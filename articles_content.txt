                        In a major development in the crypto space, blockchain investigator ZachXBT identified seven wallet addresses on May 21 containing 891.13 Bitcoin, worth approximately $61 million, linked to the infamous North Korean hacking group Lazarus.ZachXBT shared these findings on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting the ongoing threat posed by the state-backed hacker group. The revelation follows the investigator’s previous research, which led to the authorities freezing $3.8 million in digital assets.ZachXBT identifies Seven More Addresses Linked to Lazarus 
As of the latest updates, the flagged wallets still hold the amounts identified by ZachXBT. The usernames “EasyGoatfish351” and “FairJunco470” were noted explicitly for their deposits and trading volumes, which matched the stolen funds. The stolen assets were often exchanged into Tether (USDT) before being converted to fiat and withdrawn.Lazarus Group, known for its cyber heists, resurfaced earlier this year after a period of inactivity. On January 8, they moved $1.2 million in stolen digital assets from a mixer to an inactive wallet, involving two transfers totaling 27.37 Bitcoin. Subsequently, 3.343 BTC worth $150,582 was sent to a previously used address. The group also employed social engineering tactics, using LinkedIn to target vulnerable users with malware attacks. Blockchain security firm Slowmist flagged these attacks, noting that the hackers pretended to apply for blockchain developer jobs to gain access to confidential employee credentials.Over $200 Million Laundered By North Korean Hacking Group Lazarus
The discovery of seven more addresses comes after an in-depth analysis published by ZachXBT on April 29, detailing how Lazarus laundered $200 million from over 25 hacks since 2020. The investigation revealed that the group orchestrated over 25 exploits across various blockchains, using crypto-mixing services and peer-to-peer marketplaces to obscure the origins of the stolen funds. The Lazarus Group, infamous for its hacking activities since 2009, reportedly stole over $3 billion in crypto assets over the six years leading up to 2023, directly and indirectly impacting thousands of individuals. The laundered funds were primarily converted into USDT stablecoin before being exchanged for fiat currencies, often through over-the-counter traders in China. Notably, $44 million of the stolen cryptocurrency was laundered through Paxful and Noones P2P marketplaces using specific usernames. In response, Tether blacklisted over $374,000 worth of stolen funds linked to the group, and other stablecoin issuers blacklisted an additional $3.4 million.The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and DeFiLlama data indicate North Korea has been involved in $2.4 billion worth of crypto heists since 2020, with a significant portion attributed to compromised private keys.Despite the increased hacking activity by North Korean groups in 2023, they stole $700 million less than in 2022. The reduction in losses might reflect improved project security and market conditions. Experts warn that hacking activity could surge again with favorable market conditions and the continued expansion of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, however.

Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Warns Against Rushing Into ‘Very Risky’ Superintelligent AI - Decrypt

Vitalik Buterin, the mastermind behind Ethereum, called for a more cautious approach to AI research, calling the current forward frenzy "very risky." Responding to a critique of OpenAI and its leadership by Ryan Selkis—CEO of crypto intelligence firm Messari—the creator of the world's second most influential blockchain outlined his views on AI alignment—the core principles that should drive development."Superintelligent AI is very risky, and we should not rush into it, and we should push against people who try,” Buterin asserted. “No $7 trillion server farms, please.”Superintelligent AI is a theoretical form of artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence in virtually all domains. While many see artificial general intelligence (AGI) as the final realization of the emerging technology's full potential, superintelligent models would be what comes next. While today’s state-of-the-art AI systems have not yet reached these thresholds, advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and other AI-related technologies continue to progress—and people are by turns excited and worried.After Messari tweeted that "AGI is too important for us to deify another smooth-talking narcissist,” Buterin emphasized the importance of a diverse AI ecosystem to avoid a world where the immense value of AI is owned and controlled by very few people.“A strong ecosystem of open models running on consumer hardware [is] an important hedge to protect against a future where value captured by AI is hyper-concentrated and most human thought becomes read and mediated by a few central servers controlled by a few people,” he said. “Such models are also much lower in terms of doom risk than both corporate megalomania and militaries."The Ethereum creator has been closely following the AI scene, recently praising the open-source LLM Llama3 model. He also suggested that OpenAI’s GPT-4o multimodal LLM could have passed the Turing test after a study argued that human responses were indistinguishable from those generated by the AI.Buterin also addressed the categorization of AI models into "small" and "large" groups, with the focus on regulation of "large" models being a reasonable priority. However, he expressed concern that many current proposals could result in everything being classified as "large" over time.Buterin's remarks come amid heated debates surrounding AI alignment and the resignations of key figures in OpenAI's super alignment research team. Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike have left the company, with Leike accusing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman of prioritizing "shiny products'' over responsible AI development.It was separately revealed that OpenAI has stringent non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that prevent its employees from discussing the company after their departure.High-level, long-view debates about super intelligent are turning more urgent, with experts expressing concern while making widely varying recommendations.Paul Christiano, who formerly led the language model alignment team at OpenAI, has established the Alignment Research Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to aligning AI and machine learning systems with "human interests." As reported by Decrypt, Christiano suggested that there could be a "50/50 chance of catastrophe shortly after we have systems at the human level."On the other hand, Yann LeCun, Meta's chief researcher, believes that such a catastrophic scenario is highly unlikely. Back in April 2023, he stated in a tweet, that the "hard take-off" scenario is "utterly impossible." LeCun asserted that short-term AI developments significantly influence the way AI evolves, shaping its long-term trajectory.Buterin, instead, thinks of himself as a centrist. In an essay from 2023 —which he ratified today— he recognized that "it seems very hard to have a "friendly" superintelligent-AI-dominated world where humans are anything other than pets," but also argued that "often, it really is the case that version N of our civilization's technology causes a problem, and version N+1 fixes it. However, this does not happen automatically, and requires intentional human effort." In other words, if superintelligence becomse an issue, humans would probably find a way to deal with that.The departure of OpenAI's more cautious alignment researchers and the company’s shifting approach to safety policies have raised broader, mainstream concerns about the lack of attention to ethical AI development among major AI startups. Indeed, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have also reportedly disbanded their teams responsible for ensuring that AI is being safely developed.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Why Did the SEC Suddenly Change Its Mind on Ethereum ETFs? An Inside Source Reveals the Real Reason - Bitcoin Sistemi


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly on the verge of approving spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This sudden change left companies trying to understand the SEC's change of attitude in a difficult situation.
Just two weeks ago, the SEC showed no interest in the filings, according to a source familiar with the matter. However, on Monday, the SEC's trading and markets division notified exchanges that they would approve 19b-4s this week. This news coincides with reports from Barrons' SEC staff indicating a trend toward approval.


The source described the situation as “completely unprecedented” and suggested that this U-turn was “purely political”. This speculation stems from a lack of internal coordination within the SEC. While the trading and markets division is preparing to approve 19b-4s, the corporate finance division, which is responsible for S-1s, appears out of sync on this issue.

The source also speculated that the SEC's change of heart could be politically motivated, given the fast-approaching elections. Former President Donald Trump, who recently backed crypto, told a crowd of NFT buyers, “If you love cryptocurrencies in any form, you better vote for Trump.”





The source believes this could become a campaign issue, especially since Democrats desperately need the youth vote. The source suggested that President Joe Biden could score a win with the approval of spot ETH ETFs and position himself as a leader going forward.
The next step involves updating the 19b-4 forms once comments are received from the SEC. Given the tight deadlines, comments on 19b-4s are expected to be light. The source emphasized the urgency of the situation, likening the SEC's efforts to “writing a term paper the night before the deadline.”

Fed, Bank of Japan Will Drive Bitcoin to $1 Million, Says Arthur Hayes - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Federal Reserve and Bank Of Japan will be key drivers of a Bitcoin price rally to $1 million, predicts BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, when both the central banks hit “the easy button” to rescue the Asian nation’s flagging currency.Hayes argued in an essay published on Monday that the dollar-yen exchange rate is “the most important global economic variable” right now, due to its potential to influence central bankers into ballooning the global money supply.He says the story, however, begins in China, which has the most to lose from the yen’s ongoing devaluation trend.“If the CNYJPY exchange rate rises (weaker JPY vs. stronger CNY), China’s export competitiveness is hurt,” Hayes wrote. “If the yen keeps weakening, China will respond by devaluing the yuan.”Since a country’s local goods are denominated in its local currency, a fast-inflating currency is good for countries that rely on exports to keep their economy moving.Unfortunately for China, Japan is its biggest competitor in the automotive export market, and as the yen becomes increasingly cheap, Japan is difficult to compete with on prices.Hayes expects the Bank of China to pressure the United States into making Japan strengthen the yen. Even so, he writes that the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) will have trouble strengthening its currency through traditional methods like raising interest rates.“The BOJ would meltdown faster than Sam Bankman-Fried on a witness stand if they were to raise rates,” Hayes wrote, explaining that doing so would crater the value of Japanese government bonds which are 50% owned by the central bank itself.To keep bonds from collapsing, the BOJ would have to force local banks and pension funds to buy the government’s debt, Hayes said. Funding that purchase would require selling US Treasuries and US stocks, however—which would run against American interests.Hayes concludes that instead of raising rates, the BOJ must resort to “the easy button”: the unlimited US dollar “swap line” where the BOJ and Federal Reserve can swap yen for dollars at a specified rate.Since the BOJ can freely print more yen, their cost of gaining more dollars is effectively zero. Those dollars may then be used to buy up the yen, strengthening Japan’s currency while simultaneously weakening the dollar.The final scenario would be a win for all parties: China maintains a weaker currency than Japan, the BOJ stays solvent, and the dollar weakens because of the BOJ’s open-market yen purchases.It’s also good for crypto since environments with lots of money printing tend to drive up Bitcoin’s price alongside other assets, Hayes argued.“When something is done about the weak yen, I will mathematically guestimate how flows into the Bitcoin complex will ratchet the price to $1 million and possibly beyond,” the investor wrote.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

$300,000 Withdrawal at JPMorgan Chase Instantly Stolen at Bank Branch in Brooklyn: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A JPMorgan Chase customer reportedly lost $300,000 at a bank branch in Brooklyn immediately after withdrawing the cash.
The 31 year-old customer withdrew the huge sum from a teller and was robbed once he exited the bank’s front door, reports News 12.










Although the bank has not released a statement on the assault, it provided security footage from the branch showing the alleged robber, which authorities have now made public.
Source: NYPD / Crime Stoppers
Police say the suspect “forcibly removed” the cash from the customer and rode away on a scooter.
Chase has not said whether it will reimburse the victim and the customer has not made any public statements on the incident, which happened last month.
The New York Police Department is asking anyone with information on what happened to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS.
Last year, Chase made headlines over new safety measures in New York City.
Amid a surge in crime, the banking giant said a “small number” of its ATMs in NYC would be switched off by 6:00 p.m. “due to rising crime and vagrancy that occurred in these previously 24/7 vestibules.”

Galaxy Digital Exec: This Is How the SEC Could Classify ETH as Security


																Alex Thorn, the Head of Research at Galaxy Research, speculated that the SEC could differentiate between Ethereum (ETH) and staked Ether, possibly classifying the latter as a security.
He noted that this distinction could provide a regulatory loophole for approving spot Ethereum ETFs.
Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Loophole
In a May 21 post on X, he stated, “If the speculation about a 180 from SEC on the Ethereum ETFs is true, I would guess they try to thread a needle between ‘ETH’ NOT being a security and ‘staked ETH’ (or even more flimsily, ‘staking as a service ETH’) as BEING a security.”


This potential distinction could have implications for spot Ethereum ETFs, which the SEC has been reluctant to approve so far. According to Thorn, this shift would align with the SEC’s ongoing legal battles and investigations, enabling it to approve spot Ethereum ETFs while maintaining consistency with its previous arguments and positions.




However, Thorn also highlights that this approach might involve specific restrictions on spot Ethereum ETFs. He suggested that the SEC might prohibit ETFs from staking the ETH they hold.
By distinguishing between ETH and staked ETH, the SEC could allow for the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs while maintaining a strict regulatory framework around staked assets and other altcoins.
SEC Approval Optimism
Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their predicted likelihood of a spot Ether ETF approval from 25% to 75% on Monday. This change followed discussions suggesting that the SEC might adopt a more favorable stance towards these applications.


In a May 20 post on X, Balchunas hinted that the SEC’s increased pace toward approving the ETF could be influenced by political pressure, contrasting with the agency’s previous lack of engagement with ETF applicants.
The analysts later clarified that their increased odds only apply to 19b-4 approvals, with the SEC’s decision on the VanEck spot Ether ETF anticipated on May 23. “We also need S-1 approvals. It could be weeks to months before we see S-1 approvals and thus a live Eth ETF,” Seyffart explained.
He added, “That said, if we’re correct and we see these theoretical approvals later this week, it *should* mean that S-1 approvals are a matter of ‘when’ not ‘if.'”
Meanwhile, Ethereum’s value has surged by over 20% following news that the SEC might approve spot ETH ETFs, despite the market’s earlier consensus that approval was unlikely.

Trump campaign begins accepting bitcoin, ether and other crypto donations - Blockworks


Former President Donald J. Trump’s website says that the presidential candidate now supports crypto donations. 
According to his campaign website, users can donate fiat or, selecting more options, donate crypto. His campaign supports donations made via Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask, and the donations are made to joint fundraising committees organized by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNCH).
“Demonstrating President Trump’s success as a champion of American freedom and innovation, we proudly offer you a chance to contribute to the campaign with cryptocurrency,” the site said.

The site shows the logos for bitcoin, Ripple’s XRP, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Solaba, SHIB and Cardano. 
Trump promised to allow crypto donations in a speech made earlier this month, which highlighted crypto as a political issue in this year’s presidential race. 
“This addition to President Trump’s already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrency for donations,” a statement about the move said.
It added that Trump plans to “build a crypto army” ahead of the Nov. 5 election by allowing supporters to donate crypto.

The former president is not the only candidate in this presidential race to offer people the chance to donate their crypto. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign announced that it would accept bitcoin last May. 
But the opportunity for politicians to collect donations in more than just cash can be traced back to 2016, when Senator Rand Paul sought bitcoin donations during that year’s presidential election. 
Presidential candidates Andrew Yang and Eric Salwell also accepted crypto donations back in 2020.

Farcaster Raises $150M Series A from Paradigm | Bankless


Farcaster, the leading decentralized social network, has raised $150 million in a Series A round led by Paradigm, with participation from a16z crypto, USV, Variant, and more.What's the scoop?The latest funding round values Farcaster at $1 billion and comes as the network has facilitated 350K paid signups and an exponential increase in activity since going permissionless in October 2023. While the Farcaster team still has most of its funds from its May 2022 seed fundraise, the new windfall will allow them to further hone in on growing daily active users and adding new in-protocol primitives like channels and direct messaging."We’re doubling down on Farcaster to grow it to an internet-scale protocol,” Dan Romero, Farcaster cofounder, said on the news. “This funding will support our work for many years to come."Bankless take:Farcaster is king of the hill in the crypto social scene right now, so this new raise positions the team well to extend their dominance that much further. The protocol already has a significant swath of developers building atop it, so more money for building new dev-friendly features will undoubtedly lead to new waves of apps and users.Zooming out, this Series A is a big bet on the continued success of Farcaster, and if the protocol does in fact keep gaining traction from here, its rise will signal a shift toward more user-centric and decentralized internet experiences, challenging the status quo of traditional social networks.

ETH NFTs in the Banana Zone | Bankless


Last month, Real Vision cofounder and CEO Raoul Pal said crypto seemed to be on the verge of the banana zone, where majors and altcoins rally hard as new all-time highs (ATHs) are reached. That prospect of the, ahem, banana zone came further into focus this week as the ETH price surged to +$3,700 on the news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seems prepared to approve its first ETH ETFs. With ETH now within 24% of its previous record of $4,878, and having seen $75B in inflows yesterday on the ETF excitement alone, it’s no stretch to assume that an official ETF approval in the coming days could rocket ETH through its previous ATH and into price discovery mode. Why? As DCinvestor recently pointed out, a supply-side crisis seems brewing around ETH. Imagine the buy pressure of major Wall Street inflows, which could be considerable, to say the least.Then imagine that pressure against how Ethereum only issues ~2.5k ETH per day currently, and at times that issuance can be entirely offset by fee burns, and how there is a ton of ETH essentially locked away in staking and across various apps and Layer 2s (L2s) right now. via XThese factors create a perfect storm for a dramatic supply shock. As more institutional investors and retail buyers rush to gain exposure to ETH, the limited circulating supply would seemingly struggle to meet this demand. This dynamic could propel ETH into uncharted territory, driving prices far beyond previous ATHs. For those of us that stack ETH, that would be great—bring on the banana zone squared. But what else should we be looking out for?For his part, the banana king himself, Raoul Pal, thinks the next NFT bull run will rev up once ETH breaches through its previous ATH.via XPersonally, I agree, as we’ve seen this play out before. When ETH rallied hard in 2021, people also rallied hard into things you could do with your ETH, like NFTs. That said, if ETH really does take off in the weeks to come, then it’s not out of the question for the floor prices of, say, the top ETH NFT collections like CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, Pudgy Penguins, and Miladies to double or beyond by summer’s end. You would also undoubtedly see a resurgence around NFT apps like NFTfi platforms if that happened. via CoinGeckoOf course, I thought Runes would catalyze the Ordinals ecosystem, and while there are surely still synergies to come here, that catalyzing hasn’t panned out yet. And to be sure, I do think it’s always good to anticipate the unexpected. Maybe the arrival of ETH ETFs won’t be a huge catalyst for the ETH NFT scene. Yet the arrival of Runes and the arrival of ETH ETFs are very different beasts. Runes didn’t kick off the next leg up in the crypto bull market, but ETH ETFs seem primed to do just that. And the potential ETH supply-side crisis has no analogue with Runes. If the ETH price does rocket to new heights, holders will feel more risk-on, and a non-trivial number of them will bid on NFTs they’ve been eyeing over the past bear market. Plus, NFT projects of all stripes have better UX than they did just a few years ago, so the ecosystem is more fertile now. Another angle to consider is that a new bullish momentum in ETH and ETH NFTs would likely spur a new wave of innovation and experimentation within the NFT space, from crosschain experiences to games and beyond.All in all, then? We may be on the verge of the next transformative period in crypto where NFTs and their use cases surge anew. Stay vigilant, and brace yourself, because things may go bananas soon…

Ethereum's Time | Bankless


Impending Approval? Denial of spot ETH ETFs was certain to occur at the outset of the week, but from the depths of multi-year lows on the ETH/BTC ratio echoed a “we’re so back” that has radically shifted the prevailing perception. Why are markets now anticipating approval, and have we already priced in the immediate upside?Bloomberg’s ETF analysts increased their odds of spot ETH ETF approval threefold to 75% yesterday afternoon after hearing information that the SEC may have reversed its looming decision to deny the applications because crypto has increasingly become an election issue.News that the SEC had asked exchanges SEC to update their 19b-4 filings for spot ETH ETFs on “an accelerated basis” broke shortly after Bloomberg updated its approval odds; this request likely would not have been made if denial was certain.
Despite the increasing pervasiveness of expert-driven negative approval sentiment throughout 2024, the eventual listing of spot ETH ETFs had already guaranteed by the approval of commodity futures-based ETH ETFs as of last October.While these experts had extolled that a lack of meaningful communication between the SEC and proposed issuers was proof of denial, it looks increasingly probable that the same level of communication required to approve spot BTC ETFs was unnecessary to approve spot ETH ETFs. In the final months leading up to spot BTC ETF approval, issuers were consulted by the SEC about proposed creation and redemption processes, the roles of authorized participants, and matters related to custody.
Crucially, the approval of futures-based ETH ETF had occurred after Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, nullifying concerns that staking could result in Ether’s classification as a digital asset security.With the experts close to confident on approval and Polymarket’s prediction odds now at 66% – the highest level since early January – consensus is forming that ETH ETF approval is certain to occur this Thursday, leaving those who had prepared for denial caught offsides by a monstrous pump for Ether!
ETH gained nearly $600 in dollar-denominated terms yesterday, its largest single-day gain in price corresponding to a market capitalization increase nearly the size of Solana's total MC, meanwhile the ETH/BTC ratio rallied 20% on the heightened odds of spot ETF approval and regained key support at 0.05 after plunging to new multi-year lows last week.In just under a day, erratic crypto traders went from heavily underweight Ether to trampling over each other for ETH longs, and although we can now anticipate the approval of spot ETH ETF products with confidence, questions remain over whether it will be a bullish catalyst for markets.BTC price fell by 20% in the twelve days following its spot ETF debut, with hefty redemptions on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) suppressing any net flows that could be generated from alternative products until the end of January; Ethereum faces a similar situation, with over $10B in ETH set to become redeemable upon the conversion of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF.Although regulatory filings have revealed a smattering of BTC ETF holdings among institutions, the majority of shares are held by investment advisors on behalf of their retail clients who can easily access crypto through alternative routes and hedge funds that are unlikely to be assuming directional exposure to BTC price.The arrival of Ethereum's spot ETFs is theoretically bullish, but only if they result in net inflows from buyers who are not hedging against price risks (i.e.; hedge funds).Traditional market participants have demonstrated interest in purchasing Ethereum, attested to by the $100M they have put into ETH futures products, but it's unclear if initial inflows will be powerful enough to counteract Grayscale outflows.

Crypto Exchange Binance Discloses Investment in L2 DEX Protocol Aevo - The Daily Hodl


								The venture capital arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume is announcing a new investment in a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol.
According to a new press release, Binance Labs has invested in a layer-2 (L2) DEX called Aevo, a rebrand of Ribbon Finance.










Aevo bills itself as a high-performance derivatives DEX platform tailored for futures and perpetual contracts trading.
The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is built on top of the Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 protocol Optimism’s (OP) OP Stack. It acts as an off-chain order book, with orders settled on-chain on Ethereum. The protocol uses Celestia (TIA) as a high-throughput data availability (DA) layer to increase scalability. The project is also backed by Paradigm, Dragonfly and Coinbase Ventures.
According to the announcement, Aevo plans to use the investment to grow the ecosystem and its community, which already has over 50,000 monthly active users who have done more than $80 billion in derivatives volume.
“As part of the future roadmap, Aevo will launch vault strategies, yield products, and Aevo staking. It will expand its ecosystem of derivative products by allowing builders to deploy their dApps permissionlessly on Aevo L2 to leverage its growing user base and unique features.”
Binance Labs is the accelerator and venture capital arm of Binance.

Venture Capitalist Rips Into Cardano, Questions Network's Decentralization Claims


								Justin Bons, the founder of Cyber Capital, has launched a scathing attack on Cardano, claiming that the Ethereum competitor is “centralized.” Venture capitalists are convinced that this level of centralization, at the protocol level, is a “major weakness of the proof-of-chain blockchain.”
Founder: Cardano Is Centralized
According to Bons’ assessment, there is a problem with Cardano’s “genesis keys.” Technically, these keys are a multi-signature system that grants control over core protocol rules. 
In a post on X, the VC argued that these keys confer “excessive power” to Input Output Global (IOG), the company developing the smart contract platform.

The Genesis keys were introduced during the third phase of Cardano’s development: Shelley. The problem is that these “keys were not a temporary measure but released as part of the network’s design.” As earlier designed, the IOG didn’t have the absolute power of the genesis keys. 
However, the Cardano Foundation’s decision to delegate its control to the developer meant that IOG was now in control.
Cardano price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: ADAUSDT on Binance, TradingView
The alleged centralization, Bons claim, is that IOG “controls five out of the seven genesis keys.” With this, the developer can unilaterally alter the protocol without community consensus. This level of control, the founder adds, “goes against Cardano’s claims that the platform is one of the highly decentralized, even better than Ethereum.”
That IOG has this power, Bons continued, means “they can exploit these keys and even disrupt the network.” For instance, the developer can stop the blockchain from processing blocks or modify how ADA is distributed to validators. 
The Venture Capital founder claims that the centralization of Genesis keys can be seen in the deliberately slow development approach. Unlike competitors like Solana, Cardano is still being refined, with IOG planning to enhance efficiency once Voltaire goes live.

Will Voltaire Increase Decentralization Levels?
By design, public blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin, for example, are decentralized. Though the level of decentralization varies as they evolve, validators are guaranteed not to censor transactions or reverse some, even in extreme disruptive hacks. 
The censorship resistance feature gives these ledgers an edge over centralized options, explaining the rapidly increasing adoption across the board.

How IOG and the Cardano community will resolve this remains to be seen. In the next development phase, Voltaire, the network will introduce on-chain governance. With this, the use of Genesis keys will be a thing of the past.

Bits + Bips: Is US Politics Driving the ETH ETF Approval? - Unchained


                                Why ETH spot ETFs are now more likely—and the reversal may have come from the Biden administration. Will this lead to ETH reaching all-time highs, sway US elections, or spark a new wave of crypto spot ETFs?

RFK Jr. Says He Bought GameStop to ‘Punish Predator Short Selling to the Moon’ - Decrypt

As crypto policy increasingly divides political parties, U.S. Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—better known as RFK—is now touting his love for meme stocks.In a Wednesday Twitter post, the independent candidate said that he had bought $24,000 in GameStop stock as a way to “punish predatory short selling.” GameStop (NYSE:GME) is a video game retailer which first made headlines in 2021 when amateur traders started buying its stock and pumping its price. It made a comeback last week after the trader that started the 2021 buying frenzy, known as Roaring Kitty, posted online for the first time in nearly three years. “We need a free and fair market,” RFK tweeted. “Let’s punish predatory short-selling to the moon. By the way, I ride with you and I’m not leaving.”He added: “My administration will support the Ape retail rebellion and enact aggressive Wall Street reforms.”RFK was referring to the Wall Street firms that had initially shorted GameStop stock, betting that its price would go down. The 2021 trading frenzy aimed to stymie this strategy, and promote investing among ordinary citizens. Roaring Kitty—real name Keith Gill—urged people to invest. The craze eventually led to Wall Street chaos due to shares suddenly going up in value. Despite this, it has since been revealed that major Wall Street firms such as BlackRock and Vanguard held GameStop shares and may have raked in billions of dollars as a result. Such investments are now known as meme stocks—shares of companies made popular on Internet forums. Meme stocks later led to a surge in popularity in cryptocurrencies known as meme coins.Both meme coins and stocks shot up in value last week following Roaring Kitty’s return, with some investors making huge gains. Crypto has becoming an increasingly pivotal issue in politics, with Trump stepping up his courtship of cryptocurrency holders and U.S. President Joe Biden finding himself at odds with some in his own party over federal regulation of the space.RFK is not a newcomer to the space, and aligned himself with the digital asset industry in the past. He previously said he wants the U.S. dollar and Treasury Bills to be backed by Bitcoin, and vowed to put the U.S. budget on the blockchain if elected.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

                        Former U.S. Treasury official Graham Steele is receiving backlash after he took to X Monday morning to scrutinize support for the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) ahead of its likely vote on Wednesday.Steele’s X post came in response to a social media petition created by Digital Innovation For America (DIFA) supporting the bill, claiming that “the best way to fight Big Tech is with Blockchain technology.”X Users React After Graham Steele Shares Stance On DIFA FIT21 Petition
Calling the written request “pretty sneaky,” Steele noted that the highly-anticipated crypto bill does not include a prohibition on “Big Tech.”“This petition about the FIT 21 Act uses progressive framing, claiming that the bill fights against “‘Big Tech,’” Steele said. “FIT 21 actually creates a light-touch regulatory framework for crypto, largely outside securities laws.“Consisting of organizations such as Amazon, Apple, and Meta, some members of the crypto community feel that standard “Big Tech” companies’ top-down structure may at times stand in stark contrast to blockchain’s traditionally decentralized nature, seemingly prompting social media backlash to Steele’s take on DIFA’s petition.“Poor take,” one X user replied. “Educate yourself about the tech and what is happening here.”“I would argue this is fighting back against big tech,” another alleged. “Blockchain networks are better for consumers than corporate networks.”“You are making this a partisan issue and alienating millions of young, enthusiastic voters who want freedom to innovate,” a third claimed. “Decentralized crypto threatens ‘Big Tech’ – they are fighting against it! We hoped you would be different.”Martin Gruenberg’s Replacement And A House Vote On FIT21
Steele’s post came amid a turbulent 24 hours for the FDIC, with Chair Gruenberg announcing he would resign from his position in light of sexual harassment, discrimination, and general misconduct concerns.In a statement on Monday, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sam Michael claimed Biden would announce Gruenberg’s replacement “soon,” with recent reports suggesting that Steele may make the cut to take over the position.The federal corporation has previously warned about the potential risks associated with crypto-assets pertaining to banking organizations.Meanwhile, the House is gearing up for a full floor vote on FIT21, which is scheduled for Wednesday.Backed by several key industry leaders in the crypto space, a successful vote on the bill could prove critical in establishing a robust regulatory framework with increased freedom for digital asset operators across the United States.

Donald Trump now accepts Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and other cryptos for his election campaign

Photo: Michael M. Santiago (Reuters)The presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, announced late Tuesday afternoon that he would accept donations in Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies. With this move, he has become the first major party candidate to embrace digital currencies. Earlier this month, the former president declared himself as the candidate for cryptocurrency at a Mar-a-Lago gala, propelling crypto into the 2024 campaign.Why Bitcoin and Ether are skyrocketingCryptocurrency donations will be accepted through the Coinbase Commerce product. “MAGA [Make America Great Again] supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th,” per the statement.Trump’s recent stance on cryptocurrency is viewed as an attack on Democrats, who have historically been unsupportive of cryptocurrency. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in particular, campaigned against cryptocurrency. However, this year, even some Democrats are pro-cryptocurrency, distancing themselves from Warren’s stance.Crypto has emerged as a political topic in this election year, with presidential candidate Trump making several pro-crypto statements during his campaigns. However, he has not yet declared how he plans to support cryptocurrency and blockchain growth through policies. His position on cryptocurrency represents a significant U-turn. A few years ago, he denounced Bitcoin as “a scam against the U.S. dollar” and said the central bank digital currencies are “very dangerous.” In the past years, he said that crypto is “a disaster waiting to happen” and that he is “not a fan of it.” But now he says he is “good” with it.

Microsoft Recall Is Spyware And an Obvious Target, Say Security Experts - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWhen Microsoft announced its new Recall feature during its annual developer conference on Monday, the news made waves beyond the AI industry. Cybersecurity and privacy experts also took notice—and they were concerned.During the presentation, Microsoft said new Copilot-enabled computers will remember and later be able to find anything displayed on screen—including emails, websites, and applications—through AI-indexed snapshots stored on-device. Reaction to the announcement was mixed, prompting some security experts to call the feature spyware and a natural target for cybercriminals.“This is the company that wants to record literally everything you ever do on your computer,” Geometric Intelligence founder and CEO Gary Marcus wrote on Twitter. “If you don’t think Microsoft Recall, local or no, will be one of the biggest cyber targets in history, you aren’t paying attention.”“I’m so glad Microsoft is out here helping me recall why I don’t use Windows if I can help it, and when I do, I disable every ‘smart’ feature they add,” writer at Linus Tech Tips Emily Young wrote.“Back in my day, we called this spyware,” Software Engineer and crypto researcher and critic Molly White wrote.With Recall, verything that appears on screen is captured—including passwords, if the app or form doesn't automatically obscure it.Although a simple premise, the implementation of Recall requires a lot of care, cybersecurity expert Katelyn Bowden told Decrypt.“Recall appears to function like existing search engines, with an expanded scope of what it records,” Bowden said, noting that Recall only functions on PCs with specific hardware configurations. “You already have a browser history and file contents index on your PC, and this is functionally no different. And unlike many of those files, Microsoft says Recall data is encrypted.“If Microsoft were to start off-loading processing of the training set, or collecting data for use in recommendation engines or off-machine models, user privacy could be compromised,” she noted.Bowden is a member of the hacker collective known as the Cult of the Dead Cow and also serves as the chief marketing officer at the open-source privacy-focused Veilid Project. She said more transparency around how AI tools are used is essential.“I always feel more comfortable when companies who develop AI products are transparent about what datasets were used to train the software,” Bowden said. “Microsoft’s lack of transparency surrounding that concerns me. If people don’t know what data was used to train the model, they shouldn’t submit to it.”With OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft pushing hard to bring generative AI products to market, several projects and groups are also offering decentralized and open-source alternatives, including Venice AI, FLock, PolkaBot AI, and the Superintelligence Alliance.Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote earlier today that open-source AI is the best way to avoid a future where “most human thought becomes read and mediated by a few central servers controlled by a few people.”“People should assume that everything they write to OpenAI is going to them and that they have it forever,” Venice AI founder and CEO Erik Voorhees previously told Decrypt. “The only way to resolve that is by using a service where the information does not go to a central repository at all in the first place.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Dogecoin Forms Bullish Triangle Pattern, Analyst Reveals The Next Target | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin is currently seeing reasonable upside following the Bitcoin recovery above $71,000. This has sent the whole crypto market into a state of euphoria, and the DOGE price has crossed the $0.16 resistance while at it. This bullish trend is expected to continue, as one analyst points out that Dogecoin has formed a bullish triangle pattern.
Dogecoin Triangle Pattern Points To More Upside
In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Lingrid pointed out an interesting formation on the Dogecoin chart. According to the analyst, the meme coin has successfully formed a triangle pattern, which has been historically bullish for the price.

Explaining how this came to be, the crypto analyst explained that the market has been consolidating below the upper border of the triangle. Now, this triangle pattern often leads to a price squeeze, which is very bullish for its price.
Lingrid identified a range zone for Dogecoin just above $0.15, which was important to the formation of the triangle. This is because the appearance of a range zone suggests that accumulation is going on and it is time for the price to begin to move. Sometimes, this can be either bearish or bullish, but as the crypto analyst points out, with the “consolidating just below the upper border of the triangle,” this time around, it is bullish for the price.

Additionally, the meme coin has been creating higher lows, suggesting that this is a sustained bullish trend. “If the price breaks through the downward trendline, we can expect a bullish rally to follow. Furthermore, if the price breaks through the range zone and closes above it, it’s likely that the market will move higher. My target is resistance at 0.17500,” Lingrid states.
DOGE Remains Bullish
This week, the Dogecoin price has turned rather bullish as investor interest has turned toward the meme coin. One way that this is shining through is the trading volume of the digital asset which has jumped more than 130% in the last week. Currently, Coinmarketcap data shows a more than 132% increase in trading volume which has sent it to almost $2 billion at the time of writing.

At the same time, there has been a significant increase in the Dogecoin open interest, suggesting that traders are now betting big on the DOGE price. Coinglass data shows that in the last 24 hours, there is an 18% increase to reach $921.4 million. This is the highest that the open interest has been in the past month and shows a turn in the tide from the bearish trend. Historically, an increase in open interest has usually correlated with an increase in price. So, in this case, it is expected that the price rally will continue.
For now, DOGE bulls continue to dominate the market, pushing it over 8% in the last day. It is currently trading at $0.164, which is a 122% increase in the last year.

Gala Games Recovers $23M Stolen By Hacker, Plans Token Buyback Program


																In a recent security incident, Gala Games, a Web3 gaming company, fell victim to an exploit that led to the unauthorized minting of 5 billion tokens, equivalent to approximately $214 million. 
The hacker behind the breach subsequently sold 592 million GALA tokens, amounting to $21.8 million in value, as blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain confirmed.
CEO Of Gala Games Takes Responsibility For Breach
Gala Games responded to the breach, assuring the community via social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the security incident involving the GALA token had been contained and that the affected wallet had been frozen. 
The company acknowledged the isolated nature of the incident and stated that it had addressed the cause while collaborating closely with law enforcement agencies to investigate the individuals responsible for the breach.

	Related Reading



Eric Schiermeyer, CEO of Gala Games, expressed his regret over the incident, referencing his previous stance on projects experiencing hacks. 
Schiermeyer disclosed that the breach led to the unauthorized sale of 600 million GALA tokens, equivalent to $21 million, and the subsequent burning of 4.4 billion tokens. Within 45 minutes, Gala Games identified the compromise and effectively secured and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract.
Reassuring stakeholders, Schiermeyer emphasized that the Ethereum (ETH) contract for GALA remained secure and protected by a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet, with no compromise detected. 
Acknowledging internal control shortcomings, Schiermeyer also admitted responsibility for the incident and outlined the steps being taken to prevent its recurrence.
Gala Games expressed confidence in identifying the culprit behind the breach. They confirmed active collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and a network of international authorities to ensure appropriate legal actions are pursued.
The incident raised concerns regarding the project’s daily distribution, prompting Gala Games to propose a node vote to address the issue. As per their community-driven approach, the decision on how to proceed will be determined by the community itself.
DFW Labs Support
In response to the incident, DFW Labs, a Web3 investor and market maker, took action to alleviate selling pressure in the market. They purchased 28 million GALA tokens from the open market to stabilize the value of the token, which had fallen to $0.037 on Monday following the exploit. 
However, with the investment from DFW Labs, the token rebounded to its current trading price of $0.0431, representing a loss of 7.8% in the last 24 hours.

                        As the Fantom (FTM) price climbs to new monthly highs, investors are asking whether it might be too late to buy Fantom.Last at $0.8744, FTM is up 35% in the past seven days according to CoinMarketCap.A seemingly sudden shift in the SEC’s position on Ethereum ETFs has injected positive momentum into market this week.Fidelity, Vaneck, Invesco, Ark 21Shares and Franklin all filed amended 19B-4 applications on Tuesday.That comes one day after rumors emerged that the SEC might approve spot Ethereum ETFs as soon as this week.That helped launch FTM nearly as high as $1.0 on Monday, with the price having since dropped around 5%.While not in as much focus this week, macro is also more of a tailwind these days.US jobs and CPI inflation data this month helped bolster bets for Fed rate cuts this year. Tomorrow’s Fed minutes release shouldn’t threaten that narrative too much.When financial markets move to price in easier financial conditions, this tends to bolster crypto.And high-beta altcoins like Fantom are especially sensitive to changes in financial conditions.Fantom also recently kickstarted an exciting upgrade to integrate its innovative Sonic technology.The outlook in crypto markets seems tilted towards more near-term upside.So is it too late to buy Fantom?Is It Too Late to Buy Fantom?
Well, investors jumping in now will have missed the bottom of the recent price dip by a large margin.But that doesn’t mean its too late to buy Fantom.FTM remains nearly 30% below its 2024 highs. So investors can, at the very least, rest assured that they aren’t buying the market right at its recent peak.Nor is the Fantom price anywhere near its long-term peak.FTM briefly surpassed $3.70 in 2021, so it is still trading at a 75% discount versus its record highs.If FTM can break to the north of its 2021 highs this cycle, investors could still bag 5x gains.In that sense, it definitely isn’t too late to buy Fantom.If Fantom (FTM) can hit new record highs this cycle, then that means it definitely isnt too late to buy Fantom.

The outlook for Fantom is strong this bull market. The Fantom Foundation is pushing to kickstart a meme season on the blockchain.If successful, this could accelerate FTM’s appreciation, as seen with Solana.But, as noted, FTM’s gains this bull market might be limited to as much as 5x.Those gains are to be sniffed at. But some crypto traders will be targeting much greater upside.Such traders often flock to the meme coin market hunting for gems.One potential meme coin gem that analysts at Cryptonews like a lot is Wiener AI (WAI).The sausage dog-themed coin offers useful AI-powered trading tools and has already raised over $2.5 million in its presale.WAI is not only a meme coin with AI capabilities but also a potential passive income gem.20% of the supply has been allocated to staking rewards, and investors are currently earning a massive 396% APY, as per the project’s official website.At this rate, investors can double their initial presale investment in just a few months.Crypto experts have been lining up to join the Sausage army. Here’s why widely followed crypto analyst Michael Wrubel, who boasts over 312,000 YouTube subscribers, ranks WAI as a top crypto for 2024.VIDEOInterested investors need to move quickly, as the WAI price will rise when the presale hits $2.7 million.At the current price of $0.000709, WAI’s market cap is under $50 million.If it achieves market leadership, early investors stand to benefit greatly, with a potential for 100x gains or more.Buy Wiener AI Here

                        Tuesday, May 21, 2024- As Sealana’s (SEAL) presale passes the $2 million mark, the Solana-based meme coin is poised to become the next crypto to explode in value. Sealana is a playful and culturally resonant meme coin inspired by a patriotic, obese American redneck seal reminiscent of the South Park World of Warcraft character.The Sealana presale operates on a fixed price model, selling tokens at $0.022 each. Investors can purchase $SEAL using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, or with fiat currency using a bank card.Sealana’s quirky concept and its play on American culture has struck a chord with the crypto community, visibly driving interest and investment. The concept is simple yet engaging: feed Sealana SOL (Solana’s native token), fatten him up, and watch as he repays you with SEAL straight into your wallet.After achieving the $2 million-mark milestone, the FOMO for Sealana’s market debut continues to build. The latest Solana meme coin is well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum.The success of previous Solana meme coins like Slothana (SLOTH), which, like Sealana, raised $15 million in its send-to-wallet presale in just over four weeks, sets a promising precedent for Sealana.Solana has emerged as a robust platform for meme coins, thanks to its stability, efficiency and low transaction costs.Solana Network Remains Resilient, Sealana Continues the Momentum Solana is up 25.36% over the past week and the viral meme coins on its network have remained resilient. Notable examples include DogWifHat, which is up 28.12% and POPCAT, which increased 9.26% in the last 24 hours.Betting on Solana-based meme coins right now could prove beneficial. SLOTH, which is down by 19% over last week, after launching on the top 10 HTX exchange, could be worth a look too.The cryptocurrency market is expected to experience a summer meme coin frenzy, driven by bullish sentiment following April’s Bitcoin halving.Historically Bitcoin halvings have led to increased interest in the broader crypto market, including meme coins. This anticipated market shift could further boost Sealana’s prospects.Meanwhile, the market is abuzz with speculation that the team behind Sealana may have also been involved with SLERF – another meme coin that recorded an all-time high price of $1.30 in March 2024, but is currently trading at $0.3117. Traders in the SLERF market might now be looking for the next strong Solana meme coin, like Sealana.VIDEOSealana Presale: A Safe Bet For Q2 2024? Since March 12, Solana has consistently outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it an attractive option for meme coin projects. The growth is supported by technological advancements such as token extensions, which enhance the functionality and utility of SPL tokens.The broader Solana system continues to experience rapid growth, with significant increases in DEX trading volumes and project funding.Sealana represents the next wave of Solana-based meme coins, blending cultural resonance with innovative blockchain technology.Investors looking for the next big thing in crypto should keep a close eye on Sealana.Follow the latest developments on Sealana’s X account and Telegram channel.Don’t miss your chance to purchase Sealana at what could be its lowest price ever.

âItâs happeningâ: Ethereum ETF approval is imminent as issuers amend 19b-4 filings - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart shared on X that the movement to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US “is happening.” According to Seyffart, at least five of the potential Ethereum ETF issuers have submitted their Amended 19b-4s in a 25-minute timespan.“Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares, & Franklin all submitted via CBOE,” he added. The 19b-4 Form is one of the mandatory documents that need to be filed before the SEC can approve an ETF.However, even with the spot Ethereum ETFs approved in the US, Seyffart highlights that this doesn’t mean an immediate launch. Notably, it can take up to months after the approval of Ethereum ETFs before they can be officially traded.“But these filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate. Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s AND THEN we need to see S-1 approvals. Could be weeks or more before ETFs launch,” added the Bloomberg analyst in another post. Most likely a political decisionCommenting on a The Block article about the motivations behind the sudden pivot to a spot Ethereum ETF approval, Seyffart agreed with undisclosed sources that stated this is “a completely unprecedented situation, which means it’s entirely political,” and that “they’re not even internally coordinated yet, which is why this is most likely a political decision.”James’ fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas already suggested this in a Monday X post, saying that rumors around the SEC shift in stance pointed to “political issues.”Seyffart concludes his series of posts on X by admitting that he was wrong about a spot Ethereum ETF approval not happening this week, but so was the entire market. Notably, as reported by Crypto Briefing, not even notorious fund managers were expecting a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US this week. Katherine Dowling, general counsel for ETF applicant Bitwise, said that “most people are universally expecting a disapproval order.” VanEck CEO Jan van Eck also predicted a likely denial during a CNBC interview.

Standard Chartered Maintains $8,000 ETH Price Target as it Expects Green Light for Ether ETFs This Week | Cryptoglobe


                                
Standard Chartered, a British multinational banking and financial services company, has revealed it expects the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the listing of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the country this week, and maintained its $8,000 price target for ETH.



The bank’s Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research reportedly told The Block that with key deadlines for spot Ether ETF applications looming – May 23 for VanEck and May 24 for Ark 21 Shares – the bank is “80% to 90%” sure that these funds will be approved.



The potential impact is significant. Standard Chartered estimates that these spot Ether ETFs could attract significant investment, bringing in 2.39 to 9.15 million ETH within the first year, translating to roughly $15 billion to $45 billion in U.S. dollars in a figure that it sees as “proving accurate” according to estimates for inflows for the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs.



Looking beyond approval, the bank’s analysis suggests Ether’s price could keep on climbing rapidly this year and maintain a 5.4% price ratio with the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which would suggest an $8,000 price target by the end of the year if BTC maanges to hit $150,000 as it predicts.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Earlier this year the bank revealed it was expecting spot Ether ETF applications to be approved by May 23 , but given the market’s expectations of a rejection earlier this month the bank had said that delays in the approval were already “priced in.”



Standard Chartered’s prediction comes after a dramatic rise in cryptocurrency prices related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.



 Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.

Trump campaign leans in on crypto with new donation page amid shifting political landscape

Former President Donald Trump has begun accepting crypto donations for his re-election campaign, making him the first US Presidential candidate to adopt digital assets for funding.According to a May 21 statement:“This addition to President Trump’s already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrency for donations.”The website’s available information showed that crypto users could donate in different digital assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and others.Crypto has become a pivotal topic in the lead-up to the November elections, with former President Trump and President Joe Biden expected to be the primary candidates for their respective parties.The candidates have taken a diverging stance toward the emerging industry, with Trump openly supporting crypto and promising to foster its growth through proper regulation. Trump stated:“Democrats, like Biden and his official surrogate Elizabeth Warren, continue to believe only government has the answers to how our nation leads the world.”However, recent events suggest that the Biden administration may shift its long-standing hardline stance against the space.Ethereum ETFOn May 20, reports surfaced that the US SEC might approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — a stark pivot from earlier expectations.Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the SEC’s turnaround might have political motivations, a view shared by many in the crypto community.Variant Fund chief legal officer Jake Chervinsky said:“If the spot ETH ETF is approved, it will be a true shock to everyone I know in DC who’s close to this process. That doesn’t mean it won’t happen. It means approval could signal a major shift in US crypto policy.”Congressional developmentLast week, US lawmakers from both parties united to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) resolution despite President Biden’s stated intent to veto the bill.Several crypto stakeholders have argued that the bulletin was controversial, as SAB 121 required financial institutions to safeguard customer assets and keep them on their balance sheets. Notably, the American Bankers Association (ABA) pointed out that the regulation made it difficult for banks to act as spot Bitcoin ETF custodians.This rare bipartisan event precedes the upcoming Senate vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), widely considered the most significant piece of crypto-specific legislation likely to become law.The FIT21 bill will establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for the digital assets industry in the US. The bill has widespread industry support from key players, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Andreessen Horowitz.Moreover, the bill will establish a baseline for classifying digital assets as securities or commodities. It expands the CFTC’s authority to register and regulate digital commodities and requires the FTC and SEC to jointly issue rules for assets not otherwise classified.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

VanEck's Ethereum spot ETF listed on DTCC under ticker $ETHV - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            VanEck’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF has appeared on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) new securities list with the ticker $ETHV. This development comes shortly after Cboe released amended 19b-4 forms.
ETHV: VanEck’s Ethereum ETF Awaits SEC Approval, Listed on DTCCWhile the DTCC listing is a crucial step for the ETF, it does not guarantee the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval, which is still pending.VanEck’s spot Ethereum ETF application will likely be the first to get a decision from the SEC. The SEC will decide whether to deny or approve the product.Van Eck filed for a spot Ethereum ETF in September 2023. Many other industry giants like BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity also followed suit.The outlook for Ethereum-based funds was previously not promising as people involved in conversations with the SEC stated that there was an ongoing lack of engagement.However, things started to take a turn just a few days before the May 23 verdict. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate there is now a 75% chance of SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF. They cite staking removal and political issues as the key drivers.Standard Chartered is also confident in the regulatory approval potential of the spot Ethereum ETF. Additionally, the bank is bullish on Ethereum’s price, projecting that it is on track to hit $8,000 by year-end.Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has shown impressive performance following positive developments in the Ethereum ETF. Ethereum surged 8% after Bloomberg analysts raised the odds and extended its rally, breaking through its $3,500 key level. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $3,700, up 31% in the last 7 days.

Dogecoin Bulls On The Rise: Analyst Highlight Path To $0.2


																Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency, is currently demonstrating signals that suggest it might be on the cusp of a significant bullish breakout.
According to a recent analysis from prominent crypto analyst Ali, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency appears to be approaching a crucial resistance level, with market behaviors hinting at potential upward movement.

Eyes Set On Breaking The $0.2 Resistance Level
Ali, a well-known market analyst, pointed out that Dogecoin is testing the possibility of reaching its highest price level in over a month at $0.2. His analysis is based on DOGE’s recent escape from a descending triangle pattern, which typically suggests a shift in market dynamics favoring buyers.
Following a pattern similar to the previous cycle, where DOGE experienced a retracement after breaking out from a descending pattern before rallying, the asset has recently completed a significant 47% retracement.
This movement has led Ali to highlight the market’s tendency to echo past patterns, though not perfectly. With the breakout from the descending pattern and subsequent retracement now complete, DOGE is positioning itself for another push toward the $0.2 resistance level.

This level has proven challenging, with selling pressure frequently intensifying around this range. However, the broader market sentiment remains bullish, which could support Dogecoin’s push toward this key price point.
Notably, to reach $0.2, DOGE would need to increase further by nearly 20% from its current position. Currently, the memecoin is trading at $0.168, reflecting a 10% increase over the past 24 hours and continuing a week-long uptrend that has seen nearly a 15% increase.

Surging Interest In Dogecoin And Strong Upside Signal
The positive movement in DOGE’s price performance is further underscored by a surge in DOGE’s open interest, which has risen by 23% in the past day to reach $1 billion, according to data from Coinglass.

Additionally, the open interest volume has soared by 200%, now at nearly $4 billion. An increase in open interest indicates that new market participants are entering or existing positions are being expanded. This can be a sign of strengthening market activity and a supportive factor for the ongoing price increase.
Echoing Ali’s sentiment, another analyst from Crypto Daily Trade Signals identified a symmetrical triangle pattern in DOGE’s price movements, reinforcing the potential for continued upward momentum.

According to this analysis, Dogecoin is showing signs of bullish behavior, with immediate resistance near $0.15950. However, since DOGE already surpassed that, the analyst noted other resistance levels at $0.16980 and $0.18440.

‘All Bets Are Off’ - Top Analyst Unveils Crypto Market Forecast Amid Increased Odds of Ethereum ETF Approval - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist says that a certain altcoin group will massively benefit from the approval of a spot market Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 554,400 followers on the social media platform X that while an Ethereum ETF might be a bit bearish for Bitcoin (BTC) inflows, it will be bullish for Ethereum and an altcoin cohort that has yet to see big rallies.










“Think ETH ETF would take quite a bit of bid away from BTC. Think ETH ETF would lead to ETH going up which would lead to more stupidity in the market. Think it’s good news ETH alts only basically, but that’s worth a lot given they’ve been depressed for so long they’re dirt cheap.”
Yesterday, the crypto market took off amid reports that an Ethereum ETF now has a 75% chance of getting the green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
According to DonAlt, an Ethereum ETF will give the crypto markets a massive shot in the arm.
“Anyway if we get an ETH ETF all bets are off. Retardation can go to new ATH (all-time high) levels and we’ll all be friends again. Shit would be wild in my opinion and would change my mind on a lot of things short term.” 
The analyst names one altcoin that will likely witness a breakout rally if an Ethereum ETF gets approved.
“[Pepe is] the main ETH memecoin. I’d rather not fade it if we truly get an ETH ETF. Still technically below resistance but I don’t like the chances that holds.”

At time of writing, Pepe (PEPE) is trading at $0.0000111, well above DonAlt’s resistance level.

US DOJ Seizes $100M In Crypto From Major Dark Web Drug Trafficking Operation | Bitcoinist.com


								In a recent crackdown on illicit transactions involving crypto assets, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested Rui-Siang Lin, a 23-year-old individual from Taiwan. Lin, who also goes by the names Pharoah and Faro, is accused of owning and operating a dark web drug marketplace known as the “Incognito Market.” 
The platform allegedly facilitated anonymous crypto-based transactions of illegal narcotics with a total value of more than $100 million worldwide.
$100 Million Crypto Operation Exposed
According to the complaint and indictment, Incognito Market emerged in October 2020 as an online narcotics bazaar operating on the dark web. Until its closure in March, the marketplace facilitated the sale of over $100 million worth of crypto in narcotics, including substantial quantities of cocaine and methamphetamines. 

Accessible to global users with internet connectivity, Incognito Market could be reached via the Tor web browser on the darknet. Lin, operating under the online pseudonyms “Pharoah” or “Faro,” acted as the market leader and oversaw all its operations, including employees, vendors, and customers. 
US Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York highlighted that Lin’s alleged operation exploited the community for personal profit, emphasizing that criminal actors would be pursued regardless of whether they operated on street corners or the “dark corners of the internet.” 
Dark Web Drug Lord Arrested
According to the DOJ, Incognito Market was designed to facilitate seamless narcotics transactions worldwide by incorporating features commonly seen on legitimate e-commerce sites, such as branding, advertising, and customer service. 
Users reportedly gained access to the marketplace by logging in with unique usernames and passwords, allowing them to search thousands of listings for the drugs of their choice. 
It is further alleged that the platform sold illegal narcotics and misbranded prescription drugs, including heroin, cocaine, LSD, MDMA, oxycodone, methamphetamines, ketamine, and alprazolam. 
To become a vendor on Incognito Market, individuals had to register with the site and pay an admission fee. In exchange for listing and selling narcotics, vendors paid 5% of the purchase price to Incognito Market. Lin accumulated millions of dollars in profits from the operation. 
Interestingly, the marketplace had a “bank” that allowed users to deposit crypto assets into their “digital bank accounts.” After a transaction, the cryptocurrency was transferred from the buyer’s account to the seller’s account, with Incognito Market taking a 5% fee. 

Lin was arrested on May 18 at John F. Kennedy Airport, and he is set to appear before US Magistrate Judge Willis in Manhattan federal court. 
If found guilty, Lin faces severe penalties, including a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for narcotics conspiracy, a maximum sentence of 20 years for money laundering, and a maximum sentence of 20 years for conspiracy to distribute narcotics.

XRP starts to rise amidst Ethereum ETF hopes: What's next? - AMBCrypto



XRP holders rejoiced as prices advanced toward a key resistance zone.
The on-chain metrics showed accumulation but also warned of potential selling pressure.

Ripple [XRP] saw a moderate price jump on the 20th of May. It gained 6.13% in a 24-hour window and during the same time, Bitcoin [BTC] climbed by 6.9% but saw a minor dip from $71.3k to $70.9.
Despite the gains, XRP continued to trade within a long-term range and faced a strong supply zone at $0.57-$0.585.
The Ethereum [ETH] ETF approval chances were upgraded to 75% from 25% by Eric Balchunas and saw the token’s prices rocket upward by 20% within a few hours.
The ETF analyst added that it took everyone by surprise.
This could lead to spot ETFs being filed for other cryptos. As one of the largest tokens in the market, XRP could be among the next cryptos that ETF issuers submit applications for.
Yet, the ongoing SEC-XRP case remains a hurdle for issuers.
Crypto markets are jumpy and investors need to watch out
In November 2023, XRP surged to $0.7503 because of fake reports that BlackRock had filed for a spot XRP ETF. A month before this event, false news of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval saw BTC prices surge by 10%.
In both cases, the strong gains were quickly reversed. Therefore, while XRP might see vast price pumps due to such reports or speculation, it will do little to embolden investor confidence.
Hence, AMBCrypto analyzed social and network metrics to understand if the token might see a genuine rally in the coming months.

The daily Weighted Sentiment has been positive for a good chunk of the past month. During this time, XRP made higher lows, but still struggled to form a long-term uptrend.
The Social Volume remained consistent over the past month but has reduced noticeably from March.
The Open Interest also rose higher to show speculators were gaining confidence in going long. Yet, the recovery has been slow compared to the fall in April.

The MVRV ratio showed that investors have been at a loss since the mid-March correction. It fell to -19% on the 14th of April and was at -3.83% at press time.

Meanwhile, the mean coin age continued to trend higher to signal network-wide accumulation. Together, they signaled a buying opportunity.
Worryingly, the dormant circulation spiked during the recent rally. This suggested increased token movement, likely for selling. This might hinder the bulls’ attempts at a recovery and drag prices lower.

                        As hype builds that spot Ethereum ETF approvals in the USA might be imminent and Ether pushes to fresh two-month highs above $3,800, traders are hunting for the best crypto to buy now that might hand them the quickest gains in the current market environment.Multiple potential Ethereum ETF issuers submitted amended 19b-4 applications on Tuesday.And some tickers are already being listed on the DTCC.Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading a little lower in the past 24 hours around $70,200. Solana (SOL), meanwhile, dipped 4% back under $180.Attention will shift momentarily to the macro backdrop when the Fed releases the minutes of its April meeting on Wednesday.But Ethereum ETF newsflow will likely continue to dominate the headlines this week. That potentially leaves the market with significant near-term upside risks.Imagine Ethereum ETFs get approved and launched, and then demand is stronger than expected. That’s what happened with Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.Ethereum could be about to launch back above $4,000. Even though its up 35% up versus recent lows, ETH could still be the best crypto to buy now.That being said, some traders are hunting higher beta plays.Here are some strong-performing altcoins that might offer even greater upside potential than Ethereum.Best Crypto to Buy NowPepe (PEPE)Pepe (PEPE) has jumped more than 50% in the past two days to fresh record highs above $0.000014.Last at $0.00001375, its market cap is just under $5.8 billion as per CoinMarketCap.But Pepe could yet go higher. Traders appear to be piling into the token to express bets on Ethereum ecosystem growth.And Pepe still has a long way to go to catch up to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.It could still 5x from current levels this bull market. That makes Pepe potentially the best crypto to buy now.Arbitrum (ARB)A major underperformer since March, layer-2 Ethereum scaling blockchain Arbitrum’s ARB token is attempting to pick up.ARB recently surged back above $1.20 for the first time in a month. It’s also now back above its 21 and 50DMAs.ARB could thus be one of the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewQuick 2x gains could be instore for ARB, as traders bet on Ethereum ecosystem growth, which would directly benefit Arbitrum.Arbitrum is a leading Ethereum layer-2 protocol, but currently only has a market cap of around $3.2 billion.That leaves plenty of room for growth this bull market. ARB could thus be one of the best crypto to buy now.Uniswap (UNI)The native token of multi-chain DEX Uniswap (UNI) is another outperforming crypto since the SEC’s u-turn on Ethereum ETFs.Uniswap was recently hit by a Wells Notice from the agency. Its outperformance could be related to hopes the SEC takes a softer-than-initially-feared stance against them after the Ethereum u-turn.Either way, UNI is picking up fast and hard. The token was last at $9.65, up 25% in two days.A break above resistance either side of the $10 level could open the door to a further push higher.Indeed, UNI could soon retest yearly highs around $17, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now.Crypto Alternative to Consider – Sealana (SEAL)
If Ethereum ETFs are coming, that could be a risk on trigger to start a new meme coin season.While Ethereum is currently in focus, Solana has been the go-to trading venue for meme coins this year.Established Solana meme coins like dogwifhat are a good bet. But their already bloated market caps reduce upside potential.For 50-100x gains, traders need to find newer meme coins.One new Solana meme coin that analysts at Cryptonews think has lots of potential is Sealana (SEAL).SEAL features an overweight, South Park-themed, Solana meme coin trading degen seal called Sealana.The seal mascot has already attracted over $2.2 million in funds from eager investors.Sealana’s marketing and presale success is reminiscent of the recently launched Solana meme coin Slothana (SLOTH).Slothana raised over $15 million in a blockbuster presale.However, following launch, its token subsequently pumped to a market cap of over $100 million, as per DEXTools.Rumors suggest the Slothana and Sealana teams are in some way related. Traders will thus be hoping SEAL matches SLOTH’s success.Investors can buy their SEAL by connecting their web3 wallet on Sealana’s official website with SOL, ETH, USDT, or USDC. Sealana is also available for purchase via card.Buy Sealana Here

Russian Experts Say Bitcoin Bull Market Will Fall Short of 2017 Highs

                        The current Bitcoin bull market is falling short of the highs of 2017, Russian experts claimed on May 20.The comments came in a Bitcoin- and crypto-themed report from the Roscongress Foundation, one of Russia’s biggest development-focused NGOs and conference organizers.‘Bitcoin Bull Market Fever Will Falter’ – Experts Weigh in
The report’s authors claimed that BTC’s new all-time-high peak in March this year was part of a “speculative game” played “against the backdrop of spot Bitcoin ETFs approvals.”However, March’s sudden growth in Bitcoin prices has since “failed to cause a stir similar to the situation at the end of 2017,” they wrote.The authors pointed to internet search engine queries “related to cryptocurrencies,” which have “remained well below peak values.”The authors added that only half as many people worldwide were searching for BTC and crypto-related themes in 2024 as was the case in 2017.Better Bitcoin Access Thanks to ETF Approval, Say Experts
Experts also noted that analysts had claimed spot Bitcoin ETFs would “make cryptocurrency investments more accessible to a wider range of people.”All-time Bitcoin prices. (Source: CoinMarketCap)But the evidence appears to suggest this has not yet happened, the foundation claimed.The authors explained that the “mining-based transaction protocols of the Bitcoin network” are an “obstacle” to “full inclusion” in the traditional financial system. The authors wrote:“Generally, cryptoassets are still a poor fit for full integration in the traditional financial system. The main thing holding back traders is the fact that cryptoassets are not suitable for offsetting.”A Roscongress Foundation summit. Source: (RC Dreamteam/YouTube)In the financial world, offsetting (aka “netting”) refers to “the net presentation of separate assets and liabilities or income and expenses in the financial statements.”The foundation added that market data shows that most investors still see Bitcoin as a “high-risk asset” in the same vein as “tech stocks.”Additionally, the authors claimed that BTC is “much more strongly correlated with stock market movements” than with assets like gold. As such, it fits the profile of a “classic high-risk speculative asset.”The authors also spoke of a “weak reaction” in the Bitcoin market to the April halving event,” and added:“The behavior of an asset is increasingly determined by the general level of willingness of financial market participants to take on risks.”However, the report was not entirely downbeat about BTC or the effect of spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the United States. The authors wrote that in the long run:“The emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs will undoubtedly make investing in cryptocurrency more accessible to all market participants.”But they said temporary price rises were the result of “speculative play” from traders trying to capitalize on the ETF approvals in Washington.They added that the “range of Bitcoin price forecasts for the end of the year” was “extremely wide.” The authors explained:“At the top end, the average maximum forecast is $121,764, while the average floor is $50,138.”Stablecoins Influencing Bitcoin Prices?
The authors also noted that there had been a “growth of the capitalization of stablecoins” since 2017.Distribution of stablecoins against Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other leading cryptoassets, based on market capitalization, on December 5, 2023. (Source: Statista, CoinGecko)And, they said, this has helped spur a Bitcoin bull market in both 2021 and 2024. The authors wrote:“The first wave of [Bitcoin price] growth in 2017 was caused by the popularization of cryptocurrencies. The second, in 2021, can be explained by a sharp increase in the supply of stablecoins and the transfer of pricing to virtual spaces.”The experts concluded that the 2024 all-time-high peak was “due” in part to “a restoration of the supply of stablecoins.”Earlier this month, Russian experts claimed that BTC and altcoin mining were set to grow by 20-40% before the end of the year.

Bull Run Not Over Yet: Bitcoin Price Could Move to New All-Time High on New Short Squeeze, Willy Woo Says | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin has recently surged to surpass the $71,000 mark, while the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum moved up over 20% in a single day, with an analyst now suggesting an upcoming short squeeze could lead to new highs.



According to popular cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo, the price of BTC surged over 6.5% in a single day and ETH moved up to the $3,800 in a massive daily move over a short squeeze that liquidated one month of short positions on BTC.



That short squeeze, he suggested, could be followed by another one that would see the price of the flagship cryptocurrency moves to a new all-time high. Bitcoin, it’s worth noting, is currently very close to its all-time high, which was slightly above the $73,500 mark.







Data shows a dramatic decrease in short BTC positions within the last 24 hours, plummeting from 291 BTC to just 165, indicating that nearly half of these bearish bets were liquidated as Bitcoin’s price climbed rapidly. This triggered a cascade of buy orders from those scrambling to cover their short positions.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.



Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.



The SEC’s ongoing investigation into Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has intensified over the last few months, especially after the network’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake protocol.



Should Ether be classified as a security, it could provide the SEC with a basis to deny the applications for spot Ether ETFs.

Perennial Bitcoin HODLers Bought Big Ahead Of Rally: Data


								On-chain data shows that Bitcoin addresses with zero sales histories participated in a big accumulation before this recovery run started.
Bitcoin Inflows To Accumulation Addresses Sharply Spiked Recently
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the accumulation addresses on the Bitcoin network have shown some significant inflow activity recently.
The “accumulation addresses” here refer to the Bitcoin wallets that have never made outgoing transactions on the blockchain. In other words, the accumulation addresses are basically the HODLers of the network.
Not every address with zero history of selling is included in this cohort, though, as there are some other requirements. The address must have at least two incoming transactions, the last of which must have occurred within the past seven years.

These exist because a wallet with only one transfer wouldn’t set a pattern one way or the other, and addresses that have been inactive for more than seven years are more likely to have reached old age by being lost rather than through HODLing.
Only the addresses holding greater than 10 BTC are counted under the accumulation addresses. Naturally, exchange—and miner-related wallets are excluded from this cohort, as they represent the perennial sell side of the market, which is on the opposite end of the spectrum from these HODLers.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin inflows going into the combined balance of this group over the past year or so:

The value of the indicator appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant
As displayed in the above graph, these accumulation addresses saw extremely large inflows on the 15th of this month. More particularly, these HODLers received 17,800 BTC to their balance with this spike.
At the time of these inflows, the cryptocurrency price was around $61,600, so the purchases would have cost these investors almost $1.1 billion.
Interestingly, the asset’s price started on a recovery run soon after this buying spree, culminating in the asset surpassing the $71,000 mark earlier in the past day.
The accumulation from these HODLers might have naturally been a factor behind the rally, but it most likely wasn’t the sole reason. Rather, it would appear that these are potentially smart-money investors who anticipated the rally, so they bought in at the lows.

The chart shows that the indicator registered two extreme spikes earlier in the year as well. Following both of these, the cryptocurrency witnessed some bullish price action.
The accumulation has certainly paid off for these Bitcoin HODLers this time, as the stack that they bought is now worth more than $1.24 billion.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,600, up 13% over the past week.

Altcoins ‘Maniac Phase’ Preparing, Analysts Call For Next Leg Up


																The crypto industry has seen a positive shift with the recent market recovery. After a Q1 full of bullish sentiment, Q2 saw many sectors of the crypto space brewing a pessimistic feeling toward altcoins.

	Related Reading



Experts and market watchers have reassured investors that the price corrections were part of the cycle, predicting that the bullish rally would resume after the cool-off. Now, analysts consider that altcoins are about to embark on a “massive leg higher” for the alt season.
Ethereum’s Surge Refuels Sentiment
The crypto market is up by 8.3%, with a market capitalization of $2.55 trillion. This market surge has seen Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, soar past $70,000 in the last day.
Similarly, the “king of altcoins” remarkably performed these past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH)’s price has risen 22% since yesterday, surpassing levels not seen since mid-March.
However, ETH is yet to test its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, set nearly two years ago. As a result, the second-largest cryptocurrency has been criticized this cycle for being “a major disappointment.”
In a turn of events, rumors of an approval of ETH spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have refueled investors’ bullish tank, “erasing 65 days of down only” with a single daily candle.
As ETH rallies, analysts believe it’s only a matter of time before the whole altcoins sector surges to kick off the altcoin season. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted the ‘Crypto Money Flow Cycle’, stating that, now that BTC and ETH have rallied, “it’s time for Altcoins to rally.”
Is The Altcoins Season Here?
During the slowdowns, market watchers have analyzed altcoins’ run this cycle. Altcoin Sherpa has stated that many tokens didn’t “run that hard” during round 1 of the bull run, resulting in his forecast of a 1-4 months “cool-off” period before resuming the uptrend.
Despite the similarities with previous bull runs, the singularities of this cycle, like the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Memecoin pre-sale frenzy, have made investors question whether they would see the alt season this time.
Nonetheless, several analysts, who urged investors not to panic before, suggest the community prepares for the “maniac phase” ahead. Crypto Yoddha shared his chart for the 2024 altcoin cycle, stating that the dip was “just a higher low in an uptrend.”

Per the chart, the altcoins market is now looking to retest the $1.27 trillion resistance level seen in March before testing last cycle’s $1.7 trillion ATH. To crypto Yoddha, “we’re looking at the bullish continuation” that will lead to a new market ATH during round 2.
Similarly, Top analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who recently sold all his BTC for Altcoins, stated that the Altcoin market capitalization has finished its correction:
The next step: reaching all-time high, which is ~60-70% from here.
I think #Ethereum is likely reaching that in the next 2-4 months.

Lastly, Crypto Jelle considers that “Altcoins are about to embark on a massive leg higher” after an 18-month accumulation period. The analyst compared the market’s recent breakout to a ball being held underwater, claiming that “it’s time for history to repeat.”

UNI’s price surged after the protocol disclosed a plan to introduce the ERC-7683 standard.
Open Interest hit a monthly high, activity spiked, while the token could rise to $12.

Uniswap [UNI] broke out, rose by 18.98% and hit $9.30 in an unexpected move within the last 24 hours.
For many participants, the surge could be linked to the news that the odds for the U.S. SEC to approve Ethereum [ETH] spot ETFs had increased. Because of this, ETH’s price jumped.
While that played a part, that was not the only reason. According to AMBCrypto’s investigation, a major development and other happenings on-chain were vital to UNI’s breakout.
The Labs come with a new standard
On the 20th of May, Uniswap Labs disclosed that it was introducing a new token standard called the ERC-7683. For context, ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment.
It is a standard for creating and issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
According to Uniswap Labs, the standard, if deployed, would solve fragmentation on the network and improve cross-chain interaction. The proposal read,
“By implementing a standard, cross-chain intents systems can interoperate and share infrastructure such as order dissemination services and filler networks.”
Moments after the announcement, UNI’s Open Interest (OI) increased. At press time, the OI was $64.90 million. This was a value that the metric has not reached for over a month.
Source: Santiment
Increasing OI indicates that more money is coming into the market. On the other hand, a decreasing OI is a sign of decreasing net positions with liquidity moving out.
Activity rises, sets UNI for another price boost
When put side by side with the price, the OI was a sign that buyers in the market were aggressive. If the value continues to rise, UNI’s price might do the same.
Furthermore, the prediction that the token could rally higher than its March high could come to pass. However, there were other changes on the network that propelled the hike apart from the OI.
One of them was the 24-hour active addresses. Whenever active addresses increase, it means that a large number of users are interacting with the blockchain.
If the metric falls, it means that the number of unique addresses visiting the network is decreasing. For UNI, on-chain data from Santiment showed that active addresses rose to a weekly high of 1926
This sudden surge indicates rising confidence among holders. Most times, this leads to increased buying activity and was surely one of the reasons UNI’s price moved northward.

Realistic or not, here’s UNI’s market cap in ETH terms

In addition, AMBCrypto got confirmation of the increased interest from the volume. At press time, UNI’s volume was $346.65 million.
Should this figure increase while the token’s price rises, then UNI could hit a higher value. Considering the momentum, the price of the cryptocurrency might hit between $12 and $15 within a short period.

                        Fraudsters are targetting South Korean crypto users with an Ethereum-themed scam, token holders in the country said on May 21.According to the South Korean media outlet Asia Time, scammers are sending alarming text messages to smartphone users, warning them that their ETH coins will be “burned” on May 22 if they do not act fast.
Ethereum-themed Crypto Scam ‘Originating from Bogus Exchanges’
The scam comes as police and regulators report that “cybercrime relating to virtual assets” is “on the rise.”Crypto community members took to online meeting places to warn fellow token holders that a “phishing text message” was circulating. One post warned:
“You could easily fall for it, so be careful.”Some warned that scammers use technology that allows their messages to bypass spam filters.Some of the text messages claim to originate from a “global cryptocurrency exchange” named Bit-Finance.The messages warn that “due to” token holders’ “long-term inactivity,” their Ethereum holdings “will be burned on May 22.”Ethereum vs the USD over the past five days. (Source: TradingView)The message informs crypto holders that they should “make withdrawals as soon as possible” to avoid losing their funds.Recipients are prompted to click on a link that will help them understand the process and safeguard their funds.
Community Members Post Warnings
One community member posted a screenshot showing that the senders claimed a total of ETH 54.5 of their funds would be burned if they did not act.The link enclosed appears to navigate smartphone users to a phishing site, where scammers attempt to prompt people to enter wallet details and passwords.The media outlet noted that “cyber ​​fraud using real virtual assets is increasing” in South Korea.Last year, the National Police Agency said that it had dealt with 167,688 cyber fraud cases over the course of the year. That represents a 7.68% increase on 2022 figures.“Crimes using virtual assets” accounted for 38.3% of the 2023 total, the police agency explained.Citizens have also filed a total of 2,209 reports to the regulatory Financial Supervisory Service from January to April this year.In each case, victims claimed they had suffered financial losses because of crypto scammers.The regulator said that 17.7% of these cases are related to phishing attacks. It has previously claimed that crypto-themed phishing is “rampant” in South Korea.
Police Vow to ‘Fight Back’
Police experts said the rise in attacks was an “opportunistic” move from scammers, with crypto markets buoyant.In recent months, South Korean markets were spurred when many exchanges began offering commission-free crypto trading.This, experts agreed, has also led to a rise in transaction volumes – and a subsequent rise in phishing attacks.An official from the Cyber ​​Investigation Unit at the National Police Agency said that crypto criminals were increasingly making use of so-called “daepo phones.”This term refers to cell phone numbers created using stolen name and social security number credentials. The official said:
“Recently, fraud has become more sophisticated. There has been an increase in virtual asset-related crimes using daepo phones, and chat apps like KakaoTalk and Telegram. However, we are fighting back. We are using investigation methods that track the flow of transactions.”Last month, South Korean media outlets reported that phishing attackers are now carefully targeting credit card users and the victims of crypto scams.Typically, these attackers try to drive their victims onto fake crypto exchanges and wallet platforms.

Dogecoin: Is a major rally coming? Key levels that say yes - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin’s current trading momentum and a symmetrical triangle pattern indicate a possible breakout above key resistance levels.
Increased Open Interest and volume suggest strong market activity, with potential for Dogecoin to hit the $0.3 mark.

Dogecoin [DOGE] has been experiencing a notable increase in market value, trading at $0.1641, marking an 8.6% rise over the past 24 hours, and extending its weekly gain to nearly 10% at press time. 
This uptrend aligned with the broader bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, drawing increased attention and investment into the meme coin. 
The surge in Dogecoin’s price is not only a reflection of current market dynamics, but also a sign of growing investor confidence in the asset’s potential for further gains.
Amid this positive market trend, analysts have spotted significant technical patterns in Dogecoin’s price movements. 
Particularly, Crypto Daily Trade Signals, a well-known crypto analyst, has spotted a symmetrical triangle pattern on the Dogecoin chart. 
 
Source: Crypto Daily Trade Signals/X
This pattern is often seen as a consolidation phase that precedes a breakout or breakdown in price, indicating that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of continuing its upward trajectory.
Dogecoin: Technical analysis and future projections
The symmetrical triangle pattern identified by analysts suggested that Dogecoin faced a major resistance level at $0.1545, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) provides strong support at $0.1513. 
At press time, Dogecoin’s market price was above this 50-day EMA, suggesting a bullish trend. 
However, for this upward trend to be confirmed, Dogecoin needs to break past the resistance at $0.1595, as pointed out by Crypto Daily Trade Signals.
Further supporting this bullish outlook, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the 50 mark, indicating a buying trend in the market. 
Dogecoin’s immediate resistance levels are at $0.1595, followed by $0.1698 and $0.1844. If Dogecoin can successfully overcome these levels, it could pave the way for more significant price increases. 
On the other hand, if the price falls below the pivot point around $0.15100, caution is advised, though the current RSI suggests there is room for profit.
Open interest in Dogecoin has also seen a significant increase, up by 16.64% in the past 24 hours, with a current value of $946.56 million.
Rising interest
This rise in Open Interest, accompanied by a nearly 100% increase in volume to $2.76 billion in the past day, underscored the growing market activity and investor interest in Dogecoin.
Source: Coinglass
Despite the bullish metrics, not all market participants are benefiting from the current trend. Dogecoin’s total liquidations sit at over $400,000, with long traders experiencing the majority of these losses. 
This points to a market that, while trending upwards, still presents risks, especially for those on the wrong side of price movements.

Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s price chart indicates a potential breakout from the previous lower low around $0.168.

If Dogecoin can breach this level, a minor retracement might follow, potentially setting the stage for a strong upward movement.

AMBCrypto’s recent analysis supported this view, suggesting that a breakout above the $0.166–$0.17 range could clear the path for Dogecoin to approach the $0.3 mark.

Diamond Hands? Trader Turns $1,360 into $2.3 Million with Little-Known Solana-Based Token | Cryptoglobe


                                
A ‘diamond trader’ has managed to, over the course of five months, turn around $1,360 into over $2.3 million to secure a gain of over 170,000% after spending 12 Solana (SOL) tokens to buy a meme-inspired cryptocurrency late last year.



According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the trader bought 5.21 million $PONKE tokens on December 24, 2024 and has since held onto them as the price of the cryptocurrency rose, with their holdings now being worth $2.32 million.







The price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has recently surged amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally that saw the space add over $200 billion to its market capitalization.



The catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.



The SEC’s ongoing investigation into Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has intensified over the last few months, especially after the network’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake protocol.



Should Ether be classified as a security, it could provide the SEC with a basis to deny the applications for spot Ether ETFs.

Miss the Notcoin pump? Better focus on L1 tokens!



                    

The market has been quite chaotic over the last couple of weeks. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 23% but has been gaining positions during the last week. As always, Bitcoin is the driver of the crypto space; once it moves, we can expect the rest of the coins to start gaining momentum.







The exceptions, as always, are new projects. The launch of Notcoin, a tokenized equivalent of game points that people were collecting on a Telegram game, was eagerly awaited by more than 5 million people. However, as we can see in the graphic, it followed a typical pattern for new projects: a huge spike followed by a sell-off. This is when market makers primarily generate revenue. After this initial phase, we typically see a steady decline in price as market makers consolidate their positions before the next possible move. We can expect the price to drop to around 0.0035. It’s likely we will see frequent pumps and dumps with this asset.








For those looking for a more stable but steadily growing portfolio, I would suggest focusing on Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) tokens, as their potential to rise is quite significant over the next couple of weeks, assuming Bitcoin continues its climb towards all-time highs.



Now, let’s review some potential tokens that are consolidating at the bottom and have not yet started their upward movement. Here are a few interesting options: Arbitrum, Aptos, Sui, and Vara. We can see that the tokens of all these projects have reached support levels and are now rebounding. But which one of them has the most potential?



Please note, this is not investment advice. I am merely analyzing the information the graphics provide.




Arbitrum



ARB dropped 60.66% from the local high when this correction started. We can see it had a false breakout with two candles, but there was no impulse, and it is once more consolidating near the level of 0.8981. If there is no rebound in the next two days, it is highly likely we will see ARB’s price drop to 0.7705.







Aptos



APT dropped 62% during this correction. It is highly likely that we will still see it go down to 7.3, with a significant possibility of a false breakout. Thus, in the next couple of days, a downtrend is highly probable, with consolidation around the level of 7.34, including a false breakout towards the level of 6.78.








Sui



SUI experienced a drop close to 60%, similar to its peers, but managed to stop at 59.37%. It had a nice rebound at the level of 0.8856 and is showing good bullish signals. This token is definitely worth watching.







Vara network



VARA proved to be one of the strongest tokens among its peers, dropping just 51.26%. It is consolidating around 0.07753, and as we can see, we can expect a rebound towards the level of 0.099 over the next couple of days. Vara has shown strong impulse movements and a steadier downtrend. So, while this is not investment advice, this token should definitely be on our watch list.







In conclusion, I would closely monitor VARA, as it has significant potential and appears to be underestimated by the market for now. SUI also looks promising with its rising possibilities.

Trump’s 2024 Campaign Now Welcomes Crypto Donations


On May 21, former US President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign launched a fundraising page allowing federally permissible donors to contribute using cryptocurrency via Coinbase Commerce.
Trump’s embrace of crypto signals a sharp contrast with the current administration’s stance on digital assets.
Trump’s Campaign Accepts Up to 8 Cryptocurrencies

According to the campaign’s announcement, supporters can visit the designated website to make donations to the Trump campaign with crypto. All contribution limits and disclosure requirements for crypto donations will adhere to Federal Election Commission regulations.
In the announcement, Trump’s campaign emphasized that he aims “to reduce government control over Americans’ financial decision-making. He also sees accepting crypto donations reflects his “commitment to an agenda that values individual freedom over increased socialistic government control.”

“Biden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‘anti-crypto army’ to restrict Americans’ right to make their own financial choices. MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army, moving the campaign to victory on November 5!” The announcement reads.


The statement citing MAGA is particularly interesting, given that MAGA is a Trump-themed meme coin. It seems that Trump wants to symbolize the campaign’s embrace of crypto through this asset.
The campaign accepts several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), USDC, XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), 0x (ZRX), and Shiba Inu (SHIBA). Supporters can donate in custom amounts or select from predefined options such as $20.24, $2,024, $45, $47, and $4547. The 45 and 47 numbers represent Trump’s presidential campaign message that he was the 45th president of the US and aims to be the 47th president.

However, it is important to note that while the announcement claimed Trump as the “first major party nominee” to accept crypto donations, he is not the official nominee until July. Additionally, in 2015, Senator Rand Paul from the Republican Party accepted Bitcoin donations for his presidential campaign.
This move follows Trump’s promise at a recent event at Mar-a-Lago, where he assured supporters they could donate in crypto. He also pledged a more welcoming approach to the crypto industry, criticizing current US regulatory measures as “hostility.”

His current crypto-focused political move comes when President Joe Biden’s administration shows a tougher stance toward the digital assets industry. This shift is notable, considering Trump was a crypto skeptic during his first presidency from 2017 to 2021.
Nonetheless, many believe that Trump’s presidency could bring a positive outlook for the crypto industry. BeInCrypto previously reported that Standard Chartered’s researcher Geoffrey Kendrick noted that Trump’s administration might adopt less stringent regulatory measures for crypto than the current Biden administration.

This potential policy shift could encourage foreign official buyers of US treasuries to explore alternative financial assets like Bitcoin. Such exploration could potentially drive its price upwards.

Bitcoiners Scoff At Gold Bull Peter Schiff's Theory That Ethereum ETF Approvals Could Sink BTC - Benzinga

Gold bull and staunch Bitcoin BTC/USD critic, Peter Schiff, used the recent euphoria around Ethereum ETH/USD spot ETF approvals to attack King Crypto's prospects.What Happened: Schiff wrote in an X post that a potential Ether spot ETF approval could be a bearish event for the world's largest cryptocurrency.He argued, "But any money to buy new Ether ETFs will most likely come from existing Bitcoin ETFs. Investors who decided to make an allocation to crypto won’t increase that allocation to buy Ether."Put simply, Schiff argued that the existing Bitcoin ETF investors would eventually sell their shares and reallocate them to new Ether ETFs rather than keeping both in their portfolios. Why It Matters: Bitcoin proponents were not amused by the commentary, with one user, Rajat Soni, taking it upon himself to educate the Bitcoin skeptic. He reminded Schiff of Bitcoin's dominant position in the market and that its pump was unrelated to developments around Ether ETFs. "Bitcoin’s price doesn’t go up because of Ether. Ether’s price goes up because of Bitcoin," Soni asserted. Another user named Joby Anderson replied to Schiff that an ETH ETF approval would “just signal to investors that regulatory risk is improving and … promote additional outside investment. You know this.”Bitcoin rallied over $70,000 amid net inflows of nearly $548 million into spot ETFs this week, according to data from SoSo Value. The eleven investment vehicles tracking the spot prices of Bitcoin have raked in around $12.88 billion since their listing in early January.Schiff's skepticism stands antithetical to Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood's forecast of Bitcoin hitting $3.8 million by 2030, provided institutional investors allocate 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin.  Price Action: Bitcoin was trading down 1.6% at $69952, as of 11:55 pm ET, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Trump Accepts Cryptocurrency Donations In Bitcoin, Ethereum, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin And More, Says MAGA Supporters ‘Will Build A Crypto Army’Photo via Shutterstock

Uniswap Labs Challenges SEC's Claims: Gears Up For Court Battle



	

Key Points:




Uniswap Labs disputes US SEC allegations.



UNI and LP tokens are claimed not to be securities.



Uniswap is ready to defend its stance in court.




Uniswap Labs challenges SEC’s charges on allegations that its UNI and LP tokens are not securities. The firm is ready to defend itself against the claims in court.





Uniswap Labs has reportedly challenged allegations brought against the company by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York-based startup disputes a claim that the company operates as an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer.



Uniswap Labs Challenges SEC’s Allegations



The SEC’s Enforcement Division sent a Wells notice last month, signaling the intention to recommend legal action against Uniswap Labs.



Marvin Ammori, the chief legal officer at Uniswap Labs, told a press conference that the SEC based the case on the incorrect assumption that all tokens are securities.




Ammori clarified that tokens are a file format and not a security per se. The chief legal officer also warned the commission that legal action risks an adverse decision and possibly clipping the commission’s wings as far as the authority to regulate crypto tokens is concerned.

Tokens are Not Securities, Says Uniswap’s Chief Legal Officer



Uniswap Labs argues that the UNI tokens the governance token for Uniswap are not securities under the Howey Test, the legal guideline defining investment contracts.



The company also states that LP tokens special tokens awarded to users contributing to liquidity pools on Uniswap are not securities but accounting tools that keep track of a user’s assets and any fees they might earn.





Ammori said that Uniswap Labs was ready to defend the company’s position in court: “We will litigate if we have to, and if we litigate, we will win.”



All these happen while SEC Chairman Gary Gensler continues to insist that the regulator has the authority over digital assets, mostly unregistered securities, according to his claims, which are under the rule of the SEC.

Donald Trump's Presidential Campaign Now Allowed To Donate Using Cryptocurrency - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Donald Trump’s presidential campaign now accepts cryptocurrency donations, which is the first for a major party candidate.



The campaign aims to counter Biden and Warren’s anti-crypto positions and attract young male voters.



Accepting various cryptocurrencies opens a new funding source for Trump’s campaign.




According to CNBC, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign announced on Tuesday that it will start accepting donations in various cryptocurrencies.





Donald Trump’s Presidential Campaign Embraces Cryptocurrency Donations



The decision aligns with Trump’s pledge to embrace digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether, positioning him as the first major party candidate to do so.



Supporters can donate using any cryptocurrency accepted through Coinbase Commerce, according to a campaign press release. This initiative follows Trump’s declaration of support for crypto at a recent Mar-a-Lago gala, marking the digital currencies’ entry into the 2024 campaign.



The announcement also targets President Joe Biden, linking him to Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent crypto critic. Warren has campaigned to build an “anti-crypto army” to restrict cryptocurrency use, a stance that Donald Trump’s presidential campaign plans to counter with its own “crypto army.”




New Fundraising Avenue Through Digital Currencies



“This new cryptocurrency option will help build a crypto army, pushing our campaign towards victory on November 5th,” the campaign stated. The move could tap into a new funding stream for Trump’s campaign, which has lagged behind Biden in cash reserves despite strong fundraising efforts in April.



Crypto donations to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign will be treated as in-kind contributions, akin to stock gifts, and are subject to Federal Election Commission regulations on contribution limits and disclosures. The campaign can choose to liquidate the digital assets or hold onto them.



Trump has made previous efforts to engage the crypto community, which tends to be younger and more male. In December, he released NFT trading cards available for purchase with cryptocurrency, and earlier this month, he hosted a dinner for NFT supporters at Mar-a-Lago, urging them to vote for him.



Meanwhile, the Biden campaign has maintained a skeptical stance toward cryptocurrencies. Hours before Trump’s announcement, Biden’s team sent a fundraising text warning that “cryptocurrency executives and oil barons are backing Trump.”





While Trump promotes himself as the first major party nominee to embrace crypto donations, he follows in the footsteps of other candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Senator Rand Paul, who previously accepted Bitcoin donations.

Bitcoin mining - Here's why this group is still holding as BTC falls below $70K - AMBCrypto



The Bitcoin miner reserve has increased to its highest level since April.
BTC has fallen below $70K once again.

Recently, Bitcoin [BTC] mining difficulty has decreased, but miners’ revenue has also declined. 
Despite this drop in revenue, miners have yet to start selling off their holdings, even with BTC falling below the $70,000 mark. They are choosing to hold onto their Bitcoin for now.
Bitcoin mining revenue and difficulty declines
According to data from Blockchain.com, Bitcoin mining difficulty has remained flat for several days. 
The chart analysis shows that the difficulty began decreasing around the 7th of May and continued until the 10th of May. Since then, it has stabilized.
 This implies that solving the block puzzle to add new blocks now requires less time and fewer resources.
Additionally, over 30 days ago, BTC miner revenue surged to over $107 million but then experienced a sharp decline, dropping to $26.4 million by the 1st of May. 
At press time, it was attempting to recover, likely supported by the recent rise in BTC prices, and sat around $34.1 million. This level of revenue is similar to what it was in December 2023.
Miner reserve increase in value
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin miner reserve indicated that it has remained stable over the past few days, holding around 1.816 million BTC at press time. 
Although there have been occasional declines, the reserve has maintained this level since the 6th of May. 
However, the value of this reserve has significantly increased in recent days. The chart showed that the reserve’s value rose from approximately $120 billion to over $129 billion by the 20th of May. 
As of this writing, the reserve’s value is around $129.2 billion.
Source: CryptoQuant
Bitcoin falls below $70k
The increase in the value of the Bitcoin miner reserve is due to the spike in BTC’s prices. On the 20th of May, the price of BTC surged from around $66,000 to over $71,000, a rise of more than 7%. 

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

However, at press time, BTC had fallen back to approximately $69K, with a decline of 2% in the last 24 hours. 
This price range means that miners’ holdings have become more valuable, even if the volume of their holdings has not significantly increased.

Ethereum ETF Approval Unlikely This Week, Says Top Crypto Analyst: 72-Hour Window 'Weird And Almost Impossible To Establish' - Benzinga

Popular cryptocurrency analyst and trader Michaël van de Poppe went against the broader market sentiment by suggesting that spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs won't be greenlighted by the SEC this week.What Happened: Van de Poppe, known for sharing crypto investment strategies on social media, said, "Honestly, I think it’s going to be a delay and approval in July/August," amid the ongoing frenzy. The analyst's views drew market interest as the final deadline for the first wave of applications falls on May 23, with VanEck‘s proposal being the first in line.Van de Poppe told Benzinga that the likelihood of approval within a window of 72 hours is "weird and almost impossible to establish." He cited the continued presence of ETH staking in many applications as a factor that could delay approvals. He added that the market would likely respond negatively to the SEC’s refusal, but the grounds for denial would determine the next reaction."If it’s solely the staking part, then it might suggest that we’re going to have an approval, but just later on, and that would automatically lead to a positive build-up at a later point in time," Van de Poppe emphasized.Why It Matters: After a few hours of receiving the aforementioned responses, nearly five applicants amended their filings to remove the staking part — a blockade that Van de Poppe was referring to.Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart maintained a 75% approval chance as of this publication. Meanwhile, VanEck's spot Ether ETF fund was listed on the website of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, according to The Block. While not a confirmation of approval, this step was important in the process of listing the investment vehicles.Price Action: At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading up 3.26% at $3,759.04, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoiners Scoff At Gold Bull Peter Schiff’s Theory That Ethereum ETF Approvals Could Sink BTCImage via Shutterstock

Trump Adopts Bitcoin, ETH, XRP, Dogecoin, SHIB For Donations


								Former US President Donald J. Trump has announced that his campaign will accept donations in Bitcoin and various cryptocurrencies, marking a significant milestone as the first major party Presidential nominee to employ this strategy for fundraising. The announcement came via an official campaign press release.
The Trump campaign’s new fundraising initiative integrates the use of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). These can now be donated through Coinbase Commerce, a service that allows merchants to accept multiple cryptocurrencies directly into a user-controlled wallet.


Trump Goes All In On Bitcoin And Crypto
According to the campaign’s press release, the move adds “to President Trump’s already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation [and] marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrency for donations.” This initiative is not just a broadening of the campaign’s digital fundraising operation but also a strong political statement in favor of Bitcoin and crypto’s role in enhancing financial freedom and innovation.

The campaign contrasts its embrace of cryptocurrency with the positions of key Democratic opponents, particularly President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who have expressed significant skepticism towards the utility and regulation of digital currencies. The press release specifically calls out Senator Warren’s efforts to curtail the crypto sector, which she has often described as a ‘shadowy system’ that needs more stringent regulation.
“Biden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‘anti-crypto army’ to restrict Americans’ right to make their own financial choices. MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!,” the press release states.
David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, who developed the Bitcoin agenda with the Trump campaign, commented via X, highlighting the significance of this move: “Only the start of the Trump news.”

He added, “Max the individual contribution to Trump, make sure to pay in bitcoin or crypto. We have his attention right now. Many decisions are being made. We want to validate this move with impressive numbers and keep him moving… Everything is on the table right now. 3,000 people max out their individual contribution over the next 48 hrs (adds up to ~$10m) Trump is going to be blown away.”
The Trump campaign has clarified that all crypto contributions will adhere strictly to Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations. These donations will be reported as in-kind contributions, similar to gifts of stock, providing a transparent framework for how these funds will be accounted for. Donors are directed to a specific page on Trump’s official campaign website where they can complete their transactions through Coinbase Commerce, choosing from a wide range of crypto options.
This strategic move comes at a critical time as Trump’s campaign finances have shown robust growth, even outpacing President Biden in April fundraising totals, according to reports. However, Biden’s campaign still maintains a larger reserve of cash on hand. By opening up the campaign to crypto donations, Trump is not only diversifying his fundraising options, but potentially tapping into crypto voters who are single-issue voters.
While the Trump campaign claims to be the first major party nominee to accept cryptocurrencies, it’s important to note that other political figures have also engaged with crypto. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running an independent presidential campaign, and Senator Rand Paul in his 2015 presidential campaign, both accepted Bitcoin. However, the scope and variety of cryptocurrencies now accepted by the Trump campaign set a new precedent in terms of the breadth of digital assets involved.

US Market Dominates Bitcoin Trading Amid ETF Boom


Bitcoin trading during US market hours has surged to unprecedented levels, accounting for 46% of this year’s cumulative volume from January to April.
This increase in trading activity is closely linked to the January launch of spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
US Dominates Bitcoin Trading, Asia Lags Behind

Kaiko Research highlights that the volume of Bitcoin trading spikes at the beginning and close of US trading hours. This pattern correlates with the calculation of net asset values for the ETFs at the close of US stock exchanges each weekday. 
Additionally, Thursdays see the highest share of trading during US hours, contributing nearly 15% of the cumulative daily volume.
While Bitcoin trading volume during US hours has rebounded to 2022 levels, volume during Asian trading hours remains significantly lower, Kaiko found. This shift indicates the growing influence of US market activities on Bitcoin trading dynamics.

Additionally, Toby Winterflood, Chief Product Officer of crypto data firm – CCData, noted that the performance of Bitcoin during US market hours reflects muted volatility compared to previous periods. 

“That literally shows you the impact that these ETFs have had, not only on Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P, but also its potential de-correlation with other altcoins and other cryptos,” Winterflood said.

The spot-Bitcoin ETFs have drawn nearly $13 billion in net inflows since their launch four months ago. This makes them one of the most successful product category debuts in industry history. 
Although demand has slowed, with a net $1.3 billion inflow so far in May, the pace seems to be picking up again. In the past two days alone, these ETFs have recorded a cumulative net flow of $542.9 million.
Currently, Bitcoin is trading around the psychological resistance level of $70,000. According to a report by Hashkey, Bitcoin returned five times the S&P 500 from January to April 2024. 

Bitcoin, representing 53% of the entire crypto market cap, delivered a 57% return year-to-date. Whereas S&P 500 recorded 12.20% growth in the same period.

Bitcoin’s typically lower volatility compared to other crypto assets highlights its unique position within the market. Many other crypto assets have returned multiples of Bitcoin’s performance, reflecting the broader volatility and potential rewards within the crypto sector.

Trump Embraces Crypto Donations, Plans to “Build a Crypto Army”


                        
                            Trump Embraces Crypto Donations, Plans to “Build a Crypto Army”

                        Donald Trump has reportedly become the first presumptive Republican presidential nominee to accept cryptos for official campaign donations.The former US President on Tuesday, launched a crypto fundraising page for eligible donors to contribute using the Coinbase Commerce product. The move comes weeks after he declared as the candidate for cryptocurrency at Mar-a-Lago gala that thrust crypto into the 2024 campaign.Per the crypto donation portal, crypto assets including Bitcoin, (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ripple (XRP), USD Coin (USDC) and Ox (ZRX) are accepted currently.Crypto donations are subject to standard contribution disclosure requirements from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). That said, it isn’t clear whether the Trump campaign will hold onto the crypto or plans to sell it.The statement further said that the move is a “part of a seismic shift toward freedom.” The announcement “reflects Trump’s commitment to an agenda that values freedom over socialistic government control,” it added.Julia Krieger, a Coinbase spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that the platform is open to all candidates this election season. “Crypto is nonpartisan and moves money forward because it’s cheaper and faster,” she added.Interestingly, the likely GOP flag bearer in the upcoming US elections, isn’t the first presidential candidate to accept cryptocurrency donations.Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from ‘We The People,’ announced in May 2023 that his campaign would accept BTC donations. Republican Senator Rand Paul, accepted BTC donations in its 2015 campaign.Building a ‘Crypto Army’
With the new crypto donation option, Trump supporters are planning to build a ‘crypto army’ to fight with the “anti-crypto army” that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has campaigned on.Although Trump is yet to propose any concrete pro-crypto policies, his supporters are already accepting the positive voices in favor of the nascent asset class. This is possibly due to Biden’s administration taking the anti-crypto stance in the past.The Biden administration has taken a cautious approach to cryptos. For instance, in 2022, Biden signed an Executive Order, which aims to develop digital assets in a responsible manner. The Order called on government agencies to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies, with a focus on consumer protection, financial stability and CBDCs.Trump’s Skepticism on Cryptos
Donald Trump, while in office, has expressed some skepticism about cryptos. In 2019, he said that he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.” He strongly supported the US Dollars, calling it the “only real currency” in the US.“[Cryptos] are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.”However, an official filing that circulated in October 2023 revealed that Trump holds between $250,000 to $500,000 in digital assets, and that he held a majority of assets in Ethereum.Early this year, the former Prez said he would never allow the creation of a CBDC, calling it a “dangerous threat to freedom.”

Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE) Will Surge 11,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gold Pepe presents a similar opportunity.



Gold Pepe has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days before it will be listed on KuCoin – a massive cryptocurrency exchange – and Gold Pepe could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Gold Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Gold Pepe on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gold Pepe by entering its contract address – 5EZoavSMtfuq3dQuyQsYqUgmD7avZJEZMYpLtpZFBgYz – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GOLDPEPE.

Ethereum ETF Issuers Amend SEC Forms, But Launches May Take Months


																“It’s happening,” exclaimed Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on May 22 who added that at least five of the potential ETH ETF issuers have submitted their amended 19b-4s to the Securities and Exchange Commission a few hours ago.
Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Ark 21Shares, and Franklin all submitted amendments via the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).
Grayscale filed an updated 19b-4 for their Ethereum Mini Trust earlier in the day.


Not So Fast
The flurry of activity follows an advisory from the SEC to submit revised 19b-4 forms by May 21. A 19b-4 is a form filed by ETF issuers and exchanges proposing to change rules or introduce new products, in this case, spot Ethereum ETPs.
May 23 is the first final deadline for SEC approval or denial for the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF.
It is still a potentially long way from a launch, said Seyffart before adding, “These filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate.”
However, there needs to be SEC approval orders on all of the 19b-4s then the regulator needs to approve the S-1 applications, which could take “weeks or more before ETFs launch,” he said.
“Seeing broad misconceptions that ‘approvals’ mean immediate launches of the #Ethereum ETFs. This isn’t necessarily the case. There will be days (at a minimum), likely at least weeks, and potentially months between approval and launches here.”
An S-1 is the initial registration form required for new securities offered to the public. They provide the SEC and potential investors with detailed information about the company’s business operations and products.
The major amendments submitted involved removing anything related to Ethereum staking from the ETF filings, which the SEC has vetoed for these products.
If the issuers could stake the ETH in the funds, they could potentially offer investors greater returns but the regulator was having none of it, still asserting that Ether is a security.
Seyffart maintained approval odds at 75% following an upgrade from 25% earlier this week.
“Also — Yes — our approval odds are still at 75%. Not that it even means anything anymore haha.”
Meanwhile, ETF Store President Nate Geraci did not think that the last-minute SEC U-turn was politically motivated.
ETH Price Outlook
Ethereum prices topped $3,800 on May 21 as ETF hopium heats up. The asset has held on to gains and was trading at $3,750 at the time of writing.
ETH has made a whopping 31% over the past week, most of that coming in a single day.
Bitcoin could not maintain gains, however, dipping below $70,000 during the Wednesday morning Asian trading session.

GALA Price Rises 5% After Hack Recovery and DWF Labs Buy


Following yesterday’s security breach, Gala Games announced that the stolen funds had been recovered as Ethereum (ETH).
The Gala Games team said they would use Gala Swap to convert the ETH back to their native token, GALA.
DWF Labs Buys 28 Million GALA as Part of Hack Recovery

Jason Brink, President of Blockchain at Gala Games, shared a link to the on-chain data of the stolen fund return transaction. According to the data, the address labeled as Gala Games Exploiter has returned 5,913 ETH, worth approximately $22.37 million with the current price.

The Gala Games team has also shared a detailed explanation of the incident. They said they immediately activated the blocklist protocol after detecting the suspicious transfer of $200 million in GALA tokens.
As a result, they froze all tokens in the unauthorized wallet 45 minutes after the breach. The team claims that such measures allowed them to minimize the impact of the incident.

“This was an isolated incident on the Ethereum network. […] A new Founder’s Node ecosystem governance vote will soon decide if the blocklisted GALA will be considered burned as it relates to GALA’s dynamic supply distribution model as described in the Gala Ecosystem Blueprint,” they explained.

Gala Games reassured the community that GALA’s minting capabilities on GalaChain remain secure. They also promised to continuously enhance internal controls and security protocols to protect against such incidents.
Additionally, they plan to reimburse anyone subjected to high transactional fees due to the incident. However, they have not detailed their reimbursement plans further.
As part of recovery efforts, Gala Games received help from crypto market maker DWF Labs—one of their partners. DWF Labs announced they purchased 28 million GALA tokens on the open market. Assuming 1 GALA is valued at $0.043, DWF Labs’ acquisition is roughly worth $1.2 million.

DWF Labs outlined that this action aimed to stabilize the token’s value and support Gala Games during these challenging times. This transaction also intends to alleviate market selling pressures and boost investor confidence.

BeInCrypto previously reported that GALA’s price plunged from $0.047 to $0.038 following the hack. However, DWF Labs’ backing and the Gala Games team’s mitigation approaches boosted the market. At the time of writing, GALA’s price has recovered to $0.044, representing an increase of 5.46% in the last 24 hours.

Six Spot Ethereum ETF Applicants Have Filed Amended 19b-4 For Upcoming Approval - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Six spot Ethereum ETF applicants, including Fidelity and ARK Invest, amended filings to exclude staking provisions after SEC feedback.



Experts believe removing staking boosts Ethereum’s legitimacy and staking returns.




Six proposed spot Ethereum ETF applicants have updated filings in response to comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the eleventh hour.





Read more: What Is A Spot Ethereum ETF? How Important Is The New Ether ETF?



Spot Ethereum ETF Applicants Are Actively Preparing for SEC Approval



In total, the spot Ethereum ETF applicants include VanEck, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, ARK Invest, Grayscale, and Invesco Galaxy. Such amendments filed with the Cboe exchange include the changes in response to the SEC’s concerns and notably remove staking on the Ethereum blockchain for possible ETFs.



Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and ARK 21Shares specifically removed clauses on the validation of Ethereum proof-of-stake from their proposals. In its revised filing, Fidelity emphasized that neither the Trust nor its related parties would stake in the cryptocurrency. Grayscale also made the same statement in its proxy, removing the staking provisions.




Industry Experts Praise Removal of Staking Provisions



Such changes would be made to satisfy SEC requirements. Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, and Ryan Berckmans, an investor in Ethereum, both noted that removing staking could help the overall Ethereum ecosystem by increasing the staking returns and legitimacy of Ethereum without adding risks associated with an ETF.



The Cboe exchange posted these revised 19b-4 filings in a 25-minute window on May 21, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. While the revised filings are a step toward launching, the ETFs still cannot launch until the SEC also approves the corresponding S-1 registration statements. Seyffart noted further that the road to the approval remains long, with revisions still needed for the S-1 forms.



Although the 19b-4 forms might get approved as soon as Thursday, coinciding with VanEck and Cboe’s deadline, the SEC’s position on staking has led to strategic changes by the applicants for the spot Ethereum ETF. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the SEC‘s aversion to allowing staking in ETFs is due to political reasons, pointing out a complex regulatory environment for these financial instruments.

Donald Trump Campaign Is Accepting $XRP, $DOGE, and $SHIB Donations | Cryptoglobe


                                
President Donald Trump’s campaign has launched a fundraising page that allows federally permissible donors to contribute using cryptocurrency via the Coinbase Commerce platform. This development is being touted as the first instance of a major party Presidential nominee accepting cryptocurrency donations, expanding the campaign’s digital fundraising methods.



The campaign has indicated that contributions will comply with Federal Election Commission regulations, including contribution limits and disclosure requirements. Supporters can now make federally permissible cryptocurrency donations at Trump Campaign Crypto Donations.







As you can see from the above screenshot, the cryptocurrencies that are being accepted for donations include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, USD Coin, Solana, and 0x.



According to the campaign’s blog post, Trump has focused on reducing regulations and promoting innovation in financial technology during his presidency. The campaign contrasts this with the views of Democratic leaders such as Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who are portrayed as favoring increased government control over financial systems.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The campaign suggests that this move reflects a broader effort to enhance individual financial freedom and minimize governmental oversight. They argue that this announcement underscores Trump’s commitment to an agenda prioritizing personal liberty over what is described as “government control.”



Elizabeth Warren has been vocal about her concerns regarding cryptocurrency, reportedly stating her intent to build an “anti-crypto army” to impose stricter regulations on digital currencies. In contrast, the Trump campaign is calling on its supporters to form a “crypto army” to bolster the campaign’s efforts leading up to the election on 5 November 2024.



According to CNBC, this new approach could potentially provide a fresh stream of funds for Trump’s campaign, which, despite raising more money than Biden’s in April, still trails in terms of cash reserves. Per the CNBC article, Biden’s campaign maintains a skeptical stance toward cryptocurrency, reflecting the administration’s cautious approach. Just hours before Trump’s campaign began targeting crypto donors, Biden’s team apparently issued a fundraising message warning that “cryptocurrency executives and oil barons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump.” 



CNBC also points out that while Trump’s campaign claims he is the “first major party nominee” to embrace crypto donations, he is not yet the official nominee. Moreover, he is not the first presidential candidate to accept cryptocurrency; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running as an independent, announced in May 2023 that his campaign would take bitcoin donations, and Sen. Rand Paul accepted bitcoin during his 2015 presidential bid.

“As scams continue to become more convincing and intricate, bad actors are taking every opportunity to target and defraud innocent victims.

There is no place for scammers, and we must come together across industries to address this pressing issue.”




Ripple took to X to announce the company’s decision to join the Tech Against Scams program. The firm wrote on its X page, “Together, we’re taking action to protect consumers and disrupt scammers.”







Welcoming this development, Garlinghouse stated that it is “high time” to take strategic action against the growing number of scams and exploits like ‘pig butchering.’ He added:










“There’s one thing all of us in tech can agree on – it’s high time we dismantled the scammers once and for all. Proud that Ripple is joining this coalition along with other industry heavyweights!”




Meanwhile, the blockchain platform Coinbase announced its collaboration with the industry leads, emphasizing to its clients the need to follow the best practices to avoid the prevailing crypto threats. Coinbase declared, “This partnership is dedicated to preventing online fraud and financial schemes that target consumers across various industries.”

Hong Kong Privacy Commission Targets Worldcoin: Key Findings


The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD), Hong Kong, has reportedly completed its investigation into Worldcoin. 
The investigation found significant violations of the Personal data (privacy) regulations. 
Hong Kong Has Been Probing Worldcoin Since December 2023

According to Hong Kong-based media outlet RTHK, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung Lai-ling issued an enforcement notice against Worldcoin. The notice demands the immediate cessation of iris and facial image collection using scanning devices.
The investigation revealed that Worldcoin’s practices in Hong Kong were excessive and unnecessary. Specifically, the retention of personal data for up to ten years to train AI models for identity verification was deemed excessive. Additionally, the collection, retention, transparency, access, and correction of personal data were all found to be in breach of the ordinance.
Worldcoin reportedly failed to adequately inform participants about the purpose of data collection and their rights to access and correct personal data was a key issue. Moreover, the project faced criticism for its lack of Chinese versions of privacy statements and consent forms. 
Read more: What Is Worldcoin? A Guide to the Iris-Scanning Crypto Project

The PCPD noted that staff did not explain or confirm participants’ understanding of these documents. Furthermore, they did not inform them of the risks associated with disclosing biometric data.
From December 2023 to January 2024, the PCPD conducted ten undercover operations at six Worldcoin locations in Hong Kong. Following a court-authorized entry into operation sites, the investigation concluded that 8,302 people had undergone facial and iris scanning for identity verification. These participants submitted to iris scanning to verify their human identity, creating an iris code for registered identity verification.

“With the view to protecting the personal data privacy of members of the public, although we have not received any complaints about the project, the office has proactively commenced an investigation against Worldcoin in accordance with established procedures,” Lo Dik-fan, a senior personal data officer, said.

Despite these developments, there has been no significant impact on Worldcoin’s (WLD) price. As of writing, WLD is trading at 5.07, down by 1.59% in the past 24 hours.
Worldcoin Price Performance. Source: BeInCrypto
The PCPD’s findings are part of broader regulatory challenges Worldcoin faces globally. For example, in Buenos Aires, authorities highlighted discrepancies between Worldcoin’s data handling practices and local regulations. 

Further scrutiny revealed that Worldcoin might have collected data from minors and stored biometric data from Argentine users in Brazil. This situation raises questions about privacy and data sovereignty. If proven, Worldcoin could face a fine of up to 1 billion Argentine pesos ($1.2 million).
In March, Portugal’s data protection authority – CNPD temporarily halted Worldcoin’s data collection, citing risks to citizen data protection. This suspension, affecting over 300,000 Portuguese citizens, followed numerous complaints about unauthorized data collection, particularly from minors.

Other countries, including Spain, have also restricted Worldcoin’s operations due to similar concerns about the safety and ethical implications of biometric data collection.

Polkadot Price Prediction: Is DOT About to Soar Above $10?


																TL;DR

Polkadot (DOT) saw a 7% daily price increase, exceeding the $7.50 mark, with analysts predicting further gains, potentially reaching $10 and beyond.
Analysts such as Michael van de Poppe and Block Diversity envision DOT’s next targets in the $9-$25 range, boosted by the recent introduction of the JAM whitepaper and surpassing important resistance levels.


DOT’s Next Possible Move
The cryptocurrency market is flashing green today (May 21), with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and many more leading digital assets charting impressive ascents. Polkadot (DOT) is also among the notable gainers, registering a 7% daily price increase.
DOT Price, Source: CoinGecko
Numerous analysts noted the asset’s rally, outlining impressive predictions for the near future. One example is the X user Crypto Thanos, who claimed that the $6-$7.50 range was “for accumulating only,” setting $10 as the next target.
Dippy.eth chipped in, too, suggesting that DOT “wants to break out” from the accumulation zone of $6.90-$7.50. In their view, reclaiming the $7.50 mark might lead to “higher levels.” Recall that the asset surpassed that mark a few hours ago and is currently trading at approximately $7.55 (per CoinGecko’s data).




Crypto Tony touched upon the matter yesterday (May 20) when DOT’s price was hovering around $6.90. The analyst said they are looking for “a safe entry” once the asset exceeds the $7.40 resistance mark. It will be interesting to follow whether the trader will jump into DOT’s ecosystem as promised. 
Previous Forecasts
Another crypto analyst who envisioned a bright future for Polkadot’s native cryptocurrency is Michael van de Poppe. The X user, with over 700,000 followers, recently claimed that DOT has already “bottomed,” especially since the introduction of the JAM whitepaper. According to Michael van de Poppe, DOT’s next price target could be in the $20-$25 range.
Recall that the team behind Polkadot released the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) Gray Paper last month. The upgrade’s goal is to create a more efficient, secure, and scalable blockchain environment that integrates the best aspects of both Polkadot and Ethereum technologies.
For their part, Block Diversity predicted a price rally toward $9, $11, and eventually $13 based on DOT clearing the major resistance level of $6.90.

Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAYELON has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gay Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin.



Gay Elon Musk launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gay Elon Musk on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Elon Musk by entering its contract address – AErKQkbiSgsRMT1GmS7XW5tWkpSmdT1zdVJCMv1unvBH – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYELON.

Is Ethereum 'underpriced' against Bitcoin? Here's what analysts say - AMBCrypto



Analyst claims that an ‘approved’ ETH ETF could attract inflows from US spot BTC ETFs.
Another analyst claims that ETH ETFs might not see outflows like in the GBTC case. 

According to crypto analyst and founder of Lekker Capital, Quinn Thompson, Ethereum [ETH] was grossly undervalued against Bitcoin [BTC]. 
Citing the recent update on potential ETH ETF approval and expected capital inflows, Thompson claimed,
‘This leads me to believe that ETHBTC at 0.05 is still underpriced, particularly given we are in a bull market’ 
The ETHBTC ratio tracks ETH’s performance in BTC terms. An increasing value suggests that ETH is outperforming BTC. However, a drop in the ratio implies that BTC is eclipsing ETH on the price charts. 
The ETHBTC ratio dropped to a low of 0.45 on the 16th of May. However, it has since recovered to above 0.50 following a recent update on ETH ETF approval. 
ETF to boost ETH price?
Thompson claimed that ETH hasn’t been able to attract enough flows because of a lack of ETFs, and the market was obsessed with BTC and Solana [SOL]. 
‘The reason ETH was the ugly middle child between BTC and SOL for the past 6 months was the lack of inflows from an ETF’
However, market watchers have mixed views on whether ETH ETFs will follow the BTC ETF’s path. 
After being converted to an ETF in January, GBTC recorded about $17 billion in cumulative outflows as of the 21st of May.  
Will Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) face a similar fate and dent ETH’s upside potential? 
Crypto analyst James Van Straten was conflicted about the possible outcome. 
Instead, Straten mentioned that the proposed Grayscale Mini Trust (ETH) could alleviate issues like fees that led to massive outflows in GBTC.  
‘The mini trust $ETH may launch at the same time with smaller fees, and investors don’t need to do anything, which wasn’t available for $GBTC.’
The proposed Mini Trust will be a spin-off from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). 
Interestingly, Thompson projected that ETH could attract about 9% of inflows from spot BTC ETFs in the first four months after ‘approval.’ 
If confirmed, the ETHBTC ratio could increase from the current 0.53, fueling the ETH value. 
A Standard Chartered executive held the same bullish stance on ETH post-ETF. 
In an interview with The Block, Standard Chartered’s head of Digital Assets Research, Geoff Kendrick, claimed that ETH ETF could be approved this week. 
Kendrick maintained that ETH could hit $8000 by year-end. He added that ETH ETFs could attract ‘roughly $15 billion to $45 billion’ in inflows in the first 12 months. 
That said, whether ETH eclipses BTC post-ETF launch remains to be seen. In the meantime, the market will focus on the SEC’s decision on the 23rd of May on VanEck’s ETH ETF application.

Ethereum Co-Founder Joe Lubin Talks About Ethereum ETFs: "Be Prepared for These Results If Approved!" - Bitcoin Sistemi

After months of anticipation, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears ready to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), setting the stage for a significant increase in demand for Ethereum (ETH) that could lead to a supply shortage.
Ethereum Co-Founder Predicts Supply Squeeze With Potential Approval of Ethereum ETFs
Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, made a statement about ETFs in an interview.


Lubin explained that institutions investing in Bitcoin through recently launched ETFs are likely to diversify their holdings with Ethereum once spot Ethereum ETFs receive approval.
“There will be a fair amount of natural, pent-up pressure to buy Ethereum through ETFs,” he said. However, this demand may face a more limited supply compared to the Bitcoin ETFs approved earlier this year.





In January, when spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, authorized participants — the firms responsible for purchasing Bitcoin on behalf of the ETFs — were able to easily purchase idle coins available on exchanges or through over-the-counter transactions.
However, the situation with Ethereum is different. On-chain data shows that more than 27% of the total Ethereum supply is currently staked on the Ethereum network, generating returns for holders and therefore kept out of direct circulation.



“The bulk of Ethereum is used in the core protocol, DeFi systems, or DAOs,” Lubin said, referring to decentralized autonomous organizations.
This locked supply, combined with Ethereum's market dynamics, could make Ethereum's price more sensitive to expected inflows from ETFs.





Moreover, increased activity on the Ethereum network will trigger the burning of some of the existing Ethereum supply over time, further tightening the current supply. The deflation mechanism introduced by Ethereum's EIP-1559 upgrade contributes to scarcity by systematically reducing the supply of Ethereum in circulation.
The scenario for Ethereum ETFs could parallel or even exceed the supply pressures faced by Bitcoin ETFs.
Lubin emphasized the broader significance of this development, calling it a “profound turning point” for Ethereum and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.

Ethereum Blockchain's Ether (ETH) Token Nearly Adds an Entire Solana (SOL) to Its Market Value

"Near-term ETH outlook is incredibly bullish. Let's not overcomplicate it," Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email. "The ETF announcement is a near black swan even to (most) investors, markets dramatically short-to-underweight ETH, much of ETH liquidity is locked in staking, and the macro backdrop is favourable,"

How Launchpads Are Fueling a Start-up Investment Boom

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
Crypto start-up investing is heating up. The first quarter of 2024 saw a total of $2.52 billion invested in crypto and blockchain projects, according to PitchBook – some 25% higher than Q4 2023. 
And all signs point to an exponential increase throughout the second half of the year. Nearly every day, we’re seeing projects in the DePIN, AI, and GameFi sectors closing bigger and bigger funding rounds, and much of this surge in activity is being fuelled by crypto launchpads.
In crypto, a launchpad is a platform that facilitates the introduction and sale of a new token to the public, typically through a process called an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Launchpads act as an intermediary between crypto projects and investors. They offer a more structured and secure environment for investors and a wide range of start-up services – from regulatory compliance to marketing support. 

For example, Yield App Angel provides access to its established community of 105,000 users with an estimated $20 billion in total crypto assets, along with marketing support, strong KOL relationships, access to top VCs, and so much more. Investors, meanwhile, can choose from a curated selection of vetted projects. 
The Formula to Start-Up Success
There are many examples of projects that successfully raised capital via a launchpad. One name any crypto enthusiast will recognize is Polygon – a platform aiming to create a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem compatible with Ethereum. Polygon, originally called Matic Network, raised funds with the help of the Binance Launchpad back in 2019. According to Defi Llama it grew into a thriving ecosystem, with around $8 billion in total value locked (TVL) at the height of the 2021 DeFi boom.
Today, there is a wide range of launchpads in the Web3 space, from platforms run by leading centralized exchanges like Binance and Bitget, to dedicated incubators and launchpads like Yield App Angel or Seedify. Every day, these launchpads are helping start-ups get off the ground with successful funding rounds. Seedify, for example, says it has helped more than 50 projects raise some $18 million in total funding and grow their market caps to five times the total amount raised.However, while launchpads can offer a crucial support network for crypto start-ups conducting a funding round, the 2018 ICO boom has also left them with a bad rep. Some were responsible for promoting pump-and-dump tokens, with an estimated 80% of all ICOs in 2017 identified as scams. 
The Importance of Due Diligence
So, while launchpads are a crucial piece of the puzzle for start-up funding, as an investor, it’s important to find one that follows strict due diligence rules to avoid fraudulent projects, since not all launchpads are made equal. If you want to make the most of the current start-up investment boom but security is your top concern, then Yield App Angel could be for you. 
With the help of its proprietary 135-point risk assessment model, Yield App expertly navigated the 2022 crypto downturn, having avoided the collapsed UST stablecoin. In fact, Yield App has seen zero hacks or exploits since its inception. You can be confident all projects available through its launchpad will adhere to the same high standards as the rest of Yield App’s portfolio. 

In the 2024 start-up investment boom, robust due diligence will be particularly crucial. With thousands of new crypto projects coming to market, it’s increasingly difficult for investors to identify the ones that will deliver the best value. Launchpads with a focus on security and risk controls will create a bridge between investors and the highest quality early-stage projects coming to market.
Yield App Angel: The Gold Standard in Fundraising
Ensuring that its users have access to the most promising ICO opportunities is at the heart of Yield App Angel. Typically, these early-stage allocations are only available to top VCs and the most privileged funds, but Yield App provides early access to retail investors with much lower minimum investments. On top of this, Yield App’s total allocations are typically much larger than other launchpads ($300,000-$4 million) and can be oversubscribed, which guarantees access to all those interested.
Recently, Yield App Angel facilitated a successful fundraising round for ME3 – a project revolutionizing fan engagement and community interaction by bringing together eSports, gaming, finance, and social connections and is currently taking subscriptions for AI project Raiinmaker.
With a wide selection of exciting fundraising rounds in the pipeline, Yield App Angel will play a pivotal role in giving the average investor access to the 2024 start-up investment boom. From gaming to AI and everything in between, Yield App seeks out curated early-stage projects that offer a real opportunity to grow your wealth and make the most of the bull market in a secure, risk-controlled way.

Analysts Expect Spot Ethereum ETFs to Launch in Weeks


Analysts anticipate the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs within weeks, following significant amendments to filings by issuers like Fidelity and Ark 21Shares.
Though US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval remains uncertain, these developments could mark a pivotal moment for the crypto market.
SEC Filings Amended, Paving Way for Potential Ethereum ETF Launch

The SEC recently requested amendments to the 19b-4 forms filed by asset managers for spot Ethereum ETFs. Five potential issuers—Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton—have complied and made the necessary changes through Cboe. They removed language related to staking and added clear statements that the funds cannot be staked by anyone.

“Neither the Trust or the Fund, nor the Sponsor, nor the Custodian, nor any other person associated with the Trust or Fund will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the Fund’s ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings,” the amended documents read.

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) website has also featured VanEck’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF with ticker ETHV. Despite these positive developments, SEC approval is not guaranteed.

“Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s and then we need to see S-1 approvals,” James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said.

The 19b-4 filings propose rule changes necessary for listing new products on stock exchanges, such as spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, S-1 registration forms provide detailed information about new securities offered to the public, including the fund’s structure, management, and investment strategy. Issuers must obtain approval for both forms to launch ETFs in the market officially.
Nonetheless, Seyffart expressed optimism after seeing this progress. He stated it “could be weeks or more before [Ethereum] ETFs launch.” Despite his optimism, Seyffart affirmed that his approval odds are still the same, at 75%.
Many see the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs as a bullish signal for the broader crypto market. However, approving these ETFs without allowing staking might disadvantage investors seeking additional yield from staking rewards.
Investors who buy, hold, and stake ETH can earn staking rewards, which provide extra yield. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs without staking provide exposure to ETH prices but lack the benefits of staking rewards.

According to a recent report, the same reason led asset managers CoinShares and Valkyrie to decide not to apply for spot Ethereum ETFs. A source familiar with the matter said that the firms don’t see value for investors without the staking aspect.
Industry experts believe that political considerations could influence the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. This is especially relevant to the upcoming US presidential election in November. BeInCrypto reported that several experts agree the approval might signal a shift in President Joe Biden’s administration’s stance on crypto.

Recently, Emilie Choi, President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) at Coinbase, also noticed the swift change in SEC’s stance.

“And the sense is that the tone from the SEC has just changed literally overnight based on some feedback, it must have gotten from just seeing the [Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121] SAB 121 repeal and probably the administration seeing sensing some panic, I guess,” Choi said during the JPMorgan Technology, Media & Communications Conference 2024.

VanEck's Fund Listed on DTCC, Approval Anticipated


							

VanEck’s Ethereum ETF takes a step forward, but full launch awaits SEC approval.



BlackRock, Fidelity, and others also in the race for a spot Ethereum ETF.



SEC’s recent move sparks optimism for potential approval of Ethereum ETFs.




Investment management giant VanEck saw its spot Ethereum ETF make its way onto the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) list of ETFs.



The DTCC, an American financial market infrastructure company renowned for providing post-trade clearance, settlement, custody, and information services, confirmed the addition on its website.



Crucially, listing the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF is a preliminary step and does not indicate the full launch of the fund. The ETF is still awaiting regulatory approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other similar filings from industry heavyweights like BlackRock, Fidelity, etc.



Furthermore, under the create/redeem column, the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF is marked as “N,” suggesting that it is not yet active. The DTCC noted:




“This file includes both active ETFs that may be processed at DTCC and ETFs that are not yet active (“pre-launch”) and, therefore, are not able to be processed at DTCC, unless and until such securities have received all necessary regulatory and other approvals.”




The SEC-registered securities clearing corporation has listed VanEck’s spot Ethereum fund ticker as “ETHV.” 









Earlier this week, reports emerged that the SEC requested US firms to update and refile their 19B-4 filings concerning their proposed spot Ethereum ETFs. This move has been interpreted by some as a positive signal, potentially indicating forthcoming approval from the regulator. The 19B-4 forms are essential documents that notify the SEC about a proposed rule change and require the agency’s approval before spot Ethereum ETFs can become effective. According to analysts, the regulator might approve 19B-4s but take its time greenlighting the S-1 filings.

Bitget celebrates il Bitcoin pizza day con oltre 20 Eventi Globali

To celebrate Bitcoin pizza day, Bitget, one of the main cryptocurrency exchanges, organized over 20 offline events worldwide. These meetings, held from May 19 to 22, brought together cryptocurrency enthusiasts on five continents to commemorate a crucial moment in the history of Bitcoin.

The origin of Bitcoin pizza day
Bitcoin Pizza Day, celebrated annually on May 22, marks the date of the first transaction with BTC made for a purchase in the “real” world. 
In 2010, in fact, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from Florida, bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, which today would have a value of about 270 million dollars! 
This transaction has demonstrated the potential of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, transforming it from an innovative idea to a revolutionary financial asset.
“`html
The global celebrations of Bitget for Bitcoin pizza day
“`
Le celebrazioni di Bitget, per commemorare questa data storica, sono state ampie ed hanno coperto città importanti come Brisbane, Buenos Aires, San Paolo e Taipei. 
A Taipei, l’evento ha visto la partecipazione di Steve Chen, co-fondatore di YouTube. 
In Australia, the evento è stato organizzato in collaborazione con l’Australian DeFi Association e la comunità All Things Blockchain. Le attività includevano sessioni di networking, condivisione di pizze, discussioni sulla blockchain e approfondimenti da parte di Bitget.
A San Paolo, Bitget ha invece collaborato con Domino’s Pizza per fornire pizze no stop all’evento, mentre a Buenos Aires è stato organizzato un evento di trading. 
These occasions therefore never turn out to be just simple celebrations, but also platforms to discuss the current landscape of blockchain technology and trading opportunities.
Beyond the celebrations: rewards and innovations
To make the celebrations more engaging, Bitget has offered exciting rewards. The company has created a 3D video to spread the message and has announced an APR of 100% in USDT for new users on Bitget Earn until June 16. 
These initiatives underline Bitget’s commitment to enhancing user engagement and promoting the adoption of criptovalute.
“`html
Reflections on the journey of Bitcoin
“`
Il Bitcoin Pizza Day non è solo una semplice celebrazione, il Pizza Day è un grande e forte reminder per tutta la comunità crypto.
The pizza Day is one of those dates that force us to stop and reflect on the enormous opportunity that cryptocurrencies still offer us today.
It forces us to take an important zoom out of the situation, becoming aware of the fact that investments in crypto remain the most profitable and advantageous investments of the last decade. 
Despite their volatility, despite the regulatory uncertainty in some of their aspects, there are absolutely no rivals. 
Despite the skepticism and sporadic bugs of the system, crypto, to date, has no competitor in terms of economic return.  
With the Pizza day, therefore, the early adopters are honored and continuous innovation in the sector is encouraged.

SEC: Uniswap ritiene insensata la regolamentazione della DeFi

According to Uniswap Labs, the attempt by the SEC to impose DeFi regulation would be weak and wrong. 
This is what they wrote yesterday in a post published on their official blog titled “The fight for DeFi continues”.

DeFi Regulation: The issue between Uniswap and the SEC
Everything originates from the Wells notice that the SEC sent to Uniswap in April.
Questo avviso informava Uniswap Labs che l’agenzia intendeva intraprendere un’azione legale contro di loro. 
According to Uniswap, the SEC claims that the Uniswap protocol is an unregistered exchange controlled by the company Uniswap Labs. 
In reality, the Uniswap protocol is decentralized, and in theory, it should not be controlled by anyone, except by the Ethereum network as a whole, and by the other networks on which it runs. 
However, the SEC also argues that Uniswap Labs acts as an unregistered financial intermediary, and that the token UNI is an investment contract.
Uniswap’s objections to these accusations are that the value represented in a specific digital file format cannot always and in every case be defined as a security, and that the SEC cannot arbitrarily extend the definitions of exchange, broker, and contracts to the point of rendering them meaningless. 
I token vengono paragonati da Uniswap a formati di file, mentre il protocollo viene definito come un programma informatico di uso generale che chiunque può utilizzare e integrare. 
Furthermore, it emphasizes that the hundreds of thousands of users who received UNI tokens for their participation, in the early days, received the token for free, without any contract and without any specific expectation of profit. 
The response of Uniswap Labs to the SEC’s note on DeFi regulation
Uniswap Labs has already sent the SEC a comprehensive legal response to their Wells notice, and in yesterday’s post, it summarized its position for easier understanding.
First of all, they state that they believe the SEC should embrace open source technology, instead of stopping it. In this regard, they also mock the agency, highlighting how its goal should be to “protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.” 
Instead, their aggressive theories are defined as an effort to expand the jurisdiction of the SEC beyond the exchanges, to communication technology and all markets. 
A tal proposito sottolineano come le loro argomentazioni legali siano talmente deboli da essere già addirittura state confutate dai tribunali. Sottolineano anche che la Camera statunitense potrebbe approvare un disegno di legge che conferirebbe alla CFTC, e non alla SEC, l’autorità per vigilare sul trading di asset digitali.
They believe they are on the right side of history, and they invite the SEC not to dedicate its taxpayer-funded resources to initiate a lawsuit against them.
In the event that the case goes to court, they claim to be ready to fight, having on their side lawyers like Andrew Ceresney, former head of SEC enforcement who has already represented Ripple in the victory against the agency, and Don Verrilli, former United States Solicitor General who represented Grayscale in its bull case won against the agency.
The Uniswap protocol 
Regarding the Uniswap protocol developed by them, they believe it represents an important innovation in the markets, and that it benefits the consumers directly. 
It is an autonomous software that allows users to carry out transactions directly with each other, without intermediaries, without having to pay fees or rely on centralized intermediaries. 
Moreover, this protocol can actually be integrated by anyone with an Internet connection, even without relying on anyone else, not even Uniswap Labs. 
They write: 
“It just works. It has supported a trading volume of 2 trillion dollars without a single hack and has been integrated by thousands of teams and copied thousands of times”.
They also emphasize that many traditional markets are actually neither efficient nor transparent, in addition to the fact that they operate on limited days and hours, sometimes with delays of several days, requiring various intermediaries who charge commissions that increase costs for all users. 
Uniswap invece ha transazioni trasparenti che possono essere verificate da chiunque, la liquidazione è immediata, ed il servizio è disponibile in tutto il mondo 24 ore su 24, 7 giorni su 7. 
They add:
“These properties offer individuals an unprecedented authority to control what they own and create value on the Internet in new ways”.
SEC defeated?
In recent years the SEC has been defeated twice in court by crypto companies. 
First from Ripple, which managed to convince a judge that XRP should not be considered as an unregistered security when traded on the secondary market (the exchanges). 
Following Grayscale, which managed to convince a judge that the SEC’s opposition to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was wrong, after the same agency had instead approved futures ETFs on Bitcoin. 
Apparently, this week the SEC might be defeated for the third time by the crypto sector, as it seems to be intending to approve the spot Ethereum ETFs, despite claiming that ETH should be considered an unregistered security.
It has always been quite clear that the SEC’s fight against the crypto sector was also a purely political initiative by a part of the United States Democratic Party, around which the current head of the agency Gary Gensler orbits, and given that in November they seriously risk losing the elections, they might have decided on a change of course to avoid losing the crypto electorate. 
The vittima sacrificale at this point should be the same Gary Gensler, on whom the democrats might end up placing the entire responsibility for this failure to try to come out clean in this election year.

Uniswap Slams SEC's Wells Notice, Calls Out ‘Weak’ Arguments

                        Uniswap Labs filed a 40-page response on Tuesday to the SEC’s Wells Notice, arguing against a potential lawsuit and urging the agency to drop the matter.It comes after the agency raised concerns a few weeks ago that Uniswap’s operations might violate US securities laws. The decentralized crypto exchange is now explaining in detail why the SEC could be wrong.Uniswap serves as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform catering to developers, traders, and liquidity providers. But the SEC claimed that Uniswap Protocol operates as an unregistered securities exchange under Uniswap Labs’ control, while labeling the Uniswap interface as an unregistered securities broker-dealer, and the UNI token as an investment contract.SEC Should Not Waste Taxpayer Money on This Case: Uniswap
Uniswap hit back, stating that the SEC’s legal assertions are “weak” and have been contradicted by court rulings.The crypto marketplace argued that the agency is stretching the definitions of securities, exchanges, and contracts to an unreasonable point. It also said the SEC’s accusations hinge on the idea that any value stored in a digital format can be considered a security.“We’re confident that our work is on the right side of history,” Uniswap said. “The SEC should not devote its taxpayer-funded resources to bringing a case against us.”Most Users Outside SEC’s Jurisdiction, Uniswap Claims
Uniswap argued that most trading on its platform doesn’t involve securities, even by the SEC’s own standards. It pointed out that a large portion (65%) of its trading volume involves assets the SEC itself has admitted aren’t securities, like Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, and stablecoins.Additionally, the protocol argued that US securities laws wouldn’t apply to most users since it estimate 75% of them are from outside the US.The marketplace said that even if a few security-like transactions took place on its platform, it isn’t a securities exchange. It said a court wouldn’t see it that way because the platform wasn’t built specifically for those transactions.The federal regulator has aggressively sent Wells notices, filed lawsuits, and settled with numerous crypto companies. Its focus is shifting towards Ethereum and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) players, with ShapeShift, TradeStation, Uniswap, Consensys all facing legal action. The Ethereum Foundation is also reportedly under investigation.

                        BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has generated significant traction, accounting for 95% of the total inflow into United States spot Bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday.The combined inflows for these ETFs surpassed $300 million, a substantial boost for the market.Preliminary data from Farside Investors reveals that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) witnessed a substantial inflow of $290 million on May 21. When considering all eleven ETF issuers combined, the net inflow amounted to $305.7 million.Notably, this marks a reversal in the trend of zero or minimal inflows observed over the past six weeks.BlackRock’s ETF Sees Uptick in Inflows
The recent influx of funds into BlackRock’s ETF represents the highest level since April 5, eclipsing the cumulative inflows witnessed over the past 21 trading days.In the context of a volatile Bitcoin rally, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced over $1 billion in inflows during the past four trading days.Taking into account the latest daily figures, BlackRock’s IBIT has accumulated a total of $16 billion in inflows since its launch, as reported by Farside Investors.However, the official website for the product displays assets under management (AUM) of $19 billion.This positions BlackRock’s IBIT in close proximity to industry leader Grayscale, whose GBTC spot ETF boasts $20 billion in AUM, according to official records.Conversely, Grayscale’s GBTC recorded zero inflows on May 21, extending the streak of five consecutive trading days without outflows.Within the past five days, the fund has witnessed inflows of $72.5 billion, marking a reversal from a four-month trend characterized by consistent outflows.VanEck’s ETF Sees Outflows
Meanwhile, the significant inflow figure on Tuesday was not without its share of outflows.The VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF (HODL) experienced an outflow of $5.9 million, while the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw an outflow of $4.2 million.The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) observed a minor inflow of $25.8 million, while the remaining ETFs reported no significant changes.The enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs has been fueled by a recent uptick in BTC prices, with the asset gaining 12% over the past week.On May 21, BTC reached a six-week high of $71,600, but it subsequently dipped below the $70,000 level during early trading on May 22, currently trading at $69,444 at the time of writing.As reported, Bitcoin has achieved all-time highs against local currencies in several countries across Asia and South America.Markus Thielen, the head of research at 10x Research, previously predicted that a breakthrough above $67,500 could potentially lead to new all-time highs. Currently, BTC is trading at $69,000, just $3,000 away from reaching a new all-time high in U.S. dollars.Aside from 10x Research, some other analysts have also turned bullish on Bitcoin following weeks-long consolidation.Leading trading firm QCP Capital has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s price momentum, forecasting a potential return to the highs of $74,000.In a recent note, the firm said it has observed substantial buyers acquiring 100,000 to 120,000 BTC Calls for December 2024, indicating confidence in the upward movement of the cryptocurrency.

Biden campaign in panic mode as Trump accepts crypto donations


    Not long after declaring his support for the cryptocurrency sector and making it one of the defining points of his presidential bid, the former United States President Donald Trump is now officially accepting donations for his campaign in the form of crypto assets, creating concerns for his opponent’s team.



Specifically, in a historic decision, the Trump campaign has announced it would start accepting donations in digital assets and has launched a fundraising page allowing them, making the former President the first major party nominee in the US to do this, according to a press release on May 21.

As per the press release, the fundraising page provides “any federally permissible donor the ability to give – through its joint fundraising committees – using any cryptocurrency accepted through the Coinbase Commerce product,” referring to the popular crypto exchange.







Indeed, the presidential hopeful’s campaign is now accepting a range of popular assets from the crypto sector, including the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset Bitcoin (BTC), as well as altcoins Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and stablecoin USD Coin (USDC). 



Trump vs. Biden crypto issue



Furthermore, the announcement reads that this makes Trump different from his rival, the incumbent US President Joe Biden, “and his official surrogate Elizabeth Warren,” the Democrat Senator from Massachusetts, as the former president “has reduced regulations and championed innovation in financial technology.”




“The effort to reduce the control of government on an American’s financial decision-making is part of a seismic shift toward freedom. Today’s announcement reflects President Trump’s commitment to an agenda that values freedom over socialistic government control.”




On the other hand, Trump’s campaign argues that his opponents “believe only government has the answers to how our nation leads the world,” also addressing Warren’s March 2023 reelection ad, accusing her of “building an ‘anti-crypto army’ to restrict Americans’ right to make their own financial choices.”



Biden campaign in panic mode



Meanwhile, Biden’s team has sent a fundraising text warning donors that “cryptocurrency executives and oil barons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump,” around the same time as the Trump campaign made the above announcement, according to a widely circulated screenshot.

As a reminder, Trump recently said he was “fine with crypto,” that he was planning to reduce regulatory “hostility” towards it and keep crypto businesses in America, as well as making it possible for his supporters to donate to his campaign using crypto assets, as Finbold reported on May 9.

PEPE Price Hits New ATH: Could Massive Corrections Follow?


PEPE’s price continued to please its holders, as the meme coin not only led the rallying altcoins but also marked a new all-time high in the last 24 hours.
However, this could trigger the altcoin observing a decline as investors look primed to sell.
PEPE Investors Close to Selling

Following the PEPE price rise, the meme coin looks prepared to see some major selling as the altcoin investors realize massive profits. According to the Network Realized Profit/Loss indicator, the overall gains have been inclining for the past month.
Realized profits are a sign that the investors are selling, and this could now intensify as the meme coin hits a new ATH. This seems to have saturated the bullishness and may lead to heavy selling.

Secondly, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio also hints at profit-taking. The MVRV ratio monitors investor profits and losses. With PEPE’s 30-day MVRV at 38%, indicating profit, selling may ensue. 

Historically, the meme coin has undergone corrections at MVRV levels of 15% to 36%, marking it as a danger zone. PEPE is already above this level, which signifies stronger profit-taking potential.

Should this happen, the altcoin could note a fall below key support.
PEPE Price Prediction: Awaiting a Dip
PEPE price market the new ATH of $0.00001430 after rising by 51% in the last two days. At the time of writing, the altcoin is not exhibiting any signs of a decline, but considering the above indicators, it could occur soon.

The most likely outcome would be a fall to $0.00001251, which marks the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement. Intense selling could extend this decline and PEPE could dip to the 61.8% Fib line at $0.00001146.
This line is known to be a bull market support floor, so losing it would wipe away a chunk of the recent profits.

But if PEPE bounces off this support floor, the meme coin could have a shot at reinitiating recovery. The same happened in mid-May before the altcoin jumped, which could invalidate the bearish thesis.

Milady Maker led CryptoSlam’s daily non-fungible token (NFT) sales chart on Tuesday with US$1.07 million, up from Monday’s US$267,554.



Milady’s Tuesday surge follows backlash against Yuga Labs, the owner of the CryptoPunks IP. The company faced criticism for announcing on Monday a new NFT collection focusing on race and gender, tied to CryptoPunks, the day’s second-ranking collection.



While disappointed CryptoPunks owners warned they might sell their NFTs, members of the Milady community predicted that the funds would flow into Milady.







CryptoSlam data shows that many CryptoPunk owners moved their assets. It ranked second on the day with US$737,526 in sales, although it only recorded five sales transactions on Tuesday. Additionally, it also recorded 14 transfers.

	
	
	
	


On Monday, the collection had 30 total transfers, which is the highest since late March.



Following closely in third place, DMarket recorded a daily sales volume of US$735,546, with 3,680 unique buyers and sellers at 3,230, contributing to 28,835 total transactions.



Other notable collections include Fantasy Top and The Captainz, ranking fourth and fifth respectively. 



Fantasy Top achieved a daily sales volume of US$652,892 with 1,726 unique buyers, while The Captainz garnered US$618,594 with 33 unique buyers.

	
	
	

	


The Ethereum blockchain, where Milady, CryptoPunks and Captainz reside, led all blockchains with US$8.47 million in NFT sales, rising from the previous day’s US$6.09 million, a 39% jump.



In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain reported a daily sales volume of US$5.85 million with 1,798 unique buyers, an increase from the previous day’s US$4.97 million. 



Polygon and Mythos Chain also reported substantial daily sales of US$1.60 million and US$758,947.38, respectively, highlighting the diverse and active nature of the NFT market across various blockchains.

Ether ETF Frenzy: Memecoins Explode, Investors Eye SEC Decision


							

Fate of spot Ether ETFs uncertain as deadline nears, VanEck’s proposal leads.



Memecoins Pepe and Floki Inu prices surge amid speculation of regulatory approval for Ether ETFs



SEC actions hint at potential green light for Ether ETFs, impacting broader crypto market




As the May 23 deadline for the first proposed spot Ether ETF approaches, the fate of such financial products hangs in the balance. Notably, VanEck’s proposal leads the pack, and despite the uncertainty, recent actions by issuers suggest they are preparing for a potential green light from regulators.



Notably, Ethereum-based memecoins have experienced a substantial price surge alongside ETH tokens amid growing speculation that regulators may be softening their stance on spot ETH ETFs.



Reports that the SEC has asked at least three U.S. firms to revise their applications for listing spot Ether ETFs have further fueled the bullish interest in these memecoins.



Pepe (PEPE) led the rally, rising 29% in the past 24 hours, as per the data from CoinMarketCap, while LADYS surged approximately 25%. On the other hand, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a small gain of 3%, while Ether (ETH) itself increased by around 4%, reaching $3,792.



Additionally, Dogecoin (DOGE) also ticked up about 4.5%, while Floki Inu (FLOKI) prices shot up by 14%. Moreover, Ethereum rollup network Mantle (MNT) saw a price surge of 6%.



 
 




The market’s positive reaction underscores the high stakes and potential impact of spot Ether ETF approvals. Investors are closely watching the SEC’s decisions, as approval could significantly boost the broader cryptocurrency market by legitimizing and expanding access to Ethereum-based investments.

Ripple CTO Falls Victim to "Sophisticated" Phishing Scam


David Schwartz, chief executive officer at Ripple, recently fell victim to a "sophisticated" phishing scam, according to his recent social media post. Schwartz claims the scam involved opening a support case with Apple. The fraudsters then leveraged real Apple emails and web pages in their SMS messages. The SMS messages were sent to the Ripple executive in order to trick him into giving control over his Apple ID. They were likely able to open a support case with just his email address. "Presumably, Apple wouldn't have given them access. What's clever is using the (real) case to make their (fake) SMS messages convincing," he said.cardThe bad actors somehow managed to obtain Schwartz's email address and phone number. "I'm now sure exactly how they got that, but they're not great secrets," he added. However, Schwartz was not tricked by scammers because their SMS messages had "terrible grammar."Ripple teams up with Facebook to fight scams The latest incident coincided with Ripple launching a new anti-scam initiative in collaboration with tech giant Meta and various cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase. "There’s one thing all of us in tech can agree on – it’s high time we dismantled the scammers once and for all," Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in his social media post.

Is Bitcoin at risk from Ethereum ETFs? Peter Schiff explains - AMBCrypto



Schiff’s remarks come amid Bitcoin’s brief move above $70k.
Bitcoin spot ETFs attract significant institutional investment despite the concerns.

As the world awaits the approval of an Ethereum [ETH] spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), prominent Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has taken the opportunity to attack Bitcoin [BTC]. 
Schiff sees an upcoming bearish trend for BTC 
In a 21st May post on X (formerly Twitter), Schiff suggested that Bitcoin could become bearish if the Ethereum spot ETF is approved. He said, 
“#Bitcoin gained renewed strength from rumors that an #Ethereum ETF will likely be approved. But any money to buy new Ether ETFs will most likely come from existing Bitcoin ETFs. Investors who decided to make an allocation to #crypto won’t increase that allocation to buy Ether.”
Schiff highlighted that although the recent rumors about an Ethereum ETF approval have boosted Bitcoin’s value temporarily, things could turn out differently.
He believes that the funds for these new Ethereum ETFs will likely come from the money currently invested in existing Bitcoin ETFs.
In his view, investors who have already allocated funds to cryptocurrency are unlikely to increase their overall investment in the crypto market just to buy Ethereum ETFs. 
Instead, they might shift their investments from Bitcoin to Ethereum, which could negatively impact Bitcoin’s price.
Should you trust Schiff’s remarks? 
Needless to say, Schiff’s remarks sparked a lot of criticism, starting with Rajat Soni, a Bitcoin educator, who claimed, 
“Peter… Bitcoin’s price doesn’t go up because of Ether. Ether’s price goes up because of Bitcoin. If you don’t understand this, your opinion is irrelevant.”
However, Santiment’s latest tweet echoed Schiff’s remarks. 
“#Ethereum is seeing the most #bullish crowd sentiment since September with the #SEC likely to approve the first #ETF’s, and $ETH’s price surge. Meanwhile, #Bitcoin & #Solana sentiment is slightly #bearish.”

 Bitcoin ETFs see massive inflows 
Despite the criticism and uncertainty, Bitcoin spot ETFs have remained a favorite among institutions. On 21st May, Bitcoin ETFs experienced net inflows totaling $305.7 million.
 Leading the pack was BlackRock with an investment of $290.0 million, followed by Fidelity with $25.8 million. Bitwise and VanEck, however, saw outflows of $4.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively.

Bitcoin has experienced a significant surge, with its price climbing nearly 13% over the past week and a half to return to the $70,000 mark per BTC. This rally has prompted market analysts and traders to reassess their strategies as Bitcoin inches closer to its all-time high of $74,000. However, despite the bullish sentiment, renowned trader John Bollinger, the creator of the widely used Bollinger Bands, has expressed caution regarding the immediate future of the major cryptocurrency.Bollinger Bands are a popular indicator among traders that help identify volatility and potential price reversals by plotting standard deviations above and below a simple moving average. Recently, Bollinger noted a concerning pattern on Bitcoin’s price chart, indicating a potential pullback or consolidation period. He highlighted the appearance of a two-bar reversal at the upper Bollinger Band, which often suggests a temporary market correction.

Massive XRP Rally Expected With Federal Reserve's $6 Trillion Inflation Shift


								Could the US Federal Reserve’s potential pivot on inflation be the catalyst for a multi-trillion dollar surge in the cryptocurrency market? That’s the bullish prediction from some of Wall Street’s top analysts as they eye a seismic shift in monetary policy.

According to a new report from Forbes, the stage may be set for a remarkable resurgence in the prices of leading digital assets like Bitcoin and XRP. The key driver? An estimated $6 trillion in sidelined capital that could come flooding back into the market as the Fed eases its hawkish stance.
The Floodgates Could Open
This isn’t just a typical crypto rally. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, believes in the potential for a transformative, once-in-a-generation event. If the Fed signals that it’s successfully reined in inflation, he said people could see trillions of dollars rushing back into the market in a matter of months.


Lee’s bullish outlook is centered around the notion that the Fed will soon declare victory in its battle against soaring prices. The recent deceleration in the US consumer price index, with a 0.3% increase in April versus 0.4% in March, suggests the central bank’s aggressive rate hike campaign may be bearing fruit.
Should that prove to be the case, Lee believes it could ignite a frenzy of investment activity, with Bitcoin potentially surging to $150,000 – more than double its current price of around $71,000. And if history is any guide, other cryptocurrencies like XRP could follow a similar trajectory.
XRP is currently trading at 0.53. Chart: TradingView
Crypto ETFs Provide Institutional Tailwind
Bolstering this bullish case is the recent wave of crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals, which have opened the door for mainstream investors to gain exposure to digital assets. Since January, a number of high-profile Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have launched, providing a crucial on-ramp for institutional capital.
XRP Poised For Resurgence?
All eyes will be on XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which has struggled to regain its former highs after a protracted legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
However, if the broader crypto market does indeed embark on a parabolic rally fueled by that $6 trillion in dormant capital, analysts believe XRP could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Some are even speculating that the token could soar past the $1 mark – and potentially reach even loftier heights – if Bitcoin achieves Lee’s $150,000 target.

XRP has been in the doldrums for a while now, but that could all change in a heartbeat if this predicted crypto boom materializes. With the SEC issue seemingly resolved, XRP is poised for a major resurgence, and we could see it reclaim its former glory as one of the market’s top-performing assets.

Shiba Inu has shown us that it has the potential to break through after the 10% surge and a move above the 50 EMA threshold. However, despite the recovery, numerous data points show that it is not enough, especially as we see no continuation at the current point in time.The recent price chart indicates that while SHIB managed to surge past the 50 EMA, it struggled to maintain momentum. The volume spikes accompanying the price surge were notable, suggesting increased trading activity. However, these spikes did not sustain, reflecting a lack of consistent buying pressure necessary for a sustained breakout.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn-chain signals present a mixed picture. Net network growth and the percentage of addresses in profit ("In the Money") are both showing bullish trends, indicating some positive sentiment and network activity. However, the concentration metric is slightly bearish, suggesting that the asset might still be under the influence of a few large holders, which could lead to price manipulation or sudden sell-offs.Exchange signals offer a slightly more optimistic view. The smart price metric and bid-ask volume imbalance both lean bullish, indicating that on-exchange trading activity is currently favorable. The bid-ask volume imbalance, in particular, shows a significant 6.69% bullish tilt, which could imply a strong demand at current price levels.Despite these positive indicators, the lack of follow-through in price action and the bearish concentration signal highlight the challenges SHIB faces. For a more decisive bullish breakout, SHIB would need to overcome the 200 EMA resistance and attract sustained buying interest. Broader market conditions will also play a crucial role in determining whether SHIB can capitalize on its recent momentum.

Bitcoin Holders Resume Buying After Market Sell-Off


The basic laws of supply and demand determine the price action of any asset, including Bitcoin. When supply exceeds demand, the asset’s price tends to decline. Conversely, when demand outstrips supply, the price usually rises. 
These same principles apply to cryptocurrencies, and on-chain metrics can provide valuable insights into Bitcoin holders’ behavior.
The Impact of Heightened Profit-Taking
When analyzing a Bitcoin bull market over the long term, the price movement typically exhibits significant upward volatility, mixed with periods of corrections and consolidation. Most investors know that financial markets do not consistently rise, leading to a dynamic interplay between supply and demand, resulting in periodic corrections.
This trend is evident when observing Bitcoin’s Realized Cap and Realized Profits.

Realized Cap: This adds up the value of all BTC based on the price when they were last moved, giving a clearer picture of the money truly invested in Bitcoin.
Realized Profits: This refers to the actual gains that BTC holders have made when they sell their Bitcoin for more than they paid.

As Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of over $73,000 in mid-March, its Realized Cap also increased, suggesting that most long-term holders were profitable. Consequently, some exited their positions, resulting in a significant spike in Realized Profits.

The rising supply of BTC on the market surpassed the demand levels, leading to a corrective phase that saw the price of Bitcoin dip below $57,000. This drop brought Bitcoin below its Short-Term Holder Realized Price, creating a sense of fear in the market, given that short-term holders are more prone to sell based on price volatility.


Realized Price: The average price at which all BTC were last bought. It is like finding out the average cost everyone paid for their BTC.
Short-Term Holder Realized Price: The average price investors paid for BTC that they have moved around in the last 155 days. These BTC are the ones most likely to be spent or sold soon.
Long-Term Holder Realized Price: The average price investors paid for BTC that they have not moved in over 155 days. These BTC are the least likely to be spent or sold soon.

The Short-Term Holder Realized Price, which currently stands at $60,500, served as an accumulation point despite investors’ fears. Indeed, long-term holders felt comfortable adding more BTC to their positions at this level after realizing profits in March.

Bitcoin Supply-Demand Trends Shift
Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holder Net Position Change provides a glimpse into this behavior. After undergoing a prolonged distribution period, long-term holders have begun accumulating again, having amassed more than 70,000 BTC since early May.

Long-Term Holder Net Position Change: It shows how the amount of Bitcoin held by long-term investors increases or decreases over time.

Based on the simple laws of supply and demand, as demand for Bitcoin begins to outstrip the available supply of BTC in the market, the odds of Bitcoin resuming its upward trajectory improve.

Observing Bitcoin’s Balance on Exchanges can corroborate these supply and demand dynamics.

Balance on Exchanges: This refers to the total amount of Bitcoin held in cryptocurrency exchange wallets.


Since early May, more than 30,000 BTC have moved to private cryptocurrency wallets for long-term holding, showing confidence among holders in Bitcoin’s future value.

While assessing the future price action of any asset can be challenging, multiple on-chain metrics can hint at potential price points investors should pay attention to. One of these metrics is the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, which determines whether the price of Bitcoin is unusually high or low based on its historical averages.

MVRV: It stands for Market Value to Realized Value. Market Value is the current price of Bitcoin times the number of BTC in circulation, while Realized Value is the average price at which all BTC were last bought.
Pricing Bands: These bands show the upper and lower limits of Bitcoin’s price based on its historical MVRV values to help identify when Bitcoin is either extremely overvalued or undervalued based on historical price data.

Bitcoin recently moved back above the +0.5σ pricing band, which currently stands at $64,600. Historically, such an upswing has led Bitcoin to test the 1.0σ pricing band supported by rising demand. This pricing band is currently hovering around $77,000.

Summary and Conclusions
The basic laws of supply and demand dictate Bitcoin’s price movements. Indeed, prices fall when supply exceeds demand and rise when demand exceeds supply. On-chain metrics offer valuable insights into these dynamics, allowing analysts to understand Bitcoin holders’ behavior.
Recent data reveals a price decline below $57,000 as supply increased. However, long-term holders have demonstrated confidence by accumulating over 70,000 BTC since early May. This trend suggests resilience in the market despite short-term volatility.

Key metrics like Realized Cap and Realized Profits illustrate that many long-term holders were profitable at Bitcoin’s recent all-time high, leading to a wave of selling and subsequent price corrections. However, the accumulation by long-term holders at lower prices indicates a positive outlook for Bitcoin’s future value.

Overall, these on-chain metrics help identify shifts in supply and demand, providing a framework to understand Bitcoin’s price action and investor behavior and indicating potential upward trends as demand begins to outstrip supply.

Donald Trump Accepts Crypto Donations Via Coinbase Commerce Product


							

Trump champions cryptocurrency, promising to build a “crypto army” and criticizing Biden’s stance on digital assets.



Trump targets Senator Elizabeth Warren’s anti-crypto efforts, highlighting a Democratic crackdown on cryptocurrencies.



The campaign criticizes President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren for their efforts to form an anti-crypto army.  




Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for the 2024 US Presidential Election, has promised to build a “crypto army” and announced the acceptance of cryptocurrency donations. During his presidential campaign event on Tuesday, Trump declared his support for cryptocurrency, criticizing President Joe Biden’s alleged “socialist government control” over digital assets



Previously, Trump emphasized the urgency of introducing a convenient and comprehensive regulatory framework. In addition, he questioned Biden and his administration’s anti-crypto stance. Trump asserted that Biden opposes crypto assets without understanding them.



In his recent campaign, Trump criticized US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a notable crypto critic, referring to her effort to build an “anti-crypto army.” By highlighting Warren and Biden in the same context, Trump pointed out the Democrats’ combat against cryptocurrencies. He stated, “Biden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‘anti-crypto army’ to restrict Americans’ right to make their own financial choices.”



The Trump campaign’s crypto donations enable the candidate’s followers to donate any cryptocurrencies through the Coinbase Commerce product. Coinbase spokeswoman Julia Krieger commented,




 “Crypto is nonpartisan and moves money forward because its cheaper and faster. The Coinbase platform is open to all candidates this election season.” 




The campaign added that the limit in contribution and other requirements will be per the regulations of the Federal Election Commission. Denouncing Biden’s anti-crypto army, the campaign cited, “MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!” 









With the Trump campaign’s announcement to accept crypto donations, Donald Trump has become the “first major party nominee” to embrace crypto donations. Meanwhile, Biden warned his supporters, stating, “Cryptocurrency executives and oil barons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump.”

Bitcoin buy calls surge: Here's what it means for your portfolio - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin has seen a rally in buy calls on social media.
However, the coin remains at risk of a correction in the short term.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] social activity has seen a significant uptick as the cryptocurrency market anticipates the approval of the spot Ethereum [ETH] Exchange-Traded Fund [ETF].
In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Santiment noted that the surging social media discussions about the leading cryptocurrency asset have been mostly positive, with the market making more buy calls than sell calls.
When an asset sees a surge in buy calls among its traders on social media, they are expressing positive sentiment about the asset’s continued price growth. Some traders even consider it a good entry point, perceiving prices as low and due for an upswing. 
BTC holders must look before the leap
While this may offer a good entry opportunity for some, “paper hands” have been known to sell when an asset’s social activity increases like this.
This is because the surge in BTC buy calls among its traders is often due to speculation and not backed by a corresponding demand for the coin. Therefore, newer investors who need more conviction in the coin’s long-term potential might be hesitant to hold during these periods even with positive social sentiment.
Also, short-term traders often see the surge in buy calls as an opportunity to profit. Hence, a temporary sell-off is possible even amidst overall bullish sentiment.
Moreover, BTC’s Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio returned a high value of 153.19% at press time. The metric tracks the ratio between the coin’s current market price and the average price of each acquired token. 
Source: Santiment
When it surges in this manner, the asset is said to be overvalued, and on average, coin holders are sitting on profits. This may lead to a spike in selling pressure as investors are more likely to take profits when the potential return is high.
The rise in BTC’s funding rates also heightens the likelihood of a short-term correction in its price. On 21st May, the coin’s funding rate across cryptocurrency exchanges was 0.018%, its highest level in a month, according to Coinglass’ data.

Generally, when an asset’s futures funding rate rallies, it is a bullish signal, suggesting a strong demand for long positions. 
However, when it gets too high and becomes unsustainable, it may result in forced selling by leveraged long positions. This may trigger price swings and result in unexpected price drops.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Declares 'Corruption Era' Amid New Evidence


								Pro-XRP lawyer and Republican Party candidate for the Senate Massachusetts, John E. Deaton voiced severe criticisms of what he described as pervasive corruption within federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve (Fed). Deaton, through a post on social media platform X, outlined a grim view of institutional integrity in the United States, coining it the “THE CORRUPTION ERA.”
Why The Pro-XRP Lawyer Is Outraged
“As I’ve said multiple times, we are living through a period of time history books will later describe as: ‘THE CORRUPTION ERA,'” Deaton asserted. He expressed particular disdain for the ‘revolving door’ practice, where federal regulators move into high positions within industries they previously supervised. “The revolving door existing within these agencies must be closed once and for all,” the lawyer who represented 75,000 XRP holders in the Ripple vs. SEC case emphasized.
Deaton announced his intent to propose and support legislation that would enforce a five-year ban preventing federal regulators from transitioning directly into the industries they once regulated. “A person should not be able to leave the FDA and then immediately go work for Pfizer,” Deaton explained, highlighting the urgent need for such reforms to dismantle the entrenched networks of influence and self-interest within government bodies.

The conversation around these concerns stemmed from a statement from Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank. Today, Long expressed shock over perceived preferential treatment by the Federal Reserve towards another institution, only weeks after a federal judge has rejected Custodia Bank’s application for a Fed master account and membership with the Fed.
Her outrage followed the surprising approval of a master account to Numisma, a Connecticut-based fintech bank formerly known as Currency Reserve, which is notably not FDIC-insured nor federally regulated.
“I AM SPEECHLESS. Is this what it appears to be — special treatment by the Fed for another former insider, just weeks after the Fed’s Inspector General ‘suspended’ its investigation into the Fed’s master account practices?” Long questioned publicly via X. She highlighted the inconsistency of the Fed’s stance in the Custodia Bank case, where it previously described such regulatory structures as unsafe and unsound.
“The Fed’s Custodia denial order went into excruciating detail about why these issues are not curable, but suddenly a bank with the same regulatory structure got a pass by the Fed — and an ex-Fed governor is involved? What the ….,” she stated.

FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared the scoop: “Connecticut-based fintech bank Numisma (formerly named Currency Reserve) has received conditional approval for access to a Federal Reserve master account, making it the second non-FDIC-insured, non-federally regulated bank to receive one in recent years.”
Terrett pointed out that both banks granted such approval had direct connections to former Federal Reserve officials, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest and the integrity of the approval process.
The denial of a master account to Custodia Bank is a significant setback for the crypto industry, which sees such access as vital to integrating more seamlessly into the broader US financial system. This access would enable crypto-focused banks like Custodia to offer more efficient, potentially less costly banking services by connecting directly to the Federal Reserve’s payment systems.
This ongoing situation casts a shadow over the crypto industry and further hints at an “Operation Choke Point 2.0”, an initiative by the Biden administration to stifle the crypto sector.
At press time, XRP traded $0.53351.

RNDR Token Meets Resistance as It Tries to Reclaim All-Time High


Render (RNDR) is poised to break above the upper line of an ascending triangle in continuation of its most recent uptrend.
Logging a 10% price hike in the last two days, the bulls can push above this resistance level if the current general market trend is sustained. 
Render May Face Some Difficulties 
Render’s double-digit price rally in the past 24 hours may witness a pullback as some of the token key indicators showed that bearish influence remains dominant.

At press time, the dots that make up RNDR’s Parabolic SAR indicator exceed its price. This indicator identifies potential trend direction and reversals in the token’s price.
Render Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
When its dots are above an asset’s price, the market is said to be in decline. This indicates that the asset’s price has been falling and may continue to do so. Market participants interpret this as a sign to exit long positions and open short positions.
Also, the value of RNDR’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was -0.01 at the time of writing. This indicator measures money flow into and out of the RNDR market.

A bearish signal, indicating a weakening uptrend or a developing downtrend, appears when its value falls below zero
RNDR Price Prediction: Negative Sentiments Meet High MVRV Ratio
The poor sentiment currently trails RNDR is depicted in its negative weighted sentiment spotted on-chain. Subsequently, at -0.29 at press time, this metric shows a dominant negative bias in the online discourse surrounding the asset.
Render Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment
This negative sentiment comes at a time when the token’s Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio is high. As of this writing, this was 231.78%

A high MVRV ratio already suggests a potential correction if the price becomes unsustainable. Therefore, a negative sentiment reinforces this concern, highlighting potential selling pressure that could drive the price down.
Conversely, if selling pressure gains momentum, the token may find it impossible to break above the upper line of the ascending triangle and fall toward $9.8.

However, if this bearish projection is overturned, the token’s price may exceed $12.

Guru Network X AMA Session With BeInCrypto


We are thrilled to announce an exclusive AMA session with Evgeny Vahteev, the CTO of Guru Network, hosted by BeInCrypto. Join us as we dive deep into the evolution of DexGuru, from its origins as a DeFi trading terminal to its current transformation into the Guru Network, a comprehensive AI-driven platform. 
Evgeny will share insights on the vision behind Guru Network, the innovative technology stack powering it, and how it seamlessly integrates trading and analytics for a superior user experience!
AMA Session with Evgeny Vahteev from Guru Network
BeInCrypto: We’re excited about our upcoming AMA session! Today, we’re thrilled to welcome a special guest — the CTO of Guru Network 🔥😏
🗣 COMMUNITY I’ll ask some questions for Evgeny Vahteev (@evahteev). After that, he will answer the 3 most interesting questions from you (quick reminder: we collected these questions in advance!) 🔥
These 3 lucky Community members will get $20 💸
What was the primary vision behind creating dex.guru, and how has that vision evolved since its inception?
Evgeny: That’s a great question, especially given our recent transition to Guru Network. Many people remember us from the Dex Guru Trading Terminal days and wonder why we’ve shifted to a network model, what orchestration involves, and why AI plays a role in it.
We started as DeFi trading terminal providing a unified platform that merges real-time trading with in-depth analytics, and DeFi trading experience by offering both elements in a single, accessible interface.
That was a new concept back then when BNB was just Launched and Poligon was just getting steam. We went through the whole DeFi summer with terminal, got VC funded, and then UST,FTX and winter came, so plans for TGE were postponed, and retail volume dried out mostly we switched to B2B products lineup coming from the same backend.

Here’s our trading terminal with traders categorization and analytics.
We initially developed a block explorer and then began offering it to various blockchain networks.
The first one was Canto, and then on 18 chains. 
We began by offering B2B products to various blockchain networks and soon realized the need to enhance our offerings. This led to the development of the Guru Data Warehouse, expanding our suite of tools to better serve our clients.


At some point, we recognized that our real strength was not merely in providing a data analytics toolset but in offering a comprehensive developer’s toolkit tailored for the builders’ community. This realization led to the transformation of Guru Data Warehouse into a full-fledged development platform, which eventually evolved into what is now the Guru Network and Flow.
And that path got us all the way to the Guru Multi Chain AI Orchestration layer we are launching in following weeks.
BIC: Please give us an overview of the technology stack that powers dex.guru.
Evgeny: We started at times there were no reliable RPC providers at the market. That’s why our technology stack starts from nodes we run ourselves for all the chains we support(https://mirror.xyz/evahteev.eth/POoVA0GiX9XcaQXGwQekS7o57pWwKARYzEW4uofwX2E), then we have ETL Pipeline inherited from open-source ethereum ETL(python)  extensively developed towards DeFI needs(Prices, Pools, Dexes, Balances etc). Clickhouse DB is a core Storage of Data Warehouse, Next.js, and react applications.
BIC: Dex.guru combines trading and analytics on one platform. Can you explain how this integration benefits users compared to using separate platforms for trading and analytics?
Evgeny: That’s the concept we started with at DexGuru, where multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXes) were presented alongside trading options across them. Users appreciated the feeling of control and the ability to conduct their own research (DYOR) directly on the platform.
We continued to deliver in that same user-centric manner, and now we offer a data-rich Guru Warehouse analytics suite, fully integrated and embedded within the platform.
We have a new DexGuru V2 Auto coming soon. 
BIC: What are some recent innovations or developments that you’re particularly proud of?

Evgeny: As we expanded our B2B analytics products, we began tackling not just the data-reading aspects but also the execution and orchestration side of things. This led to our first implementation of Chainflow during the ETHOnline hackathon, which further evolved into Flow and, ultimately the Guru Network. 
Chainflow served as a proof of concept for the future BBPA (Blockchain Business Process Automation) Engines, which now act as the compute layer on the Guru Network – Compute Orchestration Chain.
We then implemented data-aware AI agents in our block explorers, orchestrating them in the same manner as Chainflow. The definitions are done in BPMN standard:

Process definitions are run on Guru Network Orchestration Nodes and synchronized through Inscriptions on Guru Network as they serve as inscriptions producers and indexers at the same time and can trigger events based on messages coming from other engines.

BIC: Our usual question: How do you ensure the platform’s security and reliability, especially considering the service’s decentralized nature?
Evgeny: At Dex Guru, we rely on the security mechanisms of our vendors since we function as an aggregator of aggregators. This approach allows us to leverage established, robust security protocols across different platforms to ensure the safety and reliability of our services.
For the Guru Network, particularly regarding the Process Definitions Smart Contracts we plan to deploy, we have dedicated significant time and resources to conduct thorough security audits and reviews prior to the mainnet launch.
BIC: All that Guru Network stuff looks complicated… How can a simple user get started with it?
Evgeny: That’s a good question. We are constantly working on simplifying our platform and improving the user experience at Guru Network, as well as enhancing our documentation available at https://docs.gurunetwork.ai/. 
BIC: What trends do you foresee in the decentralized space, and how is dex.guru preparing to capitalize on these trends?
Evgeny: We see the DeFi space becoming increasingly complex for users as new financial mechanisms evolve. Recognizing users’ growing demand for Web3 Automation, we are responding by delivering DexGuru V2 Auto.


These Web3 automation functions will help our users track comprehensive trends and automate their usual actions and routines, enhancing their overall efficiency and effectiveness.
BIC: How will Guru Network’s BBPA engine (Blockchain Business Process Automation) impact the future of DeFi automation? Can you share some specific examples of how it can be used to automate DeFi tasks?
Evgeny: Yes, there are some obvious trading strategy examples visible on the screenshot I provided earlier. But, besides that We envision it as a catalog where Gurus contribute snippets for trades, exit strategies, periodic routines, and other degen activities we all love.
Users can select and deploy automation snippets from the catalog, paying an instantiation fee to the Guru who developed and published the snippet.
BIC: BTW, user experience is crucial for retaining traders and analysts. What steps has dex.guru taken to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience?
Evgeny: We are planning to launch DexGuru V2, featuring a completely new interface and automations, first for a private beta within our Guru NFT Season Pass holders community and then to the public along with Guru Network Mainnet launch.
Let screenshots speak for themselves:



Plus all the automations I’ve mentioned and posted as screenshots earlier.
BIC: What about the community? How important is its involvement in the development and growth of dex.guru? 
Evgeny: We have a vibrant community of DeFi users and Guru Season Pass NFT holders.
We are planning to launch initially within our community, offering incentives for invites to the Season 2 NFT Collection and running automations from the tGuru Faucet. 




We are tentatively planning to release it in the coming weeks, prior to the TGE and LBP events scheduled for the end of May or June at the latest.
BIC: How will the Guru Network be governed? Will there be a role for token holders in decision-making?
Evgeny: So the community would be able to boost their rewards by helping us make DexGuru V2 Auto better.
We postponed provisional governance two years ago, along with the deferral of our TGE plans at that time.
But now we’re revisiting that idea and will provide a governance framework for the Guru Network in the coming months before the mainnet launch.
BIC: What can users expect from dex.guru in the next year or two? Are there any major updates or expansions on the horizon?
Evgeny: The Guru Network launch and its ecosystem expansion around the narrative of Web3/AI Orchestration, fostering innovation and integration across technologies and user flows. You can learn more about it here.

VIDEO

Those plans are pretty much covering two-year period.
BIC: Thank you! Let’s move to the questions from the Community 😈
@MEHEDIIA
The Guru Enlightenment Network (GEN) aims to bridge AI and blockchain technologies. Can you detail how GEN facilitates the orchestration of user flows and business processes across both on-chain and off-chain environments, and what real-world applications this enables?
Evgeny: Guru Flow, a key product within the Guru Network ecosystem, orchestrates user actions, Web3 transactions, data insights, and the compute layer, incorporating prediction models as needed. Real-world applications range from our Web3 Auto POC, demonstrated at https://app.web3auto.guru/, to more complex, business-oriented projects like Pixelpact (https://pixelpact.ai/), our inaugural non-Guru Ecosystem venture. 
Pixelpact focuses on the tokenization of real-world assets, specifically artworks, which are used as the basis for creating unique NFTs. These NFTs, generated through three blending models that incorporate users’ input with original art, represent the real artwork and its value at exhibition events. By minting these NFTs, attendees support artists and engage in subsequent social finance activities available to NFT holders. Those are the basic examples that are already implemented and clickable by users.


BIC: @RenaldoDowd
For those interested in joining the Guru Network community and exploring revenue opportunities, what are the steps to get involved? Where can individuals purchase tokens and sign up to participate in the project’s ecosystem?

Evgeny: We have multiple layers of network participants within our ecosystem. Gurus who contribute to the agents and AI/Web3 automations. Ecosystem projects which are utilizing the processes from catalog and flow technology as a framework for running their full stack applications in between AI, Web2, and Web3 context and retail who is looking to automate their DeFi routines and GPT tasks with the ability to pick something that works from catalog and start getting results in minutes.
We are currently working on better documentation and guides for each guru network participants audience so it would show a clear pass for participation and earning within the ecosystem.

that’s from the litepaper. 
BIC: @Anastaciaberrios63
How does DexGuru V2 (Auto) differentiate itself from traditional analytics platforms, and what features can users expect from this closed beta release?
Evgeny: On top of our traditional feature reach trading analytics Dex Guru V2 is aiming to provide new Web3 automation features. Those automation scenarios are based on reach data, synthetic indicators, and trained AI models, and executed in a non-custodial fashion in the user’s controlled environment. That gives a completely new perspective on possible DeFi activities, eliminates human errors, and makes our lives easier. On the other side community members (Gurus) who develop and publish their scripts and agents in the catalog are incentivized by instantiation and infrastructure fees share paid by users who deploy and run them.

We did POC of automation features just recently:

VIDEO


BIC: Great, that’s it! @evahteev, thank you for being with us today 🖤 
Evgeny: I want to thank the BeInCrypto community for participation.

Bitcoin Funds Get $306 Million Boost Ahead of SEC Ethereum ETF Deadline - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsSure, the spotlight has been on spot Ethereum ETF hopefuls since Monday—but the already-trading Bitcoin ETFs have gotten a boost from the excitement.Yesterday Bitcoin ETFs saw $306 million worth of funds deposited, according to Coinglass. That's the biggest single day of inflows the category of funds have seen since earlier this month.Yesterday's distribution across the Bitcoin ETFs wasn't exactly even.BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) took in $290 million, while the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw $26 million worth of inflows. That was offset by the Bitcoin Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) seeing $4 million and $6 million worth of withdrawals, respectively.And the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw $72.5 million worth of net inflows between May 15 and May 20, was flat on Tuesday, according to Coinglass data.As an aside, the gap GBTC and IBIT has now shrunk to $736 million. That's approximately half what it was less than a month ago. It remains to be seen whether Grayscale's incoming CEO, Peter Mintzberg, will make any changes to the firm's flagship Bitcoin fund.But why would Bitcoin ETFs pump on anticipation for Ethereum counterparts? That could be because some analysts, like Standard Chartered bank, are predicting that an Ethereum ETF approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission could lead both assets—BTC and ETH—to new all-time highs.The global market cap got close to matching that in mid-March, when the Bitcoin price was on a tear and set its currently all-time high of $73,737.94.For Ethereum, that means chasing a price of $4,878.26—which it last saw on November 10, 2021. That's around the time that prices were booming and the global crypto market capitalization inched past $3 trillion for the first time ever.And there are plenty of traders turning to derivatives in hopes it'll do just that. In the past day, Ethereum open interest has surged by 30% to an all-time high of $11 billion, according to Kaiko.As of this morning, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation now includes the VanEck Ethereum ETF on its active and pre-launch list. Hard to say whether that's a sign of an imminent approval, though.Tickers for Bitcoin ETFs appeared and then disappeared on the clearing house and settlement company's list all the way back in October, which was months before the SEC approved any for trading.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Popular Project Banned from Hong Kong! Detected to Violate the Confidentiality of Personal Data! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The Office of the Personal Data Privacy Commissioner (PCPD) has completed its investigation into the Worldcoin project, finding that its activities in Hong Kong violated the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO).
Hong Kong Privacy Commission Orders Worldcoin to Stop Iris Scanning Operations
Privacy Commissioner Ms. Lillian Chung issued an enforcement notice requiring Worldcoin to stop using iris scanning devices to collect iris and facial images from the public.


The investigation revealed that Worldcoin violated various Data Protection Principles regarding the collection, storage, transparency, access and correction of personal data under the KVKK.
In particular, the collection of face and iris images was considered unnecessary and excessive. PCPD criticized Worldcoin's policy of storing personal data for up to 10 years to train artificial intelligence models used in identity verification processes, finding it excessive and unjustified.





Additionally, PCPD found that Worldcoin did not adequately inform participants about the purpose of data collection, their rights, and the means to access and correct their personal data as required by law.
The “Privacy Notice” and Consent Form for Biometric Data provided by Worldcoin did not have a Chinese version, and staff at collection sites did not explain or confirm that participants understood these documents.



PCPD conducted multiple visits to six Worldcoin locations in Hong Kong between December last year and January this year, including a court-ordered investigation in late January.
The investigation found that participants in the Worldcoin program were required to consent to the collection of facial and iris images through iris scanning to verify human identities and generate iris codes.





This verification process was a prerequisite for receiving a registered identity and free virtual currency known as “Worldcoin”.
Worldcoin confirmed that the faces and irises of a total of 8,302 people were scanned during its operation in Hong Kong.
This decision highlights the importance of complying with data protection laws and ensuring transparency and fairness in the collection and use of personal data.

BlackRock's Dominance in Bitcoin ETFs Drives Market to New Highs


							

Spot Bitcoin ETF recorded $306 million in net inflow on Tuesday, May 21.



BlackRock’s IBIT accounted for $290 million of the total Bitcoin ETF inflow of May 21.



BTC surged 17% amid seven days of consecutive net ETF inflows.




The spot Bitcoin ETF market continued its strong performance with $306 million net inflow on Tuesday, May 21. With this milestone, the spot Bitcoin ETF achieved a consecutive net Outflow for seven days and a day when Grayscale’s GBTC recorded a $0.00 net inflow.







Meanwhile, the BlackRock IBIT maintained its impressive performance by ranking as the highest in net inflow. IBIT’s net inflow for Tuesday was $290 million, representing about 95% of the total daily net inflow in the spot Bitcoin ETF market.



Tuesday’s influx of investment into spot Bitcoin ETFs boosted the total net assets value across all the listed products by 4.29%. Consequently, the spot Bitcoin ETF total net assets after Tuesday’s inflow reached $58.91 billion, according to data from Soso Value, a financial research platform for crypto investors.



It is worth noting that the consecutive spot Bitcoin ETF inflow significantly affected Bitcoin’s price. The flagship cryptocurrency surged impressively during this period, pushing closer to the all-time high (ATH) established about two months ago.



Bitcoin started rallying on May 17, recording a daily profit of over 7.5% for the first time in nearly two months. The top cryptocurrency broke above significant resistance around $67,200, surpassing $70,000 for the first time in May.









TradingView data shows Bitcoin gained over 17% in the last seven days, with the bullish momentum intact. The latest rally launched the top crypto back into the bullish range and closer to the current ATH. Several crypto analysts believe a sustained net inflow rate would inject more bullish momentum into Bitcoin’s uptrend that could see BTC reach a new ATH soon.



Bitcoin traded for $69,826 at the time of writing, following a slight pullback from Tuesday’s $71,958 high. As Bitcoin edges closer to its all-time high, the sustained inflow into ETFs, driven by products like BlackRock’s IBIT, underscores a burgeoning confidence in cryptocurrency investments. With market momentum showing no signs of waning, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can sustain its bullish trajectory and possibly set new records.

Is China’s Bitcoin mining ban the worst decision this century?


    Though the process has been ongoing for a relatively long time – and even the most outspoken opponents of the crypto market have been getting involved, including during the ‘crypto winter’ – 2024 has been the year of institutional cryptocurrency adoption.



The trend has been most evident and extensive with regard to Bitcoin (BTC), particularly since the approval of the U.S.’ first-ever spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Indeed, these financial instruments have seen significant institutional interest in recent months, with investors of all stripes joining the action.







One country that has excluded itself from both the trend and its fruits – and which has, arguably, made it difficult for itself to catch up – is China.



In 2021, the government of the People’s Republic banned BTC mining within its borders, which—though it has failed to fully eliminate such activity—has significantly damaged the once-booming sector.



The ban quickly gutted the Chinese Bitcoin mining sector, which—after already declining in global market share between 2019 and 2021—fell to 0% at one point in 2021, per the data made available through the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI).



Though the figure rose somewhat with activity in China – mostly considered to consist of underground operations – standing close to 21%, it still marks a substantial drop from the final pre-ban mining market share of 46%.



China unlikely to be able to catch up



Finally, even if the Chinese government assesses in 2024 that its decision was a mistake given the recent mainstream legitimization of Bitcoin, it would likely have a hard time attempting to regain ground.



One of the biggest reasons behind the likely issues is the latest BTC halving that took place in April 2024. The event made it twice as difficult to obtain the coin, with JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) recently revising the estimated cost of mining a single Bitcoin to $45,000.



The concerns associated with the increased mining difficulty are perhaps most evident in the stock prices of major BTC miners – such as Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) – which have declined since the start of the year despite the crypto market undergoing a large and broad rally.



Nonetheless, with Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs (ATH) in general in March, and, when denominated in yuan, in February, and with other important metrics such as the hashrate also being at their ATH, it is possible China will seek to reverse the ban.



Why China may not regard the ban as a mistake



Ultimately, while it is possible that the recent trends could force the Chinese government to reevaluate its ban, it is far from guaranteed, given that some of the primary stated reasons behind the decision are largely still relevant.



Though Bitcoin has been trading with relatively little volatility in recent years – at least by crypto market standards – it is doubtful whether the stability has already proven enough to negate the original argument of preserving financial stability.



Indeed, China expressed its concerns that Bitcoin might collapse to $0 as recently as 2022 – shortly after the ‘crypto winter’ started in May of the same year.



Similarly, though China has been working on increasing its reliance on green energy, the supply share has risen by only about 2% from 27.73% in 2021 to 29.14% in 2023, meaning that it is doubtful much has changed regarding the environmental argument.



Finally, the last major reason for the ban—concerns over capital flight—has arguably only increased given the global economy’s increased exposure to crypto markets and the higher rates of cryptocurrency adoption.



On the other hand, there have been some developments in China that hint toward a mode dovish stance on crypto, such as a conference in Nanjing that took place in late April and that saw a number of scholars agree on the need to afford digital assets a more concrete legal status in the country.

Trump Reportedly Made Over A Million In Recent Crypto Rally As Ex-President's Investments In Ethereum And Memecoin MAGA Continue To Surge - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump's cryptocurrency holdings have sparked widespread media interest and investigation in recent months. The firebrand leader, who has strongly marketed his pro-crypto stance in the ongoing election campaign, profited handsomely from the market's recent rally. What Happened: Trump's crypto portfolio was worth $8.65 million at the time of publication, according to data from Arkham Intelligence.The largest holding in his portfolio was Maga Coin TRUMP/USD, a memecoin inspired by the "Make America Great Again" political movement. The crypto rose 9% in the rally this week, pushing his total investments to $4.81 million, an increase of $520,000.The second-largest holding was Ethereum ETH/USD, followed by Wrapped Ether WETH/USD. Combined, Trump had nearly 815 ETH and WETH, worth more than $3 million at the time of writing.  ETH witnessed a 21% surge this week on higher expectations of spot Ether ETF approval, meaning that the rally added more than 500,000 to his ETH-WETH portfolio.  Overall, Trump's crypto portfolio gained more than a million in the rally, indicating a 13% increase. Why It Matters: Donald Trump is one of the biggest celebrity cryptocurrency owners, with one prior Arkham report revealing him to be at the top of the list in terms of crypto holdings of X celebrities with over a million followers.Coins such as ETH and WETH have been gained from the sale of NFT products featuring his name and likeness, while the project designers delivered the memecoin TRUMP to his address as a token of gratitude.The Republican challenger has looked to counter his arch-rival, President Joe Biden on the subject of cryptocurrencies and regulations. He also started accepting cryptocurrency for official campaign donations. Read Next: Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!

Bitcoin Price (BTC-USDT) Analysis for 22 May 2024: Key Support and Resistance Levels Explained by Macro Trader | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 22 May 2024, a detailed analysis of Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price action was shared by pseudonymous analyst Bitmidas on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). This analysis provided an in-depth look at the market dynamics, offering valuable insights into the current and future state of BTC’s performance.







The analysis began by noting a divergence between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on the previous day. While ETH managed to stabilize, BTC struggled, adjusting towards $69,413.07 and eventually bottoming at $69,162.94. It was highlighted that today’s support level is shifting to $69,031.98, and despite the oscillations, the overall trend remains bullish.



There was a significant net outflow of $16.81 billion the previous day. Although the price drop was modest, the high price and trading volume meant that outflows nearly matched the prior day’s inflows. BTC attempted to stabilize but failed to follow ETH’s performance, breaking below $70,495.27 and adjusting towards $69,413.07.



Despite the failed stabilization attempt, BTC is still within a bullish oscillation. The key support zone for the day is identified as $69,031.98 to $68,544.98, with the price likely to oscillate between this zone and $71,016.08. If BTC can maintain the level of $70,495.27 for 4-8 hours, it could potentially target $71,016.08. Breaking this minor resistance might lead to higher targets of $72,860.67 to $73,320.85. However, multiple dips below the support zone of $69,031.98 to $68,544.98 could shift the trend to a bearish oscillation.



Additional data on capital flow shows that the support range is between $68,544.98 and $65,844.59. The daily sentiment remains predominantly bullish at 90%, with a slight 10% bearish outlook. The long/short ratio stands at 1.19, indicating a slight advantage for long positions. Funding rates range from 0.01% to 0.0213%, reflecting a strong but slightly receding bullish sentiment. The total contracts in the market amount to $350.9 billion, a 0.92% increase, and the greed index is at 76, suggesting a high level of market optimism. The turnover rate is at 25%, indicative of active trading.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The analysis continued by discussing the minor adjustments due to BTC’s failed stabilization. Early data showed a slight tug-of-war between bulls and bears, with bulls attempting to reclaim stabilization points and bears pushing towards the capital flow support levels. The increased oscillation suggests traders should exercise caution.



Despite the recent volatility, BTC remains in a long-term bullish trend. There are no immediate low-entry opportunities, and ongoing observation of macroeconomic data is essential. The long-term strategy still favors buying on dips, reinforcing a cautiously optimistic outlook.



Finally, the broader economic environment was considered. Several Federal Reserve officials made cautious statements, indicating that they are closely monitoring monthly data. They hinted at potential rate cuts in the fourth quarter of 2024, which could have significant implications for the crypto market.







While technical analysis can provide valuable insights into market trends and potential price movements, it does not guarantee future performance. Market conditions can change rapidly due to various factors, including economic events and investor sentiment. Traders should use technical analysis as one of many tools in their decision-making process and remain aware of the inherent risks involved in cryptocurrency trading. Always consider your own risk tolerance and financial situation before making investment decisions.

                            US Prosecutors Seek 5-7 Years for Former FTX Executive Ryan Salame

                        The U.S. prosecutors are pushing for a prison sentence of five to seven years for the former FTX executive Ryan Salame.According to a sentencing memorandum, the attorneys of the Southern District of New York have argued for an extended imprisonment term, citing the seriousness and the general deterrence in imposing sentence.Former FTX Executive’s Crimes of Seriousness
The document stated that Salame was first the head of the Settlements Team at Alameda and then CEO of FTX Digital Markets from 2019 to 2022, during which he assisted Samuel Bankman-Fried in “perpetrating aspects of the interrelated frauds.”The attorneys elaborated that Salame was found guilty for “unlicensed money transmission and false statements to banks” and “unlawful political contributions through Alameda.”“For instance, he was relied upon to integrate FTX into the Bahamas (Def. Mem. at 9), and he spoke to Caroline Ellison about ways to retrieve funds from cryptocurrency exchanges in China that had frozen Alameda accounts (Tr. 830),” the memo reads.The memo also included the recommended sentence of 120 months’ imprisonment by the Probation Office, considering serious offense conduct, the large amounts of money involved, and the need for general deterrence.“In light of the defendant’s serious crimes, which were designed to undermine the integrity of the U.S. campaign finance system and the U.S. financial system, a substantial term of incarceration, well above the 18 months’ he requests, is required,” the memo reads.Salame Requests 18 Months or Less
The lawyers of the defendant submitted the sentencing memo on May 14, urging a prison time no longer than 18 months.“Such a sentence would satisfy the purposes of sentencing … while allowing Ryan to have the opportunity to continue contributing positively toward society,” the defendant’s sentencing memo reads.Salame’s attorneys argued that he did not play a central role in the fraudulent activities and lost a significant portion of his personal fortune with the collapse of FTX. The sentencing is scheduled for May 28

Economist Henrik Zeberg Issues Dire Warning, Says Fed Cannot Stop Major Recession at End of 2024 - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed economist is warning that a major economic event last witnessed almost a century ago will likely rear its ugly head in 2025.
Henrik Zeberg tells his 140,700 followers on the social media platform X that he sees risk-on assets such as stocks and crypto going higher and higher for the next few months.










However, the economist predicts that the bullish conditions will abruptly subside toward the end of the year, just as market participants become extremely exuberant.
“You may not like it. You may not understand it.
But the bull market has an end date – this year! A blow-off top!
First US markets will explode higher. Crypto and small caps will soar as we see a rotation from large caps and foreign markets (outside the US).
Everybody will become euphoric and once again trust that the Fed will have our backs.
But a major recession will set in at the end of the year.” 
According to Zeberg, the Fed will try to support the economy by printing money to stimulate growth. But he says the Fed’s actions will only delay an economic collapse that will eventually give rise to stagflation – a period of slow economic growth with climbing unemployment and high inflation.
“Fed will intervene – yes – but will only create a bounce in markets, as they enter with monetary stimulus when recession and deflation stare them in the eyes.
They will offset stagflation! 
Consequence: largest recession and bear market since 1929 in two stages. First deflation, then bounce, later stagflation.”
In January 2023, Zeberg predicted that the stock market would reach record highs before witnessing a sudden crash. At the time, the S&P 500 was trading at around 4,000 points and Bitcoin was worth close to $20,000.
At time of writing, the S&P 500 is hovering at 5,321 points and BTC is trading at $70,150.

Crypto Market Eyes Ether ETF Approval: Lubin Cautions on Supply Constraints


							

Joe Lubin warns of a potential Ether shortage with the launch of the Spot Ether ETF, raising supply concerns.



Bloomberg analysts increase Ether ETF approval odds to 75%, signaling a significant shift in market sentiment.



ETH sees a substantial surge, trading at $3,757 with 27% of the supply staked, highlighting growing market interest.




Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin has warned of a potential scarcity in the Ether (ETH) supply following the launch of the Spot Ether ETF. While anticipation of the ETF launch grows, Lubin asserted that the “floodgate” of ETH demand might lead to a significant shortage in supply.



Though the community was initially pessimistic about the SEC’s decision on Ether ETFs, reports suggest a potential approval of nine Ether ETF issuers’ applications this week. Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds of Ether ETF approval from 25% to 75%.







Reflecting on the positive development in the industry, Lubin highlighted a potential increase in the demand for Ether and Ether ETFs, noting that Spot Bitcoin ETF investors may “likely want to diversify into that second approved ETF.”



Lubin asserted, “There’s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether.” However, he added that Ether will be insufficient at the time to satisfy the demand.









Comparing the Bitcoin ETF launch and Bitcoin’s supply at the time with the Ether ETF and ETH supply, Lubin argued that the ETH tokens available will be much fewer than Bitcoin. Providing further insights, Lubin pointed out, “Much of the Ether is put to work in the core protocol, DeFi systems, or in DAOs.” His arguments highlight that a significant portion of ETH supply will be unavailable for ETF consumption.



As of press time, ETH is exchanging hands at $3,757, marking a daily increase of 3.2%. Over the past 7 days, ETH has seen a substantial surge of nearly 30% and 16% surge over the last 30 days. While Ether holds a total supply of 120,128,511 ETH, according to onchain data, 27% of the supply is staked across the Ethereum network.

Uniswap Responses to SEC: Crypto Tokens Are Not Securities


Uniswap Labs, the leading developer of the decentralized trading platform on Ethereum, asserted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) potential enforcement action against it lacks merit. 
According to the New York-based startup, crypto tokens should not be classified as securities. Instead, they are files similar to PDFs.
Why Crypto Tokens Are Not Securities

On Tuesday, Uniswap Labs contested the allegations that it operates an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer. This response follows a Wells notice served by the SEC’s Enforcement Division last month, indicating plans to recommend legal action against the company.
Marvin Ammori, Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs, spoke at a press conference, emphasizing the SEC’s flawed assumption that all tokens are securities. Uniswap Labs also argues that now, the SEC risks an adverse decision that could limit its authority over crypto tokens.

“Tokens are, in fact, simply a file format. They are a file format for value and they are not inherently securities. The SEC has to essentially unilaterally change the definitions of exchange, broker and investment contract in order to try to capture what we do.” Ammori said.

In a 40-page response, the company expressed its readiness to litigate if necessary, asserting confidence in its legal standing. 
SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently argued that decentralized exchanges fall within the SEC’s regulatory scope. He has stated that many digital assets are unregistered securities subject to SEC rules. 
However, Uniswap Labs maintains that UNI tokens, its governance tokens, do not qualify as securities under the Howey Test. This legal standard from a Supreme Court ruling defines investment contracts. 
In light of these developments, Uniswap’s UNI token saw a 4% increase in value over the past 24 hours, trading at $9.63.

The broader crypto market closely watches the SEC’s actions, especially as the US election approaches and crypto becomes a significant political issue. Some believe that the SEC’s stance on crypto may be shifting. Also there are expectations that the SEC will approve spot Ethereum ETFs on May 23. 

This anticipated approval is believed to result from political pressure. Crypto enthusiasts speculate that the Biden administration and former President Donald Trump might have realized the crypto community’s growing influence. 
Not to mention, Trump’s campaign recently allowed donations via crypto, signaling a more crypto-friendly approach.

Waiting for Ethereum ETF? Analyst predicts launch delay - AMBCrypto



ETH ETF approval could be likely, but the official launch could take some time, per analyst. 
Mixed feelings on the potential threat of ETH ETF, if approved, to BTC ETFs. 

Crypto markets rallied early in the week following a positive update on US spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF approvals. 
However, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, despite the positive SEC update on the ETH ETF approvals, the official launch and listing could take longer. 
“Still a potentially long way from a launch. But these filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate.”
Notably, on 21st May, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) submitted five amended 19b-4s on behalf of Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark Invest/21Shares, and Franklin Templeton.  
While this renewed interest and update was positive, Seyffart added that, 
‘Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s, AND THEN we need to see S-1 approvals. Could be weeks or more before ETFs launch.’ 
The 19b-4s forms are exchange rule changes submitted by exchanges for new funds, while S-1 filings are from individual issuers. Both forms must be approved before launching ETFs. 
Staking feature removed from Ethereum ETF filings
Another important update on the process was the apparent removal of ETH staking wordings from the recently amended 19b-4s filings. 
According to Seyffart, the amended filings replaced previous staking wordings with outright clear writing, 
‘Fund’s ETH cannot be staked by anyone.’
Most market watchers have long argued that the staking feature could complicate the approval process and raise questions about ETH’s ‘security’ status. 
Nevertheless, some quarters aren’t happy with the swift approval of ETH ETF, given that Bitcoin ETFs took almost 10 years to achieve. One user claimed that an ETH ETF approval will indicate that the ‘market is not regulated by competent actors.’
The user added that the approval will make ETH a Bitcoin equivalent, yet Ethereum’s ecosystem is full of ‘centralized sh*tcoins.’
On his part, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, asserted that ETF inflows could help ETH come out of the shadows of Solans[SOL] and BTC. 
In fact, Thompson added that ETH ETF, if approved, could attract inflows from BTC ETFs. Even Peter Schiff echoed Thompson’s sentiment. If confirmed, it remains to be seen whether ETH ETF could be a threat to BTC ETFs.

Kakarot ZK-EVM Launches Testnet, Paving The Way For EVM-Compatibility On Starknet - The Defiant

Kakarot Labs is backed by StarkWare and Vitalik Buterin.Starknet, the seventh-largest Layer 2 network by TVL, will soon enjoy EVM-compatibility, opening the floodgates to established DeFi protocols within the Ethereum ecosystem.On May 22, Kakarot Labs launched the public mainnet phase for its modular Cairo-based zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The move sets the stage for Starknet's ecosystem to become EVM-compatible, with the popular Layer 2 leveraging the Cairo programming language and facilitating smart contract execution via its bespoke CairoVM.“Kakarot is essentially an Ethereum execution engine built with Cairo,” said Elias Tazartes, CEO and co-founder of Kakarot Labs. “In time, this engine will be integrated into Starknet appchains, thus allowing any ZK-rollup that uses the Cairo stack to be EVM compatible.”The Kakarot ZK-EVM was first created in October 2022 through a joint development effort from the StarkWare Exploration Team and the open-source Starknet developer community.In June 2023, Kakarot Labs announced a pre-seed investment round featuring participation from StarkWare, the team behind Starknet, and Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s chief scientist.EVM-compatibilityWhile Starknet currently ranks as the seventh-largest Layer 2 with more than $1 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to L2beat, the lion’s share of its TVL was achieved through its long-anticipated STARK airdrop on Feb. 20.The drop was the largest in the history of web3, with the project distributing $2.1 billion worth of tokens at a $30 billion fully diluted valuation per STARK’s initial trading price. The drop also catapulted Starknet’s TVL more than 550% to $1.22 billion from $187 million overnight.However, Starknet’s modest pre-airdrop TVL illustrates the barriers posed to the network's growth by its lack of EVM-compatibility, with its TVL having sluggishly risen from $56 million in May 2023 to $187 million in February. By contrast, many EVM-compatible L2s have quickly garnered momentum by enabling established protocols leveraging Solidity — Ethereum’s primary coding language — to easily migrate onto new networks.“Today, developers looking to build on the Starknet Stack faced the challenge of learning Cairo, the programming language developed especially for STARK cryptography, distinct from Solidity, the mainstay language of Ethereum,” Kakarot Labs said. “The introduction of Kakarot zkEVM will eliminate this barrier by enabling developers to use Solidity, thereby fostering a more inclusive environment within the ecosystem.”Kakarot’s public whitelist phase is the first of three test network deployments, with the project set to follow up with a public whitelist and permissionless public testnet launches.The project said its testnet deployments will allow developers to experiment. familiar tooling such as MetaMask and Foundry within a Cairo-based setting. “By participating in this phase, developers can test and optimize new protocol changes and the latest advancements in crypto user experiences,” Kakarot said.

Target Q1 Revenue Declined by 3.1%, EPS Short of Expectations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) reported its first quarter 2024 financial results, reflecting a performance consistent with its expectations. The company posted a total revenue of $24.53 billion, a 3.1% decrease from the previous year’s $25.32 billion. This decline was driven by a 3.2% drop in total sales, partially offset by a 3.9% increase in other revenue. The operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, down 2.4% from the prior year’s $1.33 billion, primarily due to lower sales volume.



The first quarter operating income margin rate improved slightly to 5.3% from 5.2% in the previous year. This improvement was attributed to a 140 basis point increase in the gross margin rate, which rose to 27.7% from 26.3% last year. The gross margin rate benefited from cost improvements that offset higher promotional markdown rates, favorable category mix, and lower book-to-physical inventory adjustments compared to the prior year.



Target Fails to Meet EPS Forecast in Q1, Revenue in Line with Expectations



Target’s performance in the first quarter matched the company’s projections but fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company reported a diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.03, slightly below the expected $2.06. This figure also represented a minor decline from the previous year’s EPS of $2.05. Despite the shortfall in EPS, the company’s revenue of $24.53 billion closely aligned with the forecasted $24.51 billion.



Comparable sales for the quarter declined by 3.7%, which aligned with the expectations. This decline included a 4.8% decrease in store-originated sales, partially offset by a 1.4% increase in digitally-originated sales. Notably, same-day services grew nearly 9%, led by more than 13% growth in Drive Up. The company also saw continued growth in the Beauty category, which helped mitigate declines in discretionary categories.





Target Corporation Expects Q2 EPS to Range Between $1.95 and $2.35



Target Corporation provided guidance for the second quarter and the full fiscal year 2024. For the second quarter, the company expects a 0% to 2% increase in comparable sales and projects GAAP and adjusted EPS to range between $1.95 and $2.35. For the full year, the company maintains its forecast of a 0% to 2% increase in comparable sales, with GAAP and adjusted EPS anticipated to be between $8.60 and $9.60.



The company’s leadership expressed optimism about returning to growth in the second quarter. Brian Cornell, chair and CEO of Target Corporation, highlighted the improved topline performance for the third consecutive quarter, driven by growth in the digital business, particularly in same-day fulfillment services. Cornell emphasized the company’s commitment to delivering value and convenience to consumers, supported by the successful relaunch of the Target Circle loyalty program, which added over 1 million new members in the first quarter.



Target Paid Dividends of $508 Million, ROIC Improved



Target’s operational efficiency showed mixed results. The company’s SG&A expense rate increased to 21.1% from 19.8% the previous year, reflecting lower sales and higher costs, including pay, benefits, and marketing investments. Despite these higher expenses, disciplined cost management helped mitigate the impact on the overall financial performance. The company’s net interest expense decreased significantly to $106 million from $147 million last year, primarily due to higher interest income from increased cash balances.



On the capital deployment front, Target paid dividends of $508 million, reflecting a 1.9% increase in the dividend per share. However, the company did not repurchase any stock during the quarter, leaving approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program. Additionally, the company’s after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) improved to 15.4% from 11.4% in the prior year, driven by higher operating income and higher average invested capital.

Every 96th person on the planet currently owns at least $1 in Bitcoin


    Though the road has been rocky, with the 12 months starting in May 2022 being particularly dark for the industry, cryptocurrencies have, nonetheless, shown their resilience and continued their integration with the global financial systems.



So far, 2024 is proving to be a particularly eventful year given that it started with the approval of the U.S.’ first-ever spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – instruments that have already done much to expand investors’ exposure to the crypto market.



Bitcoin adoption is also evident in another statistic – the number of addresses that hold at least $1 worth of the coin. 







Indeed, in 2022, Finbold reported that there are as many as 35 million addresses holding at least $1 worth of BTC – up to 0.4% of the global population at the time.



Figures retrieved in May 2024 from BitInfoCharts.com indicate that the number has risen significantly, and there are, in fact, as many as 84 million such addresses. This means that approximately one out of every 96 people in the world might own at least some Bitcoin – slightly more than 1% of the global population of 8.1 billion.



Number of addresses with more than $1 worth of BTC. Source: BitInfoCharts



It is important to note that this figure represents an upper bound, as a single individual may hold Bitcoin in multiple accounts, resulting in more than one address per person.



Likewise, at least some of the rise might be accounted for by the increase in the price of the cryptocurrency as Bitcoin price today stands at $69,953 following a 66.10% year-to-date (YTD) rise.

Drivers for Bitcoin ownership



It is, in general, likely that the ongoing crypto market boom is responsible for the number of relevant Bitcoin addresses as investors were likely keen to take advantage of the rally. 



The trend was only boosted by the bullish forecasts surrounding the latest BTC halving event – which occurred in April – and by the mainstream legitimization offered by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin ETFs.



Indeed, though many prominent cryptocurrency advocates are generally not appreciative of SEC’s hawkish approach to the industry, there is a strong possibility that the higher levels of discussion stemming from enforcement actions  – along with the sense of a lawman arriving in the Wild West – has done much to make digital assets appear as sensible investments to more traditional traders.

Dycom Industries (DY) Shines with $1.142 Billion in Contract Revenues - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE: DY) announced its fiscal 2025 first-quarter results, showcasing a notable performance improvement. The company reported contract revenues of $1.142 billion, reflecting a 9.3% increase compared to $1.045 billion in the same quarter last year. This growth includes a 2.5% organic increase, excluding $71.2 million from acquired businesses. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA rose to $130.9 million, or 11.5% of contract revenues, up from $113.5 million, or 10.9%, in the previous year. Net income also significantly rose to $62.6 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, compared to $51.5 million, or $1.73 per diluted share, in the prior year.



During the quarter, Dycom repurchased 210,000 common shares for $29.8 million, reflecting confidence in its financial health and future prospects. The company’s strategic acquisitions and organic growth have contributed to this robust performance, indicating a well-executed business plan. The increase in net income was partly due to income tax benefits from the vesting and exercise of share-based awards, amounting to $5.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $2.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year.



Dycom Industries Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



Comparing the current quarter’s performance against expectations, Dycom significantly outperformed the anticipated earnings per share (EPS) of $1.51 by delivering $2.12 per diluted share. This represents a substantial positive variance, showcasing the company’s ability to exceed market forecasts. Additionally, the actual revenue of $1.142 billion surpassed the expected $1.09 billion, highlighting a strong demand for Dycom’s services and effective execution of its projects.



The company’s performance metrics, such as Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and net income, indicate a successful quarter beyond just meeting expectations. The Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 11.5% from 10.9% in the previous year, suggesting better operational efficiency and cost management. The increase in net income, bolstered by higher revenues and tax benefits, further underscores Dycom’s robust financial health and strategic prowess.





Dycom Expects Contract Revenues to Grow by High Single Digits for the Next Quarter



Dycom provided optimistic guidance for the next quarter ending July 27, 2024. The company expects organic contract revenues to grow by high single-digits compared to the same quarter last year, alongside approximately $70 million from acquired contract revenues. This forward-looking statement suggests continued growth and integration of recent acquisitions, which are expected to contribute positively to the overall revenue.



Additionally, Dycom anticipates an increase in Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of contract revenues by 25 to 75 basis points compared to the quarter ended July 29, 2023. This guidance indicates a focus on maintaining and potentially improving operational efficiencies while scaling up revenues. Investors and stakeholders can access detailed guidance and additional information on the company’s website, reflecting Dycom’s commitment to transparency and informed investor relations.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales have continued their heavy accumulation of digital currency. According to data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock, large whale transactions come in at 73.72% within a 24-hour period. Per the data shared, a total of 327 large transactions were recorded in 24 hours, setting SHIB on an ambitious growth course.SHIB Large Transaction Chart. Source: IntoTheBlockIn actual volume, a total of 5.58 trillion SHIB was acquired by Shiba Inu whales in 24 hours. This SHIB volume is worth a total of $145.48 million, placing Shiba Inu among the most traded tokens by whales thus far this week. With whale transactions tagged as those with a monetary value of at least $100,000, the attractiveness of Shiba Inu has continued to grow. With more than 5.5 trillion tokens scooped up, the supply crunch introduced into the ecosystem might help sustain the bull rally it has printed in the past few days.However, the entire Shib Inu protocol, as reported earlier by U.Today, paints a problematic picture. After soaring as high as 10% in a single day, jumping above the 50-day EMA, the failure of SHIB’s price to continue the rally, according to numerous data, shows concerns.At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is priced at $0.00002612, up by 2.72% in the past 24 hours. Shiba Inu has been making a frantic effort to soar above the current price range and possibly break toward the $0.00007 high. These efforts have been backed by the intense deflationary push through its burn rate and aggressive Shibarium transaction growth.With these apparent efforts, Shiba Inu is arguably moving in tandem with the broader market. It is following the slower pace of the combined market to chart its growth course. However, there are expectations that the token will print a breakout in the long term.

Bitcoin ETFs See Significant Increases as Markets Lock on Ethereum ETF Approval! Which Company Is Leading? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States are seeing significant investment inflows, recording their seventh consecutive day of net inflows on Tuesday. This increase in interest comes amid growing excitement over the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience Strong Inflows Amid Ethereum ETF Speculation
A total of $305.72 million was transferred to spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to data from multiple sources.



BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust led the way, attracting $290 million of total inflows. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund also had a positive impact, bringing in $26 million.

In contrast, Grayscale's transformed Bitcoin Trust, which experienced cumulative net outflows of $18 billion, recorded no net inflows on Tuesday.
Bitwise Bitcoin ETF and VanEck Bitcoin Trust were the only funds to see outflows, with net losses of $4 million and $6 million, respectively. Other spot Bitcoin ETFs did not report any inflows or outflows.






Since their introduction to US exchanges, spot Bitcoin ETFs have been extremely popular, generating total net inflows of $13.17 billion.
The recent success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has shifted the focus in the cryptocurrency and financial markets to the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly asked exchanges to amend their 19b-4 filings earlier this week, hinting at a possible move towards approval of these products.

How a Bitcoin Pizza Trade Pushed Decentralized Money into the Spotlight 14 Years Ago - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Fourteen years ago, on May 22, 2010, two pizzas were bought for 10,000 BTC, a transaction worth over $700 million today. This historic event marked the first documented real-world use of Bitcoin. It demonstrated the potential of decentralized digital currency, setting the stage for a revolution in finance.



Bitcoin is the World’s First Widely-Adopted Decentralized Digital Currency 



Bitcoin, the world’s first decentralized digital currency, was introduced by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. The concept behind Bitcoin was to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that would operate without a central authority, such as banks or governments. Decentralized currencies like Bitcoin offer several advantages over traditional currencies, including lower transaction fees, increased security, and the ability to conduct transactions without intermediaries.





A Programmer from Florida Paid 10,000 BTC for Two Large Pizzas



On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from Florida, made a post on the BitcoinTalk forum offering to pay 10,000 BTC for two large pizzas. On the forum, Jeremy Sturdivant (known as “jercos”) accepted the offer and arranged to deliver two Papa John’s pizzas to Hanyecz’s home. This transaction, worth roughly $41 then, marked the first documented real-world use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, demonstrating the cryptocurrency’s potential for everyday transactions.



The pizza transaction had an immediate impact on the Bitcoin community. It validated Bitcoin’s use case and encouraged other users to explore real-world applications for the cryptocurrency. The transaction also attracted early media attention, sparking growing curiosity about the potential of digital currencies.



Over the years, the significance of the pizza transaction has only grown. The value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed, with 10,000 BTC worth over $700 million as of 2024. The Bitcoin Pizza Index, which tracks the value of the pizza transaction over time, has become a popular way to illustrate the cryptocurrency’s growth. The transaction also paved the way for technological advancements in blockchain technology and inspired the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies.







Would you be willing to buy pizza with BTC today? Let us know in the comments below.

                        Stephen Findeisen, popularly known as “Coffeezilla” on YouTube, has accused artificial intelligence company Rabbit AI of orchestrating a nonfungible token (NFT) scam and attempting to cover it up.Findeisen, a prominent investigator on the video-sharing platform, recently released a video on the Coffeezilla channel, shedding light on Rabbit AI’s alleged involvement in the NFT space.According to Findeisen’s findings, Rabbit AI was previously known as Cyber Manufacture Co. and managed to raise $6 million for an NFT project named Gama.However, the company’s founder and CEO, Jesse Lyu, later distanced Rabbit AI from the world of cryptocurrencies, stating that they would “never touch crypto” in Discord statements.Fun Little Project
Lyu claimed that Gama was merely a “fun little project” he participated in during the COVID-19 pandemic and that he left the project once the associated game was open-sourced.Contradicting Lyu’s claims, Findeisen presented recordings in which Lyu discussed ambitious plans for the Gama project.In those recordings, Lyu expressed intentions of investing millions into Gama to create a groundbreaking NFT experience.He also mentioned future plans for a concept called Gamaverse and the potential for a clean energy initiative in relation to Gama Coin.Findeisen raised concerns about the $6 million funding raised for the Gama project, questioning where the money had been allocated.Despite Rabbit AI’s assertion that the funds were solely used for the NFT project, Coffeezilla argued that Rabbit AI’s foundation was built on the remnants of the Gama project, making it a matter of concern.Additionally, Findeisen criticized the overhyped nature of Rabbit AI’s viral R1 product, drawing parallels between the exaggerated promises made by both Gama and R1.Coffeezilla’s allegations are not isolated, as others have also expressed skepticism about Rabbit AI’s offerings.Josh Olin, the founder and CEO of WeGPT, previously labeled Rabbit’s project as a “scam,” characterizing it as a quick cash grab designed to lure in investors.Logan Paul-Coffeezilla Cryptozoo Controversy
Online detective Coffeezilla has made himself a reputation by uncovering crypto scams.Specifically, he made headlines last year for going after popular YouTuber and influencer Logan Paul to expose his “scam” project CryptoZoo.CryptoZoo was launched in September 2021 with much fanfare, with Paul himself being one of the founders of the project.The game utilized its own cryptocurrency called ZooCoin, with buyers able to purchase “eggs” that would hatch into randomized animals with different rarities.These animals could then be bred to create cross-bred creatures that would act as NFTs. The NFTs could be held or burned to earn more ZooCoin, purportedly providing buyers with significant returns on their investments.However, in a three-part series of videos uploaded at the end of 2021, Coffeezilla alleged that CryptoZoo had been largely abandoned shortly after its launch.He claimed that Paul distanced himself from the project, despite the extensive pre-release attention he had given it.In response to Coffeezilla’s allegations, Paul released a video blaming the co-founders and advisors of CryptoZoo for any wrongdoing and sensationalizing the story. He even threatened to sue Coffeezilla.

Smart traders take millions in profit from this crypto as retail FOMO in


    High recent on-chain activity has registered at least three smart traders taking profits from the popular meme coin PEPE. These cryptocurrency whales have made millions of dollars in trades as retail jumps in with ‘Fear of Missing Out’ (FOMO).



Finbold gathered this data from four different Lookonchain reports posted on X on May 22, suggesting a reversal could happen.



PEPE smart traders’ whale activity



First, an early buyer deposited all their 182.9 billion PEPE holdings, worth $2.53 million, into a Binance account. This was the remaining amount of a $462 initial purchase of 324.9 billion PEPE last year. In total, this smart trade rendered over $3.4 million in profits.

Second, the institutional investment firm BlockTower Capital sent $2.8 million worth of 202 billion PEPE to Cumberland, a known market maker that provides liquidity for institutional and retail trading. The transaction happened as the meme coin price broke through $0.000014 per token.



This was a six-day swing trade that earned BlockTower Capital $578,000 in profits on a $2.22 million investment.

Last, a smart trader deposited $2.83 million of PEPE to the Bybit crypto exchange as its third profitable trade. This trader is considered smart due to its 100% win rate trading PEPE, for an estimated total profit of $2.48 million.

FOMO: Retail and whales are still buying



Meanwhile, a few hours after the last activity, another whale withdrew $7.95 million in 592 billion PEPE from Binance. Lookonchain estimates this resulted from a two-day purchase during a notable price pump for the meme coin.







On May 19, Finbold reported another trader who lost $300,000 in two days of bad trading decisions with PEPE.



Moreover, Finbold gathered data from Santiment showing an increased social volume, indicating increased retail interest. Usually, these social indicators peak a few days before a trend reversal, as smart trader whales take profit over the FOMOing retail.

Meme coins and the Greater Fool Theory



Meme coins, such as PEPE, often lack fundamental value and are driven by hype and social media buzz. Traders who buy these coins are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy them at a higher price.



This mentality aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests that profits can be made by buying overvalued assets and selling them to a “greater fool.”



However, this theory also highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down, and demand dwindles, traders can be left holding worthless cryptocurrencies, leading to substantial financial losses.

Crypto security: $22 million returned to Gala Games

A couple of days ago, a security incident occurred involving the crypto of Gala Games.
 A hacker managed to access the platform with the administrator address of Gala Games, and created 5 billion new GALA tokens.  

Subsequently, he transferred approximately 4,600 ETH to 0x, and sold 600 million of the tokens he minted on Uniswap, cashing in 21 million dollars. 
Subsequently, 4.4 billion GALA tokens were burned.


The return of the bull and bear funds 
Yesterday, more than 5,900 ETH (over 22 million dollars) were sent from the hacker’s wallet to Gala Games.

L’ipotesi è che abbia deciso di restituire parte del bottino. 
According to Gala Games, the decision would have been the result of their timely and effective response, and the involvement of law enforcement. 
“`html
As they stated yesterday in a post on their official blog, the unauthorized wallet was locked down in record time, and the funds were returned because the security measures proved to be effective.
“`
Something similar, however, had also happened in the past, so it is difficult to imagine that the security measures worked 100%. 
The reaction of Gala Games: our crypto security worked
On Monday afternoon, an unusual transfer of GALA tokens occurred on the Ethereum network worth 200 million dollars.
Gala Games promptly responded by activating the blocklist protocol of GalaChain, to quickly block any further unauthorized minting and movement of GALA tokens, thus mitigating the effects of the incident.
Thanks to the swift intervention, within 45 minutes of the unauthorized minting, approximately 90% of the GALA tokens minted by the hacker were blocked. 
This was made possible thanks to a new feature implemented with the update to version v2.
Subsequently, Gala Games contacted the U.S. federal law enforcement authorities, hoping that they will initiate a thorough investigation and appropriate legal action against the culprits.
They also claim that the minting capabilities of GALA on GalaChain would still be secure, because the internal controls and multisig security protocols are designed to protect against such incidents and are continuously improved to keep up with new potential threats.
They have also decided to reimburse anyone who has been subject to unreasonably high transaction fees associated with this incident.
Gala Games:  La questione della sicurezza crypto 
Security on blockchain smart contracts is fundamental because they are public and accessible to everyone. 
In this case, the violation was carried out against the Gala platform, and in particular against the administrator’s account. 
Despite this, they claim that their security measures are solid and effective, and that they are committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and transparency. 
They justify the problem by saying that being pioneers in unknown territories can sometimes be a risky activity, but they assure that GalaChain is well-equipped to handle any unforeseen challenge that Web3 may throw. 
The token GALA
Today the price of the GALA token on the crypto markets has increased by 13%.
In reality, it has simply returned to the level prior to the news of the incident, given that on Monday it was above 46 thousandths of a dollar and today it has returned to just below 47 thousandths. 
Yesterday it had dropped to below 42 thousandths, with a daily loss of more than 12%. 
It is worth noting that at the beginning of 2024 it was at 30 thousandths, and during the month of February it rose significantly, reaching a peak of over 87 thousandths in early March. 
In April, however, it had already fallen below 35 thousandths, but only to bounce back above 50 thousandths at the end of the month. 
In May, it first fell below 39 thousandths and then recovered and rose above 46. 
The current price is in line with that of April 25, and it is 55% higher than at the beginning of the year. 
It should be remembered, however, that it is still down by as much as -94% compared to the highs of 2021, but that was a truly gigantic speculative bubble. 
At the end of 2020, the price was below 1 thousandth of a dollar, and by March 2021 it had already risen above 30 thousandths, which is a level in line with the current one. 
The bull si è gonfiata da settembre a novembre, quando nel giro di poco più di due mesi il prezzo schizzò ad oltre 824 millesimi. 
The burst of the bubble ended in January 2023 when the price had fallen below 17 thousandths. Even in November, it was just above 18 thousandths.

Bitcoin (BTC) Hovers Around $70K After ETF Records Month-High Inflows

Bitcoin hovered around the $70,000 mark during the European morning, a slight drop following Tuesday's rally to as high as $71,400. BTC is currently priced at $70,069, around 1.6% lower over 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), offering a measurement of the broader digital asset market, fell about 0.5%. BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded over $290 million in inflows on Tuesday, its highest one-day figure since April 5 and nearly three times the previous high this month: $93 million on May 16. As a whole, ETFs took on nearly $300 million in net inflows on Tuesday.

WisdomTree, Managing $111 Billion, Received Approval to List Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the SEC's critical decision on spot Ethereum ETFs was awaited, positive news came from the UK.
WisdomTree has received approval to launch Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) investment products (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange, Coindesk reported.


World-renowned asset manager WisdomTree (WT) announced that it has received approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to list Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
In the statement made today, it was stated that WisdomTree's Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Physical Ethereum (ETHW) ETPs will begin trading on May 28 and will be open to professional investors only.





The company, which has more than $111 billion in assets under management and a spot BTC ETF (WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund -BTCW) approved in the US, has been offering crypto products on European exchanges since 2019.
The FCA banned crypto derivatives, including ETPs, in January 2020. But the FCA said it would not object to requests from financial institutions seeking to list ETPs for professional investors, softening its bans after such crypto-based products have been widely used in Europe for several years and the approval of spot ETFs in the US in January.


While the FCA has approved crypto ETPs for professional investors, the ban remains in place for retail investors.

Global Bitcoin ATM Numbers Decline for the First Time Since July 2023



                    

For the first time since July 2023, the number of active Bitcoin ATMs worldwide has decreased.



The United States and Canada dominate the Bitcoin ATM landscape, accounting for 91.4% of the global network. The U.S. hosts 31,089 (82.6%) machines, while Canada has 2,909 (7.7%).




In 2024, countries worldwide significantly contributed to the month-on-month increase in Bitcoin ATMs, nearly reaching the 38,000 mark lost in January 2023. 



However, the 10-month-long global growth streak ended when over 300 ATMs went offline in May 2024. 



As of May 21, the U.S. market saw a loss of 302 Bitcoin ATMs, and Canada lost 28 machines.




Despite these losses, new Bitcoin ATMs in Australia, Switzerland, and Europe helped reduce the net decline to 280 machines at the time of publication.



Law enforcement agencies in the U.S. actively pursue and shut down Bitcoin ATMs frequently used for extortion and scams.

However, the reasons behind the recent sharp decline in their numbers remain unclear.




Australia hosts the third-largest network of active Bitcoin ATMs after the U.S. and Canada, with 1,041 (2.8%) machines.



Bitcoin Depot, the largest ATM operator in the U.S., recorded steady earnings in 2024. 



The firm stated in its 10-K annual report filed on April 15 that there was no correlation between its revenues and the price of Bitcoin historically.



“Based on our own user surveys, a majority of our users use our products and services for non-speculative purposes, including money transfers, international remittances, and online purchases, among others,” Bitcoin Depot wrote.



According to the ATM operator, the lack of correlation between Bitcoin Depot’s revenues and the BTC price is partly due to the nature of the services provided.

Trump crypto donations: Better 'financial choices' or 'another cow to milk'? - AMBCrypto



Donald Trump has started accepting crypto donations for his 2024 presidential campaign.
Cryptocurrencies see an increased importance in the political discourse.

As anticipation builds for the United States presidential elections of 2024, former President Donald Trump has made a bold move.
On the 21st of May, Trump’s presidential campaign launched a fundraising page, enabling federally permissible donors to contribute using cryptocurrency through Coinbase Commerce.
This move stands in stark contrast to his opponent, President Joe Biden, who has been known to advocate for stricter crypto regulations.
Trump’s bold move
The announcement highlighted the reasons behind this decision and read,
“Today’s announcement reflects President Trump’s commitment to an agenda that values freedom over socialistic government control.”
Providing further insight into the Trump campaign’s intentions, the announcement emphasized,
“Biden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‘anti-crypto army’ to restrict Americans’ right to make their own financial choices. MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!”
The remark on the ‘anti-crypto army’ was made in line with Warren’s re-election ad in March 2023.
Donald Trump donations are a paradigm shift 
These recent developments underscore a notable shift in the political landscape: in previous election cycles, cryptocurrency held little sway.
However, heightened regulatory scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) targeting numerous crypto firms has ignited a debate among voters.
This newfound attention has pushed cryptocurrency into the forefront of political debate and campaign tactics, making it a big deal in the 2024 elections.
These developments beg the question: Will Trump’s recent actions reduce Biden’s chances of winning the election?
Trump’s various pro-crypto stance 
Trump has actively embraced cryptocurrency, including selling limited-run NFT trading cards for cryptocurrency in December 2023 and hosting a lavish dinner for his NFT buyers at the Mar-a-Lago club earlier in May.
In contrast, Biden’s campaign reflects his administration’s cautious stance towards cryptocurrency and its proponents.
Well, Trump is not the first to accept crypto donations. Back in 2015, Sen. Rand Paul accepted Bitcoin donations for his presidential campaign.
Additionally, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also announced in May 2023 that his independent presidential bid would accept bitcoin donations.
However, despite Trump’s efforts to gain traction in the presidential race, David Hoffman, co-founder of Bankless, argues that his pro-crypto stance is nothing more than a joke.

Could Investors Cause Toncoin (TON) Price Correction?


Toncoin’s (TON) price failed to mark a new all-time high despite attempting to breach the key resistance of $7.0.
The likely reason behind this is the declining optimism of investors, which is evident in their behavior.
Toncoin Holders Hold Back

Toncoin’s price is experiencing the effect of declining bullishness among investors. The reason behind this is the lack of conviction among TON holders, which was visible in the downtick of the Mean Coin Age.
Mean Coin Age is a blockchain metric that calculates the average age of all coins by considering the time each coin has remained in its current address. It helps gauge the behavior of long-term holders and overall network stability.
The uptick in this indicator shows investors are holding onto their assets while the downtick hints at supply moving around the addresses. TON has noted a downtick since February, but the broader market cues kept increasing Toncoin’s price.

However, with the cues dissipating, the lack of conviction could show its effect on the price action.
But it’s not just the existing investors that are pessimistic; the potential TON holders are not too bullish either. This is evident in the network growth falling to a two-and-a-half-month low. 
Network growth is measured by the rate at which new addresses are formed on the network identified by their participation. It assesses whether the asset is gaining or losing traction in the market.
Read More: What Are Telegram Bot Coins?

Since this indicator fell by 70% within a week, potential investors do not have much incentive at the moment. This may be reflected in Toncoin’s price action going forward.
TON Price Prediction: Key Support Level to Watch

Toncoin’s price attempted to breach the resistance of $7.0 but failed to trickle back in the last ten days. Consequently, TON fell below the crucial psychological support level of $6.5. A recent broader market rally pushed the altcoin above this support but could not sustain it, falling to trade at $6.2.
This bearishness will loom over Toncoin’s price unless the investors’ behavior changes. As a result, the cryptocurrency could fall to test the support at $6.0. Losing this support could lead to a dip to $5.4.

However, if Tocnoin’s price does not fall below the $6.0 support level, it could bounce back to $6.5. Flipping it into a support floor would enable recovery, potentially sending TON to $7, invalidating the bearish thesis.

A Deep Dive Into P2P

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
A look at the P2P exchange market and platforms, pros and cons, and more. 
Crypto has become a huge part of our lives over the years, but we still use fiat to pay for most of the services we use in our everyday lives – which means there’s been a demand for easy conversion since the dawn of crypto. 
One of the oldest, most trusted and popular ways to exchange coins to fiat out there is as decentralized as the whole crypto universe itself – it’s P2P, or Peer-to-Peer exchange, where users swap directly with each other.
A Quick P2P Market Overview
The properly decentralized P2P approach contrasts sharply with traditional centralized exchanges, where a single entity controls the order book and facilitates trades. P2P platforms empower users with full control over their transactions by allowing them to agree on terms and execute trades directly with each other. 
One of the defining features of P2P exchanges is their reliance on a network of users instead of a centralized system. This not only enhances privacy and security but also aligns with the foundational principles of blockchain — decentralization and user empowerment. Each participant in a P2P transaction uses software that directly connects them with other participants without needing a middleman, which can reduce fees and increase transaction  transparency.
Moreover, P2P platforms often incorporate sophisticated trust and reputation systems that allow users to rate each other based on their transaction history. This feature helps build a community of trusted users and mitigates the risk of fraud. Additionally, many P2P exchanges provide an escrow mechanism, where the cryptocurrency being traded is held by the platform until both parties confirm that the terms of the transaction have been met. This safeguard reassures users and enhances the reliability of trading on these platforms.
The importance of P2P exchanges has grown in regions where access to traditional banking is limited or where financial regulations restrict the use of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. In these areas, P2P platforms offer a vital service, enabling inclusive participation in the global digital economy. Moreover, the adaptability of P2P exchanges allows them to serve a wide array of markets, catering to a diverse user base with varying needs and trading preferences.
Overall, the P2P market continues to expand due to all the perks it offers, and remains the most popular way to exchange crypto, despite other features being introduced by platforms. 
P2P Services: a Quick Overview
P2P platforms are designed to facilitate direct transactions between ordinary users in the cryptocurrency market. Here’s a closer look at some of the core services provided by P2P platforms:

Escrow Services: One of the most critical services offered by P2P platforms is the escrow system. When a trade is initiated, the cryptocurrency is held in escrow by the platform until all parties fulfill their parts of the deal. Only when both the buyer and the seller confirm that the transaction terms have been satisfied does the escrow release the funds. This service significantly reduces the risk of fraud and increases trust among platform users.
Reputation and Rating Systems: To enhance trustworthiness, P2P platforms often incorporate user ratings or reputation systems. Users can rate each other based on their experiences after a transaction is completed. These ratings are then compiled into a comprehensive reputation score for each user, visible to other participants. This transparency helps users make informed decisions about whom they choose to transact with.
Decentralized Dispute Resolution: Despite the best efforts of participants, disputes may still arise. Many P2P platforms have mechanisms for decentralized dispute resolution where neutral arbitrators or the community itself can get involved to adjudicate disagreements based on evidence provided by the transaction parties. This approach not only helps resolve conflicts fairly but also maintains the integrity of the trading environment.
Multi-Currency Support: Most P2P platforms support a wide range of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, allowing users from different geographic locations to trade in their preferred currencies. This inclusivity enhances the platform’s accessibility and utility, catering to a global audience with diverse needs.
Privacy Protection: In keeping with the ethos of cryptocurrency, P2P platforms typically offer more robust privacy protections compared to centralized exchanges. While users might still need to verify their identity to comply with regulatory requirements, the trading process itself can often be conducted anonymously, with no need for personal information to be exchanged between trading partners.
User-Friendly Interfaces: To attract and retain users, P2P platforms strive to offer clean, intuitive user interfaces that simplify the process of trading digital assets. Whether a novice or an experienced trader, the platform’s design ensures that users can navigate their trading environment effortlessly.


These services make P2P platforms an appealing option for users looking for a more personalized and secure trading experience. By combining the traditional benefits of cryptocurrency, like decentralization and privacy, with innovative trust-building tools, P2P exchanges are setting a new standard in the digital trading space.
A Look at the EMCD P2P Exchange
The EMCD platform stands out in the burgeoning P2P market, especially in Eastern Europe, where it has rapidly become a preferred choice for many cryptocurrency users. EMCD originally gained recognition as one of the top mining pools worldwide but has successfully expanded into the P2P exchange domain. Here’s an in-depth look at the unique features and benefits that EMCD offers:

Mining Pool Integration: EMCD’s roots in cryptocurrency mining provide a distinct advantage. Users who mine cryptocurrencies directly through EMCD can seamlessly exchange their mining rewards on the platform without needing to transfer their assets to another exchange. This integration simplifies the process, reduces transaction fees, and enhances security.
Wide Range of Supported Currencies: The EMCD P2P exchange supports a variety of fiat and cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to the Russian Ruble, Ukrainian Hryvnia, and the Kazakhstani Tenge, alongside major cryptocurrencies like USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. This diversity caters to a broad user base and facilitates easier and more flexible trading options across borders. Support for the Georgian lari will be added soon.
Robust Security Measures: Given its background in mining and its established infrastructure, EMCD places a strong emphasis on security. The platform implements advanced security protocols to protect users’ funds and personal information. Regular security audits and compliance with the latest cybersecurity practices ensure that the platform remains secure against potential threats.
User-Friendly Interface: EMCD’s platform is designed with user experience in mind. The interface is intuitive, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced traders. This ease of use is critical in attracting a broader audience and facilitating smooth transactions.
Local and International Bank Integration: EMCD’s integration with local and international banks is a standout feature that simplifies the process of fiat deposits and withdrawals. This service is particularly valuable in Eastern Europe, where users may face challenges with international banking transactions related to cryptocurrency trading.
24/7 Customer Support: EMCD offers round-the-clock customer support to address any issues that users may encounter. Quick and responsive support is essential in the P2P exchange space, where timely assistance can make a significant difference in user satisfaction and trust.
Community and Educational Resources: Understanding the complexities of cryptocurrency trading can be daunting for many. EMCD provides extensive educational resources to help users understand market trends, trading strategies, and the basics of cryptocurrency. Additionally, a strong community presence on platforms like Telegram allows users to engage with peers and experts, fostering a supportive trading environment.
No Regional Restrictions: Unlike some exchanges that limit access based on geographic location, EMCD offers its services without regional restrictions. This inclusivity ensures that users from various jurisdictions can access the platform, trade, and benefit from its services without hindrance.

The combination of these features makes EMCD not just a platform for trading but a comprehensive ecosystem that supports its users’ needs from mining to trading and learning. As the platform continues to evolve, it aims to maintain its commitment to providing secure, accessible, and user-friendly services, solidifying its position as a leading P2P exchange in the cryptocurrency space.
P2P: Pros & Cons
P2P cryptocurrency exchanges represent a significant shift away from traditional financial systems by decentralizing the control over currency trading. This model has several advantages and disadvantages, which are crucial for traders to understand.
Pros:
Decentralization

Direct Transactions: In P2P exchanges, trades occur directly between parties without the need for an intermediary. The platform only facilitates guarantees for transactions, securing them by freezing funds in escrow until the transaction is finalized. 
Personal Responsibility: Users have control over their wallets, which minimizes the risk of losing assets to hacks of platforms.

Privacy and Anonymity

Confidentiality: P2P platforms generally require less personal information from their users, which can provide higher levels of privacy.
Protection from Identity Theft: Reduced sharing of personal details helps protect against identity theft.

Cost Efficiency

No Fees: P2P platforms typically have no fees, since they don’t have to maintain expensive infrastructure or pay intermediaries.
No Middlemen: The absence of middlemen can further reduce transaction costs, making it more economical for users.


Global Access

Inclusive: P2P exchanges can offer services in regions where traditional banking is inaccessible or limited, providing more people with access to the cryptocurrency market.
No Geographical Limitations: Users can trade across borders without incurring the high fees usually associated with international transactions.

Flexible Payment Methods

Diverse Payment Options: P2P platforms often support a wide range of payment methods including bank transfers, online wallets, and even cash, making them more accessible.

Cons:
Complexity and Usability

Steep Learning Curve: New users may find P2P platforms more complex and less intuitive than centralized exchanges.
User Responsibility: The need for managing one’s own security can be daunting for some, as P2P does not provide the same level of user support as centralized platforms.

Security Concerns


Scam Risks: While escrow and reputation systems help mitigate risk, scams can still occur. Users must be vigilant and prudent in their dealings.
Dispute Resolution: Resolving disputes can be more complicated without a central authority to adjudicate conflicts.

Liquidity Issues

Variable Liquidity: Depending on the asset and the specific P2P platform, liquidity can be lower than on centralized exchanges, potentially making it harder to complete large transactions quickly.
Price Volatility: Lower liquidity can lead to higher price volatility; prices may vary more significantly than on centralized platforms.

Speed of Transactions

Dependency on Participants: Transaction speeds depend on the responsiveness of the counterparty, which can lead to delays if the other party is not prompt.
Manual Processes: The need to manually find and secure trades can slow down the process, especially for less popular assets or payment methods.


Regulatory and Legal Risks

Uncertain Regulation: The legal status of P2P trading is still unclear in many jurisdictions, which could pose risks of sudden regulatory changes affecting the ability to trade or withdraw funds.
Compliance Requirements: While anonymity is a benefit, it also places the onus on users to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations regarding taxation and cryptocurrency trading.

Conclusion
P2P platforms offer a compelling alternative to traditional and centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, especially for those valuing privacy, lower fees, and direct control over their transactions. However, these advantages come with the responsibility of managing one’s own security and the potential for less liquidity and slower trades. 
For many, the benefits of P2P exchanges outweigh the drawbacks, particularly in regions with restricted access to traditional banking services or where users seek to avoid heavy regulation. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the role of P2P platforms is likely to expand, driven by increasing demand for decentralized financial services.

SEC Chair Gensler Criticizes FIT 21 Crypto Bill, Warns Of 'New Regulatory Gaps' - Benzinga

The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) would undermine investor protections and hinder the SEC’s regulatory efforts, the financial watchdog’s Chair Gary Gensler stated on Wednesday.What Happened: “FIT21 would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,” Gensler warned.A joint effort by the House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, FIT21 aims to delineate the roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing cryptocurrency. The bill introduces the term “digital commodity” for digital assets not classified as securities, placing them under the CFTC’s jurisdiction.Gensler argued that FIT21 disregards long-standing regulatory precedents for investment contracts and places the SEC in a difficult position for certifying self-proclaimed digital commodity issuers. He emphasized that the bill overlooks the Supreme Court’s Howey Test precedent, compromises investor protections, and potentially exposes investors to undue risk without adequate disclosures.“U.S. securities laws, developed after the Great Depression, were designed to protect consumers by enforcing disclosures and providing tools for regulators and investors to safeguard customers,” Gensler noted. He pointed out that the crypto industry has been reluctant to comply with these established regulations.Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Ethereum ETFs Could Drive ‘Mass Adoption’ — What Investors Need To Know NowGensler also criticized the bill for removing investment contracts recorded on a blockchain from the statutory definition of securities, thus excluding them from federal securities laws’ protections. He highlighted that this exclusion contradicts court rulings that many crypto assets are offered and sold as securities under existing laws.The bill’s provision allowing companies to self-certify as issuers of “digital commodities” is problematic, Gensler said, because it gives the SEC only 60 days to evaluate whether these assets meet the bill’s criteria—a timeframe he deemed insufficient given the vast number of digital assets in circulation.Gensler also expressed concerns about the bill’s definition of a digital commodity, which he argued ignores the Howey Test and the economic realities of assets. He cautioned that the bill’s investor protection framework and the exclusion of exchanges could increase risks to the public.Moreover, Gensler warned that FIT21 might harm the broader U.S. capital markets by enabling companies to circumvent SEC oversight through decentralized networks.The House of Representatives is expected to vote on FIT21 later on Wednesday.However, the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate and is unlikely to become law this year.What’s Next: For further insights into regulatory developments and their impact on the digital asset space, join industry leaders at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This gathering will delve into the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.Read Next: SEC Could Approve Spot Ethereum ETF ‘This Week:’ ReportImage: Shutterstock

Gary Gensler Criticizes FIT21 Crypto Bill Before House Vote


US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has publicly opposed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a bill to regulate digital asset markets. He believes the bill would weaken the SEC’s ability to protect investors by reclassifying crypto assets and reducing regulatory oversight.
At the same time, The House is set to vote on the bill, which faces notable opposition and an uncertain future in the Senate.
SEC Chair Criticizes FIT21 Act for Reducing Regulatory Oversight

In a Wednesday report, Gary Gensler expressed his strong opposition to the FIT21 Act. The bill, introduced in July 2023 by Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson and backed by several key Republicans, aims to establish clear federal guidelines for digital asset markets. It seeks to balance innovation with strong consumer protections and clarifies the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) roles in regulating cryptocurrency.
Gensler argues that the bill undermines classifying crypto assets as investment contracts. This change would remove these assets from the SEC’s oversight, making it harder to protect investors.
Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?

He noted that FIT21 might enable crypto firms to self-certify their products as “decentralized” digital commodities, thus avoiding SEC scrutiny. Gensler warned that the SEC’s limited resources would hinder its ability to challenge these certifications, leaving much of the crypto market unregulated.
Gensler also criticized the bill’s definition of a digital commodity. He said that it ignores the Howey Test and the economic realities of the assets. Furthermore, he warned that FIT21 could harm the broader US capital markets by allowing companies to evade SEC regulation through decentralized networks.

“The bill would remove investment contracts that are recorded on a blockchain from the statutory definition of securities and the time-tested protections of much of the federal securities laws. By removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled—but what crypto market participants have attempted to deny—that many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law,” Gensler explained.

Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), shared his thoughts on Gensler’s stance and current approach to crypto regulation.

“He thought he was above Congressional oversight. That’s all gone. He’s now a struggling political liability,” Alderoty said.

The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Wednesday. However, its passage through the Senate remains to be determined. If enacted, the bill would alter the Howey test and significantly reduce the SEC’s oversight of crypto assets. Introduced in 1946, the Howey Test determines if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and, thus, a security.

At least eight House Democrats support the FIT21 Act and may gain more backers. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is reportedly considering supporting the bill. Despite no longer being in Democratic leadership, Pelosi’s opinions still influence many House Democrats.
If Pelosi supports the bill, she would go against Ranking Members Democrats Maxine Waters and David Scott, who both oppose it. They express concerns that the bill would result in the mass deregulation of crypto and some traditional securities. They see this deregulation severely undermining US capital markets by removing key protections for investors and consumers.

BeInCrypto previously reported that Waters and Scott urged their colleagues to vote against the bill. However, House Democrats leaders have stated they will not whip against the FIT21 bill. As the debate continues, the vote’s outcome and its implications for the future of US crypto regulation remain uncertain.

Bitcoin Pizza Day: A $700 Million Reminder of Cryptocurrency's Rise


							

Bitcoin Pizza Day marks the first documented Bitcoin transaction, now worth $700 million



Early adopter spent over 100,000 BTC on various goods, missing out on immense potential wealth



Bitcoin, despite bearish sentiment, remains a store of value with a rich and celebrated history




On this day in 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based software developer, etched his name in history by purchasing two pizzas with 10,000 Bitcoin (BTC). This marked the first documented commercial transaction using the original cryptocurrency. Five days before the purchase, Laszlo posted a request on the BitcoinTalk forum, seeking to exchange Bitcoin for pizza.



Today, with Bitcoin trading near $70,000, those two Papa John’s pizzas would be valued at over $700 million. Fourteen years ago, they cost a mere $41. This historic transaction is now commemorated annually as Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22, a celebration of the cryptocurrency’s remarkable evolution.







In a 2019 interview with journalist Anderson Cooper, Hanyecz reflected on this transaction, noting that dwelling on the immense Bitcoin fortune exchanged for two pizzas would be counterproductive. Beyond the pizzas, Hanyecz made various other purchases with Bitcoin, spending over 100,000 BTC in total. Had he retained this amount, he could have been among the largest Bitcoin holders today.



Despite Bitcoin’s initial conception as a means of payment, it has not yet achieved widespread adoption for this purpose. However, it has thrived as a store of value, with many holders anticipating price appreciation. Recently, CoinEX launched the “One Bite of Bitcoin” campaign on Bitcoin Pizza Day, inviting the global crypto community to join in the festivities.









Currently, Bitcoin is experiencing a bearish trend. BTC price has dipped by 1.93%, now trading at $69,764. Additionally, the trading volume has declined by 22.90% to $39.98 billion. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has fluctuated between a high of $71,426.98 and a low of $69,191.12.



The value of the Bitcoins spent on the pizzas is also referred to as the Bitcoin Pizza Index. This index serves as a poignant reminder of Bitcoin’s meteoric growth and its unrealized potential. The community’s celebration of Bitcoin Pizza Day underscores the significance of this transaction in the annals of cryptocurrency history.

Two Ethereum-Based Altcoins Witnessing Abrupt Surge in Whale Activity Amid Marketwide Bounce: Santiment - The Daily Hodl


								New data reveals crypto whale transactions are rising for two Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoins as the broader market rallies.

Is the altcoin season ‘maniac phase’ about to flip on?


    Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent surge to a record $71,000, followed by a pullback, has set the stage for what many in the cryptocurrency sector believe could signal the onset of an altcoin season.



The coming two weeks are set to be pivotal for the entire altcoin industry. The United States House of Representatives is preparing to vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).



Additionally, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to vote on spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF)  later this week. Speculation about the likely approval of both the FIT21 bill and the spot Ethereum ETFs has been rife, driving increased activity in the crypto markets.







At press time, the global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $2.73 trillion, a 0.45% decrease in the last 24 hours.



Market movements and trends



The cryptocurrency market began the week with strong bullish momentum, led by Ethereum’s (ETH) recent surge to $3,800, which in turn has driven notable gains across major altcoins. 



Historically, Bitcoin initiates market cycles with a robust surge, but significant action typically unfolds during its consolidation phases, where other cryptocurrencies take the lead. 



This trend is expected to become more pronounced in the upcoming period, driven by varying forecasts from leading analysts



Analysts’ insights



Prominent crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe observed that the altcoin market cap, referred to as TOTAL2, has completed its recent correction. 







Poppe suggested that the altcoin market cap is well-positioned for a rally to retest its all-time high (ATH). Additionally, most altcoins, led by Ethereum, have broken out of a bullish flag pattern in recent days. 



Another well-known analyst, Rekt Capital, noted in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the altcoin market cap, excluding the top 10 cryptocurrencies, has successfully retested the $250 billion level as a support level over recent weeks.

According to his analysis, the altcoin market cap is expected to surge to $315 billion before retracing back to the $250 billion mark. This retracement is projected to be followed by an explosive surge above the $440 billion market capitalization.



Investor sentiment



Prominent analyst  advise investors not to panic and to prepare for the upcoming “maniac phase.” Prominent crypto analyst Crypto Yoddha shared that the recent dip was ‘just a higher low in an uptrend.’



According to his analysis, the altcoin market is looking to retest the $1.27 trillion resistance level seen in March before aiming for the previous cycle’s $1.7 trillion all-time high. He anticipates a bullish continuation leading to a new market all-time high during the next phase.



Contrasting Signals



Despite these optimistic projections, the altcoin season index by Blockchain Center presents a contrasting view. 



According to this index:




“If 75% of the top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days), it is Altcoin Season.” 




Currently, only 37% of the leading 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the past 90 days, still insufficient to officially declare an altcoin season.



The cryptocurrency market stands at a critical juncture, with significant legislative decisions and market movements on the horizon. 



While many analysts are optimistic about the potential onset of a new altcoin season, contrasting indicators suggest investors should proceed with caution. 



The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the direction of the altcoin market, potentially leading to a ‘maniac phase’ or continued consolidation.

Ripple CLO Advocates For Crypto, Cites US SEC Chairman's Inefficiency | Bitcoinist.com


								Stuart Alderoty, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of Ripple Labs has taken a firm stand in support of the cryptocurrency landscape, scathing the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler for his incompetence in overseeing crypto assets.
Ripple CLO Slams Gary Gensler
Today, May 22, Chris Brummer, a professor of Financial Technology at Agnes Williams Sesquicentennial noted that for the first time, the SEC has become a subject of presidential politics.
The SEC chairman Gary Gensler was called out by name by a presidential candidate, which came as a shock to the professor because this has never happened before. Another shocking development highlighted by Brummer was the US president’s Joe Biden threat to veto Congressional legislation regarding the SEC in advance.
The post read:
This is the first time the SEC has become a subject of presidential politics. I don’t recall ever a presidential candidate mentioning the Chair of the SEC by name.  I also don’t remember a sitting President threatening preemptively to veto Congressional legislation about the SEC.
Responding to the professor’s post, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s CLO, believes Gensler has overplayed his hand, which led to the development. Rather than promoting a balanced regulatory environment that fosters growth while safeguarding investors, Alderoty argues that Gensler’s approach mistakenly labels crypto innovation as the problem, as he thought it was an easy target.

According to the Ripple CLO, the regulatory watchdog’s chairman enjoys being the person whom everyone loved to despise. Furthermore, Alderoty draws attention to Gensler’s disdain for accountability to Congress, which is essential for efficient regulation. 
Given his status, the Ripple CLO noted that Gensler misunderstood the role of Congressional oversight in the cryptocurrency sector, believing that he was immune to congressional scrutiny. However, with all of that gone, the chairman is now a struggling political liability, suggesting that Gensler is responsible for several problems in the industry.
Alderoty has also addressed Gensler’s unauthorized overreach in the crypto industry. Following the vote against the SEC’s SAB 121 bulletin last week, the CLO stated that the event demonstrated an agreement between the Democrats and Republicans that the chairman’s unlawful crypto overreach will no longer be accepted.
Gensler Sees Heightened Criticism From Top Crypto Figures
Stuart Alderoty is not the only popular crypto figure who has slammed the SEC’s chairman’s inefficient regulation. On Tuesday, cryptocurrency market observer and Cinneamhain Ventures founder Adam Cochran also attacked Gary Gensler over his lack of clarity regarding Ethereum regulations.

Cochran strongly believes that Ethereum is not a security, unlike the SEC, which thinks the asset fails under the securities law. Thus, Cochran insisted that Gensler explain this in court, calling on Coinbase’s CLO Paul Grewal to make this demand.
This might imply that the founder believes that Gensler might be unable to defend his claims that ETH is a security, asserting that his collapse would be historic.

Ethereum ETF Excitement Sparks Bitcoin and Altcoin Surge


							

Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin will surpass its $73,798 record this week.



The potential green light for an Ethereum ETF fuels optimism, driving Bitcoin’s price surge.



Ethereum and memecoins like Pepe and Floki are also experiencing significant gains amidst renewed bullish sentiment.




Geoff Kendrick, the Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, has predicted a new all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin by the coming weekend. Kendrick noted in an interview that the flagship crypto would surpass the current $73,798 ATH, achieved on March 14, before the weekend is over.



Citing the potential approval of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) this week, the research expert believes it would further legitimize the crypto sector, boosting Bitcoin’s adoption. He asserts that this week’s anticipated new high aligns with his $150,000 target for Bitcoin by year-end and a $200,000 target by December 2025.



Kendrick highlighted the renewed optimism among spot Bitcoin ETF investors, which has invigorated the ecosystem. This has led to increased inflows, bringing the total value to $12.9 billion at the time of the interview. Data from Soso Value shows this figure has since risen to $13.17 billion.



Bitcoin embarked on a significant rally following a recent notice by the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), requesting updates to 19b-4 filings for spot Ethereum. The SEC’s request signaled potential progress toward an Ethereum ETF approval. It also increased the chances of approval from 25% to 75% based on the crypto industry’s sentiments.









Beyond Bitcoin, many altcoins also rallied, signaling a resurgence of bullish sentiment. Pepe and Floki led the memecoin rally, outperforming other cryptocurrencies. Pepe spiked by 59% in the past 48 hours, while Floki gained 30%.



Most notably, Ethereum, the flagship altcoin, broke out of a 5-week range to rally 26% in the past 48 hours. With the surge, Ethereum climbed above multiple resistances, opening the way for retesting this year’s high of $4,093, which it established in March. ETH traded for $3,754 at the time of writing, having retraced slightly from yesterday’s $3,841 high, according to data from TradingView.

Breakneck Growth: Polygon (MATIC) Surpasses 4 Billion Transactions


								Polygon, the Ethereum scaling solution aiming to solve the network’s scalability woes, has blasted past a monumental milestone: 4 billion total transactions. This achievement is particularly impressive considering the network launched just four years ago in June 2020. Bitcoin, for comparison, took a staggering 15 years to reach 1 billion transactions, highlighting the breakneck speed of Polygon’s adoption.

User Surge Fuels Polygon’s Growth Engine
This meteoric rise isn’t just a vanity metric. The number of daily active users on the network paints a vibrant picture of a thriving ecosystem. Since March 19th, Polygon has boasted a streak of over 60 days with an average of over 1 million daily active users.


This surge in user activity is likely fueled by the popularity of decentralized applications (dApps) built on Polygon. Popular names like Matr1x, a mobile-first play-to-earn game, and Galxe, a burgeoning digital identity network, are attracting users and driving transaction volume.
Source: Polygon Scan
However, despite this impressive network growth, the price of MATIC, Polygon’s native token, hasn’t mirrored the enthusiasm. Over the past year, MATIC has remained largely range-bound between $0.5 and $1, significantly underperforming the broader crypto market. This disconnect between network activity and token price has some scratching their heads.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Unpacking The MATIC Price Mystery
Analysts offer a few explanations for this price conundrum. As more users flock to Polygon’s dApps, the demand for MATIC, needed to interact with them, should rise in turn. This could lead to a long-term price appreciation for MATIC. However, others point to the sheer volume of tokens in circulation (over 10 billion) as a potential damper on price increases.

Another factor is the competition. While Polygon is the leading Ethereum scaling solution, other blockchains like Solana boast even higher transaction volumes (over 290 billion in a similar timeframe).

The Future Of Polygon: A Balancing Act
Despite the current price stagnation, experts remain cautiously optimistic about Polygon’s future. The network’s rapid growth and user adoption are undeniable positives. The team behind Polygon is also actively working on scaling solutions and attracting new dApps to its ecosystem.
If they can successfully navigate the competitive landscape and translate network activity into real value for users, MATIC could finally escape its downward trend and embark on a sustained journey upwards.

Oracle Protocols: Bridging the Gap Between Blockchain and the Real World - Coin Edition


							

Oracle protocols bridge the gap between blockchain and real-world data, enhancing the functionality of decentralized applications.



Flare Network integrates Oracle capabilities directly into its blockchain, providing a robust environment for advanced smart contracts.



Arthur Hayes highlights the competition among leading oracle protocols, noting Flare’s potential to revolutionize the industry.




Blockchain technology, known for its decentralized nature, thrives on accurate and reliable data. However, to fully leverage its potential, blockchain applications require information from the real world—data typically not available on the blockchain itself. Oracle protocols provide a solution to this challenge, acting as the critical link between off-chain and on-chain data.



What Are Oracle Protocols?



Oracle protocols are specialized software systems that serve as intermediaries between blockchain networks and external data sources. They enable blockchain applications to utilize real-world data, which is essential for decentralized applications (dApps) to operate effectively. Without oracles, blockchains would remain isolated and unable to access external information necessary for various applications.



Oracles retrieve, verify, and transmit data from outside sources to the blockchain securely and reliably. This process is crucial for smart contracts, which depend on accurate and timely data to function correctly. For example, oracles can provide real-time price feeds from traditional markets to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, enabling services like lending, borrowing, and trading based on up-to-date market data.



Furthermore, Oracle Protocols empower dApps to make informed decisions based on real-world events. Whether tracking the condition of goods in a supply chain, determining the outcome of a sports event for a betting platform, or triggering an insurance policy based on weather conditions, oracles connect blockchain technology with real-world data, enhancing the practical application and effectiveness of dApps.



How Oracles Link On-Chain and Off-Chain Data



Oracles facilitate a seamless flow of information between blockchain environments and external data sources. The process begins with an off-chain source, such as a web API, database, or sensor in a connected device. The oracle retrieves this data and verifies its accuracy and reliability through multiple stages to minimize the risk of manipulation or errors.



In decentralized oracle networks like Chainlink, this verification process involves collecting and cross-checking the same data from multiple nodes. These nodes compare their results and reach a consensus before the verified data is transmitted to the blockchain. Financial incentives, such as staking and rewards schemes, align node operators’ interests with the accuracy of the data they provide.









The confirmed data is then relayed to the blockchain, where it can be used by smart contracts and other dApps. This relay process often includes additional security measures to ensure the data remains untampered. Cryptographic methods can secure the data during transmission, and time-stamping techniques ensure the data is current and relevant.



Accuracy and data integrity are paramount in this process. The reliability of smart contracts and dApps depends on the correctness of the data they use. Incorrect or outdated information from an oracle can lead to erroneous contract executions, financial losses, or other unintended outcomes. Therefore, oracles employ rigorous methods to retrieve, verify, and transmit data, ensuring blockchain applications operate as intended and make sound decisions based on the most accurate data.



How Flare Network Uses Oracle Technology



Flare Network is a protocol that integrates smart contract technology with Oracle capabilities. Unlike traditional oracles that provide data to blockchains, Flare incorporates these features directly into its blockchain architecture. This integration creates a robust environment for building and managing smart contracts with reliable data.



Flare’s approach involves validators within its network who are responsible for obtaining and verifying external data, ensuring network integrity, and earning rewards for their contributions. Key components of Flare include the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) and the Data Connector. The Data Connector allows Flare to access data from various external sources, including other blockchains and online services, while the FTSO handles time-sensitive data, which is crucial for applications needing real-time information.



By offering these integrated features, Flare facilitates the development of advanced and versatile smart contracts. The network’s ability to gather and process data streams from multiple sources ensures the accuracy and timeliness of the information available, promoting the creation of applications that depend on precise and up-to-date data without additional costs.



Insights from Arthur Hayes



Arthur Hayes, in his article “Igniting the Oracle Wars: Keep an Eye on Flare,” discusses the competition among leading oracle protocols—Chainlink, Pyth, and Flare. As blockchain applications grow more complex, the importance of oracles increases, making this competition critical.



Chainlink, the industry leader, benefits from a robust network and extensive integrations. However, it faces challenges with speed and managing large data volumes, as well as centralized price feed management. Pyth excels in providing rapid, precise price updates, particularly useful for financial applications.



Flare combines the strengths of both Chainlink and Pyth, offering unique features like the Data Connector and FTSO. This integration directly links Oracle services with its smart contract platform, allowing Flare to generate revenue from both data services and smart contracts. Hayes predicts that the protocol that best handles future challenges, such as managing large datasets for AI applications, will dominate the “Oracle Wars.” Although Chainlink currently leads, Flare’s innovative approach and expanding ecosystem position it as a formidable competitor.



Conclusion



Oracle protocols are essential in the blockchain ecosystem. They enable smart contracts to utilize real-world data, thus enhancing the flexibility and utility of decentralized applications. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, Oracles will play a crucial role in supporting more sophisticated and diverse applications. Keeping abreast of advancements in Oracle technology is vital, especially with emerging protocols like Flare that have the potential to transform the industry and drive new innovations.

Ethereum ETF Launch Potentially Still Weeks Away, Says Bloomberg Analyst - Benzinga

Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on Monday pointed out that the listing of spot Ethereum ETFs could be weeks or even longer away, despite recent developments.What Haeppened: At least five potential spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETF issuers, including Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares and Franklin, have filed their amended 19b-4s through CBOE.These amendments primarily involve the removal of staking-related content, emphasizing that the Fund’s ETH cannot be staked by anyone.In his tweet, Seyffart stated, “It’s happening. We have at least 5 of the potential Ethereum ETF issuers that have submitted their Amended 19b-4’s in the last ~25 min. Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares, & Franklin all submitted via CBOE.”Despite these submissions, Seyffart noted that the launch of these ETFs might still be a long way off. “Still a potentially long way from a launch. But these filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate. Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s AND THEN we need to see S-1 approvals. Could be weeks or more before ETFs launch,” he explained.The only substantial change identified in the revised filings was the removal of staking language. Seyffart said, “This is the only meaningful & substantial change that I can find? Removing the staking language and adding very clear language that the Fund’s ETH cannot be staked by anyone.”Despite these modifications, the approval odds remain at 75%, as highlighted by Seyffart, though he added, “Not that it even means anything anymore haha.”Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Ethereum ETFs Could Drive ‘Mass Adoption’ — What Investors Need To Know NowAdding to the complexity, Scott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital highlighted the extensive review process the SEC typically undertakes. He explained that the SEC’s review of BTC spot and futures S-1s took several months, suggesting a similar timeline could apply here.Johnsson said, “SEC spent nearly 4 months reviewing and iterating BTC spot S-1s and 5 months reviewing BTC futures S-1s. If Division of Corporation Finance indeed was told about this potential approval yesterday, then they’re likely just getting started. Nothing about this situation is straightforward, so difficult to know how quickly they try to push forward this process.”What’s Next: The implications of these developments and other regulatory trends in the digital asset space will be further explored at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This event will bring together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.Read Next: SEC Could Approve Spot Ethereum ETF ‘This Week:’ ReportImage: Shutterstock

WisdomTree's Bitcoin, Ethereum ETPs to debut on London Stock Exchange next week - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            WisdomTree, a global exchange-traded fund (ETF) and exchange-traded product (ETP) sponsor, has secured the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) approval to list its WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), according to a press release published today. The listing, expected to occur on May 28, will initially cater exclusively to professional investors.As previously reported by Crypto Briefing, May 28 is also expected to be the debut date of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on the LSE.This move positions WisdomTree among the first to receive FCA endorsement for a crypto ETP prospectus. Institutions in Europe can now gain exposure to crypto backed by Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, via these ETPs.With a Total Expense Ratio (TER) of just 0.35%, WisdomTree’s upcoming crypto ETPs are among the most cost-efficient options for investors in the region.Commenting on the latest development, Alexis Marinof, Head of Europe at WisdomTree, said the FCA approval not only facilitates easier access for UK investors but also removes the regulatory hurdles that previously discouraged investors from entering the market.“While UK-based professional investors have been able to allocate to crypto ETPs via overseas exchanges, they will soon have a more convenient access point,” Marinof stated.“FCA approval in this respect could result in greater institutional adoption of the asset class, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to regulatory limitations and uncertainty – we would expect FCA approval of our crypto ETPs’ prospectus to remove those barriers to entry,” he added.WisdomTree’s commitment to providing secure, regulated investment vehicles for crypto assets began in 2019 with the launch of the WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP.The firm has since expanded its offerings to encompass a suite of eight physically backed crypto ETPs. These ETPs provide exposure to both individual cryptocurrencies and diversified baskets, and are available for trading on multiple European exchanges.In March this year, WisdomTree announced it secured the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval to operate as a New York limited-purpose trust company charter. This development allows WisdomTree to offer fiduciary custody of digital assets, issue DFS-approved stablecoins, and manage stablecoin reserves.[Update with context in the second paragraph]

GameStop Price Crashes, Buy The Dip Or Sell GME? This Solana Meme Coin ICO Raises / Cryptonews
                        Just over one week on from legendary GameStop investor Roaring Kitty’s abrupt return to social media for the first time since 2021, the GameStop (GME) price has crashed, with retail investors asking whether now might be the time to buy the dip or sell GME.The GameStop price rallied as high as $65 last Tuesday but has since crashed back to $22.That leaves it barely 20% above its levels from before Roaring Kitty’s return.Roaring Kitty was a leading figure in the 2021 meme stock craze, during which time GME was a leading stock.The 2021 meme stock craze was viewed by many as a retail investor-led movement against Wall Street hegemony.Hopes remain high amongst retail investors that Roaring Kitty’s return could catalyze a new meme stock season.US Presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy even announced on Monday that he had invested $24,000 in GME.But macro conditions likely don’t warrant a repeat of 2021 meme stock mania.The US government isn’t currently handing out stimulus cheques.And while US equity markets are pushing on to new record highs, interest rates remain at multi-decade highs.Recent years of inflation plus high interest rates have put a major squeeze on retail investor spending firepower.Also, there is good reason to be bearish on the GameStop price. GME is an inflationary asset – the company last week announced a new stock sale.Meanwhile, the company continues to run at a loss and cut jobs as it struggles with e-commerce competitors.GME Investors Should Instead Consider Meme Coins 
Traders looking to make speculative bets on assets that could see huge market hype-driven gains can do better than GME.As noted above, the outlook for the GameStop price isn’t necessarily good as it has bad fundamentals and is inflationary.Its also got a bloated market cap of around $6.5 billion.For a company that probably isn’t worth anything in real life, that’s potentially a very large overvaluation.And that reduces the likelihood of anything more than 5x gains this bull cycle.Traders considering GME should instead consider crypto meme coins.Top meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe are likely to continue to grow as crypto technology is adopted.However, their bloated market caps suggest that they also have limited room for upside.Luckily, new meme coins are popping up every day. While most are scams or pump-and-dumps, savvy traders may be able to uncover hidden 100x gems.One such coin that analysts at Cryptonews are very bullish on is Solana meme coin ICO Sealana (SEAL).Sealana (SEAL) – The Best Solana Meme Coin ICO Right Now
South Park-themed Seal cartoon character Sealana has been generating huge excitement since launching its presale.The new Solana meme coin ICO features an overweight, Solana meme coin trading degen seal called Sealana.The loveable seal mascot has already attracted over $2.35 million in funds from early investors.Strong demand is no surprise given the strong traction Sealana has been getting across socials.Sealana has already garnered over 5,000 X followers, as well as over 5,000 on Telegram.Sealana’s marketing and presale success is reminiscent of the recently launched Solana meme coin Slothana (SLOTH).Slothana raised over $15 million in a similar presale. However, it then went on to pump to a market cap of over $100 million, as per DEXTools.Presale investors were up over 5x within just a few days of the token’s launch. That more than could likely be expected from the GameStop price in the near future.SLOTH also just launched on the top-ten crypto exchange HTX. This could lead to a new push higher in its price as new retail investors flood in.Amid rumors that the Slothana and Sealana teams are related, traders will hope SEAL’s success matches SLOTH’s.If Sealana can quickly secure exchange listings post-launch like SLOTH, it could easily be the best new Solana meme coin ICO to buy right now.Investors can buy their SEAL by connecting their web3 wallet on Sealana’s official website with SOL, ETH, USDT, or USDC. Sealana is also available for purchase via card.Buy Sealana Here

Bitcoin Price Alert: 273,000 BTC Held at Key Bitcoin Supply Range

As Bitcoin teeters near $70,000, analysts are closely watching a critical supply zone for the largest cryptocurrency. This range is crucial because it represents a key area where a substantial amount of Bitcoin was acquired.Crypto analyst Ali has identified a key supply zone for Bitcoin, situated between $70,180 and $70,600, where over 450,000 addresses have collectively acquired approximately 273,000 BTC.  The supply zone is an important area on the price chart that often acts as a barrier to upward price movements. It is where a large number of Bitcoin was previously bought, and holders may look to break even or take profits, potentially leading to increased selling pressure. Following a steady rebound from May 1 lows of $56,500, Bitcoin reached highs of $71,980 on May 21 before encountering resistance. At the time of writing, BTC was sustaining its declines from the prior day, down 1.91% in the last 24 hours to $69,998. Potential scenariosAs Bitcoin approaches the highlighted critical supply zone, several scenarios could unfold:If Bitcoin manages to break above the $70,600 level with strong volume, it could signal a continuation of the bullish trend. This would likely attract additional buyers, pushing the price higher and potentially establishing a new support level.On the other hand, if Bitcoin faces significant selling pressure within this range, it could lead to a price rejection and subsequent pullback. This scenario would indicate that many holders want to realize profits, resulting in temporary resistance.Another possibility is that Bitcoin consolidates below this range for a while. This would imply a balance between buyers and sellers ahead of a major price movement.As Bitcoin considers its next move, price behavior around the $70,000 mark would be closely watched given the sheer volume of BTC accumulated in this area. Based on the MVRV Pricing Bands, Ali believes that if Bitcoin continues to trade above $65,125, the next local BTC peak before a temporary drop around $77,593.

Ethereum Spot ETFs: When Will They Begin Trading In The Event Of An SEC Approval? | Bitcoinist.com


								Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has provided insights into when the Spot Ethereum ETFs could begin trading if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were to approve these funds. Based on his remarks, it could take weeks to months before these funds launch, even if an approval would come this week. 
S-1 Filings Need To Be Approved Before Trading Can Commence 
Seyffart mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the S-1 approvals are needed before the Spot Ethereum ETFs can go live and that it could take “weeks to months” for this approval to come in. He made this statement while clarifying that their 75% approval odds only related to the deadline for the 19b-4 filings, with VanEck’s and Ark 21Shares’ final deadline coming up on May 23 and 24, respectively. 

Seyffart and his colleague Eric Balchunas predict that the SEC will likely approve at least VanEck’s application on or before May 23 since this is the final deadline for the Commission to decide on it. Before now, the SEC was expected to deny these applications, mainly because there were reports that it considered Ethereum a security. 
However, Balchunas revealed in an X post that the Commission had become willing to approve these funds due to an “increasingly political issue.” The SEC has already shown a willingness to approve these funds, having informed Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to update their filings.
Insiders have also claimed that the SEC’s feedback to these exchanges is a positive signal and shows that the regulator might be ready to approve these investment funds. Steven McClurg, the head of US asset management for CoinShares, also told Reuters that it could take months for the Ethereum ETFs to begin trading since, unlike the exchange filings, there is no set timeframe for the SEC to approve the registration filings.  
However, the SEC has shown that it can approve both the 19b-4 and S-1 filings simultaneously, just like it did with the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which immediately went live thanks to this. The only difference between then and now is that the SEC constantly communicated with the issuers weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs were approved. 
Fidelity And Grayscale Remove Staking Plans From Ethereum Spot ETFs
Asset managers Fidelity and Grayscale have removed their staking plans in their updated S1-filings. This was expected, considering that the staking feature is a huge part of why the SEC is rumored to consider ETH a security. However, removing this staking offering again suggests that the SEC will approve these funds as long as ETH staking isn’t included. 

Meanwhile, Seyffart noted in an X post that their approval odds still stand at 75% since the removal of the staking plans was expected.  
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,700, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Crypto Analyst Alex Krüger Revises Ethereum Outlook Amid SEC Rumors | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 21 May 2024, prominent macroeconomist and crypto analyst Alex Krüger provided new insights on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) regarding the potential for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve spot Ethereum ETFs. Krüger, who founded the asset management and advisory firm Aike Capital, offered a detailed analysis reflecting the rapidly changing sentiment in the cryptocurrency market.



Until this week, Krüger had been pessimistic about the likelihood of the SEC approving any spot Ethereum ETFs this year or soon. However, recent developments have prompted a reevaluation. On 20 May 2024, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart significantly increased their estimated odds of SEC approval for spot ETH ETFs from 25% to 75%. This adjustment was based on emerging rumors suggesting that the SEC might be reconsidering its stance, driven by political considerations.



Balchunas shared the updated odds on X, noting that the shift was fueled by afternoon chatter indicating a possible reversal in the SEC’s approach to this increasingly politicized issue. This unexpected development has caused market participants to scramble to adjust their positions, many of whom had previously assumed that ETF approvals would be denied.







In his analysis, Krüger acknowledged the potential impact of these rumors. He stated that his base case scenario had been:



Bitcoin rising significantly by the end of the year.Ethereum underperforming due to the expected rejection of spot ETH ETF proposals by the SEC.Ethereum outperforming post the U.S. presidential elections in November 2024, driven by a potential change in SEC leadership and subsequent approval of spot ETH ETFs in 2025.



However, the possibility of an SEC approval, possibly as early as this week, could accelerate these timelines. Krüger emphasized that the market had not fully priced in such an approval, suggesting that Ethereum could see a substantial rally if the approval were granted.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Krüger explained that the current market movements were primarily driven by repositioning and the closing of short positions, as the possibility of an SEC approval caught many off guard. He predicted that if approval were granted, it would lead to significant inflows into Ethereum, potentially pushing its price to all-time highs (ATHs).



He cautioned against underestimating the potential for approval, highlighting that such a decision could reinvigorate bullish sentiment and cause Ethereum to lead the market. Despite the day’s rally, he pointed out that ETH/BTC was still down year-to-date, indicating room for further growth.







Krüger also touched on the political dynamics influencing the SEC’s stance. He suggested that the seeming shift in the SEC’s approach might be politically driven, possibly influenced by the upcoming elections and the need to counteract former President Donald Trump’s recent pro-crypto stance.



He noted that if the SEC rejects the spot ETH ETF proposals, which he now views as unlikely, the market could experience significant pain. He advised traders to stay alert and monitor developments closely until the SEC’s decision on May 23rd.







Krüger also delvec into the political dynamics influencing the SEC’s stance. He posits that the seeming change in the SEC’s approach may be driven by top Democratic party members, potentially influenced by the upcoming elections. He believes this shift could be a reaction to former President Donald Trump’s recent support for cryptocurrency, forcing a strategic move from the Democrats to not appear anti-crypto.

                        The Bonk price has risen by almost 1% today, reaching $0.00003187 as the wider crypto market drops by 0.5% in the past 24 hours.BONK is now up by 31% in a week and by 54% in a month, with the Solana-based meme token also up by a whopping 7,900% in a year.And these gains come at a time when prominent trader TheCryptoDog has suggested that attention is turning to BONK, presaging a possible rally in the near future.Bonk Price Prediction as Millionaire Trader TheCryptoDog Says BONK is About to Rally – Time to Buy?
Bonk is showing some signs of a minor correction after the surging of the past couple of days, with its indicators reflecting a dip in momentum.In particular, its RSI (purple) has declined from 85 on Sunday/Monday almost 50 today, with the coin having plenty of room to slip further before becoming decidedly oversold.Source: TradingViewHaving said that, its other indicators don’t seem too bad, with its 30-day average (orange) still rising steadily beyond the 200-day average (blue), even if it isn’t rising quite as steeply today.What’s particularly positive is that BONK’s volume remains high at just over $800 million, up from $180 million only a few days ago.Also bullish are BONK’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels, which are both rising in parallel, suggesting that the coin will trade within a consistently rising band.Much of the coin’s increased volume has come from renewed interest from whales, as recent data indicates.Such interest could continue for a while yet, with the wider market looking as though it’s entering a new bull phase.This is largely because the SEC looks ready to approve several spot-based Ethereum ETFs, with the deadline for a batch coming tomorrow.While any approval will not directly affect BONK, it will at least boost market-wide bullishness, thereby helping the Bonk price.And for some traders, BONK looks likelier than many other meme tokens to rally in the very near future.This is the opinion of TheCryptoDog, for instance, who has recently posted on X that the coin seems to be attracting more interest than many of its rivals.As such, we may see the Bonk price reach $0.000035 in the next few weeks, before potentially returning to its ATH of $0.00004547 by Q4.New Meme Tokens Could Bring Bigger Rallies
Bonk does look ready to surge in the near future, yet it’s not the only Solana-based meme token with good potential right now.There are also a range of presale tokens that are gaining hype and momentum, with some of these likely to perform very well once they list.A prime candidate is Sealana (SEAL), a new meme coin that has raised just over $2.3 million in its increasingly popular sale.Aiming to follow in the footsteps of BONK, WIF and other out-performing Solana-based meme coins, SEAL is already attracting a sizeable following online.This is partly thanks to its meme stylings, with the token adopting a gun-toting yet amiable seal as its anthropomorphic mascot.One interesting feature of Sealana is that it will actually be a multi-chain meme coin, with an Ethereum version of the token already live.Given the early success of its presale, it’s likely to enjoy a big listing once it launches in the next few weeks.In the meantime, investors can still buy it via its presale by going to the official Sealana website.It’s available at a conversion rate 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which is roughly worth $0.026 per token.VIDEOIt may quickly supersede such a price once it goes live, potentially turning itself into a rival of BONK and other SOL-based coins.Buy SEAL Today

Kangamoon presale nears 7M as Uniswap (UNI) price jumps on response to SEC's Wells Notice - CoinJournal



                    

                    
The robust rebuttal from Uniswap against the SEC’s allegations has sent shockwaves through the crypto market.
The price of Uniswap (UNI) surged to a high of $9.67 following the news of the tough response.
As UNI price rises, another new altcoin Kangamoon (KANG) is also making waves as its presale nears $7M.

The Uniswap (UNI) price is soaring following Uniswap Labs’ formidable response to the SEC’s Wells Notice. Although the token has slightly pulled back, it surged by more than 30% immediately after the news of the response broke.
The response has not only bolstered investor confidence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector but also ignited positive sentiment for other altcoins, notably Kangamoon (KANG), which is currently in the midst of its presale.
The 40-page response to SEC’s Wells Notice
Uniswap Labs filed a comprehensive 40-page response to the SEC’s Wells Notice, vehemently contesting the agency’s claims that Uniswap’s operations may violate US securities laws.
The decentralized crypto exchange argued against potential lawsuits, urging the SEC to reconsider its stance. Uniswap refuted the SEC’s assertions, labeling them as “weak” and citing court rulings that contradicted the agency’s legal arguments.
Moreover, Uniswap challenged the SEC’s expansive interpretation of securities laws, emphasizing that the agency’s allegations were based on unreasonable extensions of key definitions such as securities, exchanges, and contracts.
The platform also highlighted that the majority of its trading volume did not involve securities, as per the SEC’s own standards, and that most of its users were from outside the US, potentially exempting them from US securities laws.
The new meme coin making waves alongside Uniswap (UNI)
As Uniswap continues its legal battle with the SEC, another project, Kangamoon, is making waves in the crypto space with its unique approach to meme coins and community engagement.
Kangamoon aims to establish itself as a prominent meme coin while integrating elements of SocialFi and Play To Earn (P2E).
The project promises an immersive gaming experience where players can earn rewards in the form of $KANG tokens and exclusive NFTs by participating in challenges and competitions.
Currently in its presale phase, Kangamoon has already raised a significant amount of nearing the $7 million mark.
Notably, the presale offers early investors an opportunity to acquire $KANG tokens at a favorable price before the official launch of the platform. It has garnered attention from investors and enthusiasts alike, drawn to its innovative concept and potential for community-driven growth.
Participants in the Kangamoon presale can look forward to claiming their tokens once the presale concludes.
The project’s team has assured that detailed instructions for token claiming will be provided through various channels, including the official website, social media platforms, newsletters, and Telegram.
Conclusion
The surge in Uniswap (UNI) price following Uniswap Labs’ response to the SEC’s Wells Notice has injected optimism into the cryptocurrency market, benefiting projects like Kangamoon whose presale is underway.
As both crypto projects navigate regulatory challenges and strive for success, they exemplify the resilience and innovation inherent in the crypto space.

DOT Explodes Above $7.5 but Watch This Metric Closely: Polkadot Price Analysis


																Polkadot has recently witnessed a surge in demand, leading to a price uptick that has breached its previous swing high and broken through a multi-month descending trendline. The price is now approaching the upper boundary of its consolidation range and is on the brink of surpassing it.
Technical Analysis
By Shayan
The Daily Chart
A detailed analysis of Polkadot’s daily chart shows that after a prolonged phase of sideways consolidation, a renewed spike in demand has pushed the price higher. This surge has allowed Polkadot to break through several key resistance levels, including a descending multi-month trendline, the prior swing high of $7.47, and the 200-day moving average.
Now, the price is approaching the upper boundary of this long-standing range and is on the verge of breaking above it.
If the buyers manage to push above this range, it could signal the beginning of a sustained bullish trend. However, if selling pressure intensifies, a bearish reversal towards the lower boundary is possible. The price action around this crucial resistance zone will determine Polkadot’s short-term trajectory.
Source: TradingView
The 4-Hour Chart
In the 4-hour timeframe, Polkadot’s recent bullish momentum is more evident, with the price experiencing a 12% impulsive spike towards a significant resistance area.
This critical range is bounded by the 0.5 ($7.415) and the 0.618 ($7.821) Fibonacci levels. Nevertheless, the price has been fluctuating within an ascending wedge pattern for an extended period, and following the recent surge in demand, it is now slightly retracing towards its upper boundary.
If the buyers can breach the substantial resistance at $7.8, the next target will be the upper boundary of the wedge in the mid-term.
Conversely, a bearish reversal could lead to another downward move, aiming for the wedge’s lower boundary. A decisive breakout from the wedge pattern is necessary to determine Polkadot’s upcoming direction.
Source: TradingView
Sentiment Analysis
By Shayan
Polkadot’s price has recently experienced a notable surge, raising expectations of a potential mid-term bullish trend. Hence, analyzing the futures market sentiment is crucial to assess whether this uptrend will persist, as futures market positions are significant drivers of volatility.
This chart illustrates the funding rate and open interest metrics alongside Polkadot’s daily price movements. Despite the recent bullish surge, both open interest and funding rates have not shown a significant increase and remain near their lowest levels. This suggests that the recent price action was not driven by increased bullish activity in the perpetual markets.
While Polkadot’s price has surged, the sustainability of this uptrend depends on the futures market sentiment. If open interest and funding rates begin to rise, it will signal strong bullish momentum, potentially solidifying the uptrend. Conversely, if these metrics remain low, the uptrend may lack the necessary support for long-term continuation. Traders should closely watch these indicators to better understand the market’s direction in the coming weeks.

AI predicts XRP price for August 1, 2024


    With many assets in the cryptocurrency sector starting to stagnate after recent bullish price action, the same is happening to XRP, but artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms predict further improvements for this crypto asset in the following several months.



As it happens, XRP has halted its bullish advances from the previous days and has dropped back below the previously surpassed critical price level at $0.53, demonstrating the beginning of a consolidation noticeable in other assets in the crypto market as well.



XRP price prediction



Specifically, one of the popular AI algorithms, which takes into account historical XRP price movements, technical analysis (TA) indicators, chart patterns, and other relevant factors, has set the price of XRP on August 1, 2024, at $0.384764, which would suggest a drop of 27.29% from its current price.







3-month XRP price prediction. Source: CoinCodex



Elsewhere, the newest model of the OpenAI invention ChatGPT, called GPT-4o, has set the price of XRP for August 1, 2024, in the range of $1.24 – $3.30, taking into account both “median expert expectations [and] bullish predictions and favorable legal outcomes,” as well as supply, demand, and market dynamics. 



Additionally, the recent Anthropic AI model, Claude 3 Opus, has offered the XRP price prediction in the range of $0.838 – $2.23 by August 2024, considering “market dynamics, regulatory developments, and the outcome of Ripple’s legal case” with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Notably, it has also explained that Ripple’s strategic partnerships could positively affect the acceptance of XRP and, with it, the token’s price action:




“Ripple has established partnerships with numerous banks and financial institutions, indicating growing adoption and integration of XRP into mainstream financial systems.”




XRP price analysis



Currently, XRP is changing hands at $0.52919, suggesting a decline of 2.19% in the last 24 hours but still recording an increase of 4.24% across the previous seven days and yet accumulating a drop of 1.08% on its monthly chart, as per data on May 22.

Earlier, crypto analyst Maximus Prime observed that XRP recently encountered rejection at the symmetrical trendline, a critical resistance level, stressing that XRP will have to “fight its way back into it and hold above,” adding that the two-week chart presented a bearish outlook but that bulls were still trying.







At the same time, EGRAG Crypto highlighted that XRP was showing “inclining steps to the upside” – a bullish sign visible “even if you’re not a chart analyst” – and a “solid trajectory” with the next pivotal target at $0.75, projecting consolidation followed by a pump and “the grand finale” in an X post on May 21.

All things considered, AI and experts’ bullish XRP predictions might be correct, but doing one’s own research, weighing the risks, and keeping up with any relevant XRP news and Ripple news is critical before investing a significant amount of money in this token, as trends can change.

SEC's tough stance on crypto continues: Gary Gensler slams 'FIT 21' Act - AMBCrypto



Gary Gensler has opposed the “FIT 21” Act, citing regulatory gaps and risks to investors.
SEC’s crypto stance before the 2024 elections could majorly sway voter sentiment.

As former President Donald Trump starts accepting crypto donations for his 2024 presidential campaign, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has voiced his opposition against the crypto market bill.
Gensler’s sudden move 
In a statement released on the 22nd of May, Chair Gary Gensler publicly voiced his opposition to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (“FIT 21” Act).
The FIT 21 Act is a U.S. legislation aimed at promoting the development of new financial instruments and technologies while establishing a framework for their regulation and oversight.
Gensler stated,
“Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (“FIT 21”) would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.”
He further added,
“The bill allows issuers of crypto investment contracts to self-certify that their products are a ‘decentralized’ system and then be deemed a special class of ‘digital commodities’ and thus not subject to SEC oversight.”
Such a strong stance by the SEC Chair ahead of the 2024 presidential election has sent shockwaves throughout the crypto community.
Crypto enthusiasts unhappy 
Underlining the unprecedented involvement of the SEC in presidential politics, journalist Chris Brummer took to X (formerly Twitter) and noted,
Source: Chris Brummer
Echoing a similar line of thought, Ripple’s CLO, Stuart Alderoty, said,
“Gensler overplayed his hand. He thought crypto was an easy target. He relished being the guy that everyone loved to hate.”
He further went on and opined,
“He thought he was above Congressional oversight. That’s all gone. He’s now a struggling political liability.”
In a separate earlier interview, SEC Chair Gary Gensler voiced his frustration over the “outsized ratio” of crypto-related inquiries compared to those about traditional finance.
“Crypto is a small piece of our overall markets. But, it’s an outsized piece of the scams and frauds and problems in the markets.”
Impact on the upcoming elections 
These developments might have a significant impact on President Joe Biden’s position in the upcoming election.
His administration’s cautious stance on cryptocurrency, as reflected in Chair Gensler’s regulatory approach, contrasts sharply with Donald Trump’s pro-crypto moves.
Hence, the difference in their approaches may sway voters, especially those supportive of cryptocurrencies.

Probe finds Effective Ventures charity acted ‘diligently’ after FTX collapse


A UK government inquiry into an FTX-backed charity that received $26.8 million in donations, has concluded that its trustees acted ‘quickly’ and ‘diligently’ protecting the charity’s funds in the wake of the crypto exchange’s high-profile collapse. 
In 2022, Effective Ventures Foundation (EV) filed a Serious Incident Report with the Charity Commission, informing it that FTX, one of the charity’s major funders, had filed for bankruptcy amid reports of criminal activity. It also informed the commission that the CEO of FTX Foundation and an unpaid advisor to the FTX Future Fund made up two of EV’s trustees.
The commission subsequently launched a probe to determine ‘the extent of any risk to the charity’s assets and the extent to which the trustees were complying with their legal duties’ and to investigate ‘the governance and administration of the charity by the trustees, including relationships between the charity’s trustees and its funders and the identification and management of conflicts of interest.’
The investigation, which concluded with the publication of the commission’s report, revealed that EV trustees effectively ‘ringfenced’ its FTX funding of £3.3 million and $300,000 by informing the National Crime Agency that its FTX donated funds may be criminal as to avoid any money laundering offenses. 
The UK and US arms of EV also agreed to pay FTX a total of $26.8 million in 2022. The charity recently also listed for sale Wytham Abbey, the manor house that it bought with a £17 million ($21.5 million) grant in 2021.
EV bought the 15th-century manor using a £17 million grant unrelated to FTX.

The report also found that the charity excluded the two FTX-linked trustees from any decisions and discussions relating to the FTX bankruptcy, labeling them ‘non-participating’ trustees. The inquiry noted that there was a ‘lack of clarity’ around whether the FTX-linked trustees were acting for the charity or on behalf of FTX Foundation at any given time.
It stressed, however, that there was “no evidence” to suggest any unmanaged conflicts of interest or that the FTX-linked trustees acted against EV’s interests. The two reportedly resigned during the inquiry. 
The inquiry concluded, “Trustees acted diligently and quickly in assessing the risk to the charity and installed measures to protect their assets and continued operations.” It added that despite “highlighted weaknesses within the charity and its governance the trustees sought to put these things right at the earliest opportunity.”

Trump Accepting Crypto Donations In The US Election


                                Donald Trump's Strategic Move In the US Election                                What’s The NewsAll the candidates are putting in maximum effort for their campaigns for the US presidential election to be held in November. Current president and Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden is using safety and work record as his main tools in his campaign to secure victory. Meanwhile, potential Republican candidate Donald Trump has made a bold move by announcing that he will accept cryptocurrency donations for his election campaign thereby changing the entire direction of the US election. According to information collected by CoinGabbar, a notice was issued yesterday stating that the Trump 2024 Campaign has launched a fundraising page using the Coinbase Commerce product, allowing eligible individuals to donate in crypto. The website features logos of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, XRP, USD Coin, Solana, and ZRX.  According to the information, Elon Musk is considering Shiba Inu and Dogecoin as the better investment option.It's worth noting that Donald Trump recently held a dinner for those who bought NFTs featuring his mugshot from the time he surrendered at the Georgia jail. During this event, he asked his supporters to donate to his campaign in cryptocurrency.The president's support is a big boost for the US crypto industry which has ramped up lobbying efforts and has spent millions on the upcoming 2024 elections. This has become a new focus area for Trump to continue bashing Biden. He also disagreed with the administration’s stance on the matter, pointing out that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been aggressively antagonistic towards crypto companies for failing to register with the agency. “The Democrats are very much against it,” Trump stated.Cryptocurrency Becomes The Center Of Attraction Amid US ElectionCryptocurrency has become the center point of the US presidential election. The two parties have different views on cryptocurrency. Democratic Party candidate and current President Joe Biden has never shown support for cryptocurrency.  Actions and investigations by the SEC against crypto exchanges during his tenure indicate that he does not consider cryptocurrency favorable. On the other hand, potential Republican candidate Donald Trump has shown a positive attitude toward crypto since the beginning of his campaign. He has also deemed the SEC investigations into crypto exchanges as wrong. Trump aims to directly connect with the crypto community by accepting cryptocurrencies as donations for his campaign. For your information, about 50% of the young population in the US are crypto investors. Trump's target is to connect with this demographic directly. If the crypto community supports Trump in the presidential election, his victory could be assured. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's indifferent attitude towards crypto continues to widen the gap between him and the crypto community, which could be a significant disadvantage for him in the election.Also Read: First-Ever Standalone Crypto Legislation By The U.S.

Tether mints another $1 billion USDT this week; Is a market pump ahead?


    Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, has minted an additional 1 billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, fueling speculation about a potential market surge. 



This development coincides with the crypto community’s anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision on a spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF), expected later this week.







Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, clarified on X (formerly Twitter) that this issuance was for “inventory replenishment” and was an “authorized but not issued transaction.”







This means the tokens will be used as inventory for future issuance requests and chain swaps, but are not yet in circulation. This move is viewed by market analysts as a strategic preparation for a potential market rally fueled by the expected approval of an ETH ETF.



Ivan Sherbakov, CEO of Cryptorobotics, speculated that  this influx of liquidity will be used to pump the market ahead of ETF news.







Historically, an increase in USDT supply has been linked with broader upward trends in the crypto market, leading to increased trading volumes and a more vibrant digital asset environment.



Tether’s market impact



As of May 22, Tether’s Transparency page shows $87.8 million worth of these USDT tokens on Ethereum. Tether’s market cap has grown significantly over the past year, exceeding $111 billion and accounting for roughly 70% of the stablecoin market. 



This growth has been driven by various factors, including the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and Tether’s diversification into areas like Bitcoin mining.



Concerns and considerations



Despite the positive market implications, some analysts have expressed concerns about Tether’s lack of transparency. Deutsche Bank analysts have highlighted potential risks associated with Tether’s significant market dominance.



With the total stablecoin market capitalization exceeding $160.9 billion, Tether holds a significant share. 



These transparency issues and market dominance continue to be debated among analysts and investors, even as Tether’s actions could trigger significant market movements if the ETF is approved.

Bitcoin key support and resistance levels to watch for a possible breakout


    Bitcoin (BTC) revisited the $70,000 price zone in a bullish seven days, powered by macroeconomic indicators and overall positive sentiments in the cryptocurrency market. Finbold looked for insights on key support and resistance levels to watch for in the last week of May.



Notably, Bitcoin has been trading in a well-defined range since March, from $60,000 to $72,000. During this time, BTC has made two brief deviations—of two days each—from the price range. One in mid-March made an all-time high at $73,805, and the other in early May flash-crashed to $56,590.



Therefore, the $60,000 and the $72,000 levels remain the most important support and resistance to watch for. A breakout, followed by confirmation with increased volume, from any of these levels would bring a more aggressive move.







In the meantime, the $70,000 price makes a relevant psychological resistance that Bitcoin is currently testing. Moreover, the 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA) has also been a key level, now making support at $65,200/btc.

Bitcoin on-chain data for key support and resistance levels



Looking further, Finbold gathered on-chain data from IntoTheBlock on May 22, which highlights other key levels to watch for.



In particular, the “In/Out of the Money Around Price” metric shows strong support at lower prices than current ones. The largest volume is within the $63,728 to $65,830 level, at an average of $64,689. 1.79 million addresses purchased over 953,260 BTC at these prices and are currently in profit.



On the other hand, there is no relevant volume to the upside, suggesting weaker resistance to the range’s top for BTC at above $72,000.



In/Out of the Money Around Price. Source: IntoTheBlock



Is Bitcoin ready for new all-time highs?



In this context, Finbold checked Bitcoin’s “Market Value To Realized Value” (MVRV) Ratio of the last 90 days on Santiment.



MVRV shows the ratio between the current price and the average price of every coin acquired. Essentially, higher ratios surge in potential resistance, foreshadowing increased selling activity, while the opposite is also valid to form support.



As of this writing, the 90-day MVRV ratio at 6% suggests a neutral outlook, with weak resistance at $70,000. Nevertheless, these prices have a proportionally low ratio compared to the 35% seen in March.



Hence, Bitcoin might make new all-time highs in the following days or weeks.

In conclusion, Bitcoin’s key support and resistance levels to watch are $60,000, $64,690, $70,000, and $72,000. The support levels are stronger than the resistance, which suggests a breakout to the upside. It is important, however, to understand that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile digital assets, and indicators are not conclusive.

OpenSea Reveals ‘Get Based’ Series on Ethereum L2 Base With Free NFT Drops - Decrypt

As Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Base continues to gain steam, NFT marketplace OpenSea is gearing up to throw a spotlight on the network and its artists with the launch of “Get Based”—a series of free or low-cost digital artwork drops.Kicking off Thursday with a mint of a reimagining of the classic “Endless Summer” film artwork (seen in full below) by Carty Sewell—an artist and OpenSea employee, as well—the “Get Based” series is set to encompass works by as many as 15 artists over the summer.Weekly drops will take place via both OpenSea’s website and via frames on social media protocol Farcaster, with each open edition drop set to cost $5 or less—and some will be free.Additional confirmed artists/projects for “Get Based” include RGB Punks creator Jhekub, “Primitives” creator Hun, meme artist Cryptic Poet, Twitter “Fail Whale” creator Yiying Lu, illustrator Subwway, and Thank You Base God—which recently did a free Base NFT mint on OpenSea that yielded more than 181,000 total mints.The first drop in the "Get Based" series is from artist Carty Sewell. Image: OpenSeaBase has become a significant part of OpenSea’s focus in recent months as the marketplace embraces the budding NFT scene on a chain that doesn’t yet have entrenched, high-value collections—unlike on layer-1 chains like Ethereum mainnet or Solana.“Get Based” is planned as an introduction to emerging artists on Base, while also helping to introduce collectors to the chain. OpenSea offers native bridging of assets to Base, as well as the ability to purchase with fiat currency and credit cards via a MoonPay integration.“The Base ecosystem has proven to be a catalyst for new utility and creativity using NFTs,” OpenSea co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer told Decrypt. “We’ve been supportive of Base since its inception, and we’re excited to highlight up-and-coming artists with unique artistic styles and grow their presence within the larger NFT community.”The “Get Based” series will take place alongside Base’s upcoming “On-Chain Summer II” promotion, which kicks off on June 3 and will offer more than 600 ETH (nearly $2.3 million) worth of prizes, incentives, and gas credits across various projects and protocols. OpenSea participated in last year’s promotion, and was also a Base launch partner.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Due to this, the expert pointed out several targets for the asset to reach in the near term, such as $2,410, $2,881, $3,353, and $4,024, indicating a 38.20%, 50.00%, 61.80%, 78.60% upswingm respectively, from the current price then.
Earlier this month, Titan of Crypto noted that the bullish cypher pattern has successfully developed, and the aforementioned price targets have all been achieved, suggesting a substantial rally is on the horizon.

At that time, the crypto expert underscored that ETH was at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, which he also dubbed the 1st stop ($2,880). Should the coin manage to sustain this level, Titan of Crypto anticipates a move on the upside from the level.
However, today, as predicted by the expert, Ethereum performed a flawless recovery from the 1st stop ($2,880) point. As a result, the crypto asset is currently forming a bull flag pattern on the weekly timeframe, citing $5,300 as the next price target for ETH to reach. 
However, this is not the final destination, suggesting the potential for Ethereum to surge even higher in the upcoming months. With ETH displaying strong price performance, it could mean that the Altcoin season could be coming into play in the near future.
Indicator That Suggests A Price Correction On The Downside
Although Titan of Crypto anticipates a massive rally for ETH, Ali Martinez has underlined the potential for the asset to decline soon.  According to Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential indicator on Ethereum’s 4-hour timeframe on May 15, previously displayed a promising buy signal. This development practically led to a 32% rise in the price of Ethereum.

However, now that the ETH Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are generating so much buzz, the indicator has transitioned to a sell signal. Consequently, Ali Martinez predicts a downward correction of one to four candlesticks.
At the time of writing, ETH had increased by over 28% in the past week, trading at around $3,728. Despite the recent price momentum, the asset’s market cap and trading volume are down by 1.56% and 28%, respectively.

Ripple Unveils Ticker For New Stablecoin In Trademark Filing


								Ripple Labs Inc. has filed a trademark application that suggests “RLUSD” as the ticker for its upcoming dollar-based stablecoin. This development comes amid growing anticipation within the XRP community regarding the company’s new financial product, which aims to integrate seamlessly with On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), recently rebranded as Ripple Payments.
Details On Ripple’s RLUSD Trademark Filing
According to details from Justia Trademarks, the filing, identified under serial number 98537677, was made on May 7, 2024. This application is still in the early stages of processing, listed under the status “630 – New Application – Record Initialized Not Assigned To Examiner.” The attorney of record for this filing is Olivia Maria Baratta from Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP.

The filing specifies a broad range of financial services tied to this trademark, which include but are not limited to “monetary services for receiving and disbursing payments and gifts in virtual and digital currency and digital tokens of value determined by fiat currency over a computer network.” Moreover, the application covers “financial management and administration services, such as facilitating transfers of digital currency and electronic transmission of digital currency.”
This move by Ripple marks a significant step towards launching its stablecoin, which had been hinted at earlier this year. In April 2024, the company had expressed its intentions to delve into the stablecoin market, a strategic pivot aiming to harness a market sector that is projected to burgeon to a near $3 trillion valuation in the upcoming years.

The choice of RLUSD as a ticker symbol appears to be a tactical decision, influenced by the preoccupation of other potential tickers such as USDX and USDR by other entities. Flare Networks has already introduced USDX as a stablecoin on its blockchain platform, while USDR is currently utilized by Real USD. These circumstances presumably led Ripple to settle on the designation of RLUSD for its stablecoin initiative.
While the formal launch and full details of the stablecoin are still forthcoming, the trademark filing marks another major step for Ripple’s broad vision for a full-service crypto company. The company has yet to issue an official statement regarding the detailed features and launch timeline for RLUSD.
As previously revealed, the primary motivation for introducing a stablecoin and integrating it with its payment platform is to enhance its Ripple Payments solution for cross-border transactions. The stablecoin will enable US based customers to leverage stablecoin for international payments through Ripple Payments, as an alternative to using XRP.
“I see stablecoins as a complement or even an accelerant to what Ripple’s doing at its core,” Garlinghouse remarked during a recent interview with the CEO of SCB 10X.
At press time, XRP traded at 0.53379.

                        United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler released a statement Wednesday morning criticizing the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) ahead of the crypto regulation’s expected vote in the House today.SEC Chair Gary Gensler Pushes Back On FIT21 Before House Vote
In a blog post published on the SEC’s website Wednesday, Gensler claimed the bill would in part “create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts,” ultimately “putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.”In particular, the federal regulator argued that FIT21 would work against already established securities law by negating the long-accepted Howey Test while reneging current regulations on investment contracts, allowing crypto operators to “self-certify” their products.“The crypto industry’s record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don’t have rules or because the rules are unclear. It’s because many players in the crypto industry don’t play by the rules,” Gensler continued.“We should make the policy choice to protect the investing public over facilitating business models of non-compliant firms.”Crypto Regulations Finally See Traction On Capitol Hill
Gensler’s commentary comes amidst a wave of momentum for crypto regulation on Capitol Hill, signaling potential pushback from U.S. lawmakers over the SEC’s current regulatory regimen towards digital assets.Earlier this month, both chambers of Congress voted on a resolution that would effectively overturn the SEC’s controversial crypto accounting guidance known as SAB121.In a statement shortly following the vote disavowing SAB121, pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) claimed it was “a win for financial innovation and a clear rebuke of the way the Biden admin and Gary Gensler have persecuted crypto.”Gensler has long ruffled the feathers of key players in the crypto space, with the federal agency doling a swath of litigation to digital asset organizations for allegedly breaking U.S. securities law.Meanwhile, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, the blockchain firm currently locked in a contentious legal battle with the SEC over the sale of cryptocurrency XRP, took to X early on Wednesday to criticize Gensler’s leadership of the SEC.“Gensler overplayed his hand. He thought crypto was an easy target,” Alderoty wrote. “He relished being the guy that everyone loved to hate. He thought he was above Congressional oversight. That’s all gone. He’s now a struggling political liability.”Should U.S. lawmakers advance FIT21, it would mark the U.S. government’s first successful push for a crypto regulatory framework and a strong reprimand of Gensler’s treatment of digital assets.

If SEC approves ether ETF, will it approve altcoin ETFs?


With the likelihood of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot ether ETF suddenly rising, altcoin investors are speculating on a possible flurry of approvals for additional coins. 
Indeed, just this morning, WisdomTree gained approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority to list its 100% physically backed Ethereum ETP on the London Stock Exchange as early as May 28 — although the products will not be available for retail investment.
The bullish momentum for ether, which is up 29% this week alone, might spill over into other crypto assets.
On Monday, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas declared that the likelihood of the SEC approving a spot ether ETF had jumped from 25% to 75% thanks to the agency’s reported commentary to at least one exchange and one ETF applicant regarding their 19b-4 exchange rule change request.
The Wall Street Journal confirmed the news while CoinDesk also cited three people familiar with the matter. Around the same time and without citing 19b-4 news, David Han at Coinbase Institutional wrote a note adjusting his outlook for a spot ether ETF upward.
Barrons claimed staff workers at the SEC told exchanges “that it is leaning toward approving them, according to people familiar with the matter.”
As early as tomorrow, the SEC could approve a so-called 19b-4 filing that, alongside a related S-1 filing the deadline of which is weeks away, might lead to an eventual listing of a spot ether ETF by investment manager VanEck.
Other ETF sponsors have also filed 19b-4 applications with the SEC for a spot ether ETF, including Fidelity, 21Shares, Invesco/Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. VanEck requested the earliest response date: tomorrow.

Will a spot ether ETF lead to other altcoin ETFs?
Certainly, ether is just one of many altcoins trading on US stock exchanges via trusts. There are over a dozen trusts publicly trading in the US holding alternate crypto assets: Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Decentraland (MANA), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Filecoin (FIL), Polkadot (DOT), Horizon (ZEN), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Livepeer (LPT), Zcash (ZEC), and Solana (SOL).
So, if the SEC approves a spot ether ETF, could it also approve ETFs for additional altcoins?
The logic of altcoin proponents — arguing that non-ether spot altcoin ETFs might gain SEC approval shortly after a spot ether ETF — usually follows a simple argument: If the SEC permitted Grayscale to convert its bitcoin trust into an ETF, why would commissioners deny trust sponsors of other crypto assets to convert into an ETF?
For obvious reasons, that argument might fail if the SEC claims the crypto asset is an unregistered security. However, the SEC hasn’t classified all crypto assets held in US public trusts as securities.
Interestingly, many crypto trusts trading on OTC Markets, a US stock exchange, hold expressly SEC-designated unregistered securities, including SOL, MANA, and FIL. More crypto assets are rumored to be SEC-designated unregistered securities: ZEN, XLM, and ZEN. 
Nevertheless, there are certain trusts trading on US OTC Markets that don’t hold SEC-designated unregistered securities, such as DOT or ETC trusts. Perhaps, if the SEC were to approve a spot ether ETF, commissioners might approve spot ETFs based on such possibly non-security crypto assets.
It’s worth noting that just because the SEC hasn’t classified a crypto asset as an unregistered security doesn’t mean that it’s not. Congress didn’t task the SEC to proactively classify all assets. Instead, the SEC simply chooses to accept or reject applications that it receives, or file enforcement actions against illegal conduct on a case-by-case basis, as it has the time, money, staff, and resources.
Silence from commissioners doesn’t indicate non-designation.
Of course, there is a counterargument against this logic. Unlike altcoins like DOT or ETC, only bitcoin and ether have futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This CME market of significant size for ether alone might be a carrying reason for approving only a spot ether ETF and not any other altcoin.
Spot ether ETF: No longer an obvious SEC rejection?
According to reports from Bloomberg, Barron’s, and Wall Street Journal sources, the Trading and Markets Division at the SEC has requested amendments to an exchange and sponsor’s joint 19b-4 form — likely VanEck. This is a bullish sign for a possible spot ether ETF approval because, in the view of market observers, the SEC is typically silent or disinterested in 19b-4 filings if it intends to reject them.
Because the SEC is asking for a reapplication, the reasoning goes, its interest is likely a positive development.

Many viewed the SEC’s stance toward a spot ether ETF as decidedly negative. Joe Lubin’s ConsenSys even sued the SEC claiming that commissioners had secretly categorized ether as an unregistered security.
Therefore, if the SEC is actually considering a possible approval of a spot ETF for Ethereum, it would be a marked change of tone.
Read more: ConsenSys says the SEC designated ETH a security but won’t say where
Amid all of these media reports, the price of ether has rallied by 29% over the past seven days — outperforming bitcoin’s 12% rally by an additional 17%.
Form 19b-4 asks applicants for the information necessary for the public to understand why the SEC should change its Section 19(b)(1) rules pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In this case, the exchange and an ETF sponsor must explain why the SEC should allow ether to be used as the sole asset of a spot ETF.

UK Approves First Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Products | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to Bloomberg, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK’s financial regulator, has approved the first cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs), marking a milestone in the UK’s approach to digital asset investment.



An ETP is a type of security traded on stock exchanges, similar to individual stocks. ETPs are designed to track the performance of a specific index, commodity, currency, or other benchmark, allowing investors to gain exposure to various asset classes without directly owning the underlying assets. ETPs can include different structures, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs), and exchange-traded commodities (ETCs).



An ETF is a specific type of ETP that pools together various assets, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities, into a single fund. ETFs aim to replicate the performance of a specific index or benchmark and are structured as investment funds. When you invest in an ETF, you own shares of the fund, which, in turn, owns the underlying assets. ETFs are typically regulated under investment company laws, which provide certain protections and requirements for investors. Additionally, ETFs can distribute dividends to investors if the underlying assets generate income.



The main difference between ETPs and ETFs lies in their structure and scope. ETPs is a broad category that includes various types of exchange-traded securities, not limited to funds. They can encompass notes and commodities as well. While ETFs are a subset of ETPs and are specifically structured as investment funds, other types of ETPs, like ETNs, are debt instruments issued by banks. ETFs are regulated under specific investment fund regulations, while other types of ETPs, such as ETNs, may have different regulatory frameworks. Moreover, ETNs carry the credit risk of the issuer as they are debt securities, whereas ETFs do not have this risk since they own the underlying assets directly. Another distinction is that ETFs can distribute dividends to investors, whereas ETNs do not because they do not directly own the underlying assets.



Per Bloomberg’s article, WisdomTree Inc. announced today that it has received FCA approval to list two physically-backed crypto ETPs, which will track Bitcoin and Ether, on the London Stock Exchange. These products are expected to begin trading as early as 28 May 2024. 







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Several other issuers, including ETC Group, 21Shares, and CoinShares, have also applied to list their crypto products in the UK. As of midday on Wednesday, the FCA’s approval list included entries from WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Invesco Digital Markets Plc, all set to be part of the first batch of trading on the approval date.



Despite this advancement, the FCA has implemented stringent rules surrounding these products. WisdomTree’s Bitcoin and Ether ETPs, although physically-backed, are only available to professional investors. This restriction is stricter compared to the United States, where the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has led to significant market growth. Bloomberg says that in the US, these ETFs now manage a combined $59 billion, which is nearly five times the total for similar crypto vehicles traded in Europe.



ETPs linked to cryptocurrencies have been trading on other European stock exchanges for years. The approval of such products by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year played a crucial role in propelling Bitcoin to a record high in March and has facilitated broader adoption among retail and institutional investors.











However, not all global markets have seen the same enthusiasm. In Hong Kong, despite the approval of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, investor response has been lukewarm. This contrast highlights the varying degrees of market maturity and investor interest in different regions.



ETC Group confirmed that its application is still under review, while 21Shares has already secured approval. CoinShares and the FCA declined to comment on their status, and Invesco had no immediate response.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Loses Market Spot to Avalanche (AVAX): Details

In a reshuffling move, dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has lost its market spot to Avalanche (AVAX).Shiba Inu has remained in 11th place in the market rankings after falling out of the top 10 due to profit-taking following its stunning 300% increase in late February to early March. Despite the profit-taking that followed, Shiba Inu fiercely defended its rankings, remaining in 11th place throughout.However, Shiba Inu's resolve has been tested with Avalanche overtaking it, pushing it to 12th place in the crypto market rankings. Shiba Inu's drop in the rankings coincides with a larger market fall that has seen SHIB lose roughly 4% of its value in the last 24 hours. This fall follows profit-taking after the SHIB price reached a high of $0.00002684 during today's trading session. Market Rankings, Courtesy: CoinMarketCapEarlier in the week, crypto prices rose on hints of progress toward U.S. approval of exchange-traded funds investing directly in Ethereum as optimism revived.SHIB's price climbed alongside the market, but to a smaller extent. SHIB is currently up 5.15% over the last seven days, as its gains were relatively muted by the stiff daily MA 50 barrier near $0.000025. In recent weeks, specifically since mid-April, Shiba Inu's price has been constricted by the daily SMA 50 barrier. Shiba Inu consistently faced a battle surpassing this level; however, the bulls made a successful attempt on May 20 before confronting resistance. Conversely, Avalanche experienced a surge in value, climbing over 18% in the past week. This growth has propelled AVAX to overtake SHIB, with a current market capitalization of $15.6 billion compared to Shiba Inu's $14.8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.As the market scenario unfolds, eyes will be on Shiba Inu to see if it can sustain its rise above the tough daily MA 50 barrier. Whether SHIB can reclaim its position or AVAX will continue to climb the ranks remains to be seen.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler criticizes crypto market bill before House vote

Hours before the U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on a crypto bill, president Biden released a statement saying that he is against the legislation, but he isn’t threatening to veto it.Why Bitcoin and Ether are skyrocketingThe White House expressed opposition to the bill, ‘The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21),’ on Wednesday afternoon, due to concerns over inadequate investor protections.The bill, ‘The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), would effectively classify cryptocurrency as a commodity, not a security, and therefore make it exempt from securities regulations.“The Administration is eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system,” the White House statement said. “H.R. 4763 in its current form lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions.”The statement comes a few hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler publicly expressed his opposition to the bill. Gensler stated, “FIT21 would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.” He reiterated his stance on cryptocurrency as securities, expressing concern that the bill would exclude blockchain-recorded investment contracts from the statutory definition of securities and, hence, the protections of the federal securities laws.“Further, by removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled — but what crypto market participants have attempted to deny — that many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law,” the chair added.The bill would allow companies to self-certify that they are issuing digital commodities and also give the SEC 60 days to determine if those assets fit the bill’s definition of digital commodities.“There are more than 16,000 crypto assets that currently exist. Given limits on staff resources, and no new resources provided by the bill, it is implausible that the SEC could review and challenge more than a fraction of those assets,” he said.FIT21 was introduced last summer to determine whether a cryptocurrency should be classified as a commodity or a security and assign oversight accordingly between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Per Forbes, the Republican candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump and his advisors also support the crypto market structure bill. Trump, who used to criticize crypto as a scam against the U.S. dollar, is now promoting himself as crypto’s candidate. Yesterday, he announced that he would start accepting campaign donations in crypto.The crypto industry has been eagerly awaiting regulatory actions from the U.S. authorities and advocating for changes in laws to prevent crypto from being categorized as a security. The SEC Chair, however, has referred to crypto as a security from time to time and claims it falls under his jurisdiction. Gensler, who once taught a course on blockchain and cryptocurrencies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is known for his strict approach to regulating crypto. He’s called the cryptocurrency market a Wild West, emphasizing its need for regulation.

Why I’m a single-issue crypto voter - Blockworks


Given the events of the past two years, everyone in the United States in both parties should be single-issue voters in favor of crypto having a level playing field. In particular, we should support all politicians who oppose the Biden administration’s extreme efforts to kill the industry in the United States, regardless of party, Republican or Democrat. 
This stance is not about being pro-crypto, it is about being pro-fairness. Today, the actions of the executive branch target the crypto industry, but who will be the next target under future administrations? Fossil fuel producers? Abortion providers? Public sector unions? Gun manufacturers? Green energy companies? The press?
As a people, we cannot allow government misbehavior of this sort, and it must be our primary source of concern. If we cannot secure fair treatment under the law for all, every other right we enjoy as Americans is threatened.
Why do I believe this?
In the beginning of US regulatory engagement, we had a few strict crypto regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services with its BitLicense regime. Even so, those regulators intended for crypto did exist, just within the rules. 
In 2022, however, we began to see regulators take it upon themselves to judge that an industry should not exist and begin to take any and all actions to destroy it. As a result, we have seen a staggering variety of inappropriate and, in some cases, illegal actions from federal agencies against crypto.
The SEC has been sanctioned by a federal judge in Utah for lying in court, bankrupting a business and destroying lives to get a TRO in the Debt Box case. The SEC treated the BTC ETF application process so inappropriately that it was ultimately overruled by a different federal judge who called its behavior “arbitrary and capricious.” The SEC promulgated a rule on crypto custody called SAB 121 without consulting the industry or other regulators, which is so mechanically broken it has essentially banned regulated financial entities from offering crypto custody and caused both houses of Congress to vote in bipartisan fashion to overrule it. 
Additionally, the SEC somehow managed to sue Ripple, Coinbase, Kraken and Uniswap Labs while failing completely to sue either FTX, Terraform Labs, Celsius, 3AC or BlockFi before their various collapses harmed countless investors and consumers.
Banking regulators have engaged in similarly inappropriate behavior. From issuing a joint letter in February 2023 that unilaterally called tokens on public blockchains “highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices” to pressuring banks to de-platform their crypto customers without evidence of legal wrongdoing or undue risk through “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” they have also overreached. The Federal Reserve continues to deny Custodia, a regulated bank in Wyoming, an account.
Across the board, our federal government’s approach to crypto reeks of bias and misconduct. If we cannot trust the federal government to play fair, then all other political positions fade in importance until the checks and balances of the system are restored. In this case, it is important to remember that the ultimate check on both the executive and the legislative branches is the people. 
My belief is that crypto deserves fair treatment. While Republicans have been the recent champions of the industry thanks to their pro-business views, forward-thinking Democrat Ritchie Torres wrote an op-ed in 2022 titled “The Liberal Case for Cryptocurrency.” Long after Trump is gone from crypto, Torres and other Democrats will remain. More than 30 Democrats between the House and Senate broke ranks with the administration to vote down SAB 121. 
Fair treatment under the law is a stance all Americans of all parties can rally behind. As a long-time Democrat myself, I believe this stance will stand the test of time for both parties. Even politicians who do not care about or even dislike crypto should be able to support the basic point that obeying the law and having fair rules is essential. If they can’t, we should vote them out.
I believe we should vote for any politician, Democrat or Republican, who rejects things like the SEC’s illegal antics in the Debt Box case or the gross misconduct of the head of the FDIC. We must secure the basic fairness of our system and hold accountable those who flagrantly violate it.
That is why I am a single issue voter on this topic. It is not that I am pro-crypto, it is that I am pro-fairness.

‘Euphoric Bull’ Phase Could Be Approaching for Bitcoin (BTC), According to On-Chain Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) could be approaching a “euphoric bull” phase, according to a popular on-chain analyst.
The pseudonymous analyst known as Checkmate tells his 91,100 followers on the social media platform X that BTC is approaching a “decision point.”










“Bitcoin breaking to a new ATH (all-time high) has historically represented a transition point from the Enthusiastic Bull, into the Euphoric Bull.
It also coincides with the MVRV (market value to realized value) ratio getting above 1 standard deviation, but we rarely clear it on the first attempt.”
Source: Checkmate/X
MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all BTC at the price they were bought). It is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued.
Checkmate acknowledges that he doesn’t know when that transition point will occur.
“I don’t have a view on that as we cannot know. It completely depends on capital inflows, which right now look pretty healthy. Therefore, it could be that now is the time… but we will have to read the tape as it happens. Predictions are not overly useful, instead, I prepare my reaction function. It isn’t about what will happen –> it is about what you will do when it happens.”
The analyst also says the ongoing Bitcoin bull market is “much, much more structured” than the 2021 bull run.
“It looks a lot more like 2016/17. Spot-driven, resilient. It’s just fantastic. I love what I’m seeing in this price action.”
BTC is trading at $69,815 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours and nearly 14% in the past seven days.

SEC Chair Gensler opposes today's FIT21 vote yet White House calls no 'veto'

Gary Gensler, Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), issued a statement on May 22 expressing strong opposition to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act.The FIT21 Act is widely celebrated for offering regulatory clarity to the crypto industry. However, Gensler has criticized it, arguing that the bill would weaken current consumer protections in the crypto market.The President Biden administration said it opposes the bill’s passage. However, the White House clarified that it was willing to work with the US Congress to “ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities.”Notably, the US House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the bill later today, May 22.Gensler’s dissentGensler warned that the proposed bill would create significant regulatory gaps, undermining decades of precedent in overseeing investment contracts and putting investors and capital markets at substantial risk.The SEC chair further highlighted that the regulation would prevent blockchain-based investment contracts from being classified as securities. This change would enable crypto investment contract issuers to self-certify their products as decentralized, effectively removing them from SEC oversight. He added:“The SEC would only have 60 days to review and challenge the certification that a product is a digital commodity. Those that the SEC successfully challenges would be re-classified as restricted digital assets and subject to the bill’s lighter-touch SEC oversight regime that excludes many core protections. “Moreover, Gensler criticized the bill for abandoning the Howey Test, a key method for determining if an investment qualifies as a security. He argued that this would lead to reduced protections for the few investment contracts that are considered securities. Additionally, he pointed out the risks posed by excluding crypto asset trading platforms from being classified as exchanges.Gensler emphasized that the bill poses a significant threat to the American capital market and its investors. He stated that the legislation would undermine capital markets by allowing firms to evade enforcement actions more easily.FIT21 enjoys supportDespite Gensler’s antagonism towards the bill, the proposed legislation enjoys strong support from the US Congress and the crypto community.In a May 21 statement, Congressman French Hill, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion, said the bill gives the SEC authority over digital assets that are not certified under the legislation and would provide adequate securities to protect against another FTX-like situation.Several crypto companies, including Coinbase, Circle, Kraken, Gemini, and advocacy group Stand With Crypto, have urged US lawmakers to support the legislation. The Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) stated:“FIT 21 will introduce new compliance challenges for digital assets companies, but regulatory clarity is indisputably more responsible, safer for consumers, and preferable to the status quo.”As the bill awaits today’s vote, the White House has confirmed that it will not attempt to veto it if it passes, even though it does “oppose” the bill. The vote will likely now be one of the most important pieces of crypto legislation to be voted on by Congress.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

                        The landscape of crypto taxes is varied and dynamic, with some nations emerging as particularly friendly to crypto investors and traders.Countries with low taxation on cryptocurrencies reap the benefits of increased investment, innovation, and economic growth, creating a compelling argument for the adoption of similar policies worldwide.Contrasting these havens are countries with more stringent crypto tax laws, which can stifle local market growth and push investors to seek more favorable environments.High-tax countries often see a brain drain in talent and capital, which can be detrimental in the long run.Evaluating Crypto Taxes
For crypto investors and businesses, understanding the landscape of crypto taxation is pivotal.When assessing where to invest or operate in the crypto space, several key factors come into play.First and foremost is the tax rate itself, which directly impacts the return on investment.Some countries offer zero tax on long-term capital gains, which can significantly enhance profitability.Additionally, exemptions such as threshold limits for taxable income or gains can also be a deciding factor for small traders and casual investors.However, the regulatory environment is equally critical. Clarity and stability in regulations ensure that investors understand the rules and can comply without fearing sudden changes.Moreover, the degree of crypto adoption within a country often signals how supportive its environment is towards innovation and technology-driven financial services.Here is a list of countries with best tax policies related to digital assets:1. GermanyGermany stands out in Europe as a beacon for crypto investors. If you hold your crypto investments for more than a year, you are exempt from taxes on any gains, fostering a culture of long-term investment.Smaller gains under €600 are also tax-free, which encourages casual investors to participate without the burden of taxation.Even for the sale of Bitcoin within one year, capital gains tax will only be applied if the amount is more than 600 euros.2. PortugalMoving southwest, Portugal offers a favorable tax environment where crypto earnings are free of personal income tax.This exemption extends to trading cryptocurrencies, making it an attractive hub for day traders and crypto companies alike.However, it is worth noting that in 2023, the country started applying a 28% tax on short-term crypto gains from selling crypto held for less than a year.In February 2024, the country passed a bill that obliges crypto holders to declare their crypto assets in an annual IRS tax declaration3. SingaporeIn Asia, Singapore has positioned itself as a fintech hub by not imposing any capital gains tax on crypto investments.Moreover, digital payment tokens are exempt from Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Singapore.The absence of specific taxes on crypto transactions further cements its status as a forward-thinking center for financial innovation.4. MaltaMalta, known as the “Blockchain Island,” treats crypto transactions similarly to day trading but offers benefits for long-term holdings.Its legal framework is tailored to the nuances of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, providing a solid foundation for businesses and investors.In Malta, there is no long-term capital gains tax for cryptocurrency. However, trading cryptocurrency may be considered income taxed at a maximum of 35%.5. SwitzerlandLastly, Switzerland is renowned not just for its chocolates but also for its crypto-friendly policies.Although crypto wealth and income are subject to wealth tax, the rates are low, and professional trading can be tax-exempt, making it a hotspot for crypto finance.Comparative Analysis

Legendary Peter Brandt Predicted Ethereum (ETH) Rally: What's Next?

The legend of trading outside of the cryptocurrency industry, Peter Brandt, revealed that he has been building a bullish case for Ethereum since May 17 and even included an action plan for buying. Unfortunately, he did not reveal what is going to happen with ETH in the future, nor did he provide additional details on his buying plan. That is why we will have to address the price chart we have right now.Obviously, Ethereum is ripping and tearing the market right now, with the price of the second-biggest cryptocurrency slicing through the $3,600 resistance like a knife through butter. One way or another, there is no base below the price, so keep in mind that any correction could turn into a substantial one.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewWith the breakthrough above $3,600, we should be ready for a stronger move up at around the 50-200 EMAs. But as we mentioned above, do not fall for the rapid price increase as prices after that are really unstable. Also, keep in mind that even Brandt's plan could include a bearish scenario in which Ether reverses around $4,000.However, with such rapid gains, the risk of a correction is always present. Ethereum's current price surge lacks a solid support base, meaning that any pullback could potentially lead to a significant drop. Traders should be cautious and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect their investments.By using RSI, we can determine whether or not Ethereum is entering the overbought zone. Unfortunately, for now, the indicator shows that Ether is on the verge of becoming overbought and potentially facing a reversal in the foreseeable future. Thus, if you are going long, make sure to avoid overleveraging existing positions. In general, Brandt's bullishness on Ethereum around May 17 made some sense, considering ETH reaching the local support level of the 200 EMA, which acted as a springboard for it.

                        The price of DogWifMAGA Coin has fallen by 73% in the past 24 hours, with the new meme token correcting heavily after a big launch at the start of the week.Running on Solana, WIFMAGA had risen by as much as 50,000% in the day that followed its listing on Raydium, with the token trending on social media.Yet it has plunged significantly today, with the coin’s founders likely dumping their bags on the retail investors who’d jumped on its bandwagon.It may struggle to recover in any meaningful way, yet there are better alternatives available to traders seeking above-average gains, with multi-chain token Dogeverse one of the most promising new coins in the market right now.DogWifMAGA Coin Price Skyrockets as Presidential Elections Heat Up
There are two key features of DogWIFMAGA Coin’s chart, and both involve sharp declines.Firstly, the token’s price has declined consistently ever since reaching a high on Tuesday, and at the moment it doesn’t look like it’s going to recover.Source: DEXTools/TradingViewOne reason for this pessimism is that, secondly, the coin’s volume has also dried up, suggesting a very quick loss of interest.At the moment, its 24-hour volume stands only at $4 million, in contrast to $27 billion for Ethereum, for example, and $800 million for BONK (to take another Solana-based meme coin).As such, it would be unwise to assume that it’s going to recover anytime soon.This is particularly the case when its presence and fundamentals are minimal, even if some traders have been bigging it up in the past day.The coin’s only hope is that it attracts listings from major centralized exchanges, although its listing on Poloniex today has done little to resuscitate its price so far.It’s therefore uncertain as to whether we’ll see DogWifMAGA Coin recover, unless a wave of new listings boosts it.It has launched at a time when the United States is gearing up for yet another election between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, with whom the coin is unofficially associating itself.Yet because it lacks any real credentials or fundamentals, it would be irresponsible to suggest that a comeback is certain.Buy Now or Is This Other Coin the Real Winner?
DogWifMAGA Coin may be inherently risky, yet there are some new meme tokens that actually show more potential for gains in the near future.Possibly the likeliest to make gains soon is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain crypto that has raised more than $15 million in its heavily subscribed presale.Source: DogeverseWhat’s special about Dogeverse is that it’s the market’s first Doge-themed multi-chain cryptocurrency, running on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.Its availability on multiple chains means it could gain traction on many more apps and trading platforms than it would have otherwise.And by attracting more usage, it will, in theory, see its price rise over time.This will find help from the fact that it has a capped supply of 120 million tokens, meaning that it’s a deflationary cryptocurrency (unlike most other meme coins).On top of this, holders will be able to stake to token, something which could see a big proportion of its total supply exit circulation.Such tokenomics help explain why so many investors have ploughed into its sale, which newcomers can still join by going to the official Dogeverse website.1 DOGEVERSE is selling at a final sale price of $0.00031, although it’s likely to exceed this level comfortably once it lists in the next few weeks.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Nexo Fee Fury: Users Slam Crypto Exchange After Surprise Hike


								The cryptocurrency exchange landscape is a battlefield of trust. With centralized platforms still reeling from high-profile scandals like FTX and Celsius, any misstep can send user loyalty plummeting. Nexo, a platform that had recently emerged relatively unscathed, now finds itself in hot water after a surprise fee increase sparked outrage amongst its customer base.

From Hero To Zero: Trust Eroded By Unannounced Fees
Nexo had managed to carve out a niche as a customer-centric exchange. Their ability to dodge legal troubles and a swift reversal of a disliked fee policy in April had painted a picture of a platform that listened. However, this carefully crafted image shattered on May 21st when users woke up to emails announcing a significant hike in bank transfer fees.
The new structure imposed a £5/€5 charge for FPS/SEPA withdrawals and a hefty $25/£25 fee for SWIFT transactions. This abrupt change ignited a firestorm on social media platforms like Reddit, with users expressing a mix of betrayal and frustration.

“They practically sent out the email after or at the exact moment they implemented it,” commented one disgruntled user, echoing a common sentiment. Many worried that this was just the tip of the iceberg, fearing a slippery slope of additional charges down the line.
The backlash extended beyond mere grumbling. One user on X, a popular social media platform, took a direct jab at Nexo’s aspirations, stating, “You won’t replace banks if you’re worse than them.” This highlights the core issue – Nexo’s attempt to position itself as a disruptive force in finance now appears undermined by its own fee practices.


Communication Gap: Nexo’s Defense Rings Hollow
In response to the growing discontent, Nexo attempted to quell the flames by claiming the new fees were simply passing on costs incurred with third-party payment processors. A company moderator further asserted Nexo’s commitment to “keep transactions accessible and affordable.” These justifications, however, fell flat with many users.

The lack of transparency and the absence of any prior warning were major sticking points. The timing, coming just weeks after the community lauded Nexo for reversing the loan repayment fee, added another layer of sting.

How Blockchain Technology Can Combat the Rising Threat of AI-Generated Deepfakes

For those unfamiliar, a public blockchain transparently records information in a time-bound manner, accessible to all, globally, and without gatekeeping. This allows anyone to verify the validity of information, such as its creator or a timestamp, making it a source of truth. Public blockchains are also decentralized, eliminating the need for a central decision-maker, and reducing the risk of manipulation. This decentralized structure also offers high network security by eliminating single points of failure, and ensuring an immutable and tamper-resistant record.

Elon Musk Issues 'Black Mirror' Warning, Shibarium on Verge of Major Record, Samson Mow Makes Bullish Bitcoin Statement: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


U.Today presents you with the top three news stories over the past day.Elon Musk issues important “Black Mirror” statement to warn communityIn a recent X post, Elon Musk, the world-famous centibillionaire who takes heightened interest in the latest technological developments, expressed his distrust in a new Microsoft feature. The feature is called "Recall" and, according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it represents a semantic search of users' entire history, which will help them find anything they have ever seen or done on their PCs. "Recall's" principle is simple: Windows will be constantly taking screenshots of your computer screen, then it will use a generative AI model, along with the NPU, to process all that data and make it searchable. Despite the promising utility, Musk criticized the feature, comparing it to what an episode of the "Black Mirror" series might show, implying that the series' dystopian scenario of technologies controlling humanity is getting closer to reality. "Definitely turning this 'feature' off," wrote Musk, perhaps hinting that the data collected by "Recall" could potentially be easily accessed and used to control users’ actions.Shibarium on verge of major record as transactions shoot up 209%Along with the rest of the market, Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 solution, has recently been seeing the positive effects of a new uptrend. According to data provided by Shibariumscan, the daily transaction count surged from 6,000 on May 14 to 18,560 on May 20, representing more than 209% growth. For weeks, the number of daily transitions on Shibarium remained relatively flat, but things changed after the Shibarium hard fork was implemented on the mainnet. This was a turning point for the Ethereum L2 protocol. With the transaction surge, Shibarium is now aiming to break the record of 420 million total transactions. Even though it remains unknown when exactly this will be accomplished, Shibarium has the right catalyst to help it drive its position to a new level overall. Currently, the total transaction count on Shibarium stands at 417,525,512, per Shibariumscan's data.Bullish Bitcoin statement issued by Samson Mow: “Omega coming”Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, has finally made the long-awaited move toward revisiting its all-time high, climbing back to the $71,000 level – the highest price level since April 1, when BTC traded at $71,330. The likely catalysts for BTC's sudden recovery were the positive CPI data, which showed a weakening inflation rate, as well as a whole week of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Such a positive change in the Bitcoin price could not go unnoticed by Jan3 CEO Samson Mow, a renowned BTC maximalist who once predicted that the aforementioned asset could reach as high as $1 million one day. Mow took to his X handle to comment on the BTC price surge, making yet another prediction; this time, it concerns the coming of an Omega Bitcoin candle soon. As previously explained by the CEO, an Omega candle is a large trading candle on a Bitcoin chart accompanied by high volatility moves. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is changing hands at $70,006, down by 0.25% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models can do pretty incredible things with just a prompt, but there’s a big open secret behind them: Even their creators don’t know exactly how they’re able to do what they do, or why such results can vary from prompt to prompt. But now, one of the most prominent generative AI model creators is starting to break open that “black box.”Anthropic, a leading AI research company formed by ex-OpenAI researchers, has published a paper detailing a new method for interpreting the inner workings of its large language model, Claude.This innovative approach, dubbed "dictionary learning," has allowed researchers to identify millions of connections—which they call “features”—within Claude's neural network, each representing a specific concept that the AI understands.The ability to identify and understand these features offers unprecedented insight into how a large language model (LLM) processes information (how it thinks) and generates responses (how it acts). It also gives Anthropic leverage in modifying models without having to retrain them. It could also pave the way for other researchers to apply the dictionary learning technique into their own weights, to understand their inner workings better and enhance them accordingly.Dictionary learning is a technique that breaks down the actions of a model into many easier-to-understand parts using a special type of neural network called a sparse autoencoder. This helps researchers identify and understand the "features," or key components within the model, making it clearer how the model processes and represents different ideas."We found millions of features which appear to correspond to interpretable concepts ranging from concrete objects like people, countries, and famous buildings to abstract ideas like emotions, writing styles, and reasoning steps," the research paper states.Anthropic coded some of these features for the public. Claude is able to create connections for things like the Golden Gate Bridge (code 34M/31164353) to abstract notions such as "internal conflicts and dilemmas" (F#1M/284095), names of famous people like Albert Einstein (F#4M/1456596) and even potential safety concerns like "influence/manipulation." (F#34M/21750411).“The interesting thing is not that these features exist, but that they can be discovered at scale and intervened on,” Anthropic explained, “In the long run, we hope that having access to features like these can be helpful for analyzing and ensuring the safety of models. For example, we might hope to reliably know whether a model is being deceptive or lying to us. Or we might hope to ensure that certain categories of very harmful behavior (e.g. helping to create bioweapons) can reliably be detected and stopped.”In a memo, Anthropic said that this technique helped it identify risky features and act promptly to reduce their influence.“For example, Anthropic researchers identified a feature corresponding to ‘unsafe code,’ which fires for pieces of computer code that disable security-related system features,” Anthropic explained. “When we prompt the model to continue a partially-completed line of code without artificially stimulating the ‘unsafe code’ feature, the model helpfully provides a safe completion to the programming function. However, when we force the ‘unsafe code’ feature to fire strongly, the model finishes the function with a bug that is a common cause of security vulnerabilities.”Image: AntrhopicThis ability to manipulate features to produce different results is akin to tweaking the settings on a complex machine—or hypnotizing a person. For instance, if a language model is too “politically correct,” then boosting the features that may activate its spicier side could effectively transform it into a radically different LLM, as if it had been trained from scratch. This ultimately results in a more flexible model, and an easier way of doing corrective maintenance when a bug is found.Traditionally, AI models have been seen as black boxes—highly complex systems whose internal processes are not easily interpretable. Anthropic claims to have advanced into fully opening its model’s black box, providing a clearer view of the AI's cognitive processes.Anthropic's research is a significant step towards demystifying AI, offering a glimpse into the complex cognitive processes of these advanced models. The company shared the results on Claude because the firm owns its weights, but independent researchers could take the open weights of any other LLM and adapt this technique to fine-tune a new model or understand how these open-source models process information."We believe that understanding the inner workings of large language models like Claude is crucial for ensuring their safe and responsible use," the researchers wrote.Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Ether Volatility Expected as Traders Flood Exchanges With $231M of ETH Amid ETF Hopes

The daily net flow of ETH, which tracks inflows and outflows to exchanges, hit 62,000 ether ($231 million) this week. High exchange flows are typically associated with volatility, the report said.

Here’s when Ethereum (ETH) could hit $5,000


    Ethereum (ETH) is on a bull rally amid positive expectations regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States’ approval of Ethereum spot ETFs and BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) interest in real-world assets (RWA) tokenization.



Analysts started speculating on price as the cryptocurrency market awaits further developments in exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval and BlackRock’s endeavors. Reaching $5,000 in the next few days is possible as speculation heats up, even before the awaited ETF approval.



In particular, two analysts from the private wealth management firm Bernstein forecast a 75% pump to $6,600 moving forward. According to Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra, ETH could mirror Bitcoin’s (BTC) gains after its ETFs’ approval earlier this year. DefiLlama reported this and six other experts’ opinions about Ethereum on May 22.







However, Ethereum could see some action before the forecasted $6,600 a few weeks after the effective approval, as reported. This is because cryptocurrency investors could try to price the approval firsthand, backed by other positive news.



Ethereum price analysis



In this context, it is possible that  ETH first tries to challenge its previous all-time high of $4,869. This could happen as Ethereum tests the $5,000 psychological resistance, right above the historical resistance.



Notably, the leading Web3 cryptocurrency shows strong momentum, according to its weekly relative strength index (RSI) of 65.18. ETH trades at $3,692 by press time.

Joe Lubin, co-founder of the Ethereum Foundation and founder of Consensys, is optimistic about the token’s price action.




“Expect a “floodgate” of demand for Ether, which will likely lead to a supply crunch and drive prices higher. There’s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether.”
– Joe Lubin




In the meantime, BlackRock has submitted an updated spot Ethereum ETF 19b-4 document, following the SEC’s guidance. The update addresses Ethereum staking by the funds, which BlackRock and other interested institutions state they will not engage with.







As things develop, traders and investors look forward to Ethereum price projections and a nearing $5,000 test. Still, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and emotion-driven, so everything can quickly change. Speculators must remain cautious and avoid exposure above their risk profile.

First Solar Becomes Most Valuable Solar Company Amid Rivals' Struggles, Up 13% - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), a leading American solar panel manufacturer, has surpassed its competitors to become the most valuable solar company globally. The company’s market capitalization reached an impressive $21.15 billion, overtaking China’s Sungrow Power Supply Co., which stood at $20.85 billion. This achievement comes amidst significant challenges Chinese solar firms face, including a price war and trade barriers imposed by the United States.



Chinese Rivals’ Struggles and US Trade Policies



Chinese solar companies, such as Longi Green Energy Technology Co., have been grappling with the effects of a fierce price war and US trade restrictions. Longi reported a net loss of $325 million in the first quarter of 2024, starkly contrasting its $562 million profit the previous year.



The Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese solar products and support for domestic manufacturers through the Inflation Reduction Act have played a pivotal role in bolstering First Solar’s market position. These tariffs have led to US solar panel prices being nearly three times higher than the global average.



Despite First Solar’s growing market capitalization, its production capacity still lags behind its Chinese counterparts. In 2023, First Solar produced 12 gigawatts of panels, while Jinko Solar Co. produced 79 gigawatts. However, the company’s strong financial performance and favorable stock outlook have contributed to its rising value.





First Solar Stock Gains Over 13%



As of the latest update, First Solar’s stock price stands at $240.61, having experienced a remarkable 13.44% increase over the day so far. Over the past year, the stock has traded between $123.50 and $256.78. The company’s market cap is currently $22.70 billion, with a trailing P/E ratio of 22.23 and a forward P/E of 16.03. First Solar’s price-to-book ratio is 3.29.



Regarding financial performance, First Solar boasts a profit margin of 28.75%, a return on assets of 7.18%, and a return on equity of 16.05%. The company reported revenue of $3.56 billion and a net income of $1.02 billion over the last twelve months. The stock has delivered impressive returns, with a year-to-date return of 33.61%, a one-year return of 13.10%, and three- and five-year returns of 203.16% and 290.55%, respectively.



Analysts have set price targets for First Solar ranging from $157.56 to $356.00, with a consensus recommendation of “Strong Buy.” The next earnings report is expected between July 25, 2024, and July 30, 2024.



Key Upgrades for First Solar (FSLR)



First Solar has recently received several notable upgrades from major financial institutions. UBS Group raised its price target from $252.00 to $270.00 and maintained a “buy” rating, resulting in a 2.8% increase in First Solar’s share price on the day of the announcement. Barclays increased its target price from $227.00 to $228.00, with an “overweight” rating, while Mizuho upped its price objective from $196.00 to $209.00, issuing a “buy” rating.



Morgan Stanley raised its price target from $245.00 to $248.00, maintaining an “overweight” rating, and Oppenheimer lifted its price objective from $269.00 to $271.00, providing an “outperform” rating. Jefferies Financial Group increased its price objective from $209.50 to $211.00, with a “buy” rating.

DOGE Skyrockets 100% in Whale Transactions Amid Dogecoin ETF Rumors


Dogecoin (DOGE), the famous meme-inspired cryptocurrency, is experiencing a surge in large transactions in the last 24 hours, indicating potential activity from major investors, or "whales."According to data from IntoTheBlock, the total value of these large transactions, exceeding $100,000, nearly doubled in the past 24 hours, jumping from $1.53 billion to a staggering $3.01 billion. This translates to a significant rise in the volume of DOGE being moved by these whales, from 9.74 billion to 17.97 billion coins.This surge in whale activity coincides with growing speculation about a potential Dogecoin ETF. The recent optimism surrounding the Ethereum ETF has fueled rumors that DOGE could be next in line for its own regulated investment vehicle.Source: IntoTheBlockWhy is Dogecoin ETF possible?Dogecoin appears to have several factors working in its favor for ETF approval. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, DOGE is not suspected of being a security, its futures are already approved by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and it boasts a healthy market capitalization of $24 billion, ranking it as the eighth largest cryptocurrency.Interestingly, Billy Markus, one of the creators behind Dogecoin under the pseudonym Shibetoshi Nakamoto, has even chimed in on the ETF rumor with a lighthearted "amusing" remark. Whether fueled by these rumors or not, the recent surge in whale transactions suggests heightened interest in DOGE, and investors are watching closely to see if this translates to a price increase.

Perpetual futures contracts allow maximum gains, but traders should always consider the risk factors. Risks may include purchasing the altcoins with future threats, stronger wicks fund fluctuating prices, and loss from possible staking. 
Leverage enhances wicks, so handle the long-term trade very carefully. Liquidity mining and staking yields are compromised with a perpetual future, lowering long-term profits. The fluctuating funding reduces profits while a bullish market trend. So, perpetual futures have pitfalls like wicks staking loss funding rates issues despite high gains.

Crypto Futures vs. Traditional Futures – A Detailed and Comparative Analysis.

Factors to Consider While Trading in Crypto Perpetual Futures Contracts 
Cryptocurrency investors should consider the following factors in Crypto Futures Contracts

As a trader, you must be well aware of marketing analysis tools, including chart patterns, technical indicators, or support/resistance level. The knowledge of these tools will enhance your insight to analyse profitable trading business. You can take benefits by applying these techniques and took long or short position based upon market trends.

Set Stop Loss orders
You can also avoid the majority or the entire capital loss by applying stop loss order if the price of the asset moves adversely. The stop loss strategy ensures that the particular asset trade will be automatically closed if its price reaches the particular point. However you must also be very vigilant while the price movement is in a favorable direction to take benefit.  This technique is known as a discipline money management. 

Be Cautious About Funding Rates Fluctuations
Perpetual contracts embed a rate that is always charged every eight hours. These are also called inverse swaps. There can be no risk imbalances between buyers and sellers for exchange through funding rates. Although the interests of both buyers and sellers open matches at all times, leverage is subject to variation.

Crypto Futures Traders: What Are the 8 Common Trading Mistakes to Avoid?

The funding rate increases when the buyers long ask for greater leverage. Consequently, the fees will be covered by those buyers. This problem is particularly prevalent during bull run periods when there is typically a greater demand for longs.

ETHUSDT is an ETH/USDT perpetual futures contract priced on the BETHT Index. Each contract has a value equal to its price in Tether. The funding cost is paid and received every 8 hours. ETHUSDT uses a Premium index to calculate funding rates. 
The chart shows that the ETH USDT market made a bullish trend on November 10, 2023, raising its value to $2,118. After that, the market showed a slightly bearish trend and declined to $1,924 on November 17, 2023. 
However, it should be noted that some exchanges will allow manual selection of rates and set borrowing periods by users. This attitude is far better since unpleasant surprises are presented in this case, which will certainly occur after a large-scale buying activity.
Although perpetual futures trading is an excellent tool, it has shortcomings. Among those are stronger wicks running stop losses, inability to do staking, and the variable funding rate.
Leverage Results in More Powerful Wicks
The leverage will only lead to stronger wicks regardless of the market’s liquidity. Even though these moves usually do not result in a forced liquidation, they might run investors’ stops.
Thus, the principal reason why carrying futures positions for extended periods should be shunned is the probability of errant wicks.

Learn all about perpetual futures contracts in the cryptocurrency market, from their mechanics to trading strategies, with this comprehensive article.

Futures liquidation engines use price indexes from several spot (regular) exchanges to avoid price manipulation. So, the system will close positions with insufficient margin only once an index reaches its stops.


We have pasted screenshots of the two major crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. You have noticed that at the same moment, Binance is showing a BTC price of $69,852, which is lower than the price of the same asset at Coinbase is $70,244. Although the change is small, it can cause traders to close trades. 

Understand how liquidity pools are transforming the crypto futures market and their impact on your trading strategies with this comprehensive article.

Traders also have options to avoid such issues. They can change the trigger of stop orders from the last price to the Mark Price (Index). This simple strategy can save traders from liquidation, provided perpetual futures contracts separate monetarily from their index. 

Conclusion
So that’s it! If you’ve read the following sections, you should be familiar with what a perpetual futures contracts in crypto is and how to start perpetual contracts trading yourself with the help of one of the leading crypto exchanges on the market.

Learn the strategies and intricacies of perpetual swap contracts trading to enhance your 2024 investment tactics with this comprehensive article.

But, of course, being that this is such a broad subject, there are many things that we need more time to touch on, such as the question of whether perpetual futures contracts are enforceable, the funding fees mentioned above, and so on. Either way, you have a solid foundation for expanding your perpetual futures contract trading knowledge further.

Scarlett Johansson may have a case in OpenAI voice dispute


While Protos usually covers Sam Altman when he’s launching cryptocurrencies or scanning eyeballs, OpenAI and its CEO have recently made waves for other reasons: namely, it appears as though Altman and his team reached out to actress Scarlett Johansson, asked for her to be a voice for OpenAI, were refused permission, and chose to pursue a similar voice actor to create the voice instead.
AI advocates have been quick to suggest that, because it wasn’t Johansson herself, there would be no room for a possible lawsuit against OpenAI. As it turns out, things may not be that simple.
Indeed, there are many cases that suggest Johansson would not only have a case but would likely win.

Bette Midler v Ford Motor Company
In 1985, an advertising agency made a series of commercials for the Ford Lincoln Mercury that utilized hit music from the ‘70s but almost exclusively relied on sound-alike singers. One of these songs was Do You Want To Dance from Bette Midler’s album The Divine Miss M. Apparently, a brief phone interaction between the ad agency and Midler’s agent went as follows:
Ad Agent: Hello, I am Craig Hazen from Young and Rubicam. I am calling you to find out if Bette Midler would be interested in doing . . .?
Midler’s Agent: Is it a commercial?
Ad Agent: Yes.
Midler’s Agent: We are not interested.
The ad agency already had a license from the copyright holder to use the song and had a sound-alike sing it for the ad. Midler was alerted to it when ‘a number of people’ reached out to her to say it sounded exactly like her. A lawsuit followed.
Midler lost the initial case but won on appeal.
Importantly, the court asked, “Why did the defendants ask Midler to sing if her voice was not of value to them? Why did they studiously acquire the services of a sound-alike and instruct her to imitate Midler if Midler’s voice was not of value to them?” It then answered those questions in the next sentence, stating “What they sought was an attribute of Midler’s identity. Its value was what the market would have paid for Midler to have sung the commercial in person.”
While the case revolved around a singer, her song, and the use of both in an ad, it wasn’t those aspects that won her the case. Most importantly the court said “To impersonate her voice is to pirate her identity.”
Tom Waits v Frito-Lay
While Midler had the fact that she was a superstar and that the advertising agency had reached out to her representative and asked her to sing on her side in her court case, Tom Waits had no such advantages.
In his case against Frito-Lay, Waits sued the chip manufacturer for creating a radio jingle that sounded exactly like him.
Although no one from the ad agency reached out to Waits or his representatives, they did a ‘search for a lead singer for the commercial [that] suggests that no one would do but a singer who could not only capture the feeling of [Tom Waits’ 1976 song] Step Right Up but also imitate Tom Waits’ voice.’
The ad agency found a Waits impersonator and hired him to sing a song about Doritos. A video by Rock N’ Roll True Stories plays the embarrassing fake Tom Waits Frito Lay radio commercial here.
In the lead-up to the first airing of the ad, Frito-Lay reached out to the ad agency to ask if they could get sued for releasing it. The attorney for the ad agency said “there was a ‘high-profile’ risk of a lawsuit in view of recent case law recognizing the protectability of a distinctive voice,” adding “based on what Grossman had told him, however, the attorney did not think such a suit would have merit, because a singer’s style of music is not protected.”
Unfortunately for the ad agency lawyers, a jury decided in Waits’ favor even though they didn’t know of him and ‘thought [he] was a criminal’ the first time they saw him. Frito-Lay appealed.
Waits won on appeal, with the Ninth Circuit reaffirming almost all of the jury’s decisions, including his award for punitive damages of $2 million.
Vanna White v Samsung Electronics America
Wheel of Fortune hostess Vanna White sued Samsung for an ad it ran that featured a robot game show hostess. While it didn’t use her voice or name, it wore an outfit like White’s on Wheel of Fortune.
It turns out that even that was enough to win a court case.
The appeals court stated, “The right of publicity does not require that appropriations of identity be accomplished through particular means to be actionable,” adding that “if we treated the means of appropriation as dispositive in our analysis of the right of publicity, we would not only weaken the right but effectively eviscerate it.”
Read more: Opinion: Americans shouldn’t offer their eyeballs to WorldCoin
Honorable mention: Crispin Glover v Universal Pictures
Famously, Crispin Glover turned down a part in Back to the Future Part II because he didn’t like the script. But that didn’t stop Universal Pictures from using old footage, prosthetics, and face masks to recreate him in the Back to the Future sequel, and that pissed Glover off.
Upon receiving the lawsuit, Universal filed a demurrer arguing that ‘the publicity rights claim should fail because the filmmakers were only trying to perpetuate the George McFly character.’ This argument was rejected by the judge and, ultimately, the case was settled in (presumably) Glover’s favor.
Not federal law
Of course, none of these cases were taken to the Supreme Court in the US, and right to publicity has largely been decided state-by-state, so no one knows what could transpire on a federal level. It’s possible that Johansson doesn’t attempt to take OpenAI on for their misuse of a voice, particularly as it was quickly pulled.
While the demo video of the new OpenAI used Johansson-modelled ‘Sky’ voice, it’s unclear if this is enough to seek punitive damages or if Johansson is interested in spending years of time litigating against Microsoft and OpenAI.
Regardless, this marks a watershed moment where actors, artists, writers, and other creators will need to see how far they’re willing to let artificial intelligence go before it crosses the line on their rights to privacy and publicity.

U.S. Congressman warns CBDCs 'threaten to destroy the American way of life’


    Congressman Tom Emmer spoke in the House of Representatives against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), warning they are surveillance tools. Emmer has been against the U.S. current CBDC project for a while and is now doubling down on his stance.



Notably, the Congressman’s most recent appearance was in a video shared through his official X account on May 22. Before that, Tom Emmer gave an interview to Bloomberg on May 20, addressing a similar stance. According to him, the House of Republicans will take action to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC.



In this most recent speech, the U.S. Congressman warned CBDCs “threaten to destroy the American way of life.” This was said while Tom Emmer presented the “CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act.”








“With this legislation, we are going to stop unelected bureaucrats in the Biden Administration from using a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), that threatens to destroy the American way of life.”
– Tom Emmer








Congressman Tom Emmer: CBDCs must be like cash



Interestingly, Emmer continued his speech by comparing CBDCs with decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and mentioning the properties of the competing tools.




“Unlike decentralized digital assets such as Bitcoin, CBDCs are a digital form of a sovereign currency designed, issued, and monitored by the Federal Government. In short, a CBDC is a government-controlled, programable money that, if not designed to be just like cash—open, permissionless, and Private (with a capital P)—it not only could it will give the federal government significant transaction-level data and individuals an ability to suppress politically unpopular activity.”
– Tom Emmer




The Congressman mentioned the example of China weaponizing its Central Bank Digital Currency against its citizens, besides other countries. Moreover, Tom Emmer warned about a Federal Reserve document highlighting CBDCs as one of their key duties moving forward.



“In doing this, the Biden Administration has proven they are itching to trade Americans’ right to privacy for a CCP-style CBDC surveillance tool,” concluded the U.S. Representative.



However, he explained that the “CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act” will not prevent a CBDC from existing. The bill aims to ensure that the centralized monetary system can maintain cash’s attributes as permissionless and “Private (with a capital P)” and guarantee individual sovereignty.

There's Been A Serious Pump In Big Memecoin: Two Whales Bought Hours Earlier - Bitcoin Sistemi

In days when a very enthusiastic atmosphere prevails in the cryptocurrency market, memecoins do not stop their upward movements.
As it is known, it is almost certain that the SEC will approve Ethereum Spot ETFs, and the final decision date for these ETFs is tomorrow.


As the possibility of approval increased, almost all memecoins, especially PEPE, were positively affected.
Today, the significant rise of a memecoin attracts attention in the cryptocurrency market. The altcoin named Dogwifhat (WIF) experienced a significant rally during the day, rising from $ 2.71 to over $ 3.20.





Graph showing the rise in WIF price.
Whales did not sit idle during the rise of WIF. According to Onchain data, two cryptocurrency whales seem to have benefited from this rise.

The first whale, with short address 37reKQ, purchased 453,877 WIF tokens at $2.89, paying $1.31 million. Then, with the rally in WIF, the unrealized profit level of the whale is around 161 thousand dollars at the time of writing this article.


The second whale with short address 8rWUUy used $730 thousand SOL to buy 247,791 WIFs at $2.95 and currently holds a total of $4.5 million WIF.
Both whales are currently profitable, but PEPE's performance has been superior to WIF so far, even accounting for WIF's recent rise. One of the reasons for this may be that PEPE is Ethereum-based while WIF is Solana-based. There is a lot of hype in the Ethereum ecosystem right now due to ETFs.

Azuki 'Satoshi Nakamoto' Hoodie Is Tokenized on Both Bitcoin and Ethereum - Decrypt

Ethereum NFT project Azuki and multi-chain marketplace Magic Eden have teamed up to create what they’re calling the first dual-chain NFT product that exists on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains—a limited edition hoodie inspired by the creator of Bitcoin, represented by an NFT on both chains.The Azuki x Satoshi Nakamoto Enduro Hoodie, first revealed last fall, was created exclusively for holders of Azuki's "Spirits" NFTs—so there are just 98 pieces in total. The hoodies serve as a tribute to Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.Each hoodie contains an embedded chip that allows owners to scan it and mint a corresponding NFT as proof of ownership and authenticity on Ethereum—but also an NFT-like Ordinals inscription on Bitcoin.The hoodies utilize Azuki’s own Physical Backed Token (PBT) technology per the Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP-5791 standard. Ownership transfers require a signature from the physical chip embedded in each hoodie, creating what Azuki calls “decentralized on-chain verification combined with off-chain ownership."“The ownership on ETH is still tied to immutable art on BTC,” Azuki and Magic Eden noted in a statement. “The concept was built around the desire to collect and trade artifacts in a user-friendly way, which led to programming on EVM while keeping the art enshrined on BTC.”Azuki is one of the most prominent NFT properties, with more than $1.1 billion to date worth of trading volume for its original Ethereum collection alone, per CryptoSlam.Magic Eden has been the leading NFT marketplace by trading volume in recent months, thanks in part to its early bet on Bitcoin Ordinals.

Ripple Vs. SEC Lawsuit: Latest Filing Marks Beginning Of The End Of Historic Battle | Bitcoinist.com


								The long-running legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple is one step closer to an end with the Commission’s latest filing. The court is expected to give its judgment soon enough, as both parties have filed all necessary briefs. 
What The SEC’s Latest Filing Is About
The Commission filed a letter in opposition to Ripple’s motion to seal certain documents related to the remedies stage. In line with an earlier report, the SEC noted that they weren’t opposing Ripple’s requests in its entirety. For the opposed redactions, the Commission argued that the crypto firm had failed to “overcome the strong presumption that court filings should be public.”

The regulator mentioned that the materials they oppose a redaction are “fundamental to the rationale behind the SEC’s requested remedies.” The SEC further noted that Ripple had invited the public to form an opinion about the merits of the Commission’s positions. As such, the crypto firm cannot “simultaneously hide” from the public the evidence on which the SEC’s position is based. 
Furthermore, the SEC claimed that Ripple’s argument that failure to redact these documents could harm its business doesn’t eliminate the burden of proof on the crypto firm to show “exceptional circumstances” that justify sealing or redacting. Ripple had also cited earlier instances in the case where the court agreed to certain requests for sealing and redactions. 
However, the Commission claims it doesn’t “justify” Ripple’s requests as it tried to differentiate those earlier events from the case at hand. Firstly, they noted that the court’s earlier rulings regarding redactions were “in the context of specific filings, not for the rest of the case.” Unlike then, the financial information and offering terms the firm seeks to seal “is now at the crux of the remedies decision,” the SEC remarked. 
Secondly, the SEC argued that the documents that Ripple seeks to seal are ones which it would have been legally mandated to disclose in the first place since the court had already ruled that the firm’s institutional sales were investment contracts. Lastly, the Commission argued that these documents were already “stale” and there was no need to hide them. 
When Is A Final Judgment Expected For Ripple?
Judge Analisa Torres is expected to give her final judgment soon enough since both parties have filed all their respective briefs according to the scheduling order. However, before then, the Judge will need to rule on Ripple’s sealing motion and decide whether or not the crypto firm’s financial information should be made public. 

Following the ruling, Ripple will have fourteen days to file a public or redacted version (depending on the court’s ruling) of the documents in question. After this has been done, the court can then proceed to give its final judgment. The SEC has proposed that Judge Torres order a fine against Ripple summing up to almost $2 billion.
Meanwhile, Ripple has opposed the proposed remedies and asked that the court limit any proposed fine to just $10 million.

What a Potential Ethereum Spot ETF Could Mean for Cryptocurrencies?

It goes without saying that cryptocurrency and digital asset adoption has reached an inflection point. The recent approval of several Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the United States marked a significant milestone for Bitcoin and the entire crypto market as a whole.

Last year, we speculated on the prospect of these approvals and what impact it could have on the markets. 

Since the approvals in January, the cryptocurrency markets have entered a raging bull market with increased deliberation among the mainstream media. This week, we see yet another turning point towards widespread adoption with the chatter of the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) potentially approving several Ethereum Spot ETFs amidst a political backdrop in the US that is becoming increasingly crypto-friendly. 
Even though rumors of the Ethereum Spot ETF have been floating around for months, it wasn’t until this week when real traction grew. The SEC began actively engaging with issuers and national exchanges, mirroring the approach taken prior to the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs. This blog explores what an approval could bring to Ethereum, altcoins and the cryptocurrency sector as a whole over the short term and long term. 

The SEC’s Stance on Ethereum 
The second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has been in the crossfire with the United States’ SEC for years. Ever since Ethereum’s transition from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) in 2022, the SEC under the helm of Gary Gensler has been maneuvering to classify Ethereum as a security rather than a commodity. Shortly after the Merge, Gary Gensler stated that tokens in a PoS consensus system could be considered securities since investors rely on the efforts of others to make a profit. 
Classifying Ethereum as a security poses significant drawbacks for the crypto market. Such a designation would subject Ethereum to stringent regulatory requirements, potentially stifling innovation and deterring investment. 
The increased compliance costs and legal uncertainties could hinder the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain-based technologies built on the Ethereum network. 
Furthermore, it might prompt exchanges to delist Ethereum to avoid the complexities of trading securities, reducing its liquidity and accessibility for investors. This regulatory shift could create a ripple effect, impacting the broader crypto ecosystem and slowing the adoption of blockchain technology. 
In early 2024, the SEC began investigating Ethereum, issuing subpoenas to U.S. entities connected to the Ethereum Foundation. This move raised questions about whether it is part of a broader effort to classify ether as a security, possibly slashing hopes that the regulator will approve Ethereum Spot ETFs. Until last week, this mounting bearish stance pushed the odds of an Ethereum spot ETF being approved to 10%. 

Over the past week, however, the SEC has seemingly done a 180 on their stance on Ethereum. On Monday, news that the SEC had informed exchanges the agency was leaning towards approving Ethereum spot ETFs shook the world of cryptocurrencies.  
Possible Impact of an Approval 
Price Appreciation
While the decision on the Ethereum Spot ETF’s to be authorized is still pending, it is interesting to speculate on some of the scenarios that could take place. One such is an Ethereum price surge. This scenario has in fact already taken place. Since the news broke, Ethereum’s price rallied a staggering 20% in a single day. 

Some on twitter are also of the opinion that the news has not been priced in. Others view the break of structure as an indicator of the start of a longer-term parabolic bull market. 

To understand market sentiment and the characteristics that typify a crypto bull and bear market, read this article: Bull and Bear Markets Explained: A Guide to Maximizing Profits in Crypto 



Even though predicting short term price swings can be difficult, the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price following its ETF approvals may signal similar trends for Ethereum. 
An Altcoin Season 
An approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs could potentially trigger an altcoin season by significantly boosting investor confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market. Ethereum, as the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, holds a pivotal role in the crypto ecosystem. Its recognition and validation through a spot ETF would likely attract a wave of institutional and retail investment. 
This influx of capital could not only drive up the price of Ethereum but also increase interest in other altcoins, as investors look to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the broader market momentum. 
Historically, major developments and positive regulatory news for bluechip cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have had a cascading effect, lifting the entire market.

Moreover, an Ethereum Spot ETF approval could pave the way for a broader trend of crypto ETFs gaining regulatory approval. Established protocols like Solana are already being speculated as the next candidates for such recognition. 


Increased Institutional Adoption 
One possible scenario following the approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF is a significant increase in institutional adoption of Ethereum. With a spot ETF, traditional financial institutions such as mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds would have a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of directly purchasing and storing the cryptocurrency. 
This could lead to a substantial influx of institutional capital into the market, which would not only drive up the price of Ethereum but also enhance its legitimacy as a mainstream investment asset. 
We have already seen this play out with the Bitcoin ETFs with large hedge funds accumulating the digital asset at unprecedented rates. 

Easier Accessibility
Ethereum Spot ETFs will significantly enhance accessibility for people interested in investing in cryptocurrencies without having to navigate the complex technicalities of the Web3 ecosystem. 
Traditionally, investing in Ethereum requires a basic understanding of setting up crypto wallets, managing private keys, and purchasing the asset via cryptocurrency exchanges—all of which can be challenging for those unfamiliar with this space. With the introduction of Ethereum Spot ETFs, investors can bypass these hurdles. 

Read this article for an end-to-end guide on cryptocurrency wallets: Cryptocurrency Wallets: Explained

These ETFs, traded on traditional stock exchanges, offer a familiar and regulated investment vehicle that simplifies the process. This ease of access means that anyone with a brokerage account can gain exposure to Ethereum just as easily as they would with stocks or conventional ETFs.
The availability of Ethereum Spot ETFs will diversify the investor base by attracting people who use legacy investment platforms. By offering a product that fits within the existing framework of traditional finance, Ethereum Spot ETFs open the market to a broader audience, including institutional investors, retirement funds, and everyday individuals who prefer the security and simplicity of regulated financial products. 
Closing Thoughts 
The prospect of an Ethereum Spot ETF approval stands to significantly shake up the crypto sector, with both short-term and long-term implications. The approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs would mark a pivotal step towards mainstream adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into the global financial system. 
While the decision for approval remains to be seen at the time of this writing, the mere possibility and the precedent set by approved Bitcoin ETFs speak volumes about the progress and maturation of the cryptocurrency industry since its inception 15 years ago. 
The journey of digital assets from a niche investment opportunity to a significant component of the financial landscape underscores its transformative potential and the capacity to redefine financial paradigms.

MetaMask set to integrate native Bitcoin functionality - CoinJournal



                    

                    
MetaMask integrating native Bitcoin support, bridging Ethereum-Bitcoin gap.
Although no exact timelines, the integration is expected within a month.
Currently, MetaMask uses Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum’s decentralized applications.

MetaMask, renowned as the most-used Ethereum (ETH) wallet, is poised to transcend one of the biggest tribal divides in the crypto sphere by extending support to Bitcoin (BTC).
The move, anticipated within the next month, will mark a significant step towards interoperability in the ever-expanding world of cryptocurrencies.
This news comes at the backdrop of Metamask’s integration with Coinbase Onramp allowing Coinbase users with an active Coinbase account to seamlessly buy and transfer crypto directly to their MetaMask wallet by selecting the Coinbase Pay option.
Bitcoin addition part of MetaMask’s multi-chain approach
This development underscores MetaMask’s commitment to embracing a multi-chain approach in the Web3 landscape.
Currently, MetaMask does not directly facilitate Bitcoin transactions but utilizes Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), an Ethereum-compatible ERC-20 token, to bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum’s decentralized applications.
However, the forthcoming integration of native Bitcoin functionality within MetaMask holds the potential to streamline user interactions across different blockchain ecosystems, fostering greater interoperability and expanding the utility of both Ethereum and Bitcoin for users worldwide.
With over 30 million monthly active users, MetaMask serves as a vital gateway into the world of decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.
As Ethereum continues to pioneer innovations like smart contracts, MetaMask has played a crucial role in facilitating user navigation within this smart contract-based environment.
Now, with plans to incorporate Bitcoin functionality, MetaMask is poised to broaden its utility and appeal to a wider audience of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
No exact timeline for the integration
While the exact timeline for the integration remains uncertain, sources familiar with the matter suggest that access to native Bitcoin functionality could arrive within the MetaMask platform in the coming month.
However, the specific features and capabilities of Bitcoin support are yet to be finalized. It is anticipated that initial functionalities may be limited, with expansions and enhancements rolled out gradually over time.
MetaMask’s parent company, ConsenSys, led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, has expressed excitement about the prospect of embracing the multi-chain world of Web3.
A spokesperson for MetaMask emphasized the company’s ongoing commitment to enhancing usability and security while exploring new integrated features for its self-custodial wallet.

House of Representatives To Vote on Major Crypto Bill by the End of This Week - Here’s What It’s About - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. House of Representatives is gearing up to vote on a major crypto bill that aims to clarify how digital assets are regulated.
The bipartisan “Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act” would empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate crypto assets as commodities if the blockchain they run on is sufficiently decentralized.










The bill says decentralized blockchains can’t be controlled unilaterally by any one person. The potential legislation also states that no issuer or affiliated person can control 20% or more of the digital assets or the voting power of a decentralized chain.
Digital assets associated with blockchains that aren’t decentralized would be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as securities.
Eight Republicans and three Democrats have sponsored the bill, which is widely expected to go to a vote this week.
The Blockchain Association, a crypto lobbying group, has expressed support for the potential legislation, and a16z Crypto, the digital asset investment arm of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, says the act would “give blockchain projects a pathway to safely and effectively launch” in the United States.
House Democratic leaders don’t plan to whip against the bill but have expressed their opposition to the potential legislation, according to a report from Politico journalist Eleanor Mueller.
In an email sent to Democratic House members, the party leadership argues that the bill “undermines decades of legal precedent and case law, thereby creating uncertainty in our traditional securities market.”
“The bill also provides a safe harbor in which entities can file an “intent to register” if they meet certain requirements, effectively shielding them from SEC rules and regulations until SEC and CFTC finalize their rules, which weakens investor protections and opens the door to fraud and market manipulation.”

The Protocol: EIGEN Riches Tempt Ethereum Devs, Even as ETF Approval Nears

MEV SNIPING! It's not clear exactly what started it all, but top Ethereum developers locked horns on the social-media platform X, in an intense and almost uncomfortable-to-observe debate touching on the practice of maximal extractable value, or MEV – essentially, the use of sophisticated trading bots to frontrun user transactions at the point of execution. On May 16, Ethereum core developer Péter Szilágyi tweeted about his despair over the lack of progress in pushing to solve some of the blockchain's most vexing issues. "Voila, the banking system recreated," he wrote. One of his points was that Ethereum had "glorified" MEV, remarking, ostensibly in sarcasm, that it was "futile to fight against MEV, so might as well lean hard on it, right?" (As chronicled in last week's issue of The Protocol, even U.S. government officials now appear to characterize MEV as standard operating procedure on the blockchain.) Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist retweeted Szilágyi's post with the comment, "This is such a lazy take if you can't also tell me what your supposed solutions are that let local block producers extract MEV." A back-and-forth ensued, and then Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin chimed in, tweeting that "I'm really proud that Ethereum does not have any culture of trying to prevent people from speaking their minds, even when they have very negative feelings toward major things in the protocol or ecosystem." Buterin, who is known to write long, interrupted his work on a project in Kenya to bang out a 3,000-word-plus essay breaking down the issues, concluding: "I also do not think that the situation is anywhere near as hopeless as Peter's tweets imply."

Good News from the USA to Binance! The Court Cancelled the Prohibition Decision! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Good news came from the USA for Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.
According to Bloomberg, the Florida Court of Appeals overturned the Binance ban.


Accordingly, the First District Court of Appeal in Florida overturned the ban on Binance on May 22 with a unanimous decision.
In its decision, the court said state regulators did not follow proper procedures when banning Binance in November 2023.





The court ruled that Binance's operations in the state could not be blocked under the emergency cease-and-desist order issued by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation.
The Court of Appeals also stated that the Florida Office of Financial Regulation did not consider CZ's conduct to be grounds for suspending the license of Binance's Florida subsidiary.


Florida regulators' decision to suspend Binance came after former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges.

Is Donald Trump Accepting Crypto Donations 'Just Another Cow For Him To Milk?' - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump is now accepting cryptocurrency for official campaign donations, a move that has garnered mixed reactions from experts in the crypto industry. While some see this as a strategic play to attract crypto enthusiasts, others remain skeptical about Trump’s genuine commitment to the sector.Experts Split On Trump's Move To Accept Crypto DonationsDavid Hoffman, Co-owner at Bankless, dismissed the significance of Trump’s move, stating, “I'm not going to celebrate Donald Trump accepting crypto donations. It's trivial. Thinking it's ‘embracing the industry' is naive. Trump has not shown any true commitment to crypto. So far, we are just another cow for him to milk.”In contrast, Ryan Selkis, founder & CEO at Messari Crypto, views Trump's acceptance of crypto donations more positively.“You can now support the first pro-crypto major presidential candidate, President Trump…with crypto,” Selkis said, adding, “Liz had an army. We have a hulk.”Selkis also highlighted Trump's recent influence on the crypto market and regulatory environment, noting, “In one week, [Trump] sparked a $200 billion+ crypto market rally, forced Senate Dems into submission on SAB 121, forced the resignation of the FDIC Chair, forced the SEC to reverse course on its ETF approval, and upped FIT 21 odds of passage.”The Shift To Crypto Donations: Strategic Move Or Token Gesture?In early May, Trump indicated his support for the cryptocurrency sector, announcing that his campaign would begin accepting crypto donations.“If you like crypto in any form…if you’re in favor of crypto you’d better vote for Trump,” the former president remarked at the time.Also Read: Ethereum ETF Launch Potentially Still Weeks Away, Says Bloomberg AnalystTrump Campaign First Major Party To Embrace Crypto DonationsOn Tuesday, Trump's presidential election campaign became the first major party campaign to accept cryptocurrency donations. A statement from the campaign reads, “This addition to President Trump’s already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrencies for donations.”The fundraising initiative adheres to Federal Election Commission regulations and will accept any cryptocurrency currently supported by Coinbase Commerce, including Bitcoin BTC/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD, Solana SOL/USD, Tether USDT/USD, Rippple XRP/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD, Cardano ADA/USD, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, and Avalanche AVAX/USD.Eric.eth commented on the broader political landscape, "It AMAZES me that people in crypto are still out here defending Biden. The guy has outright assaulted our industry for 4 years. ‘Ya but Trump may change tone once elected' is max cope. No proof whatsoever that’s true. Are you people OK? Blink twice if you need help."Comparing Crypto Strategies: Trump vs. KennedyTrump’s decision to accept cryptocurrency donations comes as a strategic move to attract crypto-friendly voters, particularly as independent competitor Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been accepting Bitcoin donations for months. This effort is seen as a counter to the anti-crypto stance of President Joe Biden and several Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren.The campaign website promotes Trump's stance on new technologies, stating, “Trump stands ready to embrace new technologies that will Make America Great Again.”It further emphasizes Trump’s track record in reducing regulations and supporting financial innovation, contrasting it with the Democratic approach of more stringent government controls.Political And Market ImpactAs Trump's campaign aims to build a “crypto army” to secure victory in the 2024 election, this move could significantly influence the cryptocurrency market and its regulatory landscape. Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and ConsenSys, remarked, “The resulting ‘floodgate' of demand for Ether will likely lead to a supply crunch. There's going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether.”The broader implications of this development, including regulatory trends and market dynamics, will be explored at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. Industry leaders, investors, and policymakers will gather to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.Read Next: Bitcoin Spot ETFs See Seventh Straight Day Of Inflows With $306MImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Bitcoin Market Not 'Top Heavy' Yet But More Consolidation Expected: Analysts


																BTC prices have retreated back below $70,000 during Wednesday morning’s Asian trading session but markets are not overbought yet, according to analyst James Check.
“Right now, using a variety of volume metrics as the input, BTC prices appear to be right in line with the fundamentals,” he said in a newsletter on May 21.
Moreover, the market looks like it did in late-2020, he added.
In early December 2020, BTC prices rose to reclaim its 2017 all-time high of $20,000. It consolidated around this level for a couple of weeks before surging to a new peak of $30,000 by New Year’s Day.


History Rhyming?
During this recent cycle, BTC prices have climbed to almost reclaim their mid-March peak of $73,738 but have found resistance there, indicating positive momentum and potential for entering price discovery territory.




“Only seven days in all history have a closing price above this [$71,000], so we are really breathing thin air up here,” said the analyst.
He added that “punching a convincing all-time-high is rarely successful on the first go” before stating that a period of “chopping wood” and a couple of significant attempts is very normal.
Moreover, the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio suggests that bitcoin’s price is in line with its on-chain transaction throughput, similar to the conditions seen during late 2020.
Additionally, the short-term holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) shows that the market is in an “enthusiastic” but not “euphoric” phase, indicating a potentially sustainable uptrend.
This is a condition in which a significant number of holders are caught off guard and buy too many coins at too high a price.
The Glassnode analyst also mentions a “top-heavy” market condition, where a significant number of investors are holding assets at a loss. However, he notes that this condition has improved significantly, with only 6.6% of the short-term holder supply now held at a loss, reducing the risk of panic selling.
More Chopsolidation Ahead
On May 21, fellow analyst “Rekt Capital” predicted that a weekly candle close above $71,500 “would probably kickstart the breakout from the re-accumulation range.” However, BTC prices had already dipped to $69,782 at the time of writing.
He added that history suggests BTC should consolidate inside this re-accumulation range for several weeks more.

5 Stocks Orbiting Nvidia's Earnings Report Today - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



When Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) released its earnings report in February for (fiscal) Q4 ‘24, it significantly impacted other tech stocks. Having exceeded expectations and outperformed in data center revenue, the chipmaker bumped the NASDAQ 100 (NDX) index by 3% into the next day.



This is not surprising with Nvidia’s current market cap gravity pull of $2.38 trillion. Having started the year with $1.22 trillion, this is an impressive 95% growth of value. Effectively, NVDA stock became a proxy for all things related to generative AI infrastructure, although AMD’s MI300X chips are heading to be more cost effective.



After the market closes on May 22nd, Nvidia is scheduled to release the earnings report for fiscal Q1 2025, ending April 2024. Considering Nvidia’s heavy gravity, let’s look at five stocks that are directly involved with the company or could be lifted by Nvidia’s AI tide. 



SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN)



Notwithstanding Nvidia’s disclosure of 1.73 million SOUN shares at the end of 2023, SoundHound AI is a sound investor choice in its own right. The Santa Clara startup leverages the need for natural voice interfacing powered by machine learning. 



Alongside food chains like White Castle and Krispy Kreme, SoundHound’s AI-powered voice systems found themselves in leading auto brands under the Stellantis umbrella, including Kia, Hyundai, and Honda. Owing to the NVIDIA DRIVE framework, SoundHound is working toward AI interactions without cloud connectivity.



In February’s earnings for Q1, the company reported a 73% YoY revenue growth. Although still delivering a $33 million net loss, SoundHound ended the quarter with $226 million net cash. Year-to-date, SOUN stock is up 147% at present $5.14 per share. Nasdaq’s average SOUN price target is $7.17 per share.



Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU as ADS)



Before US export controls on AI chips, Chinese Baidu was a major source of revenue for Nvidia. The company is still a major AI player since shifting to Huawei’s 910B Ascend and its own Kunlun chips. 



Both Baidu and Alibaba recently cut prices on their large-language model as the AI cloud-compute wars heat up in China. In a bid to corner the market, Baidu’s Ernie Speed and Ernie Lite LLMs are now free for business accounts. 



The company’s income stream is stable owing to ad revenue and subscription services like Netflix. In May, for Q1 2024, Baidu reported 7% net income growth and 25% YoY growth for its Apollo Go, an autonomous ride-hailing service. 



Year-to-date, BIDU has tracked a negative 10% performance at $103.50 per share price. Given Nasdaq’s forecasted average BIDU price target of $155.06 per share, this makes for a very strong upswing potential.





Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM as ADS)



In a different timeline, this British semiconductor company would operate under Nvidia. But after failing to acquire Arm for $40 billion in 2020, Nvidia settled for a minor $147.3 million stake. Arm is a highly attractive asset, considering its over 90% market share in the mobile applications market.



Rather than manufacturing chips, Arm relies on design licensing for its revenue. According to a Nikkei report, the company is set to launch AI chips by spring 2025, contracting with various manufacturers for mass production. This will be a boon to suppliers looking to wean off of Nvidia.



ARM stock is up 65% year-to-date. Wall Street Journal’s aggregated forecast puts the average ARM price target at $118.81 vs. the current $114.30 per share, with a high potential of $195.



Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ: NNOX)



Nvidia’s stake in this startup of $380k was a leftover from Nano-X acquiring Zebra Medical, which Nvidia invested in 2017. Nonetheless, Nano-X got into the public spotlight aiming to reduce healthcare costs with AI solutions.



Specifically, to leverage Digital Tomosynthesis imaging tech to break the barrier for complex and expensive scanning and diagnosis. Combined with Nanox.ARC, the company’s ecosystem to make it happen, is facilitated by Nanox.AI and Nanox.Cloud. 



Nano-X is scheduled to release its Q1 2024 report on May 28th. Previously, the company reported $10.2 million net loss, which was a significant reduction from $52.8 million net loss in a year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, NNOX stock is up 40%. Nasdaq’s average NNOX price target is $16 vs current $9 per share. 







Mobileye Global (NASDAQ: MBLY)



Mobileye’s claim to fame is its camera sensor, which facilitates ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance Systems) technology. The company’s latest iteration is Mobileye EYEQ6 Lite, which collaborates closely with the Volkswagen Group. 



The Israel-based company directly competes with Nvidia, having noted in 2019 that “Nvidia must think very highly of us,” referring to Nvidia’s Safety Force Field (SFF). Mobileye CEO construed Nvidia’s document as heavily influenced by Mobileye’s own Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) published in 2017.



In April, Mobileye delivered Q1 earnings, showing a 48% YoY revenue decline and a $218 million net loss vs. a $79 million net loss in the year-ago quarter. However, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua is still optimistic, forecasting fully autonomous vehicles hitting the roads in 2026.



With its heavy presence in Israel, investors should note that Intel (INTC) also has a stake in Mobileye. As of February, Intel CEO Gelsinger alone owned 66,386 MBLY shares, alongside 456k shares across trusts. Since Intel is one of the main beneficiaries of the CHIPS Act, aiming to become the world’s second-largest chipmaker after TSMC, long-term Mobileye investments are likely.



Year-to-date, MBLY shares are down 33%. At $27.66, Nasdaq’s average MBLY price target of $38 per share creates a high profit potential. The upper forecasting ceiling for MBLY stock twelve months ahead is $53 per share.

For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 22, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Coinbase, Robinhood Markets, Reddit, GameStop and MicroStrategy.3 Crypto-Related Stocks to Buy NowCoinbaseCoinbase COIN is the most prominent crypto exchange in the U.S., earning a best-possible Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) score.Cash CowSeth Klarman is a legendary value investor, billionaire, and one of the highest-earning money managers in the world. In an interview last year, Klarman stated that he avoids crypto but sees value in Coinbase, saying, "Coinbase is sitting on $5 billion in cash, has less than that in debt, and is doing some smart things." Well, now that number has grown to more than 7 billion. I bring this to your attention because not many people trading a stock like COIN probably understand how sound the company is fundamentally.Coinbase Smashing the Street's ExpectationsOn May 3rd, the leading crypto exchange announced EPS of $4.4, smashing the Street's estimate of $1.07.Here is a snippet of the EPS transcript that stuck out to me:"Our financial performance in Q1 reflects our focused execution on product expansion, ongoing operational discipline, and strong crypto market conditions. We generated $1.6 billion of total revenue and $1.2 billion of net income*. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 billion – more than we generated in all of 2023." Lastly, we continue to drive regulatory clarity for crypto through grassroots advocacy, pushing for legislation, and ongoing efforts to seek clarity through the courts." COIN has beaten expectations for five straight quarters, and not only are they beating them, they are smashing them. Over the past five quarters the average EPS surprise is 364.63%!Robinhood MarketsZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Robinhood HOOD is one of the most popular brokerages in the United States. Robinhood was the first major broker to "democratize" trading by offering a commission-free investing app. The app rose to prominence during the meme stock craze that was spurred on by retail investing groups on the social media platform Reddit RDDT and included meteoric moves in stocks like GameStop GME.Bull Catalyst: CryptoHOOD recently added crypto-enabled trading. Though HOOD is late to the crypto game, the company has the perfect client base to take advantage of a Bitcoin BTC/USD bull market.Consistent Positive EPS SurprisesHOOD reported first-quarter earnings that trounced Zacks Consensus Estimates by 260%. Over the past four quarters, positive earnings beats have become the norm, with an average EPS beat of 230%!Record Net DepositsNet deposits are one of the most important metrics to monitor for brokers. HOOD net deposits reached a record $11.2 billion in Q1, translating to a 44% annualized growth rate and contributing to a 30% growth rate over the last twelve months. Meanwhile, CEO Vlad Tenev announced on May 14th that Robinhood hit $5B in equities trading volume.Robinhood Gold Is GrowingRobinhood recently announced a new "Gold" credit card. HOOD has already gained a healthy 260,000 new subscribers.MicroStrategyMicroStrategy MSTR has been around for years and is a leading provider of business intelligence software.Adopting the Bitcoin StandardFormer CEO and billionaire Michael Saylor made waves on Wall Street a few years ago when he got MSTR on the "Bitcoin Standard." Instead of sitting in inflationary assets like U.S. dollars, Saylor realized MSTR would be better off on a "Bitcoin sail." Essentially, MSTR is a leveraged Bitcoin bet. The results speak for themselves – over the past five years, MicroStrategy is up more than 1,000%!Conversely, a good option for investors who do not want a leveraged bet but want to tap into Bitcoin's potential upside is the IBIT ETF IBIT. IBIT has some of the lowest fees and the most liquidity out of all the Bitcoin ETFs.Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Inherent in any investment is the potential for loss.

Florida court reinstates Binance US money services license - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Binance US wins appeal to reinstate its Florida money-services business license.
Court ruled OFR lacked legal justification for the emergency suspension order.
Binance US suspension posed financial risks to over 170,000 Florida account holders.

Binance US has successfully appealed the suspension of its money-services business license in Florida.
The Florida First District Court of Appeal ruled that the emergency suspension order issued by the state Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) lacked sufficient legal justification.
Binance US suspension was unjustified
The suspension, initiated following Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s guilty plea on November 21, 2023, to federal charges of violating U.S. Anti-Money Laundering laws, was deemed unjustified by the court.
The court noted that the relevant state law uses the term “may,” indicating discretion rather than a mandatory action, for suspending a license.
In its ruling the court has said that it requires the OFR to provide additional reasoning beyond merely citing the statute and to explore less severe alternatives to outright suspension.
The court’s decision further emphasized that the suspension posed significant financial risks to over 170,000 Florida account holders.
The court stated, “For Petitioner to immediately comply with the ESO, it would be necessary to liquidate the digital asset holdings of every customer [which] threatens financial harm because of digital asset price fluctuations.”
Binance US resumes operations in Florida
The suspension in Florida was one of the first among several states following Zhao’s plea, with similar actions in Alaska, Maine, North Carolina, and Oregon.
In addition, the status of Binance US’s operations remains uncertain in Georgia and Ohio, while it has never operated in Hawaii, Minnesota, New York, Texas, and Vermont.
Although the ruling is subject to appeal, Binance US can resume its operations in Florida for now.
The crypto exchange has, however, temporarily paused new user onboarding in Florida while continuing to serve its existing customers in the state.

Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GRATRUMP has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Grabby Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Grabby Trump could become the next viral memecoin.



Grabby Trump launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Grabby Trump on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Grabby Trump by entering its contract address – 84ABvkFYWuh5oCSvPMztyeK5yVQAsd17egSLgJN4X9nr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GRATRUMP.

BREAKING: Highly Anticipated FED Minutes Released - Here Are The Most Important Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Investors were expecting to hear more details today about what led Federal Reserve officials to advance plans to slow the pace of balance sheet reduction even as the central bank keeps its benchmark interest rate steady.
Here are the highlights from the minutes of the April 30-May 1 meeting, where interest rates were kept constant:



'Many' respondents were uncertain about the degree to which the policy would be restricted.
'Various' participants are willing to tighten further if necessary.
Respondents assessed that it would take longer than previously anticipated to gain greater confidence that inflation would move sustainably towards 2%.
Several participants said it would be helpful to begin discussions about the appropriate term structure of the Fed's portfolio over the long term.
Nearly all respondents supported the Fed's decision to begin slowing the pace of decline in securities holdings; a few supported continuing the current pace.
Officials are discussing keeping interest rates steady for longer if inflation does not fall.
FED officials drew attention to the 'disappointing' inflation figures in the first quarter.
'Various' Fed officials have talked about raising interest rates if inflation warrants it.
Participants noted that the future policy path will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.
Many participants expressed uncertainty regarding the degree of policy restrictiveness.
Several participants spoke of a willingness to tighten policy further if the risks to the outlook materialize and make such action appropriate.
Some officials think long-term interest rates may be higher than previously thought.
Some officials worry that financial conditions are not restrictive enough.
Although the economic forecast of the FED staff is similar to the March outlook, it was stated that the deterioration in the financial positions of low-income households, in particular, could pose a greater obstacle to economic activity than anticipated.

While FED officials decided to keep the federal interest rate target at 5.2-5.50%, Powell stated that the current stance is appropriately restrictive and maintains maximum flexibility and optionality.

However, Citi's Andrew Hollenhorst argued that the economic data released so far this month, including the consumer price index, which points to a welcome slowdown in inflation, and the latest comments from FED speakers make the minutes “stale” at this point.





“The slowdown in employment growth and significant declines in individual sales and industrial production since the May 1 FOMC meeting will further convince officials that growth is slowing,” Hollenhorst wrote.

Whale Withdraws Over Half a Trillion PEPE Worth Nearly $8,000,000 From Binance As Memecoin Soars - The Daily Hodl


								A deep-pocketed crypto entity has been seen suddenly withdrawing more than a half trillion Pepe (PEPE) as the memecoin soars, on-chain data shows.
Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain noticed that the crypto whale withdrew 592 billion PEPE from Binance, the world’s top crypto exchange, which was worth nearly $8 million at the time of the transaction.










“A whale withdrew 592 billion PEPE ($7.95 million) from Binance [on May 22nd], most likely bought during the price increase over the past two days.”
Source: Lookonchain/X
Pepe is trading for $0.0000137 at time of writing, up 11.5% in the past 24 hours and 108% in the last month.
Some analysts are suddenly turning bullish on Pepe, including pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa.
 “If you’re looking for a big cap meme to long, I think PEPE is a good one, good liquidity, strong volume. This one definitely catches up to the others a bit in my opinion – not saying it’ll flip Doge or anything, but should go up more relatively. Long in the green boxes.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Pepe could retest two trading ranges to the downside, including the range between $0.00001300 to $0.00001200 and $0.00001150 to $0.00001100, before rallying again.
However, another popular analyst DonAlt is warning that red-hot memes like Pepe could see a sudden collapse in value of more than 80% based on data from previous cycles.
“If I’m right, the popular memes we trade today will trade 80%+ lower. Then you’ll have new memes come up that build new communities that run up. And we’ll have the same discussions in a couple of years.”

Biden Campaign Pleads For Donations To Compete With Crypto Execs Supporting Trump


                        
                            Biden Campaign Pleads For Donations To Compete With Crypto Execs Supporting Trump

                        President Joe Biden’s election campaign team is calling for financial aid to keep up with his Republican, competition, who he says is backed by the wealthy crypto industry.Biden Begs For Support To Fight Crypto
In a widely circulated screenshot on Wednesday, Biden’s campaign team appeared to have messaged followers warning them of the sheer size of donations being received by the Trump campaign.“Folks, this couldn’t be any more serious,” Biden’s message reads. “Cryptocurrency executives and oil barrons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump. They’re rushing $800,000 checks at glitzy events.”Biden admitted that Trump’s campaign was outraising his own, pulling $76 million in April, with $50 million raised purely from the former President’s $50 million Florida gala last month.Biden’s request mimics those of democratic senator Elizabeth Warren months prior, who is now in direct competition with a Republican pro-crypto lawyer for her seat in Massachusets.Figures from the Federal Election Commission last month showed that John Deaton – who represented 75,000 XRP investors in a lawsuit with federal regulators last year – raised $1.36 million in Q1, compared to Warren’s $1.1 million. Some of Deaton’s donors included Skybridge Capital co-founder Anthony Scaramucci and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, among others.Crypto’s Partisan Nature
Crypto’s lopsided support for Republicans follows years of hostile enforcement actions against the industry from the Democrat-led Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and direct efforts from the White House to hamper the Bitcoin mining industry.Earlier this month, the White House promised to veto legislation that would repeal SAB 121 – an SEC rule widely criticized for preventing regulated banks from offering crypto custody services.Both the House and Senate have now passed the resolutions, with total Republican support alongside small Democrat support in both chambers.Meanwhile, Donald Trump – who once derided Bitcoin as a scam – is now warming up to the industry. After a February interview saying he would be tolerant of Bitcoin, the candidate has now begun accepting crypto-based campaign donations, with intentions to build a “crypto army” challenging Elizabeth Warren’s hostile efforts.An official filing in October 2023 showed that Trump personally owned between $250,000 and $500,000 in crypto.Later today, the House of Representatives will vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which is intended to foster broad regulatory clarity for crypto at large.

Bitcoin Bulls Are Strong: Over 450,000 Addresses Bought 273,000 BTC At This Level


																Bitcoin is cooling off after an impressive 25% spike from May 2024 lows. Even with this cool-off, some analysts are upbeat, predicting the coin will extend gains in future sessions.
Bitcoin Finds Strong Support Between $70,180 and $70,600
In a post on X, one analyst believes Bitcoin has strong support at around $70,180 and $70,600. The analyst explained that on-chain data shows that over 450,000 addresses collectively bought over 273,000 BTC at this price range. 
Zone above $70,000 emerging as support | Source: @ali_charts on X
For this reason, the concentration of BTC holdings in this zone means the coin has strong support. If the level is to be broken, then sellers would need to make an even larger effort to break through this line, with a higher amount of BTC hitting the sell side of the equation.

On-chain analytics firm Glassnode notes that the Bitcoin market is cooling after intense selling pressure. After the strong uptick that saw the coin roar to as high as $73,800 in March 2024, prices plunged to as low as $56,500 this month. Prices have since recovered, but bulls have yet to break above all-time highs.
While capital inflows remain moderate, Glassnode adds, volatility has decreased noticeably. Still, whether this volatility will shoot higher once $72,000 is broken remains to be seen.
BTC Retraces: Will Bulls Break $72,000?
 
All eyes are on whether BTC bulls will shake off the current correction. In a post on X, another analyst said holders shouldn’t be worried because of this pullback and the failure of bulls to confirm the May 20 leg up.
Pullbacks are inevitable in bull markets | Source: @CryptoJelleNL via X
Instead, the analyst is confident, saying pullbacks are a natural part of any bull market. The recent 23% correction, the analyst added, is an example. 
What’s important is that every retracement has been from a higher position. Therefore, the next local bottom will likely be higher than the previous one, potentially reaching around $80,000. 

	Related Reading



Thus far, BTC has a strong resistance of $72,000. The bulls didn’t push through this line, even with more serious attempts in early April. 
As a result, this reaction level remains important from a technical perspective. Any breakout for now would increase the probability of BTC prices floating to retest $73,800 or break higher.

In the days ahead, inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) coupled with improving sentiment might spark more demand. In that likelihood, BTC bulls will find the momentum to confirm the May 20 bar and break above the local resistance.

Solana & Bitcoin Sentiment Still Bearish: Signal To Buy?


								Data suggests the market sentiment around Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC) is negative currently, something that could benefit their prices.
Crowd Bearish About Solana & Bitcoin While Ethereum Gets All The Hype
As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment in a post on X, investors have still not become bullish about Bitcoin and Solana despite their recent surge.
The relevant indicator here is the “Weighted Sentiment,” which is based on two other metrics: Sentiment Balance and Social Volume. The former measures the net sentiment among cryptocurrency traders right now.

This indicator works by analyzing social media data and applying a machine learning model to differentiate between negative and positive posts about the asset. Then, it uses the difference between the two to determine which side is currently dominant.
The second metric of interest here, Social Volume, tracks the unique number of posts/messages/threads on social media platforms discussing a given asset. Essentially, its value represents the degree of discussion the coin receives from social media users.
While the Sentiment Balance does provide information about the net sentiment in the market, it’s not always useful, as it doesn’t say anything about how many users actually share this opinion.
The Weighted Sentiment fixes this problem by weighing the Sentiment Balance against the Social Volume. This means that this indicator’s value only spikes in either direction when many posts discuss the asset, and most of them are positive or negative about the coin.
Here is a chart showing the trend in the Weighted Sentiment for three of the top cryptocurrencies in the sector: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

The value of the metric appears to have been quite positive for ETH recently | Source: Santiment on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Weighted Sentiment for Bitcoin and Solana has been negative recently. Interestingly, these red levels have persisted despite their prices observed bullish winds.
Ethereum, on the other hand, has seen a large positive spike in the indicator, implying that many bullish posts related to the coin are spreading on social media.
This optimism behind the cryptocurrency is due to positive news about the odds of the ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) being approved.

Historically, market euphoria has been a bearish sign, as the price generally tends to move opposite to the majority’s expectations. Similarly, investors’ fear has been a positive sign that fresh surges will start.
As such, at least going by the sentiment, Bitcoin and Solana may be more likely to see a rise than Ethereum, which may be getting too hot.
SOL Price
With gains of more than 19% over the past week, Solana is among the best performers out of the top coins by market cap. At present, SOL’s price is trading around $177.

                        Wednesday, 22 May 2024 – Learn-to-Earn token 99Bitcoins ($99BTC) has raised $1.5 million from contributors to its presale as interest in its pioneering protocol grows.99Bitcoins is one of the most well-known and earliest of the Bitcoin education sites and is a respected resource for all those who wish to find out more about bitcoin and crypto more broadly.There are just five days to go before the token presale price increases from $0.00106 to $0.00107, so there’s no time to lose to catch the lowest bid.As Bitcoin hovers around the $70,000 mark a renewed push to all-time highs above $74,00,000 is on the cards, and that will keep 99Bitcoins’ presale firmly in the spotlight.Ethereum ETF approval will further drive up interest in crypto and 99Bitcoins token
Bitcoin has entered the financial mainstream following the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which provide a regulated, cheap and easy entry point for investing in the preeminent digital asset.Since then, the possibility that an Ethereum ETF could be next up for approval has led to a resurgence in crypto prices, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the way.This is all good news for top crypto education and information sites like 99Bitcoins.Bloomberg Intelligence analysts have changed the probability of an Ethereum ETF being approved from 10% to 75%, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked providers to expedite submission of paperwork (19-b4s forms to be precise) that are seen as a precursor to an approval.Tomorrow, 23 May, the first provider to have its Ethereum ETF up for consideration by the SEC is VanEck Ethereum ETF.Although it is not certain that positive news will emerge tomorrow, all the signs are pointing to an approval, albeit the exact date may be several weeks away.The SEC is thought to be likely to approve all the submitted ETFs at the same time, as it did with the Bitcoin ETFs, in order to not give any one provider an advantage over its competitors.There are a total of 10 Ethereum ETFs seeking approval or conversion in the case of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.This news flow combined with the bitcoin halving event that typically ushers in a bullish pricing environment for crypto, means the 99Bitcoins presale is set to rocket.Helping $99BTC to stand out from the crowd is its strong protocol fundamentals, connected as it is to the mounting interest in the crypto space.99Bitcoins ($99BTC) is presenting to the market a revamped educational platform that monetizes education with a Learn-to-Earn rewards model that is uniquely well-positioned for success.There’s no telling how much value can be placed on trust, and 99Bitcoins has that enviable commodity by the bucket load.It means the platform will be able to capture a significant chunk of new entrants to the crypto space looking for best-in-class educational resources they can rely on.99Bitcoins’ early emphasis on the visual learner through its YouTube channel will also stand it in good stead with crypto beginners, where its new visual courses are sure to be a hit.No business or website can rest on its laurels, but where 99Bitcoins is concerned, its pedigree heritage platform gives it a competitive advantage as an educator and resource provider.Its YouTube channel has 700,000 subscribers and the crypto courses already have more than two million registered users.This is how 99Bitcoins’ token works to incentivize learning
99Bitcoins combines gamification with a leaderboard reward system to incentivize users to keep learning. The concept is simplicity itself: users earn crypto while learning about crypto.Interactive learning modules, quizzes, and tutorials are all designed with gamification in mind.User progression is reinforced through the unlocking of more courses, which means more opportunities to earn rewards – at the core of the system is the $99BTC token to make learning engaging, enjoyable and profitable for all users.The emphasis on multimedia taps into the reality that people find it easier and less daunting to learn when they have audio and visual aids, instead of being expected to wade through a textbook.Building on its current offering, the courses will cover everything from the ins and outs of blockchains to crypto wallet basics, how-to guides all the way through to trading signals, strategies, and high-end technical knowledge.$99BTC token has a lot going for it in the utility stakes, which is why some crypto experts think it could be a top bet for the next 10x crypto:VIDEOWhere it all began for 99Bitcoins… and where it is headed with BRC20 tokens
The roots of 99Bitcoins go back to 2013, two years before Ethereum even existed and around the same time Bitcoin achieved some mainstream awareness.Always an evangelist for financial freedom and an eye for getting people into the space, 99Bitcoins began life as BitcoinWithPayPal.com.The website said what it does on the tin.But including another company in the brand name didn’t go down too well with PayPal, so the 99Bitcoins brand was born.Being a trailblazer remains in the DNA of the website, which is why it is now pivoting to Web3 with its groundbreaking Learn-to-Earn ecosystem.Although $99BTC initially launches as an ERC-20 token, it will transition to BRC-20, the new Bitcoin Ordinals standard.Ordinals use spare ‘inscriptions’ space provided in the Bitcoin protocol to store the code for fungible tokens. The innovation first began as a way to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain.Among the new projects being built on the Bitcoin blockchain are the ORDI and SATS tokens, up 6.7% and 9% respectively over the past seven days.Therefore, 99Bitcoins is launching at an opportune time, as judged by the current market sentiment and the targeting of the expected continued growth in this exciting new area of Bitcoin development.The market value (market capitalization) of BRC-20 tokens is today a little shy of a whopping $2 billion.99Bitcoins is giving away $99,999 in BTC to early presale buyers

Waiting for Ethereum Spot ETFs Continues: Top 10 Developer-Focused Altcoins Likely to Be Impacted Upon Approval Revealed - Bitcoin Sistemi


While there are strong expectations that Ethereum Spot ETFs will be approved by the SEC, the Ethereum ecosystem altcoins that cryptocurrency developers are most focused on have emerged.
With the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs, it is thought that other ETH ecosystem altcoins may also be affected by this event.


Here are the ETH ecosystem altcoins and developer scores that cryptocurrency developers have focused on the most in the last 30 days:

Chainlink (LINK) – 479.77
Status (SNT) – 307.1
Ethereum (ETH) – 304.17
Decentraland (MANA) – 258.63
Audius (AUDIO) – 211.33
sUSD (SUSD) – 185.07
Synthetix (SNX) – 185.07
Holo (HOT) – 146.9
API3 (API3) – 131.03
The Graph (GRT) – 123.37

All of these mentioned altcoins have the ERC20 standard.






However, Ethereum spot ETFs have not yet been approved, and altcoins in this ecosystem may react widely to approval or rejection. However, according to information obtained by various cryptocurrency journalists from sources, some of them originating from the SEC, these ETFs seem likely to be approved.
On the other hand, the fact that these ETFs will not have staking features causes some analysts to list them among the factors that may reduce the demand for these ETFs.

SEC's Gensler criticizes crypto regulation bill ahead of vote


SEC Chair Gary Gensler opposed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) in a statement on Wednesday.



The bill, which has garnered support from key Republicans and major cryptocurrency firms, is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives, with its future in the Senate remaining uncertain.



Gensler’s critique centers on the risk that the bill could undermine the SEC’s ability to protect investors and the integrity of U.S. capital markets by altering the classification of crypto assets and diminishing regulatory oversight.



“[FIT 21] would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,” Gensler said.

	
	
	
	


The FIT21 Act, introduced in July 2023, seeks to establish clear federal guidelines for digital asset markets and delineate the roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in cryptocurrency regulation. 



Gensler said that the bill could erode the Howey test, a cornerstone in determining investment contracts, and allow crypto firms to circumvent SEC regulation by self-certifying their products as “decentralized” digital commodities.



Additionally, the FIT21 Act’s exclusion of crypto trading platforms from the definition of an exchange is seen by Gensler as a move that could undermine investor protection. 



The White House also released a statement on Wednesday that opposes the passage of the bill.

	
	
	

	


“H.R. 4763 in its current form lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions,” the President’s Executive Office said on Wednesday.

Ethereum Game 'Pixelmon' Reveals MON Token Airdrop Details - Decrypt

Pokémon-esque crypto and NFT game Pixelmon has announced airdrop details for its soon-to-be-launched MON token.Over 180,000 wallets will be eligible for the airdrop on Monday, May 27 with the claim process starting at 9:30 a.m. UTC through the newly created Mon Protocol. MON will be minted as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum.Those eligible include holders of selected Pixelmon game NFTs, players of Pixelmon hyper-casual game Kevin the Adventurer, participants in the PixelPals “Farm2Farm” competition, and buyers of the MON token presale. Pixelmon originally launched with clunky Minecraft-like artwork which led to the battle arena title being widely ridiculed online. Now two years, an ownership change, and a dramatic artwork overhaul later, the Pixelmon IP is birthing quarterly mini-game releases with larger-scale games further on the horizon.This included Kevin the Adventurer, which was built around a heavily memed ogre-like creature from the Pixelmon universe, soon garnering 36,000 active players on Base. And then PixelPals was launched on the Mantle network, blending pet care and trading card elements. Both player bases are being rewarded during this airdrop.One group that won’t be receiving their MON tokens during the token generation event are those who completed Mon Protocol airdrop missions. These players will get their tokens shortly after the event has finished, as originally planned.Alongside the launch and airdrop of the MON token, a staking platform will also go live. Token stakers will accumulate points that can be spent in a launch pool, more details about this will be announced “soon” after the token launches, but the basic gist with most staking programs is that holders can earn rewards for locking them up within the game or platform.LiquidX bought the Pixelmon IP from the original creators in 2022, setting out to expand the initially ridiculed brand of Pixelmon into trading cards, merchandise, and various media adaptations using the Mon Protocol to power this growth.The MON token is designed to fuel what’s been described as an “IP protocol” to incentivize and reward NFT holders who help grow the Pixelmon brand as it expands with larger games in the future.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Gensler & Biden Speak Out Against FIT21 Act | Bankless


SEC Chair Gary Gensler says he strongly opposes the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), citing major concerns about investor protection and market integrity. President Biden has also signaled opposition but stopped short of threatening a veto.What’s the Scoop?Regulatory Concerns: Gensler opposes FIT21, arguing it undermines decades of securities regulation.Investor Risks: He claims FIT21 would allow crypto firms to self-certify as "decentralized," putting them outside the SEC's oversight and risking investor protection.State of Legislative Support: Major crypto groups and presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump support FIT21 as a necessary modernization of outdated securities laws. The U.S. House of Representatives plans to vote on FIT21 soon, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is considering the bill. Biden Opposition: While the White House opposes the bill over concerns about investor protections, it is not threatening a veto. This shows they are open to working with Congress on future bipartisan legislation.
Bankless TakeGary Gensler's opposition to the FIT21 Act is expected but disappointing, particularly considering the bipartisan history of the bill. As Republicans lead the vote in our industry, it would be wise for Democrats to come around and reassess the issue of crypto with fresh eyes as the election approaches. Many speculate this may be the reason for the ETH ETF’s likely approval, with the White House’s stance now potentially reinforcing this view. A good thing too as proponents of FIT21, like Stand With Crypto, make it clear that crypto support spans the political spectrum, especially among Gen Z.In the end, Gary’s stance just increases the importance of voicing your support for the bill.Tell Your Representative to Support FIT21 on BanklessHelp DC pass crypto legislation that makes sense.Click here to find your representative and ask them to vote YES on the FIT21 Act.

Experts speak out on how high Ethereum could go with an ETF approval - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Tomorrow is the final deadline for the approval of VanEck’s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, and expectations are high. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared that an approval movement “is happening,” despite regulatory indicators pointing out to the contrary direction until Monday.As a result, Ethereum (ETH) leaped up to 21% in less than 48 hours and stood just 22% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. Bitcoin (BTC) leaped 96% in two months before the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and reached its all-time high two months later.James Davies, co-founder and CPO at Crypto Valley Exchange, highlights that Bitcoin’s case was different. “In that instance, though, everything came together – ETFs, bitcoin halving, and global inflation easing significantly – and lined up to drive Bitcoin. Ethereum has already had the crypto cycle and global market sentiment increase,” he shares.Although Davies sees Ethereum ETF inflows having a substantial impact, propelling ETH to new all-time highs, it may be hard for Ethereum to replicate BTC’s movement after the funds’ approval. “It does, however, present a great steady growth story for the rest of 2024.”Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, also shares the view that an Ethereum ETF might trigger a sharp ETH price increase. Moreover, this movement might not be fully priced, with significant upside yet to be seen. “If so, it will be a powerful impetus for the whole crypto market and a stimulus for other coins’ growth,” added Lienkha.Bitfinex’s analysts believe that a spot Ethereum ETF approval could play out just like the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which was “a sell-the-news event before a long-term bullish outlook was triggered, causing a multi-month rally.” As for inflows, they expect a similar level compatible with ETH’s market cap.The current move from sub $3000 to $3800 is a result of the market pricing in the higher odds of an ETF approval. It is important that market participants often front-run and price in odds as absolute – implying that 75% odds of approval by Bloomberg analysts could potentially be priced in as 100%.Marko Jurina CEO at Jumper.Exchange, pointed out that BTC rose nearly 65% following the trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Thus, a similar movement would propel ETH “well beyond its previous all-time high.” Zentner also believes that the approval might trigger a crypto market growth for the second half of 2024.What if…?Despite the optimism regarding the Ethereum ETF approval, there is still a slight chance of rejection. Moreover, as highlighted by Seyffart, a good part of investors are misunderstanding the current movement since approval doesn’t translate to immediate trading. Both of these scenarios might then upset investors.Nevertheless, in the light of recent developments, those events are now being priced out, says James Davies, from Crypto Valley Exchange. On the other hand, Jumper.Exchange’s Marko Jurina believes that both negative possible events are already priced in.“When the spot BTC ETFs first came to market, there was actually a brief sell-off where some took profits before the rally resumed. Additionally, given the volatile nature of the market, good and bad news gives ample opportunity for market makers to create more violent price swings, so blood on the streets is definitely possible. More problematic for the ETH community (if no approval) would be the loss of a narrative as a catalyst,” Jurina added.Moreover, a slight drop followed by a consolidation period is also a possibility, shares Ruslan Lienkha from YouHodler. “Ethereum ETF approval is just a matter of time. The SEC will approve it sooner or later after the status clarification of ETH, and it matters little if it is recognized as a commodity, security, or something else. As for now, fundamentally, nothing will change for ETH. It will remain the second crypto in the industry even without ETFs.”Even if an unlikely rejection happens, Bitfinex analysts describe a ‘layered’ scenario, which could end in a “hard rejection” or a “soft rejection.” A hard rejection would include ETH being considered a security, while a soft rejection would be limited to ETF proposals.“The former could be very bearish leading to a retrace of the entire move up currently. The latter could lead to more speculation continuing over a future approval on re-appeal,” Bitfinex analysts concluded.

                        President Joe Biden’s administration will oppose the passage of Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) amidst its vote in the House of Representatives, a Wednesday statement from the White House claims.President Joe Biden To Oppose FIT21 Amid Vote
The White House statement says that FIT21 “lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions,” but stops short of vetoing the legislation altogether.“The Administration is eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system,” the statement continues.The Biden administration’s statement comes just as the House of Representatives are scheduled to vote on whether or not to advance the key piece of crypto regulation widely supported by the blockchain sector.If passed, FIT21 would allot greater freedoms to U.S. crypto operators and delegate increased regulatory responsibility of digital assets towards the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).Meanwhile, critics argue that the passage of FIT21 could cause market instability and negate already established securities law.SEC Chair Gary Gensler Pushes Back On Crypto Regulation Bill
On Wednesday morning, United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler released his own statement criticizing the bill, claiming it would put “investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.”“The crypto industry’s record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don’t have rules or because the rules are unclear,” Gensler wrote. “It’s because many players in the crypto industry don’t play by the rules.”Both Gensler and the Biden administration have been criticized for their stringent regulatory-focused approach to digital assets, with the SEC filing litigation against several major crypto organizations in the past several years alone.However, new momentum around a handful of crypto-related legislation on Capitol Hill could spell the beginning of the end for the SEC’s regulation-by-enforcement approach altogether.Just last week, both chambers of Congress passed a bipartisan resolution that would overturn the federal agency’s controversial staff accounting bulletin SAB121, despite Biden having released a statement saying he would veto it.Meanwhile, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump announced has seemingly embraced cryptocurrency, with his campaign beginning to accept donations in crypto as of Tuesday.Alexander Grieve, Paradigm’s lead on government affairs, noted a shift in the White House’s tone towards digital assets between the Biden administration’s recent veto announcement and Wednesday’s statement on FIT21, calling it “a huge course correction.”Despite U.S. lawmakers’ efforts, only time will tell whether or not common-sense crypto regulation will be passed anytime soon.

                        The daily trading volume for Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surged to an all-time high yesterday, fueled by increasing anticipation of potential spot approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).On Tuesday, Ethereum futures ETFs recorded a trading volume of $47.75 million, a 40% increase from the previous peak of $34.18 million set on March 5, when Ether was nearing the $4,000 mark. This build-up followed a significant spike of $23.67 million on Monday.New Records From All Corners
ProShares’ Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) led the category, accounting for $43.14 million or 90% of yesterday’s trading volume. VanEck’s Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and Bitwise’s Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) followed, generating $2.6 million and $2.01 million, respectively, according to The Block’s dashboard data.Despite this new record, the trading volume for Ethereum futures ETFs, which launched in October 2023, remains modest compared to spot Bitcoin ETFs.The latter debuted in January and amassed a combined trading volume of $2.16 billion on Tuesday, spearheaded by BlackRock’s IBIT with $1.12 billion. However, it is noteworthy that spot Bitcoin ETF daily trading volume has significantly decreased since its peak of $9.93 billion on March 5, coinciding with Bitcoin surpassing its previous cycle high of around $69,000.Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) also saw a substantial rise in trading volume on Tuesday, reaching $684.44 million — the highest since its all-time high of $842.67 million in May 2021. ETHE’s discount to net asset value narrowed to -6.7%, its lowest level in over two years. Investors are purchasing discounted shares in anticipation of a potential ETF conversion, reminiscent of the scenario with Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) before its conversion to an ETF on January 11.Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Likely Close
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently requested exchanges to update their spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings by submitting new Form 19b-4 on an “accelerated basis.” This requirement suggests that the SEC might be leaning towards approving the Ethereum ETF applications by the upcoming deadline, potentially leading to the issuance of the second spot digital asset ETF in the U.S. Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have raised the approval odds from 25% to 75%, while ETF Store president Nate Geraci highlighted the necessity for the SEC to approve both the 19b-4s and S-1s for the ETFs to launch.This possible approval is seen as a significant shift in U.S. crypto policy. Variant Fund Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky noted that such an approval would surprise many in Washington, D.C., and could signal a significant policy shift rather than just the introduction of an ETF.Notably, Standard Chartered also maintains its bullish prediction of $8,000 for Ethereum (ETH) by 2024, driven by the increasing likelihood of Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals. The bank forecasts that these ETFs could launch in the U.S. this week with 80% to 90% confidence, potentially leading to significant inflows of 2.39 to 9.15 million Ether, translating to $15 billion to $45 billion in the first year.The renewed optimism surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs has contributed to a 20% rise in Ether’s price since Monday, driving the price to around $3,792. According to Coinmarketcap, ETH is trading at $3,741 at the time of writing.

Can Polygon [MATIC] climb 17% soon? Taking a closer look - AMBCrypto



MATIC may be due for a double-digit rally, according to analyst Ali Martinez.
However, it might face headwinds in the short term.

Polygon [MATIC] is due for a 17% price rally if it breaks above its parallel channel, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has noted in a post on X (formerly Twitter).
Assessing the L2 token’s movements on a 4-hour chart, Martinez found that its price has consolidated within a range since the beginning of April to form the parallel channel pattern.
This pattern is formed when an asset’s price action is confined between two trend lines, indicating a period of consolidation. 
MATIC may not be ready
At press time, MATIC exchanged hands at $0.72 and trended toward the upper line of its parallel channel.
When an asset rallies toward the upper trendline of a parallel channel, it is interpreted as an attempt to test resistance. 
If that position fails to hold, and a breakout ensues, the asset in question may record new price highs. 
However, AMBCrypto found that MATIC’s rally above this resistance level may be challenging in the short term. 
This is because the token’s price trades significantly close to its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
When an asset’s price fluctuates around this moving average, it hints at indecision in the market, with neither buyers nor sellers able to establish dominance. 
For a break above the resistance to occur, there has to be a surge in buying pressure, which puts the bulls in clear market control.
However, with MATIC’s MACD line (blue) gearing to fall below its signal line (orange), bear power might be on the rise. 
When an asset’s MACD line attempts to fall below its signal line, it’s generally interpreted as a bearish signal. It suggests a weakening upward momentum and a shift toward a downtrend.

A good place to buy?
MATIC’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, assessed using a 365-day moving average, has flashed a buy signal. 
According to Santiment’s data, this metric’s value was -12.58% as of this writing. The metric measures the ratio between MATIC’s current market price and the average price of every token acquired.

When it returns a negative value like this, MATIC is deemed to be undervalued, as its market value is below the average purchase price of all its tokens in circulation. 
It is seen as a buy signal because traders see it as an opportunity to buy the token at a discount compared to the historical cost basis.

Cryptocurrency Journalist Eleanor Terrett Reveals She Heard Something New About Ethereum Spot ETFs - Bitcoin Sistemi


Eleanor Terrett, a famous cryptocurrency journalist, raised the possibility of Ethereum Spot ETFs being approved tomorrow.
Terrett said the following regarding the issue:



“Discussions have begun between SEC staff and issuers regarding S-1s, with the conclusion that there is 'work to be done' on them. I will consult with ETF experts on this, but this suggests the SEC may approve 19b4s tomorrow and then over the next few weeks/months.” “It shows that it will work with issuers on S-1s throughout.”


Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart also made evaluations on the subject. “Yes, I think if they work very hard it can be done in a few weeks, but there are many examples in history of this process taking more than 3 months (of course, the current situation is unlike anything that has ever happened in history, in my opinion),” Seyffart said.
Until a few days ago, almost everyone was commenting on ETH Spot ETFs as impossible, but the institution's attitude has changed 180 degrees and almost the entire cryptocurrency market is now waiting for approval for these products, with the final decision date of May 22.

LidoDAO Price Jumps 26% – Is It Too Late to Buy LDO? This Meme Coin Could Topple Shiba Inu / Source: Cryptonews
                        The LidoDAO (LDO) price continues to trade sharply up since the start of the week as bets for Ethereum ecosystem growth flood in on expectations that the SEC is on the verge of approving spot Ethereum ETFs, with some asking if it is too late to buy LDO.LDO is the native crypto of the decentralized Ether staking platform Lido. It also doubles up as the governance token of the Lido decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs the Lido protocol.The LidoDAO price was last changing hands just above its 50DMA at $2.075. That’s a 26% jump in the past 7 days, as per CoinMarketCap.LDO is now roughly 37% up versus its earlier monthly lows around $1.50. While investors jumping in now won’t be buying the market at its local bottom, that doesn’t mean it’s too late to buy LidoDAO.Is It Too Late to Buy LidoDAO? Here’s Why It Isn’t
LDO remains nearly 50% down versus its January highs above $4.0. But if the Ethereum ecosystem is about to see massive ETF-driven growth, as one of its leading protocols, LDO could go a lot higher from here.If ETH hits $5,000 by June, which decentralized options markets on DeFi derivatives market Lyra suggests has a 20% chance of happening, then LDO could quickly 2x back to yearly highs.But LDO’s modest market cap of $1.8 billion suggests gains of more than 2x could come this bull market.LDO could see gains of at least 5x to become a $10 billion market cap crypto. In that sense, it definitely isn’t too late to buy LidoDAO.Crypto Alternative to Consider – Meme Coin Wiener AI (WAI)
While 5x gain potential is more than enough for most investors, some highly risk-tolerant individuals will be targeting a bigger upside.These investors should check out the market for up-and-coming meme coins.Most newly launched meme coins fall flat, or don’t retain long-term value.But if backed by a savvy marketing team that knows how to build a community, a new meme coin could easily 100x.Analysts at Cryptonews think Wiener AI (WAI) is one such coin.VIDEOThe meme coin market is over-saturated with Shiba Inu-themed coins boasting little to no real utility.Sausage dog-themed Wiener AI offers a new spin to the meme coin space.The meme coin also comes with in-built AI trading capabilities, differentiating it from other utility-lacking coins like Shiba Inu.It’s no surprise to see that Wiener AI has already raked in over $2.6 million in its presale.WAI is also a passive income gem. Presale Investors are currently earning a massive 381% APY, as per the project’s official website.At this rate, investors can double their initial presale investment in just a few months. 20% of the supply has been allocated to staking rewards.Potential WAI investors need to move quickly. The WAI price will rise when the presale hits $2.7 million.At the current price of $0.000709, WAI’s market cap is under $50 million.If it achieves market leadership, early investors stand to benefit greatly, with a potential for 100x gains or more.Buy Wiener AI Here

Kraken Affirms No Plans to Delist Tether in Europe Amid MiCA Compliance Review



                    

Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has stated it has “no plans” to delist Tether (USDT) in Europe, contrary to a recent report suggesting the firm was “actively reviewing” the decision to remain legally compliant.



“[Kraken] continues to list USDT in Europe and we have no plans to delist at this time,” said Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s global head of asset growth and management, in a May 18 X post.




Greenberg emphasized that the firm will adhere to all legal requirements, even those it disagrees with. “But the rules are not finalized yet and we continue to do everything we can to continue to offer all relevant stablecoins to our European customers.”



A May 17 Bloomberg article had reported that Kraken was “actively reviewing” plans to comply with the European Union’s upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework.



“We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT,” said Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy, at the time.

“It’s something that we’re actively reviewing, and as the position becomes clearer, we can take firm decisions on that.”



The rules governing stablecoins under MiCA are set to take effect on June 30, while the broader rules for cryptocurrency service providers will come into force six months later on December 30.



One of Kraken’s major competitors, OKX, delisted USDT in Europe in March. 




Binance also announced similar plans last September, citing the need to comply with MiCA, but has yet to follow through.



In April, Kraken ceased support for the Monero privacy token for its customers in Belgium and Ireland.



Despite these regulatory challenges, Kraken has been expanding its services in Europe. 



The exchange recently secured a virtual asset service provider registration in Spain and the Netherlands, along with an electronic money institution license in Ireland.

Federal Reserve Officials Express Concerns Over Persistent Inflation, Remain Cautious on Rate Cuts | Cryptoglobe


                                
Federal Reserve officials have grown increasingly worried about the stubborn nature of inflation, as revealed in the minutes from the April 30-May 1 policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The minutes, released on Wednesday, indicated that policymakers lacked the confidence to move forward with interest rate reductions due to the lack of progress in bringing inflation down to the targeted 2% rate.



The meeting took place following a series of economic readings that showed inflation running well above the Fed’s target despite having eased over the past year. The minutes noted that “various participants mentioned a willingness to tighten policy further should risks to inflation materialize in a way that such an action became appropriate.”



The FOMC unanimously voted to maintain the benchmark short-term borrowing rate in a range of 5.25%-5.5%, the highest level in 23 years. While some incremental signs of progress on inflation have emerged since the meeting, such as the slightly lower consumer price index for April, consumer surveys indicate increasing worries about the inflation outlook.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Fed officials identified several upside risks to inflation, particularly from geopolitical events, and expressed concern about the pressure that inflation was having on consumers, especially those on the lower end of the wage scale. They also noted that consumers were resorting to riskier forms of financing, such as increased usage of credit cards and buy-now-pay-later services, to make ends meet as inflation persists.



Although officials were largely optimistic about growth prospects, they expected some moderation this year and grew uncertain over how long it would take for inflation to return to the 2% objective. Immigration was mentioned multiple times as a factor helping to spur the labor market and sustain consumption levels.



Public remarks from central bankers since the meeting have taken on a cautionary tone, with Fed Governor Christopher Waller stating earlier this week that he will need to see “several months” of good data before voting to cut rates. Last week, Jerome Powell maintained that the Fed will “need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work” as inflation remains elevated.



According to a report by CNBC, markets have continued to adjust their expectations for rate cuts this year, with futures pricing indicating about a 60% chance of the first cut coming in September and a slightly better than 50-50 chance of a second move in December. This marks a significant shift from earlier this year when markets had been pricing in at least six quarter-percentage point cuts.

Gensler Must Answer for Prometheum, ‘Regulatory Uncertainty’ on Ethereum, Lawmakers Say - Decrypt

Republican lawmakers once again raised eyebrows over the controversial crypto firm Prometheum, demanding clarity from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday over how the firm will comply with a novel framework from the agency.The SEC introduced a framework for so-called special purpose broker-dealers (SPBDs) in 2020, and the designation allows firms to facilitate the trading of digital asset securities. Though it has not fully realized that vision yet, Prometheum is one of the sole firms to receive such a registration.In a letter signed by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-SC), Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI), and Rep. French Hill (R-AR), demands were made for the SEC to hand over records and communications related to Prometheum and the regulatory status of Ethereum.Prometheum, as a market ecosystem for digital asset securities, said Monday that it had launched custody services for Ethereum as a security, heightening jitters over the asset’s regulatory status among crypto market participants and perturbing the lawmakers.“Prometheum’s announcement that it will offer custody services for ETH [raises] a number of questions regarding what are, and what are not, permitted activities for SPBDs,” the lawmakers wrote. “Without answers, […] our concerns about the precedent being set by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and Prometheum are growing.”Last year, the House Financial Services Committee described Prometheum’s crypto gambit as “shady,” arguing the little-known crypto firm was being used by the SEC as a wedge to show that existing securities laws are sufficient for crypto firms to stay in compliance.As the agency faces pressure over how it regulates crypto, Prometheum co-CEO Aaron Kaplan’s testimony before Congress last year aligned with the SEC’s stance that a pathway toward compliance exists for crypto firms—as many other firms have argued compliance isn’t feasible.The Republican lawmakers argued Wednesday that the SEC has refused to provide them with any answers related to Prometheum. A response from the SEC last month failed to sufficiently describe how the firm will comply with its special purpose broker-dealer license, they argued.In a lawsuit filed by the Ethereum software giant Consensys in April, the firm alleged the SEC has internally viewed Ethereum as a security for over a year. And in a letter last month, McHenry accused SEC Chair Gensler of lying about the matter after sidestepping questions during congressional testimony last year.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Gala Co-Founder Confirms Hack, Says Security Incident Led to Unauthorized Sale of $21,000,000 Worth of Coins - The Daily Hodl


								The co-founder of Gala (GALA), Eric Schiermeyer, is revealing the genesis of an exploit that led to the loss of crypto assets worth millions of dollars on the blockchain-based gaming platform.
Schiermeyer says that a security incident triggered the “unauthorized SALE of 600 million ($21 million) GALA tokens and the effective BURN of 4.4 billion tokens.”










According to the Gala co-founder, securing and removing unauthorized access to the web3 gaming platform built on the Ethereum blockchain was initiated and completed in less than an hour.
“It’s important to note our Ethereum contract for GALA is secure and under the protection of a multi-signature wallet. It was never compromised.
We messed up our internal controls…This shouldn’t have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t ever again.”
Schiermeyer further says that the culprit’s identity is possibly now known and the blockchain-based gaming platform is working with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a “network of international authorities”.
According to a pseudonymous developer who reportedly first discovered the exploit, the hacker who had obtained administrator privileges on the web3 gaming platform’s smart contract minted billions of Gala tokens before selling some of them.
“There is a cap [on the number of GALA tokens that can be minted], but still 12 billion more tokens that can be minted before that cap.
The attacker has had their address blocklisted, so can’t sell or mint anymore unless they have access to another admin address.”
GALA is trading at $0.0411 at time of writing, down by around 5% over the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin may be coming to the biggest crypto wallet on Ethereum

Photo: Jose Cabezas (Reuters)Popular  cryptocurrency wallet MetaMask might soon add Bitcoin support, CoinDesk reports. An unnamed source cited by the outlet said access could be granted within the next month, while another mentioned that the functionality is not yet finalized. The features may be initially limited and then expanded over time.RFK Jr. investing in GameStop is hilarious, exec saysA blockchain software company, Consensys created MetaMask to connect users to Ethereum’s blockchain ecosystem. The wallet supports Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs), such as Avalanche, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.Currently, MetaMask does not directly facilitate Bitcoin acquisition. Users must make the transactions using Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). A Wrapped Bitcoin is a tokenized version of Bitcoin that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It is pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin, so one Wrapped Bitcoin is always equal to one Bitcoin. It acts as a bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s decentralized applications (dApps). If the CoinDesk report pans out, MetaMask users will soon be able to add Bitcoin directly.This is not the first time MetaMask has expanded beyond the Ethereum ecosystem. In 2023, the company added a feature called Snaps. Snaps are JavaScript applications that enable cross-chain interoperability, allowing different blockchain networks to communicate and interact without intermediaries.Users have downloaded MetaMask’s apps over 22.66 million times, according to CoinGecko.

                        Hong Kong police have arrested 100 individuals in a significant crackdown on fraud and money-laundering syndicates, recovering over HK$180 million (US$24.2 million) from 295 victims.In a two-week operation code-named “Widepeak,” which concluded on Monday, 75 men and 25 women were detained on suspicion of money laundering and obtaining property by deception. Cryptocurrency Scam Amongst OthersChief Inspector Cheng Ki-fung of the Sham Shui Po district crime squad disclosed that most suspects were holders of stooge accounts, with occupations ranging from cleaners and chefs to decoration workers. These individuals allegedly loaned or sold their bank accounts to criminal syndicates, enabling the collection and laundering of scammed money in exchange for a cut of the proceeds.Chief Inspector Cheng revealed that the suspects were linked to 82 cases of deception. These included investment scams, employment fraud, internet love scams, e-shopping swindles, and telephone deception. The most significant financial loss stemmed from an investment scam targeting a 74-year-old businessman. An online acquaintance lured him into investing in cryptocurrency and swindled him out of HK$23 million.Inspector Wong Sze-ki highlighted another notable case involving an online shopping scam. This scam deceived 54 victims into spending more than HK$70,000 on supposed discount tickets for travel, theme parks, and hotel staycations.In response to these rising scams, the police have advised the public to utilize the force’s “Scameter“ search engine, available through the CyberDefender website or app, to verify suspicious or fraudulent schemes. The search engine helps identify dubious web addresses, emails, platform usernames, bank accounts, mobile phone numbers, and IP addresses. The force’s 18222 “Anti-Scam Helpline“ is also available for assistance.The crackdown was launched following a nearly 30% rise in reported deception cases in Sham Shui Po district, escalating from 1,873 in 2022 to 2,419 last year. The district recorded 706 deception cases in the first four months of this year alone.Superintendent Chen Chi-cheong, assistant Sham Shui Po district commander, emphasized the importance of targeting stooge accounts, which are vital to fraud networks for collecting and laundering illicit funds. He warned the public against lending or selling their bank accounts to others, as they could face money laundering charges punishable by up to 14 years in jail and a HK$5 million fine.The Rising Concern of Crypto Fraud in Hong Kong
The city experienced a 42.6% increase in all deception cases last year, with 39,824 reports filed, up from 27,923 in 2022. Financial losses from these cases surged by 89%, rising to HK$9.1 billion in 2023 from HK$4.8 billion the previous year.Superintendent Chen added that over 200 holders of stooge accounts were arrested by Sham Shui Po police for money laundering and conspiracy to launder money in the past year. Prosecution has been approved, and charges have been filed against 111 individuals. 11 convictions led to prison sentences ranging from four to 28 months.As reported on May 21, scammers target South Korean crypto users with an Ethereum-themed scam. Fraudsters send alarming text messages to users, warning them that their ETH coins will be “burned“ on May 22 if they do not act quickly. The messages, allegedly from a fake global cryptocurrency exchange named Bit-Finance, urge users to withdraw their funds immediately to avoid losing them. Recipients are directed to a phishing site where scammers attempt to steal wallet details and passwords.Police and regulators have noted the rise in such scams, with cybercrime related to virtual assets increasing in South Korea. Last year, the National Police Agency dealt with 167,688 cyber fraud cases, a 7.68% increase from 2022, with crimes involving virtual assets accounting for 38.3%. Between January and April of this year, 2,209 reports of financial losses due to crypto scams were filed with the Financial Supervisory Service, 17.7% of which were related to phishing attacks.

Shiba Inu Price Can’t Reach $0.01, Crypto Pundit Reveals Why


																Crypto analyst Oscar Ramos has outlined why he doesn’t believe the Shiba Inu price can go above $0.01 this cycle. He made this statement while alluding to the possibility of the meme coin reaching $0.5 at some point in the future. 
Why Shiba Inu Can’t Go Above $0.01
Ramos mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Shiba Inu can’t go above $0.01 because of its current supply of over 589 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The crypto analyst made this remark while sharing a prediction chart from the price prediction website Telegaon, which showed that Shiba Inu could reach $0.5 in 2040.

Indeed, Shiba Inu’s circulating supply significantly impacts its price, which is why the Shiba Inu team has made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of SHIB tokens in circulation through regular token burns. Shiba Inu’s burn tracker had previously noted that Shiba Inu’s circulating supply would need to be just over 85 billion for its price to even reach $0.01, as Ramos predicts.  
That means almost 80% of Shiba Inu’s circulating supply still needs to be burned for the meme coin to attain Ramos’ price target. Crypto YouTuber Jeff had previously suggested that it was almost impossible for Shiba Inu to burn that much of its circulating supply, stating that it would take over 1 million years for Shiba Inu’s circulating supply to reduce to 100 billion tokens. 
However, there is no doubt that the Shiba Inu team has still made great efforts to reduce the meme coin’s circulating supply. Over 76 billion SHIB tokens were burned in 2023, while 83 billion were burned the previous year. Seeing how Shiba Inu’s price has increased since last year, these efforts are paying off. 
While burning 80% of Shiba Inu’s circulating supply still seems like a far-fetched goal, SHIB token burns are expected to increase exponentially, especially thanks to innovations like layer-2 network Shibarium, which uses some of the transaction fees earned for SHIB burns. Therefore, the number of token burns carried out will increase as Shibarium enjoys more adoption. 
SHIB Can At Least Rise To $0.011
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez had previously predicted that Shiba Inu could make a historic run from its current price level and rise to as high as $0.011. Other crypto analysts have also given bullish price predictions for Shiba Inu, although not as bullish as Martinez’s. 

	Related Reading


Crypto analyst Armando Pantoja predicted that Shiba Inu could reach $0.001 and even claimed this would happen after the Bitcoin halving. Ramos has also given his bullish prediction for SHIB in this bull run, as he predicts that the meme coin can shed another zero from its current price and rise to $0.0001. 
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00002603, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Analyst Unveils Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Targets, Says Incoming Altcoin Opportunities Will Be ‘Insane’ - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed analyst believes that the crypto market is on the verge of witnessing the next leg of its bull cycle.
Pseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 639,700 followers on the social media platform X that the real bull market has not even started yet.










The crypto strategist says that Bitcoin (BTC) is currently in its post-halving accumulation phase as it gears up to rally toward an upside target of as high as $200,000.
“The upside of each major bull market has seen significant attrition from a post-halving percentage growth perspective, with each respective all-time high (ATH) move reducing ~3.5x from the previous cycle. If this trend continues, the ATH this cycle for BTC would land somewhere between $150,000 – $200,000.”
Source: Kaleo/X
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $70,016.
Looking at Ethereum (ETH), Kaleo thinks that the leading smart contract platform will soar to about $12,000 this cycle.
“As much fun as today’s news was, this chart is just getting warmed up. Send it higher.” 
Source: Kaleo/X
At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,774.
As for other crypto assets, Kaleo thinks that the massive capital inflows to Bitcoin and Ethereum will trigger an altcoin mania.
“The opportunity that comes with THAT type of money moving will be insane. Alts and DApps (decentralized applications) will go crazy. We’ll probably see a crypto-native DApp hit the mainstream market at one point or another. Retail hasn’t even shown up in masses yet. 
Don’t let the chop shake you out. We’re just getting warmed up.”

Ethereum sees $2.3B in inflows as ETF anticipation sparks optimism - AMBCrypto



Ethereum saw around $2.3 billion inflows.
The ETH price rise triggered a notable short liquidation volume.

Ethereum [ETH] recently experienced a significant price move, triggering a large volume of short liquidations and leading to a record inflow volume. 
Amid these developments, there is speculation that institutions might be preparing for the potential approval of an Ethereum-based financial product.
Ethereum sees significant flow into exchanges
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Ethereum’s inflow chart on CryptoQuant showed that traders have moved to take advantage of the recent price increase. 
On the 21st of May, around 627,770 ETH, valued at over $2.3 billion at approximately $3,789 per ETH, flowed into exchanges. This marked the second-largest inflow volume in over a year.
 The largest inflow occurred in March when 648,000 ETH, also worth about $2.3 billion, were transferred. At press time, the inflow had already exceeded 100,000 ETH.
Source: CryptoQuant
Due to these substantial inflows, Ethereum’s Netflow has been positive over the past few days. The Netflow indicated that more ETH was entering exchanges than leaving. 
On the 21st of May, the Netflow was around 49,000 ETH — this trend continued with an additional Netflow of over 5,600 ETH at the time of writing.
Ethereum shorts see more liquidation
Another effect of the recent Ethereum price increase has been a surge in liquidation volume. 
According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of the liquidation chart, short traders have experienced significant liquidations in the past few days. 
Source: CryptoQuant
On the 20th of May, approximately 20,558 ETH, valued at over $75.2 million, were liquidated, marking the second-highest short liquidation volume in over a year. 
The trend continued on the 21st of May, with over 11,600 ETH worth around $44 million being liquidated.
Institutions preparing for ETF approval?
Amid the recent price increase in Ethereum, there is growing speculation about the imminent approval of an Ethereum ETF. 
Commentators are optimistic about this approval, and some analysts believe that institutions are already preparing for it. 
A CryptoQuant chart showed notable outflows of ETH on Coinbase on the 11th and 27th of March and 18th April, with volumes of approximately -134,000, -120,454, and -133,000 ETH, respectively. 
Similar outflow patterns were observed on Coinbase before the announcement of the Bitcoin ETF approval in January, suggesting that institutions might be positioning themselves for a potential approval now as well.

ETH sees a slight drop
Ethereum surged to approximately $3,661 following a 19% increase on the 20th of May.

According to AMBCrypto’s assessment of the daily time frame chart, this upward trend continued on the 21st of May, with ETH reaching around $3,789 after a 3.50% increase, hitting a price zone last seen in March.
 As of this writing, Ethereum was trading at about $3,749, reflecting a decline of just over 1%.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Climbs 434% Amid Market Recovery, Can It Send SHIB To $0.0001? | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu burn rate has accelerated once again after a lackluster start to the week. The burn rate has surged over 400% in the last 24 hours alone, signifying a move alongside the Shiba Inu price as the crypto market rally continues.
Shiba Inu Sees 434% Spike In Burn Rate
The burn rate, over the past days, has seen a significant amount of tokens burned compared to the start of the week, according to burn tracking website, Shibburn. At the time of writing, there has been a total of 18 burn transactions recorded in the last 24 hours, which have seen almost 14 million SHIB tokens incinerated.

This figure is a 434% increase from the prior day’s figure of 2.6 million. This had been a 67% decline from Monday, so this turn in the burn volume is a welcome development for the meme coin. Additionally, the increase in the number of burn transactions shows a growing interest among Shiba Inu holders to participate in reducing the supply of the token.
Some notable burn transactions from the last 24 hours include 8 transactions in total carrying more than 1 million tokens to the burn address. Naturally, these addresses make up the bulk of the burned tokens, with smaller transactions thrown in there as well.
Despite this significant increase in daily burn rate, the weekly burn rate is still suffering. Shibburn’s data shows that a little over 42.4 million tokens have been burned during this time. However, it represents a 70.41% decline from the previous week’s figure, showing that the burns for this week are falling short already. Nevertheless, the movement of SHIB tokens to the burn address is a plus overall to the ecosystem, no matter how small.


Can SHIB Burn Send Price To $0.0001?
The Shiba Inu burn initiative is something that is meant to propel the SHIB price by reducing the amount of tokens in circulation. This became important as the SHIB supply is more than 500 trillion, greatly limiting its upside potential. Thus, by reducing the supply, the community hopes to propel demand.

However, the SHIB burn has not moved as fast as expected. Going on two years since its inception, the burn is yet to reach 1 trillion tokens. To put this in perspective, around 410.7 trillion tokens have been burned in total. Of this, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin burned 410 trillion tokens which were sent to him in 2021. This means that the community has collectively burned around 700 billion tokens since the burn began.
At this rate, it is unlikely that the Shiba Inu burn will propel the SHIB price toward $0.0001 anytime soon. However, with the crypto market picking up and Bitcoin rallying toward a new all-time high, SHIB still has the potential to reach this figure, which would be around a 300% increase from its current price level.

Crypto Analyst Says It’s Time for Altcoins to Rally, Predicts New Bitcoin Breakout Amid Bullish Technical Setup - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed analyst says that altcoins are likely about to spark new rallies while Bitcoin (BTC) decides its next move.
Pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital tells his 470,000 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins are at the beginning of the “hype cycle” phase where they find bottoms before making new impulses to the upside.










“Welcome to the Q2 Altcoin Hype Cycle
The Altcoin Bottoming Out process is in progress.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
At time of writing, the total altcoin market capitalization is coming in at $294 billion, up from $76 billion in November of 2022 during the worst of the bear market.
Looking at Bitcoin, Rekt Capital says BTC is potentially forming a bull flag on the monthly chart. Bull flags, as the name suggests, are typically seen as bullish technical setups that imply an upward impulse and then a brief consolidation before another move up.
“Imagine if Bitcoin was forming a Monthly Bull Flag right now.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
However, according to the trader, those looking for a longer and more robust bull market may prefer BTC to consolidate for longer before continuing upward. He says that a clean break of $71,500 could indicate that BTC is in for a shorter, faster bull run.
“Extended consolidation here would get Bitcoin closer to resynchronising with historical Halving Cycles
After all, the current acceleration in the cycle is still around 190 days (which is an improvement from the 260-day acceleration set in mid-March when BTC made new All Time Highs)
On the one hand, investors understandably want a breakout, but that would entail an Accelerated Cycle, where Bitcoin would probably peak in its Bull Market sooner
On the other hand, extended consolidation here would help with resynchronisation with historical Halving Cycles, resulting in a longer Bull Run
There is no right or wrong answer – both cases are bullish
It’s more a question of whether we get a shorter bull run or a typically long one
History suggests we should see a typically long one but Bitcoin is one Weekly Close above the $71500 Range High from going against the grain of history once again.”
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $70,221.

Hong Kong Just Kicked Out Worldcoin Over Privacy Concerns - Decrypt

The Hong Kong government ordered Worldcoin to cease operations within its borders on Wednesday, accusing the identity project of skirting its privacy rules. The administration's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) is demanding Worldcoin leave Hong Kong—and is asking citizens to report if they see further Worldcoin operations.“The privacy commissioner has served an enforcement notice on Worldcoin Foundation, directing it to cease all operations of the Worldcoin project in Hong Kong in scanning and collecting iris and face images of members of the public using iris scanning devices,” the PCPD said.The PCPD claims that the collection of face and iris images was unnecessary and excessive. It also alleges that Worldcoin collected personal data unfairly by not providing privacy notices and consent forms in Chinese, failing to disclose all possible risks, and not clearly informing participants of the reason for the collection.While the project's Orb hardware is a signature part of its operation, Hong Kong administrators said they weren't needed to verify someone's humanity.“Scanning or collection of face images was not required for the purpose of verifying the humanness of the participants as the iris scanning device operators were already in the position to carry out such verification at the operating locations,” the PCPD said in the report.Formed in 1996, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data is an independent body that oversees the enforcement of Hong Kong’s personal data laws.Launched in 2022, Worldcoin—developed by Tools For Humanity, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and stewarded by the non-profit Worldcoin Foundation—uses controversial Orb iris scanners and its World ID application to combat bots by ensuring members or users of a system are actual people. Participants are issued WLD tokens in exchange for letting Worldcoin scan users' biometrics.According to Tools For Humanity, since its launch, World ID has drawn over 10 million users in 160 countries, with over 5 million people having verified their identity using the Worldcoin Orbs.“Taking into account biometric data is sensitive personal data, any wrongful disclosure or leakage of such data could lead to grave consequences,” the PCPD wrote. “Given that there were less privacy-intrusive means as alternative options to verify the identity of the participants, the collection of face and iris images for such purpose was not necessary, and excessive, thereby contravening the requirements of [our Data Protection Principles].”Worldcoin did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.In March, to alleviate privacy concerns surrounding its Orb iris scanners, Worldcoin open-sourced core components on Github, allowing researchers to examine the technology more deeply.“Open sourcing typically helps to foster trust, transparency, and verifiability while also encouraging developer communities to further advance a technology,” a Worldcoin spokesperson previously told Decrypt. “This builds on the open sourcing of the iris code last late last year and opening up of the hardware nearly a year ago.”Despite the PCPD’s actions, Worldcoin’s WLD token is up 0.8% for the day and 5.0% for the last seven days according to CoinGecko.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Shocking Interest Rate Remarks from Goldman Sachs CEO: Will There Be A Rate Cut This Year? Revealed His Forecast - Bitcoin Sistemi


Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon made a bold prediction about the future of the Fed's interest rates. Speaking at an event held at Boston College, Solomon stated that he does not currently expect the FED to make any reductions in interest rates this year.
The CEO's prediction comes amid an economy that has shown remarkable resilience, thanks largely to government spending. “I still don't see compelling data to say we will lower interest rates here,” Solomon said, adding that he currently foresees “zero” reductions.



Solomon also emphasized the role of investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure in increasing the economy's resilience to the FED's monetary tightening. That resilience could be a key factor in the decision not to cut rates, according to Solomon.
However, Solomon also warned of the risk of a significant economic slowdown, which he described as “real and palpable”. Noting that this risk is greater now than six months ago, Solomon also cited geopolitical fragility as an important factor contributing to this. “This is something people will have to live with for a long time,” he warned.

Pepe Price Prediction as PEPE Pumps Up 30% and Hits a New All-Time High – 100x Possible? / Source: Cryptonews
                        As the Pepe (PEPE) price continues to pump to new record highs, with PEPE up 30% in the past 7 days, investors are asking whether 100x gains for the meme coin might be possible.Pepe was last trading around $0.00001350, giving it a market cap of around $5.7 billion.100x gains would see Pepe reach a market cap of $570 billion.Almost all crypto experts would agree that, in the short-term anyway, Pepe doesn’t stand much chance of going this high.Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the most widely used/adopted smart-contract-enabled blockchain Ethereum, only has a market cap of $450 billion.Pepe Price Prediction – How High Can It Go?
While aiming for 100x gains is likely overly ambitious given Pepe’s already large market cap, its outlook remains strong.Traders have been buying the Ethereum-issued meme coin aggressively amid growing expectations for Ethereum ETF approvals from the SEC.These traders seem to be betting on Pepe as a major beneficiary of accelerated Ethereum ecosystem growth.Pepe’s market cap is still 4x lower than Dogecoin’s. And Dogecoin could yet 2 or 3x this bull market.If Pepe catches up, that means it could still post 10x gains from here.That would imply that the Pepe price has the potential to erase another zero to hit $0.00010.Pepe Alternative to Consider – Multi-chain Meme Coin Dogeverse (DV)
Most investors would be more than happy with 10x gains. But many meme coin investors are hunting bigger upside of 50-100x.The best way to bag these bigger gains is to get in early on a new meme coin gem.One meme coin that the team at Cryptonews thinks fits this bill is Dogeverse.Dogeverse is a new meme coin with unique cross-chain capabilities and is generating considerable excitement in the market.Dogeverse seeks to be the multi-chain equivalent of Dogecoin and is launching on the six most popular blockchains (excluding Bitcoin).Dogeverse’s cross-chain bridging capabilities further enhance its appeal, making it a “Doge with superpowers.”Currently in presale, Dogeverse has raised over $15 million.  Interested investors should get in quick ahead of the token’s official launch.Visit Dogeverse Here

Pepe price hits new all-time high: here's why it's soaring - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Pepe price hits $0.0000142 ATH, showcasing its resilience and market prominence.
Ethereum’s surge and altcoin rotation among the factors fueling Pepe’s rally.
Despite early investor profit-taking, bullish sentiment persists, fueled by whale activity.

In a remarkable turn of events, the price of Pepe price has surged to a new all-time high, reaching approximately $0.0000142.
This surge marks a significant milestone for the frog-themed meme coin, as it solidifies its position as one of the top performers in the crypto market.

Notably, the current bullish momentum in Pepe’s price comes after a period of internal challenges among developers, indicating a remarkable turnaround for the cryptocurrency.
Despite its rocky start, Pepe has gained substantial traction in recent times, with its market capitalization exceeding $5.77 billion.
What is behind the current Pepe price surge?
The altcoin market, including Pepe, has benefited from a notable shift in investor sentiment, with capital flowing from Bitcoin to alternative assets.
This rotation of funds has fueled the ongoing altcoin recovery, with Pepe emerging as a standout performer in this resurgence.
Pepe’s adoption and liquidity have also played a crucial role in its price appreciation. With deep liquidity of nearly $60 million in Wrapped Ether (WETH) and over 223,000 holders facilitating approximately 2 million transfers, Pepe has demonstrated robust on-chain activity.
However, amidst the euphoria surrounding Pepe’s price surge, there are also signs of caution. On-chain data analysts like Lookonchain have flagged instances of profit-taking by early Pepe (PEPE) investors.
Nevertheless, despite these concerns, bullish sentiment remains strong, with heightened whale purchase activity in the Pepe ecosystem fueling expectations of a fresh bull run in the coming weeks.
Moreover, the potential approval of spot Ether ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could provide further catalysts for Pepe’s upward trajectory. The current Pepe price surge seems to closely mirror that of Ethereum (ETH) amid the hype created by the potential ether ETFs approval.
Pepe followed suit, highlighting the interconnectedness of various cryptocurrencies within the broader market ecosystem.

How Perplexity Ai Helped Druckenmiller to Invest in Argentina | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent CNBC interview, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller shared his thoughts on a wide range of topics, including the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, inflation, artificial intelligence (AI), and his global investment strategies.



Stanley Druckenmiller is highly regarded for his consistent and impressive investment performance, particularly during his tenure at the Quantum Fund with George Soros. He played a pivotal role in the fund’s legendary 1992 bet against the British pound, which netted a profit of over $1 billion. Known for his long-term vision and macroeconomic analysis, Druckenmiller has successfully navigated various market conditions, showcasing his adaptability and strategic acumen. 



His ability to time markets and manage risk effectively has resulted in significant returns with relatively low risk. Beyond his investment success, Druckenmiller has been a mentor to many in the financial industry, influencing a generation of investors. Additionally, his substantial philanthropic efforts in education, medical research, and social causes have further enhanced his reputation, making him a respected figure both in finance and beyond.



Druckenmiller expressed his perplexity regarding the Fed’s December pivot, believing that they had fumbled an opportunity to control inflation when it was coming down and financial conditions were tightening. He criticized the Fed’s forward guidance, arguing that it trapped them into a cycle of talking about rate cuts, which led to a melt-up in financial conditions. Druckenmiller suggested that the Fed should eliminate forward guidance and simply raise or cut rates as needed without trying to be a “rockstar” on “60 Minutes.”



The investor also questioned the Fed’s obsession with achieving a soft landing, citing Paul Volcker’s willingness to put the economy into a recession to achieve long-term prosperity. He warned that the current focus on avoiding pain could lead to political consequences, as the average American is more affected by rising gasoline prices than stock prices.



Druckenmiller gave the Biden administration an “F” for their economic policies, arguing that they are misdiagnosing the current situation as a depression and overspending when the private sector is healthy and innovative. He expressed concern that government spending and resulting interest rates on debt could crowd out private sector innovation in areas such as blockchain and AI.



On the topic of AI, Druckenmiller revealed that he had invested in Nvidia after being advised by a young partner who predicted the company’s potential in the AI space. Although he pared back his position after significant gains, Druckenmiller remains bullish on AI in the long term, comparing it to the early days of the internet. He acknowledged that AI might be overhyped in the short term but could be underestimated in the long run.



Druckenmiller also discussed his investment in Perplexity AI, an AI-powered answer machine that he believes could potentially challenge Google. He praised the company’s founder and team for their innovation and humility and encouraged viewers to try the platform for themselves.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

When asked about the potential for AI language models to become commoditized, Druckenmiller admitted that it is a concern and one of the reasons he reduced his positions. He also questioned the long-term incremental value of increasingly costly AI models.



Regarding the upcoming U.S. presidential election, Druckenmiller expressed concerns about both candidates’ potential impact on inflation. He suggested that under a Trump administration, factors such as tariffs, immigration, and animal spirits could lead to inflation reaching 6% by 2025. Under a Biden administration, he worried about stagflation due to government spending, regulation, and the Fed’s impact on financial conditions.



Druckenmiller also discussed his investments in Argentina and Japan. He praised Argentina’s new leader, Javier Milei, for his free-market policies and ability to maintain public support despite implementing significant reforms. In Japan, Druckenmiller sees opportunities arising from the country’s shift towards corporate governance changes and its emergence from a prolonged period of deflation.



The story of how he invested in Argentina was quite interesting. 



Druckenmiller said:



“By the way, do you want to hear how I invested in Argentina? It’s a funny story. I saw — I wasn’t at Davos, but I saw the speech in Davos and it was about 1:00 in the afternoon in my office. I dialed up Perplexity and I said, give me the five most liquid ADRs in Argentina … It gave me enough of a description that I follow the old Soros rule, invest and then investigate. I bought all of them. We did some work on them. I increased my positions and so far, it’s been great. But we’ll see.“



Finally, Druckenmiller shared his bullish outlook on copper, citing the long lead times for new production and the increasing demand from electric vehicles, power grids, data centers, and even munitions. He also reiterated his stance on not investing in China as long as the current leader remains in power, preferring to focus on exciting opportunities in the United States, Argentina, and Japan.

SEC's Gensler Going Rogue in Solo Quest to Stop U.S. Crypto Legislation?

The SEC's sister agency in policing the U.S. markets, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC), has taken a strong pro-legislation position, arguing that existing law leaves a hole in oversight of the crypto spot markets for non-securities, such as bitcoin (BTC). CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam has told lawmakers that "Congress needs to act" on crypto legislation, and he's said that if FIT21 passes, his agency can build a regulatory framework within 12 months. A CFTC spokesperson told CoinDesk on Tuesday that the agency would not comment on the bill.

MetaMask Reportedly Adding Native Bitcoin Support | Bankless


MetaMask, Ethereum’s reigning wallet giant, is exploring native Bitcoin support, CoinDesk reports – citing sources familiar with the matter.What's the scoop?CoinDesk's source said the Bitcoin integration could launch as early as June 2024. Another source said MetaMask was still working to finalize feature ideas.“While we can't confirm any timeline for specific developments at this time, we're always working on innovations to serve our users better,” a MetaMask spokesperson told CoinDesk. “Stay tuned for further updates when we're ready to share more."Bankless take:Newer wallet challengers like Magic Eden Wallet and Phantom have made significant inroads lately by catering to increasingly multichain crypto users. In combination with MetaMask Snaps, MetaMask's native embrace of Bitcoin signals it’s far from ready to cede the multichain opportunity to its competitors. If MetaMask goes beyond BTC support and integrates additional Bitcoin token offerings like Ordinals and Runes, this could prove to be a significant catalyst to the Bitcoin ecosystem over time, as MetaMask currently boasts over 30 million monthly active users. It may also be the first of more native integrations, which could reposition MetaMask as a leading multichain wallet.

Cryptocurrency Exchange CEO Says "Everything is Bullish", Explains Why - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to data, Ethereum call options have become more expensive than put options across all maturities. According to one analyst, this trend indicates a bullish trend in the market.
Luuk Strijers, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Deribit, said in an email: “The bid minus bid skew is negative across all maturities and increases further beyond the end-June expiry, which is a very bullish signal, with the basis at around 14% per year.” “It has risen to e, which is another bullish indicator.”



The analysis shows that investors are willing to pay more for calls than for puts, especially for options expiring at the end of June and later. This trend could be an indicator of a bull market, according to the CEO, as it shows that traders are predicting that ETH prices will rise in the future.
There has been renewed optimism regarding the potential approval of spot ETH ETFs following a surprise filing request by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).





“We have observed a significant increase in trading volumes and volatility for ETH options and futures on Deribit. In fact, we recorded an almost unprecedented trading volume of $12.5 billion in the last 24 hours,” Strijers continued.

Bipartisan Drive For Crypto Regulation Signals White House-Congress Collaboration | Bitcoinist.com


								In the lead-up to the November elections, cryptocurrencies have become a prominent topic in the race for the White House. Notably, the Biden administration has changed its approach to digital asset regulation, likely influenced by former President Donald Trump’s support for the nascent industry.
Biden Administration Calls For Balanced Crypto Regulation
In an executive release, the Biden administration opposed the passage of H.R. 4763, a bill that would impact the regulatory structure for digital assets in the United States. 
Instead, the administration aims to collaborate with Congress to establish a “comprehensive and balanced” regulatory framework that promotes responsible development and innovation in the crypto assets and payment sectors. 

The administration also cited the lack of sufficient protections for consumers and investors in H.R. 4763 and emphasized the need for adequate guardrails while fostering innovation.
Senate And House Overturn SEC Rule
The Senate also recently voted to overturn Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB-121), an SEC rule that imposed burdensome accounting standards on cryptocurrency assets held by financial institutions. This decision followed the House’s approval of the same pro-crypto measure. 
Additionally, the House is set to consider the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a bill to establish a regulatory regime for the crypto industry in the United States. 
The potential approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Ethereum by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) further indicates a shifting tide in favor of cryptocurrencies.
According to a Fortune Magazine report, President Biden intends to veto the Congressional action reversing SAB-121. Still, lawmakers within his party, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Corey Booker of New Jersey, have voted to repeal the SEC rule. 
SAB-121 required financial institutions to treat crypto accounts as liabilities, making the safekeeping of digital assets economically unviable. A recent bipartisan analysis by the Congressional Research Service highlighted the potential limitations and costs associated with this rule, signaling a need for regulatory adjustments.
Trump Campaign Champions Financial Freedom
While blockchain technology remains a bipartisan focus, the Trump campaign has made a noteworthy move by announcing its acceptance of donations in Bitcoin and various cryptocurrencies. 
This marks a significant milestone as the first major party Presidential nominee to embrace cryptocurrency for fundraising purposes. The campaign integrates digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, allowing donations through Coinbase Commerce.
The Trump campaign’s foray into cryptocurrency fundraising expands its digital fundraising operation and serves as a political statement supporting Bitcoin and crypto’s role in enhancing financial freedom and innovation. 

As the race to the White House intensifies, the Biden administration’s shifting stance on regulation and the Trump campaign’s embrace of digital asset donations highlight the evolving landscape of digital assets in politics and regulations. 
The upcoming elections are likely to shape further the trajectory of blockchain technology and its impact on the financial sector.

Beyond Bitcoin: How MicroStrategy stock beat the crypto market - AMBCrypto



MicroStrategy stock has outperformed BTC, miner stocks and Coinbase’s COIN.
Despite having more upside potential on price charts, MSTR could be affected by BTC’s pullback. 

MicroStrategy’s stock [MSTR] was apparently the best-performing share with Bitcoin’s [BTC] exposure last week. 
MSTR shares rallied 34% last week and reclaimed the $1500 level, boosted by the BTC recovery and MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the MSCI Index. The rally extended into the current week and hit a high of $1740, tucking an extra +4% as of 22nd May. 
Overall, the MSTR’s remarkable double-digit performance eclipsed even Coinbase [COIN] and several other Bitcoin miner stocks. 
MicroStrategy stock vs other BTC-linked stocks
MicroStrategy’s shares recorded 3.6X more gains than Coinbase’s, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, stock [COIN] when performance was adjusted on the weekly chart.  
MSTR was up 22% in the past five trading days, compared to COIN’s 6% over the same period. 
Interestingly, collective Bitcoin miner stocks also saw remarkable double-digit gains but were slightly lower than MSTR over the same period. 
Notably, Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF [WGMI], which tracks top BTC miner stocks, including Marathon Digital’s stock [MARA], recorded 12.8% gains in the past five-day trading period. 
That said, MSTR eclipsed COIN, and overall BTC miner stocks over the last 5-day trading sessions. However, it’s worth noting that COIN’s performance has remained relatively muted, partly because of the ongoing lawsuit with the US SEC. 
MicroStrategy, under the guidance of its founder and CEO, Michael Saylor, has maintained its Bitcoin strategy. 
So far, in Q2, the firm added 122 BTC, bringing its total BTC war chest to 214,400 coins, worth over $15 billion based on current market prices. 
Compared to the firm’s current total of 17.7 million shares as of 22nd May, its BTC per share was approximately 0.01209 BTC. 
But large number of investors have thronged to MSTR, sometimes way higher than BTC, the underlying asset they are seeking exposure to. 
But MSTR’s allure could be irresistible, especially compared to BTC’s performance. MSTR has outperformed BTC on a weekly, monthly and YTD (Year-to-Date) basis.
In May, MSTR was up 55% compared to BTC’s 15%. On the YTD front, MSTR’s gains were over 140%, while BTC’s value was +58%. 
It meant MSTR holders had better returns than their BTC counterparts. So, what’s next for MSTR’s price? 
What’s next for MSTR’s price?

On the daily chart, the key next bullish targets were the ATH of $1999 and $2300 based on the Fib retracement tool (yellow). The bullish reading on the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicated that the above bullish targets were feasible. 
However, despite MSTR outperforming BTC on the price charts, a pullback by the king coin could erase part of the share’s gains. 
At the time of writing, BTC eased slightly below $70K after hitting the range-highs at $71K, while MSTR traded at $1650. MSTR’s further rally could be derailed if BTC extends its retracement.

$582,381,000,000 Added To US National Debt Since January As JPMorgan Chase CEO Issues Warning on America's Fiscal Future - The Daily Hodl


								The US has added well over half a trillion dollars to its national debt since the start of 2024 as the CEO of the world’s largest bank issues a warning on the state of America’s balance sheet.
According to new data from the Treasury, as of May 14th, the US national debt grew by $582.381 billion year-to-date, with interest on that debt surpassing spending on both national defense and Medicare.










The nation’s total outstanding debt now stands at $34.5 trillion.
In a new interview with Sky News, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says that much of the growth in the American economy in recent years is largely driven by borrowing.
But Dimon says the debt-to-GDP ratio, if unchecked, will become a major problem that’s much harder to deal with.
“America has spent a lot of money. And during Covid and after Covid our deficit is 6% now. That’s a lot, but obviously that drives growth. Any country can borrow money and drive some growth but it may not always lead to good growth so I think America should be quite aware that we have to focus on our fiscal deficit issues a little bit more, and that is important for the world…
I think it’s why we have higher inflation and sticky inflation, and I think if you want to do a great job in your country, and you have a 6% deficit and a 100% debt to GDP [ratio], this can go on for a while. But the sooner we focus on it, the better. So I’m hoping that the government really focuses on how can we reduce that deficit and still have good growth…
At one point it will cause a problem, and why should you wait? Because the problem will be caused by the market and then you’ll be forced to deal with it and probably in a far more uncomfortable way than if you had dealt with it to start.”
According to the Treasury Department, the US government has spent $855 billion more than it has collected in the 2024 fiscal year.
In 2023, the government’s total deficit spending reached $1.7 trillion.

Nvidia reports $26 billion Q1 revenue, AI crypto tokens show correlative gains - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Chip-making tech behemoth Nvidia has announced its Q1 earnings, showing a record quarterly revenue of $26 billion, up by 5.5% of market expectations. The company has also confirmed that a ten-for-one forward stock split would be implemented by June 7, 2024. At the time of writing, the Nvidia stock ($NVDA) is up 2.6% after market close.On the crypto side, artificial intelligence-related tokens have seen notable gains, despite the muted performance of the broader digital asset market, with the exception of Ethereum’s recent gains.The uptick in AI token prices comes as investors prepared for the quarterly earnings report from chip-making giant Nvidia (NVDA). Nvidia’s report is widely viewed as the grand finale of a surprisingly strong earnings season for big tech companies. Looking ahead, Nvidia expects revenue of $28.0 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, plus or minus 2%. The company also announced a 150% increase in its quarterly cash dividend. Several large-cap AI tokens have posted significant gains over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Fetch.ai’s FET, Render’s RNDR, Bittensor’s TAO, and SingularityNET’s AGIX have all advanced between 4% and 5%.Meanwhile, AIOZ Network’s token (AIOZ) has surged 7% following the announcement that Nvidia has listed the project on its Accelerated Applications Catalog, which allows users to search for tools and services built on Nvidia platforms.A merger between Fetch.AI, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol has also been approved by their communities, combining $FET, $AGIX, and $OCEAN into $ASI at anticipated total value of $7.5 billion. The native token of Near Protocol (NEAR), a layer-1 (L1) network that garnered attention when its co-founder spoke at an Nvidia conference earlier this year, has also seen a 2% gain. NEAR was the best-performing asset, which fell 0.6% alongside modest declines in both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).The overall market decline comes on the heels of a breakneck rally driven by positive regulatory developments in the US and falling bond yields as inflation concerns ease. Despite this, AI-focused tokens have managed to buck the trend and post gains.Nvidia’s earnings report is expected to confirm the enthusiasm surrounding AI and potentially offer a glimpse into the future for stocks. The company’s shares have soared more than 200% over the past 12 months, adding roughly $1.5 trillion in market value. With a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion, Nvidia’s weighting in the S&P 500 has increased from 2.2% to more than 5% in the past year.Other tech giants, such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple, have already reported strong earnings, showing that demand for AI services is helping to fuel revenue growth. These results have helped propel the S&P 500 Index to an all-time high.Investors have come to expect Nvidia to deliver blow-out earnings, with the company having topped profit and sales estimates by at least 15% in recent quarters. However, there are some concerns about the rollout of a new chip dubbed Blackwell later this year, which could lead customers to slow purchases of its predecessor until the new one is available.Despite these concerns, the performance of AI-focused tokens serves as a testament to the growing excitement surrounding the AI sector and its potential impact on the future of technology and finance.

Ethereum's Institutional Sell | Bankless


New Best? Laser-eyed Bitcoiners have long-maintained that their chosen asset is the only cryptocurrency institutions will be willing to purchase. With spot ETH ETFs on the horizon, will TradFi soon find a superior alternative?Bitcoin’s High Priest of HODLing, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, had previously repudiated Ethereum on grounds that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would declare it – and by extension all non-BTC tokens – as crypto asset securities.Unfortunately for Saylor, impending approval of spot ETH ETFs opens the door for future spot ETF listings on any crypto asset that meet the murky definition of a commodity, eliminating BTC’s monopoly on TradFi access and forcing it to compete amongst other crypto assets in the free market for capital.
While many conformed to beliefs that BTC will be the only digital asset to be accepted by the masses, Ethereum remains highly attractive to institutional players due to the usefulness of the network and the presence of similar properties.Over half a dozen high profile financiers have lauded Ethereum and the use cases it enables, with numerous asset management firms launching their own tokenization experimentations to gain first hand experience with the Ethereum L1!Assuming spot ETH ETFs receive approval tomorrow, TradFi institutions will finally receive the tools they need to monetize their support of Ether, potentially compelling them to increase their adoption of Ethereum-native blockchain technology and advertise Ether to external capital.
Daily trading volumes on existing commodity futures-based Ether ETFs set new all-time highs twice this week, generating $47.8M in volume on Tuesday, a 40% increase from the previous all-time high set just the day before and a 7x increase from last week’s peak volume day.Ether futures ETF volumes may pale in comparison to the billions of dollars in daily volume processed by spot BTC ETFs, but they are not a distant cry from the volumes for BTC futures ETFs, which ranged around the $200M mark in recent weeks.Although increases in ETH futures ETF volumes certainly appear impressive on a percentage-adjusted basis, it is worth noting that they have merely rebounded off depressed levels of just a few million dollars in daily volume.Leading Bitcoin futures ETF BITO consistently processed over $500M in volume leading up to spot BTC ETF approval and achieved nearly $2B in volume one day prior to the main event; the chasm between BTC and ETH pre-spot ETF launch volume statistics makes it clear that TradFi participants are not speculating on the launch of spot ETH ETFs with the same amount of gusto as they exhibited for BTC’s spot debut.Despite the relative lack of enthusiasm for Ether ahead of tomorrow’s first final spot ETF decision deadline, an overwhelming denial sentiment heading into this week could have made bulls weary of taking this trade…Over $10B of ETH has been accumulated by the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and will become redeemable upon its conversion to a spot ETH ETF. Sell pressure from ETHE redemptions likely suppresses price in the near-term as it did for Bitcoin after GBTC unlocked in January, but many analysts remain bullish on the future trajectory of ETH price. Asset manager Bernstein claims that spot ETF approval will send Ether to $6.6k, meanwhile multinational bank Standard Chartered reiterated an $8k end-of-year target.

Uniswap Labs Responds to SEC Wells Notice, Calls the Legal Basis “Weak”


																Uniswap Labs, the company behind the decentralized exchange Uniswap, has issued a response to the Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Meanwhile, Uniswap’s native token UNI has surged 2.0% over the last 24 hours and 37% over the week to hit $9.48.
Uniswap Labs Criticizes SEC’s Legal Basis
In a blog post on May 21, Uniswap Labs criticized the SEC’s basis for the notice, calling it “weak.” The firm compiled a number of reasons why the agency’s pursuit of legal action needs to be reconsidered.
Uniswap noted that the SEC based the notice on the assumption that all tokens are securities. However, Marvin Ammori, the Uniswap Labs Chief Legal Officer, argued that tokens are a file format for value and not inherently securities. He went on to criticize the SEC’s efforts to redefine terms such as “exchange,” “broker,” and “investment contract” to include Uniswap’s operations.
Ammori also pointed out that the SEC’s accusation that Uniswap’s interface and wallet act as brokers would likely fail, citing a recent federal judge’s ruling dismissing similar claims against the Coinbase Wallet.




Uniswap has confirmed its readiness to engage in legal action and fight off any charges, saying that its lawyers have represented such cases, including Grayscale and Ripple, which were successful.
Uniswap lawyers warned that a case against Uniswap is bound to drive American crypto investors to use foreign trading protocols. Further, it could discourage future innovators from coming up with new ideas that bring competition and innovation in financial and commercial markets.
Response Comes as Crypto Regulation Bill Vote Nears
Uniswap Labs’ response comes just as the U.S. House of Representatives prepares to vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. The bill aims to reshape the regulatory roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding crypto.
According to Uniswap, if this legislation were enacted, the SEC’s case might become irrelevant, and the CFTC would gain enforcement authority in certain areas.
Uniswap received the Wells Notice in April, as confirmed on X by Ammori. He said that he was disappointed but not surprised. Further, he criticized the SEC for not having clarity and guidance on Uniswap’s self-custodial, non-intermediated products.
Coinbase also received a Wells Notice in March last year, which resulted in full-fledged lawsuits. Meanwhile, the SEC plans to bring legal action against Robinhood, a trading platform, in May.

"Total Nonsense": Scaramucci Defends Bitcoin Evangelist Saylor Against Critic


American financier Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and managing partner of New York-based investment firm SkyBridge Capital, has defended MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor against a critic who has accused the latter of damaging Bitcoin more than helping it. Scaramucci slammed the caustic comment as "complete nonsense," adding that Saylor has been "Sherpa" for many of us. He added that the MicroStrategy co-founder was "the best explainer of Bitcoin" in the cryptocurrency community. Most cryptocurrency commentators have sided with Scaramucci, arguing that it would be ludicrous to view Saylor's influence as negative considering his dedication. However, there were also those who recalled how Saylor's Bitcoin advocacy sometimes went too far. Back in 2021, he famously advised his followers to mortgage their houses in order to buy more Bitcoin near the peak of the previous bullish cycle. In 2022, Saylor's remark came back to bite him during Bitcoin's price crash, with many followers accusing the controversial Bitcoin evangelist of leading them into financial ruin. As reported by U.Today, Saylor defended his controversial comment, claiming that the critics had cherry-picked his words. Saylor, who famously became the first person to lose $6 billion in a day during the dot-com bubble crash in 2000, managed to reinvent himself as one of the top Bitcoin proponents. After facing a lot of ridicule during the bear market, Saylor has defined his naysayers. MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock has seen a triple-digit rally this year due to the Bitcoin rally. Meanwhile, Saylor's net worth has surpassed $4 billion.

Milady NFTs Soar Amid NFT Market Volatility - The Defiant

Milady Maker NFTs have surged 35% as most Ethereum NFTs slumped.As ETH rallied over the past two days, traders sold off most major Ethereum NFT collections, such as Azuki and the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, but Miladies and related NFTs are bucking the trend.While most collections trended downwards or remained flat, the Milady floor price soared 35% from 4 ETH ($14,800) to a high of 5.8 ETH ($21,500) in a matter of hours. While there is no clear catalyst for the rally, the momentum has been sustained as the collection still sits at a 5.5 ETH floor.Top Ethereum NFTsThe Milady-adjacent NFT collection, Redacted Remilio Babies, also jumped 35%, increasing from 1.36 ETH to a high of 1.85 ETH before retracing.Periods of high volatility in the price of Ether can negatively affect NFT prices in the short term. Traders often prefer to be allocated to ETH rather than NFTs when they anticipate large price movements. This is typically due to fear of the NFT underperforming compared to the base asset, ETH.Milady Maker Floor PriceDespite previous controversy, Milady and Remilio NFTs have largely outperformed other ETH NFT collections since 2022, and both are currently at all-time highs.

&nbsp

&nbsp
With the growing anticipations of an Ethereum ETF approval, the entire crypto market is on a bull run. As the altcoins pick up pace, meme coins display impressive rallies within 48 hours.



Further, with the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs getting listing approval on the London Stock Exchange, the bulls are supercharged. Will this bull market sustain an uptrend for a massive jump in meme coins?



Don’t worry. We’ve got our top pick of meme coins that are likely to explode before the Ethereum Spot ETF approval.



PEPE (PEPE)



With the bull run spreading like wildfire in the crypto market, the PEPE price spearheads the bull run in the meme coin sector. The PEPE price is constantly rising as a frog-themed coin in a canine-dominated market.







With a massive jump of almost 50% during the Ethereum bull run, the PEPE price is trading at an all-time high of $0.0000136. Further, the meme coin shows the rounding bottom breakout rally gaining momentum.

&nbsp



The trend-based Fibonacci retracement shows that the PEPE price could easily scale to hit $0.000027 amidst the growing market. 



Floki (FLOKI)



Following the bullish breakout of a double bottom pattern and a falling wedge pattern, the meme coin prepares for a massive surge. The FLOKI price has increased by almost 20% with two immensely bullish candles. 







The Stochastic RSI average lines enter the overbought zone, and the crucial 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs are in a bullish alignment. Thus, the technical indicators bolster the continuation of the bullish trend.



As per the Fibonacci levels, the bull run could reach the 1.618 Fibonacci level at the $0.00040 mark.



Dogwifhat (WIF)



With a bullish trend in motion, the WIF price sustained above a crucial support trendline in the 1D chart. This meme coin is on the verge of a massive bull run as it prepares a triangle breakout.







With the WIF price challenging the overhead resistance trendline, the sideline traders anticipate a surge in buying pressure. Further, the bullish crossover in the MACD and Vortex indicators bolsters the possibility of a bull run.



As per the trend-based Fibonacci retracement, the 2.618 level at $9.29 is a potential upside target.



Shiba Inu (SHIB)



With a market cap of 15.29 Billion dollars, Shiba Inu ranks as the second biggest meme coin in the crypto world. The meme coin has increased by almost 10% since the buzz of Ethereum ETF started in the market.







Further, the SHIB price action shows a triangle breakout rally ready to gain bullish momentum. The meme coin sustains above the 20D EMA and is ready to challenge the $0.00002750 mark.



As the RSI line approaches the overbought zone, the SHIB price could shortly give another breakout entry. An uptrend continuation in Shiba Inu might reach the $0.00005378 mark.



Book of Meme (BOME)



Finally, the Book of MEME or the BOME token is starting to siphon momentum from the recovering market. The recovery rally in the BOME price is starting with a trendline breakout.







The bullish reversal crossed above the 50% Fibonacci level and jumped almost 20% in the last 48 hours. According to the Fibonacci levels, the uptrend continuation in BOME can target $0.037.

Promising Plays to Double-Down on ETH | Bankless


Ethereum is catching a major bid as the market adjusts to an eleventh-hour resurgence in optimism around the chances of approval for the first ETH spot ETFs!With ETH climbing more than 25% in the past week, it’s clear traders are looking to up their exposure to the asset. Investors are also bidding up assets across the EVM ecosystem that they see as beta plays on potential ETF approval.Today, we’re looking at some of the plays already catching fire, and the tokens and ecosystems that could be poised to take off at any moment 👀Ethereum ETF Approval Incoming? on BanklessAfter months of bearishness, is an 11th hour reversal coming from the SEC?Established ETH TokensWhile many major ETH ecosystem tokens have underperformed ETH for months, shifting winds may push investors to look for unrecognized upside.
💦 LDOLido’s governance token, netted a ~25% boost off of ETF approval rumors, showing how integral the protocol and its LST, stETH, remain to the ecosystem despite declining market share. While EigenLayer's restaking push has threatened to reshape the power dynamics of the staking landscape, LDO and competitors like RocketPool's RPL remain much-aped plays.
🧑‍💻 ENSThe governance token of Ethereum Name Service has pumped 50% on the back of broader market games and a notable Vitalik endorsement, who questioned why more people weren't paying attention to what he called Ethereum’s most successful non-financial application. 
🥏 ARBAmid the rise of fresh L2 competitors, Arbitrum has continued to shine with the largest TVL of all L2s. This strength has not always been reflected in its token but ARB has climbed  in the aftermath of the ETF news. Home to leading DeFi protocols like GMX and Pendle and being the primary infrastructure for L3s, Arbitrum sits securely at the top of the L2 ecosystem.♻️ ETHFIEther.fi's governance token, ETHFI, caught a bid on the ETF news, rising ~20% in the following 24 hours. As a non-custodial liquid restaking protocol, ether.fi allows users to stake assets while retaining control over their private keys, receiving eETH in return. Being the largest LRT by TVL provides ether.fi credibility as an established player in restaking, one whose demand is further solidified by its ties to Pendle and the second season of its points program.🤡 MemesLooking to go more degen in your bets? While Base and Solana have been the primary memecoin arenas of this cycle, there are still some major players on mainnet. Just take a look at some established ETH memes like PEPE, BITCOIN, or MOG, which are up ~30%, ~40%, and ~50%, respectively, over the past couple days.
🖼️ ETH-Native NFTsNFTs have been tricky this cycle, with most blue-chip collections underperforming the market or collapsing altogether. Yuga's assets have been dropping for months, but even the stalwart CryptoPunks saw their floor dip below 35 ETH this week for the first time since 2021.Meanwhile, the most promising ETH NFTs performers have been PFPs that didn't moon during the 2021 cycle, including collections like like Miladys, Remilios, Mocaverse and, shockingly, Pixelmon, which have seen double-digit jumps in their ETH-denominated floor prices this week despite ETH's pump. Overall, the price action suggests more interest in grass-roots communities with more open ocean ahead of them, compared to projects that have already raised venture funding or are deep into complicated roadmaps.via NFTPriceFloor🔵 BaseYes, there's not a native token (yet), but betting on Base could still be a solid play. Despite stagnating TVL growth, Base continues to offer a convincing narrative as a the consumer L2 hub for Ethereum. Activity and related assets has been pumping since rumors of an SEC reversal on the ETF decision caught fire. Leading ecosystem tokens like DEGEN are up around ~30% this week, with PRIME also up ~20%. Memecoins have performed even better, with some netting three-figure gains. Make Your BetsThe potential approval of an Ethereum ETF has added to the market’s exuberance, boosting established ETH tokens, ETH-native NFTs, and Ethereum’s popular L2s.While nothing is certain until the SEC makes its final calls on ETF applications, savvy ETH investors know where Ethereum is going in the long-term and should be loading up their bags accordingly.

House Passes FIT21 Bill To Provide Crypto Legal Clarity With Two Thirds Majority


																The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Monday that will provide long-sought-after legal clarity around how crypto assets should be classified, registered, and custodied.
The bill, titled the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), received near unanimous support from Republicans alongside 71 additional votes from Democrats, resulting in a final tally of 279 ‘yea’ to 136 ‘nay’.
A ‘Historic’ Step For Crypto Regulation
Crypto industry leaders widely praised the legislation as a first step towards clear, fit-for-purpose rules pertaining to digital asset trading and registration.
“Americans want to know their representatives are protecting their rights to use crypto, creating clear rules to protect consumers, and won’t let the lack of clarity be weaponized by a few activists in the administration trying to unlawfully kill an industry,” tweeted Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on Wednesday, before the vote.
According to one of the bill’s authors, French Hill (R-AR), the legislation includes an interim oversight process for digital asset firms whereby they may file a ‘notice of intent to register’ with federal regulators as rules around how agencies divvy responsibility of the industry are finalized.
“This bill imposes strict consumer protections that do not allow commingling of customer funds,” added Hill, noting that it would help prevent another FTX-like collapse.




It also helps clarify which digital assets should be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) versus the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), both of which have bickered over their rightful jurisdiction of the industry for years.
What Democrats Think Of FIT21
Contrary to the bill’s Republican supporters, Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee said the bill would benefit “wealthy crypto firms that have chosen not to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),” while hurting “ordinary investors trying to build wealth.”
SEC chairman Gary Gensler also criticized the bill, claiming that the laws on the books are sufficient to regulate crypto, and that the industry simply refuses to comply with them. “We should make the policy choice to protect the investing public over facilitating business models of non-compliant firms,” he argued.
A significant number of Democrats supported the bill, however, urging their party members to do the same to help the nation keep pace with rivals on crypto regulation and progress. “This is not a perfect bill, but I believe it is a good step in the right direction,” said Rep. Yadira Caraveo (D-CO) on the matter.
The Biden administration said that it opposed FIT21 prior to the vote, but that it would work with Congress on a “comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets.”
Notably, the administration did not signal intent to veto the bill should it pass through both chambers, as done with recent crypto legislation around crypto banking. As with FIT21, the legislation passed the House with bipartisan support.

White House Won’t Veto Passage of FIT21 Despite Opposition From SEC Chair Gary Gensler - The Daily Hodl


								The White House has signalled it won’t veto the passage of the FIT21 bill despite U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler advocating against it.
In a new press release, the White House says it does not support HR 4763, also known as the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), as it currently “lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions.”










However, the administration says that even though it opposes the bill, it is willing to work with Congress to improve it.
“The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 4763, which would affect the regulatory structure for digital assets in the United States… 
The Administration looks forward to continued collaboration with Congress on developing legislation for digital assets that includes adequate guardrails for consumers and investors while creating the conditions needed for innovation, and further time will be needed for such collaboration.”
The bill, which would give power to the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate digital assets as commodities if the blockchain they run on is sufficiently decentralized, is slated to be voted on later this week.
In a message from the SEC, Chair Gensler voices his dissent of the bill, saying that it would create numerous regulatory gaps, undermining current securities laws.
“It is through the securities laws that we get full, fair, and truthful disclosure that arms investors with the information they need to make investment decisions and enables regulators to guard against the types of fraud we’ve seen in the crypto field. 
The crypto industry’s record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don’t have rules or because the rules are unclear. It’s because many players in the crypto industry don’t play by the rules. We should make the policy choice to protect the investing public over facilitating business models of noncompliant firms.”

Black Phoenix (BPX) Emerges As The Crypto King With Mind-Blowing 4,000,000% Growth In 24 Hours


																The crypto industry has been dominated by the recovery of major cryptocurrencies and regulatory developments, but one unexpected player has taken the market by storm. Black Phoenix, a payment system protocol, and its native token, BPX, have witnessed an astonishing surge in price, outperforming the entire market with historical performance.
Notably, Black Phoenix’s BPX token reached an all-time high of $2.60 on May 22, propelled by a staggering 4,400,000% growth in the past 24 hours and over 6,500,000% in the past fourteen days.

This unexpected victory has caught the attention of investors, prompting them to examine the protocol’s underlying principles and design more closely.
Exploring The Black Phoenix Design
According to the protocol’s “Black Paper” released in April 2021, Black Phoenix presents a fully on-chain liquidity protocol for instant cryptocurrency token swaps in a decentralized manner on any smart contract-enabled blockchain. 
The protocol’s design aggregates liquidity within each blockchain, claiming to offer “the best rates” for takers executing trades. Additionally, Black Phoenix envisions a connected liquidity network facilitating seamless cross-chain token swaps across its networks on different chains, with its token based on the Tron (TRX) blockchain.

To implement a distributed infrastructure services economy, Black Phoenix introduced its native token BPX. BPX aims to eliminate “inefficiencies” in the existing protocol and attract a broad user base, ultimately creating a marketplace for distributed infrastructure services.
Black Phoenix’s long-term and short-term goals revolve around achieving reputable exchange listings, increasing the token’s value, and expanding the user base. 
Currently, BPX tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Black Phoenix is FameEX, where the most active trading pair BPX/USDT has a trading volume of $2,809,201 in the last 24 hours, which has been the propeller of the current uptrend.

Nevertheless, Black Phoenix plans to list the BPX token on several exchanges, including Hotbit, Hitbtc, Coinex, Binance, and Coinbase Pro. 
Trading Volume Skyrockets 2,800,000%
One key indicator of Black Phoenix’s recent success is the increase in trading volume. CoinGecko data shows a significant spike in trading volume for BPX on Wednesday, reaching 2,800,000%. 
At the same time, Black Phoenix’s market capitalization has risen to $3.8 billion, a significant increase from $29 million in hours. 
The fully diluted valuation (FDV) is a statistical representation of the maximum market capitalization an asset can achieve, assuming that all available tokens are in circulation. 
For Black Phoenix, the FDV currently stands at an impressive $10.4 billion. This valuation represents the potential growth and market cap of BPX if all 4 billion tokens were in circulation. 
Following the notable surge in all key metrics for BPX, the project’s team has made a bold prediction, stating that BPX will soon become one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the world.

Ultimately, the potential listing of Black Phoenix’s token on top exchanges promises to propel its upward trend further. However, as is typical for all cryptocurrencies, the extent of its surge and the subsequent occurrence of a market correction remains uncertain.

Fed Pivot Could Release $6 Trillion into Crypto to Boost BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, and More | Cryptoglobe


                                
Wall Street analysts are eyeing a potential turning point in Federal Reserve policy, with some predicting a seismic shift that could ignite a multi-trillion-dollar surge in the cryptocurrency market.



This bullish outlook hinges on the Fed successfully taming inflation, potentially unleashing an estimated $6 trillion in sidelined capital back into the market, according to a recent Forbes report. Some of that capital could move into the cryptocurrency space and boost assets like BTC, ETH, and XRP.



Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, has revealed he envisions a transformative event, a once-in-a-generation opportunity as if the Fed signals victory over inflation, Lee suggests trillions of dollars could flood back into the market within months.



Lee’s optimism rests on recent signs of progress. The April Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a deceleration, rising 0.3% compared to 0.4% in March, which suggests the Fed’s aggressive monetary policy may be paying off.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Should the Fed pivot, Lee believes a frenzy of investment activity could erupt and the price of Bitcoin could potentially skyrocket to $150,000, more than double its current price of around $71,000. Historically, other major cryptocurrencies like XRP have followed similar trajectories.



Earlier this week, the price of Ethereum soared more than 20% in a single day as the cryptocurrency market added over $200 billion, in a surge triggered by news elated to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.



These came after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.



A major cryptocurrency analysts are eyeing is XRP, which has struggled to regain its former highs after its legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started. The cryptocurrency could be a beneficiary from the potential $6 trillion in capital that could flow into the cryptocurrency space.

The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act Is a Watershed Moment for Our Industry

For too long, the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States has been an untenable, muddled mess. Different federal agencies have asserted conflicting jurisdiction, creating confusion and uncertainty in the marketplace. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken advantage of this precarious situation, supercharging a campaign of intimidation and enforcement that threatens the viability of crypto in the U.S.

Crypto Lobby Wins: House Passes FIT21 as Democrats Deride Historic Regulatory Framework - Decrypt

Lawmakers voted Wednesday in favor of a crypto market structure bill that could have a sweeping impact on the U.S. regulatory backdrop for digital assets if it eventually becomes law.Dubbed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, the measure was approved by the House of Representatives with a 279-136 vote. With 208 Republican members of the House voting in favor of the bill, 71 Democrats voted in favor of FIT21 as well. All but three of 217 Republican House members voted in favor of FIT21, while about a third of Democrats supported the measure too.The bipartisan push behind FIT21 encapsulates shifting attitudes towards crypto on Capitol Hill. Just last week, a measure rolling back crypto custody rules for banks from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) passed both the House and Senate, receiving support from notable lawmakers like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).The bill passed by the House on Wednesday creates a federal framework for the regulation of digital assets, establishing jurisdiction between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and SEC. Giving issuers the ability to self-certify assets as digital commodities, among other initiatives, the bill was skewered Wednesday by SEC Chair Gary Gensler.Among those that vocalized discontent for the bill was also President Joe Biden, who called out a lack of sufficient protections for investors in written remarks. Still, Biden in his Wednesday letter called for a “comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework” for digital assets, suggesting that the status quo is currently lacking.Curtailing the SEC’s regulatory remit, FIT21 gives the CFTC exclusive regulatory authority over digital asset commodities. Under the bill, criteria is provided for determining that status based on a project’s level of decentralization, looking at factors such as how much of a token’s supply a party owns or a blockchain’s susceptibility to influence from a single party.Hours before the bill was put to a House vote, members of the Chamber debated FIT21’s merits. Among the bill’s cosponsors, House Financial Services Committee (HSFC) Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-SC) said, “The SEC and the CFTC are currently in a food fight for control of this asset class class.”"They've created an impossible situation where the same firms are subject to competing and contradictory enforcement actions by the two different agencies, leaving consumers behind, leaving innovators behind," he continued. "FIT21 fixes this."However, several Democrats, including Rep. Maxine Waters, blasted the bill. "This bill still provides major exemptions from critical securities laws," she said. She later said that crypto companies are "refusing to register," and that the bill would "exonerate" them and "give them the opportunity to operate without regulation.""How can this happen?" she said.Brad Sherman (D-CA) said that changes under the bill to the definition of a security would serve as a "dagger at the hundred trillion dollar markets that power our economy." Additionally, he raised concerns about crypto users evading taxes or sanctions if the technology was policed with a light touch.Meanwhile, Sean Casten (D-IL) pointed to reports regarding the use of cryptocurrency by terrorist groups and to in the child sexual abuse material (CSAM) trade. "The bad guys love crypto," he said.Clarifying authority between the CFTC and SEC has been a long-held hope within the crypto industry as advocates have said existing rules are unclear. And FIT21 addresses several areas within crypto, including the treatment of trading platforms, decentralized finance, and how developers can raise funds for projects.The passage of FIT21 comes after years of squabbling on Capitol Hill over other crypto bills, such as measures to regulate stablecoins. Last year, House Republicans established a subcommittee on digital assets with the explicit goal of creating clearer crypto rules.Introduced by McHenry as a crypto "OG," Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) said that crypto legislation was long overdue after working for six years on other crypto measures. Davidson said he began working on crypto rules in 2018, starting with the Token Taxonomy Act."For too long we have pushed innovation and investment in digital asset projects overseas as Congress has constantly failed to bring the clarity that we need," he said. "We finally have the chance to end this trend and solidify ourselves as the leaders in this industry."As the bill moves next to the Democrat-controlled Senate, it could face insurmountable hurdles before reaching Biden's desk. However, the crypto-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) suggested on Twitter (aka X) that lawmakers there could rally behind FIT21 with bipartisan support.”There is a bipartisan majority in both chambers of Congress in favor of crypto," she said. "The future is very bright."Edited by Guillermo Jimenez and Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

U.S. House Approves Crypto FIT21 Bill With Wave of Democratic Support

"We need rules of the road," said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), one of the Democrats who bucked the opposition of the White House and the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). He called it "well-reasoned, thoughtful, bipartisan legislation" and argued before the vote that "it's fit to become law if we work together."

BREAKING: FIT21 Bill, Favorable for Cryptocurrencies, Passed the US House of Representatives Vote - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to the latest development, the FIT21 bill, which is positive for cryptocurrencies, was voted in the House of Representatives.
The bill, called FIT21, would give the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) more spot market authority over digital assets considered commodities, while also creating new lines of jurisdiction for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).


Crypto companies and digital asset issuers will have a framework for determining whether and how their assets qualify as securities under the terms defined in the bill, allowing them to know who their primary regulators may be.
The bill's path in the Senate is less clear, and the White House said early Wednesday it opposes the legislation, but President Joe Biden has not threatened a veto.

Audrey Tang: Learning From Taiwan’s Digital Civic Experimentation

Chapter 2-2, has a very comprehensive response, saying that, and I quote, “As a decentralized, citizen-led community, vTaiwan is also a living organism that naturally evolves and adapts as citizen volunteers participate in various ways. The community’s engagement experienced a downturn following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted face-to-face meetings and led to decreased participation. The platform faced challenges due to the intensive volunteering effort required, the absence of mandates for governmental responses, and its somewhat narrow focus. In response to these challenges, vTaiwan’s community has sought to find a new role between the public and the government and extend its outreach beyond the realm of Taiwanese regulation in recent years. A significant effort to revitalize vTaiwan was its collaboration with OpenAI’s Democratic Input to AI project in 2023. Through partnerships with Chatham House and the organization of several physical and online deliberative events centered on the topic of AI ethics and localization, vTaiwan successfully integrated local perspectives into the global discourse on AI and technology governance.”

Alex Labs Recovers $3.9 Million in Crypto from BNB Smart Chain Bridge Exploit



                    

Bitcoin layer-2 developer Alex Labs has successfully frozen over $3.9 million worth of cryptocurrency exploited from its BNB Smart Chain bridge, according to a May 16 social media post. 



The team stated that the attacker sent the funds to various centralized exchanges (CEXs), enabling the funds to be frozen with the cooperation of these exchanges.




The team announced that it recovered the entire balances for 17 different tokens, including “all aBTC, sUSDT, xBTC, xUSD, ALEX, atALEX, LiSTX, LUNR, SKO, CHAX, $B20, ORDG, ORMM, ORNJ, TRIO, TX20 and STXS.”



Additionally, $13.7 million worth of Stacks (STX) tokens were exploited. Of these, the attacker mistakenly sent “about 3 million” to centralized exchanges. 



A linked spreadsheet shows STX balances at each exchange used by the hacker, revealing that $3.7 million is held at exchanges, while $9.6 million remains in wallets under the attacker’s control.



The attacker accessed the funds by taking control of a private key linked to one of the bridge’s “vaults.” 



However, “The smart contract code and infrastructure underlying ALEX were not compromised,” the team asserted.



Alex Labs has offered a 10% bounty to the attacker and a promise not to prosecute if they return 90% of the stolen funds.

They are also preparing a police report to be filed if negotiations fail.



Given the possibility that not all funds will be recovered, the team is “evaluating deployment of $ALEX reserves held by ALEX Lab Foundation.” 




These reserves may support a “treasury grant program” to compensate users who lost funds in the attack.



Due to the significant amount of STX tokens exploited, the team may propose a Stacks network upgrade to freeze the remaining funds and mint new tokens for the victims.



Network upgrades to freeze an attacker’s coins are rare but not unprecedented. Similar actions were taken during the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack and the PopcornSwap rug pull on the BNB Smart Chain. 



However, such upgrades are rarely approved, and in the PopcornSwap case, the upgrade froze funds but did not reimburse investors.



Alex Labs stated it continues to monitor the attacker’s addresses with “multiple alarms” to prevent further cash outs.
