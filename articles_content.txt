Crypto Firm VersiFi, Co-Led by Former Genesis Exec, Acquires Trading Tech Startup Ather Digital - Benzinga

VersiFi, a crypto trading and lending firm co-led by a former Genesis executive, has acquired Ather Digital, a crypto trading technology startup, for an undisclosed sum. The deal will help VersiFi add direct market access, algorithmic trading and smart order routing to its platform, the firm said Thursday. The deal terms were undisclosed, but VersiFi founder and co-CEO Sameer Shalaby told The Block that it was an "all-stock" deal in which all Ather Digital shareholders received shares in VersiFi. One of those shareholders is Manifold Capital Partners, a quantitative investment firm from which Ather Digital was spun out in 2022. Manifold and other high-frequency trading hedge funds developed Ather's technology to meet their crypto trading requirements.

Popular Cryptocurrency Exchange Responds to Bankruptcy Rumors - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, denied rumors about the company's bankruptcy. Rumors that started circulating on social media platform X on May 22 suggested that Bybit was bankrupt or hacked.
Responding to these claims, Zhou said, “There are no facts supporting any of the rumors I have seen so far. Please be aware.” said. He also noted that Bybit updated its Proof of Reserve (PoR) this month and that all Bybit wallets are viewable through Nansen, with total assets exceeding $11 billion.



A cryptocurrency user suggested that an error in Arkham Intelligence's proof-of-reserve chart could be the source of the rumor. In response to this speculation, Zhou shared a link to Bybit's PoR data and a Nansen dashboard showing all Bybit wallets and the amount of assets they hold, in an attempt to provide transparency and reassure users.
Such rumors have historically affected not only Bybit but other exchanges as well. For example, concerns about MEXC increased after the “MEXC_CEO” Twitter account was discontinued in December 2023. This coincided with a rise in user complaints about frozen funds, fueling concerns about the financial health of the exchange.

'Notcoin' Missions Let You Passively Earn Crypto via Telegram-Here's How - Decrypt

Notcoin, the viral clicker game that had tens of millions of users fervently tapping a digital gold coin to earn crypto via Telegram, has launched a new type of mission that lets players passively earn crypto token rewards.After conducting its NOT token airdrop via The Open Network (TON) last week, Not ranks as the largest gaming token launch so far in 2024–instantly reaching a market cap of nearly $1.5 billion.Now, the token has settled around a $500 million market cap at a price of just under $0.005, and the Notcoin team is starting to roll out the next wave of in-game opportunities to earn more crypto.The newest addition to the game are “earnings missions.” Earnings missions differ from previous tasks or quests players had to complete ahead of the token launch, as completing them lets users earn NOT tokens passively rather than through a one-time reward.Notcoin's tutorial notes that these missions guide players through different communities, belonging to "partner projects," granting them tokens in return for learning about other crypto games and apps.The NOT earnings are based on your in-game level. The higher your level, the larger the pool of potential NOT rewards. You can increase your level by staking Notcoin, and the amount of NOT you have staked at the end of every month determines whether you move up or down the ranks. The highest level, Platinum, earns players the most Notcoin tokens.Sample screenshots from Notcoin's earning missions. Image: NotcoinEach partner mission includes tasks like following them on Twitter, joining their Discord, or downloading their app. At the moment, there are four missions available, including a tutorial, one for a project called TonGifts, and two for third-party crypto games that let Notcoin players earn more NOT by joining their respective communities and playing the games.“300%+ APY now for Platinum [by the way] and we just started with four pools,” the team wrote in an official Telegram community. “The real annual percentage yield, not what others offer you for a week or so. And holy math, it works.

Crypto market structure bill advances to Senate, Rep. Nickel is optimistic - Blockworks


After passing in the US House of Representatives Wednesday evening with widespread bipartisan support, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, known as the FIT21 Act, is headed to the Senate. 
FIT21 advanced Wednesday with the support of 71 House Democrats, including Reps. Nancy Pelosi, D-Cali., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J. Representatives passed the bill with two amendments proposed by Reps. Brittany Pettersen, D-Col., and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., respectively. 
Norman’s amendment requires the Treasury Department, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission to complete a joint study and submit a report to Congress that identifies any digital asset businesses that are owned by “governments of foreign adversaries,” Norman said Wednesday on the House Floor. 
Pettersen’s amendment expands the Bank Secrecy Act to include digital asset entities under the definition of a “financial institution” and orders a study to assess risks posed by centralized intermediaries in areas where anti-money laundering enforcement is not as “robust,” she said Wednesday.
After joint resolution 109 — the measure which, should President Joe Biden refrain from exercising his right to veto, invalidates the SEC’s staff accounting bulletin (SAB) 121 — passed the Senate with unexpected bipartisan support earlier this month, fans of FIT21 are hopeful. 
“I’m optimistic — yesterday’s vote in the House sent a clear message that there’s a strong bipartisan coalition supporting a regulatory structure for crypto,” Rep. Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., told Blockworks. “I’m engaged with my colleagues in the Senate who have the same priorities to protect consumers, cement the US as a global leader in finance and tech, and promote an innovative, inclusive financial future for all.”
Read more from our opinion section: It’s time to overturn SAB 121
Senators will now have the opportunity to consider the legislation as it currently stands and propose amendments. Industry advocates say the current version of the bill is probably not going to make it to the president’s desk. 
“We expect the Senate to continue working on and amending FIT21, and our focus will remain on ensuring that there are protections and legal certainty for developers and users of decentralized networks and protocols,” Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, said. “We look forward to working with the Senate on these core issues.” 
Even with 71 Democrats getting on board with FIT21 in the House, those opposed are expected to lobby in the Senate just as hard. Rep. Maxine Waters, who has dubbed FIT21 the “Not Fit for Purpose Act,” said Wednesday that the legislation serves to deregulate the crypto industry. 
“The SEC is the federal agency on the front lines of enforcing our existing securities laws on crypto firms that have willfully chosen to ignore the law and [which have] defrauded customers out of billions of dollars with ‘get rich quick’ schemes,” Waters said in a statement ahead of Wednesday’s vote. “Giving this industry a free pass to avoid most or all regulations cannot be the answer to the serious concerns that Members have raised about crypto fraud.”
FIT21 advocates will also have to take on SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who said Wednesday that the bill “would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.”
The Senate has not yet scheduled a floor vote for FIT21.

What Ray Dalio, Larry Fink, Carl Icahn And Others Have Said About Ethereum - Benzinga

With the imminent decision about spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs potentially shifting the limelight away from Bitcoin BTC/USD, a crypto trader pointed out what several big names in traditional finance have said about ETH.What Happened: Evanss6 highlighted quotes from several prominent figures, such as Ken Griffin, who believes Ethereum will eventually replace Bitcoin BTC/USD, and Carl Icahn, who prefers Ethereum over Bitcoin, viewing it as both a store of value and a payment system.He also cited Stanley Druckenmiller, who predicts Ethereum might dominate Bitcoin, and Ray Dalio, who owns both BTC and ETH and sees a place for crypto in investment portfolios. Furthermore, Jamie Dimon was noted for his criticism of Bitcoin but acknowledgment of Ethereum’s use cases.Additionally, Paul Tudor Jones described Ethereum as an "industrial digital asset" and part of the "Fourth Industrial Revolution," emphasizing the development of protocols that interact with traditional companies. Larry Fink was quoted discussing tokenization and the potential for a decentralized ledger-based financial system.Evanss6 concluded that traditional finance leaders are very much interested in Ethereum, despite it nominally being much smaller than Bitcoin.Also Read: What Would Ethereum ETF Approval Mean For The Price Of ETH?Why It Matters: The quotes highlight the interest from major financial institutions to fully embrace Ethereum, recognizing its potential for tokenization and other use cases. While Ethereum’s market capitalization of $450 million is a fraction of Bitcoin’s $1.3 billion, its versatility is tipped to become a major asset if it is fully embraced by traditional finance. However, doubts remain whether Ethereum can fulfill its potential, with Bitcoin advocates pointing out that Ethereum’s complexity makes it intentionally confusing.What’s Next: The influence of Ethereum as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Ethereum ETF Decision Looms: What To Watch Out For TodayImage: Shutterstock

Bold Claim from Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson: "I Don't Think Bitcoin Will Survive" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Cardano CEO Charles Hoskinson recently said that he has strong doubts about the future of Bitcoin.
“Bitcoin needs the industry to survive, and it certainly needs exchanges and all the other infrastructure because it is not self-sufficient at that size,” Hoskinson said.


He compared this situation to the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem, which he believes no longer needs Bitcoin to thrive. “The industry no longer needs Bitcoin to survive,” he said.
While Hoskinson acknowledged that Bitcoin has a reputation as “digital gold,” he noted that it remains a token with a fundamentally deflationary monetary policy. He argued that new digital assets with solid scientific foundations could replace Bitcoin and offer equal or greater security. “At any time, another digital gold could form, and if there is a good scientific basis behind it, it will be just as safe, if not more,” he said.





Referring to the development of Cardano, Hoskinson said that a meticulous scientific approach was followed when designing the proof-of-stake protocol. According to the founder, Cardano's team has focused on creating a secure, energy-efficient consensus protocol for seven years.
Hoskinson stated that despite these advances, the Bitcoin community has rejected these efforts. “The response from the Bitcoin ecosystem was that this was a scam, such a technology could not exist, perpetual motion and proof-of-stake were wrong.” said.



Hoskinson compared Bitcoin's current position to Microsoft's historical dominance with Windows, noting that Windows has lost its critical market position as technology paradigms change. He warned that Bitcoin could face a similar fate if it fails to adapt.
Hoskinson expressed concerns that Bitcoin may lose importance as the industry evolves and focuses on innovations outside the Bitcoin network: “You wake up and realize 98% of what you're doing is outside of Bitcoin. And you start asking yourself, why do I really care about BTC?”

Why Is The Ethereum Spot ETF Decision Still To Be Announced? Bloomberg Analyst Provides Latest Insights - Bitcoin Sistemi


While everyone is waiting for the SEC's decision on Ethereum Spot ETFs, there is no development yet, even though it is 23:30.
Bitcoin Spot ETFs were approved at 11:15 p.m.


Regarding the delay, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said:

“Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas: “No development yet. We're waiting to hear something. I've seen two different people here claim (without citing their sources) that it's been delayed until later in the night, but we can't confirm that with anyone yet. That's all we know right now. Although it hasn't been confirmed.” “Given that the Trading & Markets department was notified at the last minute, a slight delay isn't that crazy. However, everything we've heard suggests it will be approved.”

However, a decision must be made today regarding VanEck's application for Ethereum Spot ETFs, either rejection or approval.

Pundit Predicts Shiba Inu Competitor Dogwifhat Will Reach $10 Amid Short liquidations


																Crypto trader and analyst Unipcs (Bonk Guy) has reiterated his bullish prediction for Dogwifhat (WIF). He made this statement while revealing the sums lost by short traders thanks to their bearish sentiment around the meme coin. 
Dogwifhat Headed To $10
Unipcs mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogwifhat is “headed to $10” and will never drop to as low as $1 again. He added that the market is currently in a meme coin supercycle, which is why he believes the meme coin can attain such heights. The crypto trader also highlighted how WIF shorts were “getting squeezed hard” and said this is the “way it should be.”

Source: X
Besides Dogwifhat, Unipcs generally has a bullish outlook towards meme coins. He earned a reputation for longing Bonk, another Solana-based meme coin, with $16,000 in October 2023 and still holding as at the last time he shared an update on the trade. Based on his update, his unrealized profit has risen to as high as $13.7 million at some point. 
Unipcs’s bullishness on meme coins is also not surprising, considering this category of crypto tokens is projected as one of the leading narratives in this bull run. It is also worth noting that meme coins Dogwifhat and Pepe (PEPE) are currently this year’s best-performing crypto assets among the top 50 coins by market cap, with year-to-date (YTD) gains of over 1,800% and 1,000%, respectively. 
Unipcs isn’t the only one who believes that WIF could rise to $10. Another crypto trader known as ‘Free’ has also reaffirmed on different occasions that the meme coin will still rise to that price level. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Bluntz Capital is also ultra-bullish on Dogwifhat, as he once suggested that the meme coin will flip PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to become the second-largest meme coin by market cap, only behind Dogecoin (DOGE).
This Crypto Analyst Has Other Expectations
Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently revealed his bearish expectations for meme coins, including WIF. He foresees a “meme wipeout,” which could be worse than he initially thought. He added that this occurrence would “catch a ton of people off guard.” He claimed he would become a meme coin bull when the time is right, but now is not the right time. 

	Related Reading


In a recent video posted on his YouTube channel, CrediBULL Crypto also analyzed Dogwifhat. He noted that WIF had significantly moved to the upside, as he rightly predicted in an earlier market update. Back then, he mentioned that he was expecting the meme coin to rise to $3.8 before it dropped to as low as $1.6.
However, in his recent video, he revealed that he won’t be shorting Dogwifhat even when it reaches $3.8. Instead, he will wait for the meme coin to claim the untapped highs at the $4 range to validate his bearish expectations. 
At the time of writing, Dogwifhat is trading at around $3, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Specifically, the Dogecoin whale transferred 300 million DOGE to each wallet.These transactions have drawn considerable attention, but the motives and implications of these transfers are unclear.The movement caused DOGE’s price to rise 13.08%, however.DOGE recorded a price increase of 13.08%Coinglass data further indicates heightened investor interest in the asset. According to the derivatives data, DOGE’s open interest (OI) increased by 27.05% to $1.05 billion, accompanied by a volume upswing of 212.27% to $3.73 billion.The latest activity, along with the previous Dogecoin whale transactions, is driving the conversation around Dogecoin price prediction. Investors and market analysts are closely monitoring these movements, speculating on the potential for further price surges and the overall influence of whale activities on the cryptocurrency’s future.

XRPL Transactions Surge Over 100% in Q1 2024 as Average Costs Plummet, Ripple Report Reveals



                    

The number of transactions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) more than doubled from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the end of the first quarter of 2024, while the average transaction cost nearly halved, according to Ripple’s Q1 2024 XRP Markets Report.



On-chain transaction activity on the XRPL surged by 108% during Q1 of 2024, reaching approximately 251.39 million transactions compared to 121.03 million in Q4 of 2023, as noted in the report published on May 17.




Additionally, the average cost per transaction fell by 45%, amounting to approximately $0.000856.



“As such, the decrease in average cost per transaction indicated a reset and that no network congestion occurred in the quarter,” the report states.



The distribution of XRP trading volume among cryptocurrency exchanges remained stable in the first quarter. 



Binance, Bybit, and Upbit together accounted for over 70% of the total traded volume. 



During this period, the proportion of volume traded via fiat pairs decreased from 15% in Q4 to 11%. Currently, most XRP trading occurs against Tether.

The report also addressed the ongoing lawsuit between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple. 




The SEC filed the lawsuit in December 2020, alleging that Ripple’s executives conducted an initial public offering of XRP, which it considered an unregistered security during the capital-raising period.



On April 22, Ripple responded to the SEC’s request for $2 billion in remedies, disagreeing with the demand. 




Ripple argued that the law doesn’t permit the SEC to demand disgorgement or interest on disgorgement unless they can prove someone was harmed.



“In terms of next steps, both parties will wait for the Judge to make a determination on the final remedies – likely in the coming months,” Ripple explained.



“Ripple remains confident that the Judge will approach the remedies phase fairly,” it added.

Uniswap Price Prediction as UNI Reaches For The $10 Mark

                        The Uniswap (UNI) price just dipped to $9.0, just as hopes had been rising that it was about to reach for the $10 mark, with UNI now around 10% down from earlier session highs in the $9.80s.No one single catalyst can explain the decentralized exchanges (DEX)’s abrupt reversal.Rather, UNI’s intra-day turn-around is in tandem with a sell-off in the broader market.Bitcoin (BTC) just dipped back below $67,000, having touched $72,000 earlier this week.Other major cryptos were also pulling lower, with Ether (ETH) dropping back to the $3,600s from session highs near $4,000.Perhaps the market is experiencing a sell-the-news reaction to major positive catalysts this week – expectations that the SEC is about to approve spot Ethereum ETFs and the passage of the FIT21 bill through the House.Either way, the Uniswap price is taking a hit. Here’s where it could be headed next.Uniswap Price Prediction – Is $50 Possible?
$10 is a key area of resistance for the Uniswap price. It’s no surprise that UNI has found strong resistance here.But that doesn’t mean that UNI’s recovery is over. The cryptocurrency recently broke convincingly to the north of its 21 and 50DMAs.It had previously been stuck in a $6.50-$8.0ish range for over one month.A run back higher towards $17 could be on the cards later this year.The Uniswap price could soon power back towards earlier yearly highs. Source: TradingViewThe SEC’s u-turn on Ethereum ETFs has sparked hopes they might not go through with charging the Uniswap Foundation.The Uniswap Foundation received a Wells Notice from the agency earlier this year.If the agency doesn’t press ahead with charges, that would be a big weight off UNI’s shoulders.But could it go all the way to $50?Well, Uniswap hit as high as $45 back in 2021. That was the peak of meme coin mania during the past cycle.But this cycle could blow the last cycle out of the water. It already is in some ways, with Bitcoin hitting new record highs this year and comfortably holding in this area.That reflects the fact that crypto adoption has risen leaps and bounds since 2021.At $50, Uniswap would hit a fully diluted market cap of just over $50 billion.As the dominant multi-chain DEX protocol that continues to lead its sector forward, that’s not an unfair price prediction.Uniswap Alternative to Consider – Multi-chain Meme Coin Dogeverse (DV)
UNI could 5x from current levels this bull market. And most investors would be more than happy with 5x gains.But many investors are hunting bigger upside of 50-100x.These investors tend to turn to the highly speculative and volatile meme coin market.Meme coins are of course very risky, and there is no way around it.But one way that investors can turn the odds in their favor is to get into high-potential meme coins early and at a favorable valuation, before they start to pump.One meme coin that the team at Cryptonews thinks has a lot of potential is Dogeverse.Dogeverse has in-built cross-chain capabilities and, as a result, is generating considerable excitement in the market.Currently in presale, Dogeverse has raised over $15 million.Its X account has already garnered a following of over 21,200. The project’s Telegram, meanwhile, has close to 13,000 subscribers.Dogeverse seeks to be the multi-chain equivalent of Dogecoin and is launching on the six most popular blockchains (excluding Bitcoin).Dogeverse’s cross-chain bridging capabilities further enhance its appeal, making it a “Doge with superpowers.”Interested investors should get in quick ahead of the token’s official launch on the 5th of June. The presale will end on the 3rd.Visit Dogeverse Here

                        The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just approved eight spot Ethereum ETF applications through an omnibus order on Thursday in a landmark move signaling growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance.The decision arrived just four months after the regulator greenlit the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a rapid shift in the regulatory landscape.Ethereum ETF Approvals Follow Last-Minute Scramble
The SEC granted approval for 19b-4 forms submitted by prominent financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. Despite this initial hurdle being cleared, ETF issuers now face another: ensuring their S-1 registration statements become effective before trading can commence.Although the SEC recently initiated discussions with issuers regarding these S-1 forms, the timeline remains uncertain. Some analysts speculate a turnaround within weeks, while others point to historical precedents exceeding three months.SEC Faces Scrutiny Over Unexpected Shift
The SEC’s decision comes as a surprise to many market observers. Previous interactions between the regulatory body and ETF issuers gave little indication of impending approvals, leading to speculation about the catalyst for this sudden shift. Some sources point to recent bipartisan pressure from House lawmakers urging the SEC to align its treatment of Ethereum ETFs with its prior acceptance of spot Bitcoin ETFs.This unexpected move has already triggered notable market reactions. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust, for example, witnessed its discount shrink from 24% to 6% as its conversion to an ETF draws nearer. This conversion allows holders to exchange shares for the equivalent cash value of the underlying Ether.While Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed significant inflows since their approval, amassing an additional 207,000 Bitcoin ($14 billion) on top of the 621,000 Bitcoin ($42 billion) already held by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust pre-conversion, it remains to be seen whether Ethereum ETFs will garner the same level of investor interest.

FTX examiner recommends further investigation into shortfalls, S&C's legal representation

The court-appointed examiner, Robert J. Cleary, has released a detailed report recommending additional investigations into several aspects of the collapsed FTX Group, particularly focusing on FTX.US, its asset management practices, and its legal representation by Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C).Cleary’s report, submitted to the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, outlines the necessity of three primary investigations to further clarify the circumstances surrounding FTX Group’s downfall.ShortfallsThe first key recommendation centers on FTX.US balance sheet shortfalls. The report highlights significant concerns over recurring “holes” or shortfalls in FTX.US’s balance sheet.These gaps, particularly evident in November 2022, suggest possible commingling of customer and corporate assets — indicating a potential misuse of funds.The examiner emphasized the need for a comprehensive investigation to determine the causes, frequency, and resolution of these shortfalls, which may uncover additional misconduct and bolster public confidence in the bankruptcy process.The examiner also recommended a probe into the pre-bankruptcy sale of Ledger Holdings Inc. (LHI) to West Realm Shires Inc., seeking to identify potential avoidance actions against former shareholders who might still hold claims against the estate.The inquiry could provide deeper insights into the transactions leading up to the bankruptcy and uncover additional assets for recovery.S&C’s representationThe examiner called for a focused inquiry into the role of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP (S&C), the law firm representing FTX, particularly concerning its representation of Sam Bankman-Fried during his purchase of Robinhood shares.The investigation aims to determine whether S&C was aware of the fraudulent activities within FTX and whether there were any conflicts of interest that the court should have considered when approving their retention as counsel.If S&C’s representation of Samuel Bankman-Fried during his purchase of Robinhood Markets shares is found to be improper or conflicted, it could have legal and financial implications for Bankman-Fried and other individuals involved.This might include revisiting the transactions and potentially reversing or renegotiating terms. It would also disqualify the law firm from representing debtors further in the bankruptcy proceedings.S&C controversyS&C’s broader representation of FTX has generated significant controversy. Bankman-Fried claimed S&C pressured him into bankruptcy to earn legal fees in December 2022, while former FTX CTO Daniel Friedberg alleged misconduct in January 2023.Reports in 2023 indicated that S&C billed FTX approximately $70 million over five months of bankruptcy proceedings. As of April 2024, the firm has charged $170 million in cumulative fees, according to Bloomberg.The matter entered civil courts in February 2024, as former FTX investigators filed a class action suit alleging the firm aided FTX’s wrongdoing.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

AI tokens surge as whales dive in: What's next for RNDR, FET? - AMBCrypto



Whales began to accumulate AI tokens as Nvidia saw profits.
Declining network growth could impact these tokens negatively in the long run.

Interest in the AI tokens in the crypto space has grown significantly over the last few days. One of the main reasons for the surge in price for the AI tokens would be the behaviour of whales.
Whales move in
Santiment’s recent data revealed a notable increase in whale activity within the AI sector, and Render [RNDR] has been a significant part of this trend.
A prominent whale made a substantial move on the 23rd of May by transferring 4.89 million RNDR, valued at $52.1 million, to an unknown wallet. This transaction occurred amidst a period of price correction.
 
Source: Santiment
Nvidia comes to the rescue
One of the reasons for the surge in price for AI tokens such as RNDR was the success of NVDIA.
Chip-making tech giant Nvidia recently announced its Q1 earnings, revealing a record quarterly revenue of $26 billion, surpassing market expectations by 5.5%.
The rise in AI token prices coincides with investor anticipation for Nvidia’s quarterly earnings report. The success of Nvidia is perceived as the AI sector making progress. Hence, AI tokens have gained significantly after the Nvidia earnings call.
But it wasn’t just RNDR that had benefited from this. Other tokens such as Fetch.ai [FET] and Bittensor[TAO] also witnessed a massive surge in interest and surged by 20% and 5% respectively over the last week.

Read Render’s [RNDR] Price Prediction 2024-25

Even though the price of these tokens surged, there were some problems that persisted. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data indicated that the network growth for FET and RDNR fell significantly.
This meant that the number of new addresses interacting with these tokens had plummeted. If the trend continues it can cause major price corrections for these tokens in the future.

Why Dogecoin Founder Billy Markus Believes That Ethereum Will Reach $100,000 | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus (also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto) has given an interesting prediction into how high Ethereum (ETH) could rise. He made this statement while suggesting that he invested heavily in the second-largest crypto token. 
Ethereum To Rise To $100,000
In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Markus raised the possibility of Ethereum rising to $100,000, remarking that he needs the crypto token to reach this price level so he can finally purchase a house in Los Angeles. Markus’ prediction for ETH is undoubtedly one of the most ultra-bullish predictions for the crypto token and ETH reaching this price mark will be huge.

For one, Ethereum rising to $100,000 will give it a market cap of $12 trillion based on its current circulating supply. That will place the crypto token way above the most valued companies in the world based on their market cap. Meanwhile, it will also mean exponential growth for the crypto market as a whole, given that other crypto tokens like the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, will see their prices also rise significantly. 
Meanwhile, several factors will have to contribute to ETH reaching such heights. Firstly, the crypto token will have to enjoy mainstream adoption on an unprecedented level. That means that the crypto token will be widely adopted not just by retail or even institutional investors but also by different countries and their central banks.
Furthermore, the Ethereum network will have to address scalability in its entirety, as it could be a major stumbling block to its adoption. Ethereum’s development team has undoubtedly made progress, especially with the recent Decun upgrade. However, there is evidently room for more improvement if the network is to be adopted by people from all walks of life. 
In the meantime, ETH is still expected to experience significant growth, although nowhere close to $100,000, given how it has firmly established itself as the second-largest crypto token. Recent developments like the potential approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs also paint a bullish outlook for ETH. 
How High Can ETH Rise In This Bull Run?
Crypto analysts like Altcoin Daily and CrediBULL Crypto have given insights into how high Ethereum could rise in this bull run. Altcoin Daily mentioned that Ethereum’s rise to $10,000 is “programmed.” Interestingly, he alluded to the Spot Ethereum ETFs as one of the factors that will drive this price surge. 

CrediBULL Crypto gave a more bullish prediction, stating that Ethereum could hit a market peak of almost $20,000. He explained that this price target was attainable based on his belief that Bitcoin can still see a 2x increase from its current price level. 
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,790, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Ethereum Price Barely Budges After SEC Green Lights ETFs - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe price of Ethereum has has largely remained flat following the historic approval of eight spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that give investors exposure to the second-biggest digital asset by market cap.Ethereum's price hit $3,856 within minutes of the confirmed approval, per data from CoinGecko, then dipped down to $3,771. It's up to $3,825 as of this writing, but so far, the moves have been relatively minuscule.ETH is up a little more than 1% on the day, but over the past seven days, the asset is up a massive 30%.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had been quiet on the products for months, leading industry observers and analysts to expect the regulator to say no to them.But things changed this week when rumors dropped claiming that the SEC was expected to say yes to the funds. Fund managers started refiling paperwork and making amendments to important forms—signs that the products were about to be approved.And today, they got the green light. The products allow ordinary investors to buy shares that trade on a stock exchange and track the price of the digital asset.Ethereum—and other digital coins and tokens—can be daunting for traditional investors to buy, sell, and store. Popular, recognized, and regulated investment vehicles like ETFs simplify the process and allow people to get involved in the crypto world without being tech savvy.The SEC in January reluctantly gave the green light of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The historic launch of the products have led to the price of the biggest digital coin to surge as cash fast enters the space from previously excluded investors.Despite Ethereum's rise, the coin is still 22% below its November 2021 all-time high of $4,878.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Phantom Wallet Rises to Third in Apple App Store Utilities, Signaling Potential Solana Surge



                    

Phantom Wallet has achieved the third position in the utility category on the Apple App Store, trailing only behind Google and Google Chrome. 



This surge has ignited speculation among crypto enthusiasts that it could be a bullish signal for Solana’s token, as Phantom Wallet originally launched exclusively as a Solana wallet.




“Seems like the SOL season is going to be Big! What SOL coins shall I buy?” crypto entrepreneur Evan Luthra asked his 413,900 X followers on May 19.



“Phantom wallet is the 3rd top utilities app I’m so bullish on crypto and Solana,” added crypto influencer Borovik.



This comes after Phantom Wallet reached seven million monthly active users, according to an April 29 post on X.




The crypto community often views a rise in any crypto wallet’s monthly users as a sign of broader adoption.



In the overall Apple App Store, Phantom Wallet now holds the 32nd spot across all categories, behind X and the AI chatbot, ChatGPT.



Initially a Solana-only wallet, Phantom has expanded its support to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon blockchains as well.



As of this publication, Solana is trading at $174.11, marking a 25.13% increase over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap.

Crypto trader Shear suggests that if Coinbase — currently ranked 288th — and Phantom Wallet both reach the top 10 on the Apple App Store, it could indicate a market peak.



“These are my favorite indicators, I will be selling everything when they are both top 10,” Shear stated in a May 18 post.



An app’s ranking on the App Store depends on various factors, not just download numbers. 



Despite MetaMask holding the 75th position in the same category, it reported 10 million monthly active users as of February 2024.



Rankings also consider factors such as monthly uninstalls, in-app transactions, and user sentiment in reviews.



Phantom Wallet, being a self-custodial wallet, allows users to maintain control over their keys. 



This feature offers an alternative to storing assets on exchanges, a shift potentially driven by the high-profile collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, prompting users to seek more secure storage options for their crypto assets.

SEC rule approvals set stage for spot ether ETF launches - Blockworks


The Securities and Exchange Commission signed off on ether ETF proposals Thursday, bringing their potential launches one step closer.
The US securities regulator approved 19b-4 proposals submitted by the Cboe, NYSE Arca and Nasdaq exchanges “on an accelerated basis,” according to a notice posted on the agency’s website just after 5 pm ET.
Those three exchanges seek to list spot ether ETFs by VanEck, Ark Invest, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, Grayscale and Invesco. The SEC order is one step toward those planned funds hitting the market.
“After careful review, the commission finds that the proposals are consistent with the Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,” the Thursday SEC order states.
The Exchange Act is designed to “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” as well as “protect investors and the public interest,” the SEC notes.
Prior to any spot ether ETFs being able to trade, however, the SEC must also approve S-1 registration statements filed by the fund issuers. 
Industry watchers have noted the S-1 approvals could take time.
“There will be days (at a minimum), likely at least weeks, and potentially months between approval and launches here,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in a Tuesday X post. 
A winding road
Movement toward possible ether ETF approval accelerated earlier this week when Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas upped the 19b-4 approval odds from 25% to 75% — citing increased engagement between the SEC and fund groups.
The SEC had until May 23 to rule on a proposal by fund group VanEck, and until May 24 to decide on another by Ark Invest and 21Shares. Still, it was expected the regulator would approve or deny the full slate of ether ETFs before them.

Some have said the SEC’s seeming change of heart to get ether ETFs approved could be linked to recent political developments just months ahead of the presidential election. 
Read more: Politics, amendments, staking: Making sense of the ether ETF developments
To that end, the House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act on Wednesday. That same day, five congressmen penned a letter to Gensler urging the SEC to approve spot ether ETFs.   
Others interpreted the lack of SEC engagement with issuers (until the last few days) differently.
Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said in a series of March posts on X that the SEC had ironed out many details — related to custody, authorized participants and creation-redemption procedures, for example — in the lead-up to spot bitcoin ETF approvals in January.
Indeed, 21Shares co-founder Ophelia Snyder said in a March interview with Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz that because of overlap with the bitcoin and ether ETF proposals, there was “less to look at” for the SEC.
One of the main differences between spot bitcoin ETFs and the ether fund proposals, however, involved issuers looking to stake their ETH holdings.
Staking ether involves depositing ETH to help secure the Ethereum blockchain — and earning yield in exchange for doing so.
Stock exchanges and issuers amended their filings in recent days to remove language around staking — a feature of the planned funds that segment observers predicted the SEC would oppose.
Despite many increasing their odds on SEC approval of ether ETFs in recent days, questions remained around the status of ether as a security or commodity, for example.
Variant Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky noted that SEC approval of spot ether ETFs would likely mean the agency does not view unstaked ETH a security, calling such a scenario “a major policy move.”

Ethereum ETFs Approved in Abrupt SEC Policy About-Face - Decrypt

In a stunning reversal, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Thursday that it has approved eight applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, effectively green-lighting Ethereum trading on Wall Street.The following funds were approved in the filing: the converted Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, iShares Ethereum Trust, VanEck Ethereum Trust, ARK/21 Shares Ethereum ETF, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Franklin Ethereum ETF.When will the spot Ethereum ETFs begin trading? It won't be tomorrow. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart suggested in a tweet that it could be a "couple weeks" before the fund managers' S-1 documents are approved to enable trading.Just one week ago, most financial experts and crypto industry leaders had written off such an outcome as increasingly unlikely. For one, the SEC had offered little indication that it planned to move forward with any spot ETH ETF applications prior to a looming May 23 deadline.What's more, just weeks prior, a lawsuit filed by Ethereum software company Consensys against the SEC alleged that the regulator has secretly considered ETH to be an illegal, unregistered security for over a year. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) If the SEC formally labeled ETH a security, then Ethereum ETFs would need to be approved via a different process than the one currently underway. Thus, in approving spot ETH ETFs today, the SEC has tacitly conceded that ETH is not a security in and of itself. Such an outcome is a major victory for crypto advocates, given ETH’s crucial role in underpinning the Ethereum network—upon which many of the industry’s most prominent projects and services are built.  Crucially, however—in a bid to get over the finish line—several ETH ETF issuers dropped language from their applications this week regarding the staking of customer ETH. Ever since Ethereum transitioned to a proof of stake system in September 2022, ETH holders have been able to deposit their funds with the network to accrue rewards. The SEC has long taken the view that when a financial intermediary offers staking services, it is engaging in an illegally unregistered securities scheme.Spot Ethereum ETFs—unlike ETH futures ETFs, which track derivatives contracts and were approved by the SEC in October—involve issuers actually buying and storing ETH on behalf of their clients. Now that spot ETH ETFs have gained approval, traditional financial institutions and investors will soon be able to gain exposure to ETH without holding any crypto themselves. Today’s historic action follows the SEC’s approval of eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications in January. Since then, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted nearly $13 billion in net in-flows. “I always called the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, Bitcoin’s IPO,” Cody Carbone, chief policy officer at the crypto lobbying group Digital Chamber of Commerce told Decrypt. “This is ETH’s IPO. That is a massive stamp of approval.”Edited by Andrew HaywardEditor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional details.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ether (ETH) ETFs Clear Major Hurdle, Though SEC Hasn't Cleared Them for Trading Yet

"The introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs in January has already demonstrated significant benefits for the digital assets and ETF space, and we believe that spot Ether ETFs will similarly provide safeguards for U.S. investors, allowing them to gain Ether exposure in a transparent, well-regulated and easily accessible structure," he said.

Bonk Inu (BONK) Flips Floki Inu (FLOKI) Following a 15% Daily Surge: Details


																TL;DR

Solana-based meme coin Bonk Inu saw a 15% daily and 45% monthly price increase. Its market capitalization is nearing $2.5 billion, surpassing Floki Inu.
Pepe (PEPE) is another meme coin making the headlines, hitting a new all-time high after a 110% monthly ascent. Its market cap exceeded $6 billion, making it the third-largest in its cohort.


BONK Surpasses its Rival
The cryptocurrency market has been booming lately amid expectations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will give the thumbs up on Ethereum ETFs before the end of this week. Somewhat expectedly, Ethereum (ETH) is among the best performers, registering a 6% increase on a daily scale and 30% over the past month. 
However, it is not the only one well in the green, with other assets even outperforming its gains. An evident example is the Solana-based meme coin Bonk Inu, whose price jumped by 15% in the last 24 hours and 45% on a 30-day basis. The token currently hovers around the $0.00003683 mark, which is its highest level in almost three months. 
BONK’s market capitalization is inching toward $2.5 billion, surpassing Floki Inu as the fifth-largest meme coin. FLOKI has a current market cap of $2.2 billion.

BONK Market Cap, Source: CoinGecko
According to some analysts, BONK’s rally is nowhere near its end. The X user Crypto Chase claimed the asset is currently experiencing a “bullish breakout” after two months of consolidation. In their view, a potential correction could offer a great buying opportunity. 




PEPE is the Rock Star
BONK is not the only meme coin making the headlines recently, with Pepe (PEPE) claiming much of the glory. The frog-themed asset hit an all-time high on May 22 only to see that record beaten today (May 23).
It is currently worth around $0.00001438 (per CoinGecko’s data), a whopping 110% jump on a monthly scale. PEPE’s market capitalization exceeded $6 billion, making it the third-biggest meme coin and the 24th-largest cryptocurrency. 
Spiking by double digits in a short period of time is part of the meme coin’s nature. However, they can also be quite dangerous, with their infamous volatility leading to crucial losses for inexperienced traders.

SEC Approves Spot Ethereum ETFs in Landmark Decision - The Defiant

The SEC has issued an omnibus approval for eight ETH ETF issuers.Just over four months after Bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has greenlit trading of eight exchange-traded funds backed by spot Ether.The agency issued an “order granting accelerated approval of proposed rule changes, as modified by amendments thereto, to list and trade shares of ether-based exchange-traded products.”Exchanges NYSE Arca, Nasdaq and Cbose BZX Funds which applied for a rule change to list and trade ETH ETFs, received approval to trade the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust, the VanEck Ethereum Trust, the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Franklin Templeton's Franklin Ethereum ETF.The Commission said it found that the the Proposals are consistent with rules designed to “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” and, “in general, to protect investorsand the public interest.”ETH Price VolatilityIt’s been a volatile day for ETH, which has soared nearly 30% in the past week in anticipation of today’s landmark decision. The second-largest cryptocurrency traded as high as $3,960 earlier today before briefly dipping under $3,600. ETH is currently changing hands for $3,720.Ethereum ETFs will provide ETH exposure to financial institutions that want to use traditional financial rails and avoid using crypto exchanges, custody, and private keys.Ethereum bulls will hope that these new ETFs see comparable levels of interest from TradFi investors who have plowed more than $13 billion into Bitcoin ETFs to date.Before Ethereum ETFs start trading, the SEC has to approve two forms filed by applicants, 19b-4 and S-1.Today’s decision comes after a whirlwind week in which analysts’ approval odds swung from 25% to 75%. The shift left exchanges and issuers scrambling to update filings to meet the agency’s demands.

Intro to BLASTR | Bankless


Blast is currently the only Layer 2 (L2) that offers native yield via ETH staking and real world assets (RWAs).The idea? Holders of ETH and stablecoins on Blast automatically earn interest simply for holding their assets on the network. One project that’s built an interesting creator monetization avenue around this model is BLASTR, a platform that makes it easy to create and collect “unruggable” NFTs. via BLASTRThat’s because BLASTR integrates with Blast’s yield system to offer a secure and profitable environment for NFTs. Here’s how it works:Collection Setup: Creators can set up their NFT collections by defining mint prices, supply, and time lock durations. Each collection launches its own ERC721 smart contract, ensuring DIY control over funds and decisions.Minting Process: When an NFT is minted, the ETH used is locked in the smart contract for the specified duration. This ETH generates yield through Blast’s native yield system.Refundable NFTs: Post-lock period, NFTs can be refunded. If a holder opts for a refund, the NFT is burned, and the ETH is returned.Revenue Generation: Creators earn BLAST native yield from the ETH locked in their contracts, not to mention Blast Points and Blast Gold. For example, BLASTR’s calculator estimates ~22.22 ETH in yearly revenues for a 5,555 collection minted at 0.1 ETH a pop. via BLASTRThat said, collectors can also earn Points and Gold rewards by collecting NFTs on BLASTR. Simply browse the existing collections, find one whose price and benefits suit you, and then mint your desired amount. As mentioned before, the ETH you use for minting will be locked, accruing yield over time for the NFT creator. Once the lock-up period ends, you can keep your NFT or get a refund, ensuring a risk-free collecting experience. On the flip side, creating an NFT collection on BLASTR is also straightforward. It just takes a handful of steps:Initiate Your Collection: Connect your wallet on blastr.xyz/create and start a new collection by filling out the main details such as name, description, mint price, and supply.Customize: Stylize your collection with images, banners, and social media links as you see fit.  Prep Your Contract: Define your smart contract details and prepare your artwork. BLASTR has created a helpful guide on uploading art to IPFS if you need help here. Finalize: Customize your public and private minting phase settings and then press the “Deploy” button. Launch: Once deployed, your collection page will be live. Here you can edit your collection as needed or press “Launch public mint” to kick off your drop. Note, the first 5 minutes will be reserved for BLASTR Keys holders. via BLASTRLooking ahead, if BLASTR has continued success, it could inspire more platforms to adopt similar models, i.e. integrating native Blast yield into their apps. In the meantime, BLASTR’s use cases are wide open, from DAO memberships to onchain subscription services, so keep an eye on it as a novel onchain way for creators to monetize their work.

SEC approved eight Spot Ether ETFs

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has approved eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the country. In a landmark decision on Thursday evening, the financial watchdog approved 19b-4 forms for the ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton.Nvidia earnings stun the street and the stock is soaringBlackRock, Bitwise, Grayscale, Van Eck, Ark 21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin, and Invesco had previously amended their 19b-4 filings with the SEC to eliminate provisions for staking, a crypto rewards system. By doing this, these financial companies hoped to obtain approval more easily. The 19b-4 filings are documents that national exchanges like the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) submit to the SEC to request approval for listing new products on their trading platforms.The crypto industry has welcomed the SEC’s decision, hailing it as a groundbreaking development.Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink, a decentralized blockchain oracle network built on Ethereum, said in an email that the decision proves that the capital markets are now getting involved in the crypto industry.“One of the most important aspects of this ETF approval is the spotlight it places on the potential of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), which are critical use cases for Ethereum,” he said.Similarly, Paul Marino, Chief Revenue Officer at GraniteShares, said in an email that the approval from the SEC is another validation that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are real, a big part of the future of investing, and here to stay.“Those who make ‘pet rock’ statements regarding Bitcoin and others who continue to say ‘I just don’t get it’ when referring to crypto would benefit from doing some research to learn how the tokenization of assets will change what we know about investing today,” Marino said.The latest move follows the SEC approval earlier this year of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which pushed Bitcoin to an all-time high. The approval of the spot Ether ETF application is a historic moment for the crypto industry, as financial giants have been waiting for it for years.Crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital had predicted earlier in the day that there could be a potential 60% increase in the price of Ether. It suggested that Ether could surge to around $6,000 if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves spot Ethereum ETFs.Meanwhile, the crypto market didn’t jump immediately after the news. Bitcoin was down 2%, trading around $67,000, while Ether was up 1%, hovering around $3,800 on Thursday evening.The SEC’s approval follows the United States House of Representatives voting in favor of the crypto bill called “The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.” The bill would effectively classify cryptocurrency as a commodity, not a security, and therefore exempt it from securities regulations. It would also determine the oversight of cryptocurrencies and whether they should be regulated by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, it still needs to be passed by the Senate and signed into law by the president.

Ethereum ETF Proposals Clear Key SEC Hurdle in Sudden Crypto Turnaround - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission appears ready to pass eight spot Ethereum ETFs after expectations on their approval flipped overnight.
The agency just approved form 19b-4 filings from BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, Ark, Franklin Templeton and Invesco Galaxy simultaneously.










Although the products have nearly obtained the full go-ahead, the SEC must approve the firms’ S-1 registration filings before trading can begin.
Expectations on the approval of the ETFs turned on a dime when the agency reportedly changed its tune on the filings and began following procedures that preceded the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.
Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas cautions that trading for the Ethereum ETFs is likely weeks away.
“TO BE CLEAR: This does not mean they will begin trading tomorrow. This is just 19b-4 approval. Also needs to be an approval on the S-1 documents which is going to take time. We’re expecting it to take a couple weeks but could take longer. Should know more within a week or so!”
The second-largest crypto asset is up 1.5% in the last 24 hours, at $3,804.

Bitcoin Price Explosion Incoming? History Hints at $140,000 After $70,000 Breach | Cryptoglobe


                                
Historical data suggests that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) could soon explode upward to near the $140,000 mark after it recently moved strongly upward to touch the $70,000 level for the first time in a month.



Bitcoin’s surge above its 2021 peak around $69,000 has kindled speculation about its potential next move, and analysts are drawing parallels too its past bull cycles, where the cryptocurrency’s price moved sharply upward after hitting new highs.



Historically, Bitcoin has seen substantial price increases following breaches of all-time highs. After its 2013 peak of roughly $1,130, the price didn’t surpass that level until 2017, however, within three months of breaking the record, Bitcoin’s value doubled. Similarly, when the 2017 all-time high of $20,000 was eclipsed in December 2020, Bitcoin’s price doubled again within a month.



This historical trend has some analysts predicting a potential doubling of Bitcoin’s current price in the coming months to near $140,000.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The analyst noted that while the 2021 high was surpassed back in March, previous rallies also saw multi-week declines before resuming their upward trajectories. The current market seems to be mirroring this behavior, with a 23% correction in early May followed by a period of relative stability.



As reported another cryptocurrency analyst, Wily Woo, has said the price of BTC could soon see a short squeeze that would see the price of the flagship cryptocurrency moves to a new all-time high. Bitcoin, it’s worth noting, is currently very close to its all-time high, which was slightly above the $73,500 mark.



Notably, data shows that institutional investors have entered the cryptocurrency space with force, with data suggesting that deep-pocketed investors gained interest in the space after the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, leading to whales accumulating over $16 billion in BTC since.

However, ETH performed stronger, advancing 1.5% over the past 24 hours, compared to BTC's almost 3% decline during the same period. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index was down 1.6% during the day.

AI Pioneer Geoffrey Hinton Advises UK Government to Consider Universal Basic Income to Combat Job Losses



                    

Geoffrey Hinton, a prominent figure in artificial intelligence (AI) often dubbed the “Godfather of AI,” recently advised the United Kingdom’s government at Downing Street to consider adopting a universal basic income (UBI) to mitigate the anticipated job losses due to AI advancements.



Until recently, Hinton was employed at Google, working on sophisticated AI features for neural networks.




These networks form the backbone of modern generative AI systems like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.



Hinton asserts that the AI revolution will disproportionately benefit the wealthy. 



He warned that common workers and those in automatable jobs will likely lose their livelihoods, which he believes “is going to be bad for society,” as he explained in a recent BBC interview.




“I was consulted by people in Downing Street,” Hinton stated, “and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea.”



Hinton is not alone in this belief. Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI and a former student of Hinton, is also a strong advocate for UBI. 



Altman, who helped pioneer neural networks, is now known for his leadership at OpenAI and his vocal support for UBI.



Altman’s venture, Worldcoin, aims to provide UBI through a cryptocurrency token, given free to those who enroll and complete a retinal scan for identity verification.

Both Hinton and Altman believe that UBI is crucial to counter the economic disruption caused by automation. 



Additionally, they have expressed concerns about AI posing an existential threat to humanity.



Hinton left Google to openly discuss his apprehensions about AI’s future impact on society. 



Altman, on the other hand, claims that his primary motivation for co-founding OpenAI with Elon Musk and others was to ensure that advanced AI systems are developed responsibly and beneficially for humanity.



In his BBC interview, Hinton emphasized the urgency of addressing these issues, predicting that within five to 20 years, there’s a significant chance that society will face the challenge of AI attempting to assert control. 



“My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over.”

                        In a dramatic turn of events, Tigran Gambaryan, a detained executive of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, collapsed in court due to alleged ill health during his ongoing money laundering trial on May 23, as reported by Vanguard. The incident occurred at the Federal High Court in Abuja shortly after the case was called for continuation before Justice Emeka Nwite.Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen, and British-Kenyan national Nadeem Anjarwalla face charges of laundering over $35 million and engaging in specialized financial activities without a license. Both executives have pleaded not guilty.Detained Binance Executive Slumped During Trial
The courtroom drama unfolded when Gambaryan, Binance’s head of financial crimes compliance, did not immediately step forward to the dock when the case was called. Seated in the back row, he was assisted by his lawyer towards the dock but collapsed en route and had to be sat in the front row.Gambaryan’s lawyer informed the court of his client’s deteriorating health and the submission of a written application notifying the court of his condition.“My lord, the case may not certainly proceed today,” Mordi stated, explaining that Gambaryan had been indisposed and required medical attention.Since February, Gambaryan’s health issues have reportedly worsened. A letter presented to Judge Emeka Nwite highlighted that Gambaryan had broken down and received intravenous treatment for malaria the previous day. Consequently, he was also absent from a tax evasion trial held the day before.Judge Nwite ruled that Gambaryan should receive treatment at the hospital recommended by his lawyer or another designated by prison authorities. The trial has been adjourned to June 20 and 21 to allow Gambaryan’s medical treatment.The case has attracted considerable attention, especially given Nigeria’s ongoing economic challenges. The country has accused Binance of contributing to its currency woes, as Binance and other cryptocurrency platforms have become famous for trading the Nigerian naira amid severe dollar shortages and a plummeting currency.Throughout the proceedings, Gambaryan was visibly weak, leaning on the armrest of his seat. Tax Evasion Charges Against Binance
The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has filed tax evasion charges against Binance Holdings Limited and Gambaryan. Due to his absence, however, the trial could not proceed on Wednesday and has now been moved to June 14.Gambaryan, reportedly held at Kuje Prison, did not appear for his scheduled arraignment, confusing the lawyers. Justice Emeka Nwite, overseeing the case, had previously denied Gambaryan’s bail application due to new money laundering charges filed by the EFCC and deemed him a flight risk. The prosecution and defense argued over the failure to ensure Gambaryan’s presence, leading to the adjournment.Gambaryan’s absence from the arraignment session highlighted procedural issues, as his lawyer argued that the prosecution should have ensured his presence given his federal custody status.Anjarwalla, who escaped custody in March, is still involved in the case but has not been officially marked as “at large,” which could complicate proceedings since Nigerian law requires all parties to be served for the case to move forward.

                        The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just approved eight spot Ethereum ETF applications through an omnibus order on Thursday in a landmark move signaling growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance.The SEC’s decision arrived just four months after the regulator greenlit the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a rapid shift in the regulatory environment.Ethereum ETF Approvals Follow Last-Minute Scramble
The SEC granted approval for 19b-4 forms submitted by financial giants, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. Despite the initial hurdle being cleared, ETF issuers now face another: ensuring their S-1 registration statements become effective before trading can commence.Although the SEC recently initiated discussions with issuers regarding these S-1 forms, the timeline is currently uncertain. Some analysts speculate a turnaround within weeks, while others point to historical precedents exceeding three months.SEC Faces Scrutiny Over Unexpected Shift
The SEC’s decision comes as a surprise to many market observers. Previous interactions between the regulatory body and ETF issuers gave little indication of impending approvals, leading to speculation about the catalyst for this sudden shift. Some sources point to recent bipartisan pressure from House lawmakers urging the SEC to align its treatment of Ethereum ETFs with its prior acceptance of spot Bitcoin ETFs.The unexpected move has already triggered notable market reactions. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust, for example, witnessed its discount shrink from 24% to 6% as its conversion to an ETF draws nearer. The conversion allows holders to exchange shares for the equivalent cash value of the underlying Ether.While Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed huge inflows since their approval, amassing an additional 207,000 Bitcoin ($14 billion) on top of the 621,000 Bitcoin ($42 billion) already held by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust pre-conversion, whether Ethereum ETFs will receive the same level of investor interest is unclear.

SEC Approves 8 Spot Ethereum ETFs, ETH Market Rejoices


In a landmark decision, the U.S. SEC has approved eight spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity. 
This approval follows the first spot in Bitcoin ETFs, marking another milestone in the cryptocurrency market.
SEC Approves 8 Ethereum ETFs 

The SEC has given the green light to the 19b-4 forms for these ETFs. However, issuers still need approval for their S-1 registration statements, which might take weeks or months. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that this process has historically taken over three months.
The SEC’s approval was unexpected due to the lack of prior interaction with the ETF issuers. The SEC’s sudden request for the 19b-4 forms has sparked speculation about the reasons for this shift.
Some insiders suggest political pressure might have influenced this decision. Before the approval, a bipartisan group of lawmakers urged the SEC to approve these ETFs, arguing that the Bitcoin ETF approval set a precedent for Ethereum.
In response to the news of the approval, ETH’s price increased from $3,675 to $3,856. However, at the time of writing, it is now trading at $3,816.

Following this announcement, stakeholders have expressed their expectations for further industry growth. Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, commented on the spot Ethereum ETF approval.


“The Ethereum ETF approval is a second large step forward for the crypto industry. It proves that the capital markets are now getting involved in the crypto industry in earnest for some of their largest user bases and most widely used products,” Nazarov told BeInCrypto.

He also pointed out the significance of assets utilizing smart contracts being officially approved by the SEC.

“One of the most important aspects of this ETF approval is the spotlight it places on the potential of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), which are critical use cases for Ethereum. In our daily work with global banks, asset managers, and financial market infrastructures, we continue to observe increasing interest in smart contracts, the adoption of blockchain technology, and a growing interest in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class,” Nazarov added.

Analyst Predicts An "Ultra Bull" Scenario For Bitcoin That Could Send Price To $80,000


																A crypto analyst has forecasted an “ultra bull scenario” for Bitcoin, highlighting key support levels and technical patterns that suggest a price rally above $80,000 in this market cycle. 
Bitcoin Could See Upside Above $80,000
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, a crypto analyst identified as ‘CrediBullCrypto’ has doubled down on his previous prediction of an ultra-bull scenario for Bitcoin in the future. The analyst’s insights on Bitcoin’s recent activities suggest that the downside risk may be less significant than previously anticipated, paving a bullish path for a massive upside for Bitcoin. 

	Related Reading


Sharing a graphical chart of Bitcoin’s price actions from April to May 2024 in a YouTube video, Credibull Crypto predicted that Bitcoin could see its price rising above $100,000 in this projected ultra-bull scenario. The focal point of his analysis was based on the Open Interest (OI) in Bitcoin’s perpetual futures on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.
Source: X
According to the crypto analyst, Open Interest has reached 78,000 BTC, significantly higher than its baseline of 64,000 BTC. CrediBull Crypto revealed that this current Open Interest was in a danger zone. This is because the 14,000 BTC difference typically indicates elevated market activities, which often precede volatile price movements. 
Additionally, the CrediBull Crypto revealed that a single unidentified Bitcoin whale was responsible for approximately 10,000 BTC of the increased 14,000 BTC Open Interest. This means that the anonymous whale controls 70% of all the added Open Interest on Binance perpetual futures since the baseline. 
He also disclosed that in the scenario where the anonymous whale can withstand 10% to 15% downward pressure without liquidating their assets, the actual available Open Interest that would be vulnerable to a decline would be only 4,000 BTC, instead of the initial 14,000 BTC addition. The analyst revealed that out of the 4,000 BTC, some would be directional shorts, noting that the net long positions at risk would be even lower.  
Given this theory, CrediBull Crypto argued that the potential for a downside is more limited. As a result, the ultra bull scenario where Bitcoin’s price surges to new all-time highs was worth considering. 
Potential Retracement Towards $60,000
In his YouTube video, CrediBull Crypto also highlighted a potential retracement slightly above the $60,000 price mark. The analyst predicted a bearish scenario, where Bitcoin could see its price falling significantly towards $62,000 to $63,000.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading at $69,774, reflecting a 0.08% decrease in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. CrediBull Crypto disclosed that Bitcoin had failed to break through key resistance levels above $70,000. 
He predicts that consistent declines and liquidations could potentially trigger a bottom below $60,000. However, he also revealed that such a bearish turnaround was highly unlikely at this time, as Bitcoin’s price movements currently indicates an ultra bullish scenario.

XRP Golden Cross Denied, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Got Saved, Ethereum (ETH) Ready to Continue Rally?

XRP's recent performance has been under intense scrutiny, especially with its inability to break through the 50 EMA and establish a foothold above it. This situation is critical for XRP as failing to overcome this resistance level raises the risk of a further correction, potentially halting the current rally.XRP's inability to break through the 50 EMA certainly raises some concerns as, at this point in time, the asset is clearly struggling to maintain the current momentum.The 50-day Exponential Moving Average is acting as a good resistance to the price with the blue trendline. The fact that XRP struggles to float above this line adds some negativity to the mix, meaning one can read that bulls are not strong enough to hold on given the existing momentum. It has to be convincingly across this 50 EMA to have any hope of a continuation rally.XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewFurther complicating matters, the Bollinger Bands are showing absolutely no expansion right now — generally a leading indicator for rising volatility and more room for price action to develop. In fact, they are barely tight, suggesting more consolidation for the time being than any kind of clear bullish breakout.However, there is that possible watershed level around $0.53. Here, if XRP manages to cross over this level, then it could light up new buying interest. But trading should be focusing on the $0.55 and $0.61 price thresholds. These are resistance points to get past before confirming the XRP trend and nullifying the potentially bigger price correction.The Relative Strength Index is at 52.31, showing neutrality on the market. This would suggest that XRP could break either way, something that will depend on market sentiment and other extraneous factors. Levels above 70 would indicate overbought conditions, and a drop below 30 would point toward oversold conditions.Shiba Inu's promising pictureLately, Shiba Inu has been showing a lot of promise for investors, managing to hold above the 50-day exponential moving average, thereby signifying strength. This is the level of the EMA that has been acting as the support level giving birth to the current price levels, thereby filling buyers with more confidence. Worthy of focus is the fact that an ascending channel has developed, which typically signals a consolidation phase just before a breakout. This also forms a good base for bulls, with additional support from the 50 EMA. The challenges in price within this channel show that SHIB can be preparing for something more valuable on the upside if current conditions hold.Even more encouraging is that the current price action has consistency in volume. Normal volume will help the current, prevailing trend to be sustained and further make it potentially lasting. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) resides at 50.98, thus leaving some room for the price to test higher levels before it can make a top.Look for key resistance levels. SHIB, breaking above recent highs with continued momentum, will have to target much higher levels. On the other hand, holding supports above the 50 EMA will help avoid bearish reversals.Ethereum to $4,000?Ethereum remains resilient, extricating itself very slowly but surely from bears, but at this point it cannot manage to break above $3,800. Price data reflects the belief that the indication of strength emanating from the hints to the upcoming price rally is after a correction toward $3,600.The price action on Ethereum looks good for now. The ETH/USD pair has had to struggle quite a bit to the upside, finding major support around the $3,600 level. This bounce is an important move and should stamp the level as one that is key to a reaction point going forward for Ethereum investors. Trading volume has also soared, making the market even more bullish.But in terms of technicals, the moving averages are a key indicator: the 50-day moving average (in blue) is now near the 200-day moving average (in orange). Once the 50-day moves above the 200-day, it will have completed a "golden cross," a classic bullish continuation sign. The last time this golden cross took place, it was accompanied by a huge uptick in price for ETH.If Ethereum can maintain the current momentum and exceed the resistance level at $3,800, it might jump to over $4,000 in its next target. All of this is supported by increased trading volumes and general positive market sentiment.

Wells Fargo Accused of Draining Customers' Accounts Without Notice or Authorization in 'Blatant Disregard' of Consumer Loan Protections: Class-Action Lawsuit - The Daily Hodl


								A Wells Fargo customer in California just filed a proposed class-action lawsuit accusing the bank of draining customers’ accounts in blatant violation of consumer protection laws.
The plaintiff, piano teacher Helen Palma, alleges Wells Fargo unlawfully seized funds from her bank account after she fell behind on credit card payments, reports ClassAction.org.










According to the filing, the bank won a judgement against Palma for outstanding credit card debt.
But the lawsuit claims Wells Fargo then abruptly drained Palma’s checking and savings accounts without obtaining a required bank levy – allegedly violating state laws that require banks to give customers proper notice, offer a chance to file a claim of exemption as well as leave a minimum balance of $1,900 in customer’s accounts.
“In blatant disregard of these rules, Wells Fargo skipped the legal process for a bank levy, which would have prevented it from taking any money out of [the plaintiff’s] accounts, and instead unlawfully helped itself to her funds and leave [sic] her with only $102.74 to her name.”
Palma’s class action seeks to protect all residents of California who may have had their funds illegally withdrawn by Wells Fargo within the last four years.
To date, Wells Fargo has not returned the funds to Palma and has never proved that it had authorization to seize them, according to the suit.
Specifically, the lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of violating the Truth in Lending Act, Rosenthal Fair Debt Collections Practices Act and California Unfair Competition Law.

And given that it will probably soon blast above $4,000, Ethereum could easily be the best crypto to buy right now.Ethereum ETFs could start trading as soon as next week. And if demand is stronger than expected, as happened with Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, ETH could soon hit all-time highs.While Ethereum’s prospects look good right now, smaller altcoins might be a better way to express Ethereum ecosystem growth bets.Let’s take a look at some candidates for the best crypto to buy today.Best Crypto to Buy TodayPepe (PEPE)
The third-largest meme coin Pepe (PEPE) has been pumping all week traders bet it will benefit from Ethereum ecosystem growth.PEPE reached new all-time highs of nearly $0.000016 earlier today and was last up 11% at $0.00001485.The meme coin’s market cap is currently $6.26 billion, leaving plenty of room for further growth.Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have market caps of $14.4 billion and $23 billion respectively after all.Despite recent upside, Pepe could still be the best crypto to buy now.Arbitrum (ARB)
Layer-2 Ethereum scaling blockchain Arbitrum could soon see a lot more liquidity in wake of Ethereum ETF approvals.Last up 5% on Thursday, Arbitrum (ARB) is trying to set the foundations for a rebound.It was last trading near $1.20. Importantly, that leaves it above its 21 and 50DMAs, suggesting bullish momentum may be seeping into the market.Arbitrum could soon power up towards earlier yearly highs. That could mean quick 2x gains for the crypto, making it potentially the best crypto to buy today.Arbitrum could soon power up towards earlier yearly highs, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now.

Bonk (BONK) isn’t a direct beneficiary of Ethereum ecosystem growth bets, as it’s based on Solana, but it’s nonetheless pumping.That’s probably as a result of a generalized pick-up in risk appetite, which tends to lift meme coins.With a market cap of around $2.36 billion, BONK is cheap compared to some of its major meme coin competitors.As mentioned, Pepe has a market cap of around $6.3 billion and Dogwifhat of around $3 billion.Bonk could be somewhat of a value play right now. That’s why it could be the best crypto to buy now.

Top Trader Reveals ‘Obvious’ Altcoin Play Amid Potential Spot Ethereum ETF Approval - The Daily Hodl


								A top crypto trader thinks one Ethereum (ETH)-based decentralized finance (DeFi) token is an “obvious play” amid recent ETH developments.
The pseudonymous analyst known as the Flow Horse tells his 216,500 followers on the social media platform X that the governance token of Ethena (ENA) looks promising.










“Looking to go for round 2 of a shift in the pace downward and possible turnaround.”
Source: TheFlowHorse/X
The Ethena Labs project includes the yield-earning “synthetic dollar” token USDe. The project aims to create a stable and scalable form of money in the crypto space without relying on traditional banking systems.
ENA is trading at $0.848 at time of writing. The 83rd-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 15% in the past week.
The Flow Horse notes that he primarily plans to focus on Ethereum, however.
“On a real note. I already see a ton of people talking about ETH beta. Do you know what most of my ETH beta will be? Leveraged ETH.
Think of the dirt that ETH was dragged through over the last year, and how unexpected this was. There is a lot of catching up to do, this is not priced in.”
This afternoon, the SEC approved Ethereum ETF form 19b-4 filings from BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, Ark, Franklin Templeton and Invesco Galaxy.
However, the approval of the firms’ S-1 registration filings remains outstanding.
ETH is trading at $3,738 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 24% in the past seven days.

Forget Equities? Crypto Analyst Predicts Boom for Hard Assets Like Bitcoin, Gold and Silver | Cryptoglobe


                                
Popular cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe has recently suggested that so-called hard assets, including cryptocurrencies, gold, and silver, are all currently “extremely” undervalued when compared to the U.S. dollar and equities, meaning we could be on the “edge of a big bull cycle” for these assets.



In a post shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) with his over 700,000 followers, van de Poppe noted these hard assets, including commodities, are a “must-have in the portfolio” given their potential to enter this “big bull cycle.”







Notably the stock market’s benchmark index, the S&P 500, has recently hit a new all-time high after rising more than 27% in a year, while BTC also moved to a new high above $73,500 before enduring a strong correction that saw it test the $58,000 mark before recovering, to now trade at $70,000.



Meanwhile, other metals, including gold and silver, have also been surging. Earlier this month, gold topped the $2,450 mark for the first time ever, and silver moved to an 11-year high above $32 as well.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Precious metals have been boosted by growing geopolitical tensions amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas. Moreover, these hard assets saw a boost after lower-than-expected inflation data in the U.S. boosted expectations the Federal Reserve could soon start cutting its benchmark interest rate.



Gold, in particular, has been seeing growing demand from central banks throughout the world, with China driving a significant part of that demand. Aside from central banks, demand for gold in China also comes from everyday investors collecting it in the form of “beans” meant to store value.



In the cryptocurrency space, a recent surge was triggered after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.

Ethereum Price Prediction as SEC Approves Ethereum ETFs – Where is ETH Headed Next? / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Ethereum (ETH) price is trading choppy in late Thursday trade as in wake of news dropping that the US SEC has approved spot Ethereum ETFs, a spectacular u-turn that has shocked the market that, up until one week ago, was betting that Ethereum ETFs would be rejected this week.The Ethereum price was last trading around $3,800. That’s down sharply from earlier session highs near $4,000, but also up sharply from earlier session lows at $3,520.The Ethereum price has been choppy on Thursday in wake of spot Ethereum ETF approvals. Source: CoinMarketCapOn the week, the Ethereum price is up 24%. Rumors of an SEC u-turn first started on Monday.In the subsequent days, this was followed up by a flurry of engagement between ETF issuers and the SEC.All the while, traders aggressively bid up the Ethereum price on bets that ETFs will foster ecosystem growth.Everything culminated on Thursday when the SEC approved 8 spot Ethereum ETFs.Why Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Matters
Spot Ethereum ETF approvals in the US will push up the Ethereum price as institutional investors enter the market.Traders will recall Bitcoin surging to fresh record highs following spot Bitcoin ETF approvals earlier this year.Well, the Ethereum price could soon follow suit. Its current record highs are near $4,900, 28% up versus current levels.That will bring more liquidity to the Ethereum ecosystem, which should spur more adoption, activity and development.Ethereum ETFs should help solidify Ethereum’s status as the king of smart-contract-enabled blockchains.Ethereum Price Prediction – Where is ETH Headed Next?
Confirmation of the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could result in some short-term sell pressure.That would be reminiscent of what happened when spot Bitcoin ETFs garnered approval earlier this year.Some traders wait for confirmation of a positive market catalyst before taking profit.Assuming there is decent demand for Ethereum ETFs when they go live, ETH could soon go above $4,000.Uncertainty regarding Ethereum’s regulatory situation in the US prompted a lot of traders to short ETH versus other cryptos.The SEC was thought to have been campaigning to classify ETH as a security earlier this year.But now that spot Ethereum ETFs have been approved, that pretty much clears things up. ETH is a digital commodity like Bitcoin.Many shorts need to be unwound and that could be an ongoing tailwind for the market.And cryptocurrencies technicals suggest that since breaking its March to mid-May downtrend and above its 21 and 50DMAs, a retest of March highs near $4,100 is likely.The Ethereum price is likely to soon vault to the north of $4,000. Source: TradingViewthereumOnce this level goes, a quick push higher to 2021 highs near $4,900 is likely.

                        South Korean police have arrested 19 people on fraud charges in a swoop on a social media “crypto reading room.”Police think the international gang ran an “open chat room,” likely a crypto Telegram group or a KakaoTalk open chat, which pretended to offer bona fide crypto trading tips.Instead, officers said, the gang “defrauded 308 investors” out of some $18.8 million.Reading Room – ‘Crypto Fraud Gang Preyed on Victims’
Police spokespeople said some gang members posed as crypto experts in chat groups. Others pretended to be ordinary investors.These members allegedly claimed to have made money by following tips they learned in the “reading room.”Per Global Kyungjae Shinmun, the Daegu Police Agency’s criminal task force announced it had made the arrests on May 21.However, the task force thinks at least six suspects are still at large. Police said these individuals are “still overseas.”The task force said it had asked Interpol to issue red notices for all six. This would require overseas police officers to arrest the suspects on sight.Police said the group sent out invitation links to “an open chat room,” hoping to ensnare potential victims.This room, police added, was populated with gang members who claimed they had made “big profits” by following advice posted in the room.A police station in Daegu, South Korea. (Source: hyolee2 [CC BY-SA 3.0])Victims Lured onto Bogus Crypto Exchanges, Say Police
Officers explained that the gang tried to convince room members to download apps connected to crypto exchanges, where they could buy and sell unlisted coins.The group then tried to build trust by ensuring potential victims made moderate gains when they invested minimal amounts of money in these allegedly bogus platforms.In many cases, this convinced victims to increase the value of their stakes. However, when victims tried to make withdrawals from the platforms, gang members told them to pay “withdrawal fees.”When they refused, the gang members would then break off contact, police officers explained. The task force said it was trying to locate the stolen funds.‘Gang Used Pig-butchering Tactics’
Police said the gang’s ringleader used so-called “pig-butchering” recruitment tactics to increase the size of the gang.Officers said the ringleader promised several individuals employment in Myanmar. When they arrived in the country, however, the ringleader allegedly stole their passports and cell phones – and forced them to join the ring.The media outlet quoted a lawyer named Kwak Joon-ho as saying:“There has been a sharp rise in fraudulent schemes that make use of open chat rooms, including reading rooms. Perpetrators are likely to face both fraud and organized crime charges.”Earlier this week, police in Gwangju arrested 28 people on suspicion of duping about 50 crypto-keen South Koreans out of $1.3 million.

Dfinity's new API boosts Internet Computer smart contracts with cross-chain prowess

Dfinity Foundation has introduced a new API called EVM RPC to enhance cross-chain interoperability for Internet Computer (ICP)  smart contracts, according to a May 23 press statement shared with CryptoSlate.EVM RPC allows ICP smart contracts to read and write on any Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chain, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base, without relying on intermediaries. The API also supports the Bitcoin blockchain and will soon expand to Solana.This API simplifies multi-chain dApp development and eliminates the need for bridges and wrapped tokens. It allows native chain interactions and liquidity facilitation through the network API keys.Dfinity highlighted the significance of this innovation, stating:“This way, DFINITY’s Chain Fusion technology enables true multi-chain interoperability, allowing developers to write a single ICP smart contract that can custody Bitcoin, for example, and programmatically trigger sending it based on events observed on an Ethereum DeFi smart contract.”Interoperable stablecoinDfinity Foundation explained that the new API has facilitated the deployment of ckUSDC, an interoperable stablecoin pegged 1:1 to Circle’s USDC stablecoin, on the ICP network.USDC is the second-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of $32.83 billion, according to CryptoSlate’s data.The ckUSDC token, a multi-chain “twin” of USDC, leverages chain-key cryptography and ICP smart contracts that directly hold original assets. It operates similarly to ICP’s other inter-ecosystem tokens, like ckBTC and ckETH.Since its launch, ckUSDC has gained traction with notable projects such as IC Lighthouse, ICPSwap, and Helix Markets, reflecting growing demand for this type of token.Lomesh Dutta, DFINITY’s Growth President, remarked that the launch of ckUSDC and the new read/write APIs will foster further development within ICP’s ecosystem. He said:“With the addition of ckUSDC and read/write APIs, dozens of different chains can now leverage ICP smart contracts to freely interact with other networks, making the Web3 ecosystem massively more interoperable and unified.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Internet Computer StoriesLatest Alpha Market Report

US court rules crypto influencer conducted unregistered offering of crypto asset securities

the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against crypto influencer Ian Balina.The court ruled that Balina offered and sold SPRK Tokens as securities in unregistered transactions, affirming that US securities laws apply to his activities.SPRK deemed securityThe SEC’s complaint, filed on Sept. 19, 2022, alleged that Balina purchased $5 million worth of SPRK tokens from Sparkster, Ltd. in May 2018. He then allegedly organized an investment pool of about 68 individuals, to whom he offered and sold SPRK tokens without registering the offering with the SEC as mandated by federal securities laws.The SEC also claimed that Balina promoted SPRK tokens on YouTube, Telegram, and other social media platforms from May to July 2018 without disclosing a 30 percent bonus provided by Sparkster as compensation for his promotional efforts.The SEC charged Balina with violating the offering registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and with violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act for failing to disclose consideration received for his promotions.The regulator had sought partial summary judgment on the unregistered offering violation and requested a ruling that SPRK Tokens were offered and sold as securities.Alongside its charges, the SEC also issued a cease-and-desist order against Sparkster Ltd. and its CEO, Sajjad Daya. The company contributed over $35 million to a fund for harmed investors and paid various other fees and penalties.Promotion charges remainThe SEC additionally alleged that Balina promoted SPRK tokens on YouTube, Telegram, and social media between May and July 2018. He allegedly failed to disclose that Sparkster Ltd. offered him a 30% bonus on his token purchases in exchange for his promotions.The promotional charges fall under Section 17(b) of the Securities Act.Balina moved for summary judgment on both SEC claims. The court denied his requests and did not decide on Section 17(b) claims as a matter of law, leaving the promotional charges in play.Latest Alpha Market Report

Is This MEV Trading Firm Responsible For Ethereum's Drop Below $3,800?


								Ethereum is firm, trending higher, and outperforming the world’s most valuable coin, Bitcoin. Earlier today, Ethereum prices broke $3,900 before retracing sharply below $3,800 and bouncing back to spot rates.
In an attempt to explain the unexpectedly high volatility, especially with prices rapidly dropping from $3,900 and sinking below $3,800, some analysts claim that a large sell order by a Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) trading firm, Symbolic Capital Partners, might be responsible.
Ethereum Is Volatile Above $3,800: Possible Explanation
In a post on X, one crypto journalist, citing another source, said Symbolic Capital Partners offloaded 6,968 ETH, worth over $27 million, with an average selling price of $3,930 in one minute. Notably, one of these transactions involved selling 3,497 ETH simultaneously, with a “high bribe fee” of 90 ETH. 
While the exact motive behind this bulk dump remains unclear, their action seemed to have impacted prices, causing volatility.

At spot rates, Ethereum is up 30% from May 2024 lows. Technically, the uptrend remains as long as prices are trading above $3,700. On May 20, ETH prices broke above $3,300 and $3,700. These were two key resistance levels that are now supported.

As long as prices trend above $3,700, bulls might have a foundation for another leg up, taking them to March highs of around $4,100.
Even with ETH volatility being high, overall sentiment remains positive. One analyst on X notes that over the past three weeks, open interest in Ethereum futures across multiple exchanges, like Binance, OKX, and even Bybit, rose to over $4.6 billion.

Open interest is a metric that shows the number of open leveraged positions, long or short. When the number increases, traders are confident in the coin’s prospects.
Spot ETH ETF Fueling Interest
So far, the excitement about Ethereum is related to the positive progress in approving spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). When writing, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been actively communicating with potential issuers. Changes have been requested, particularly concerning ETH staking.
Some analysts believe the lack of staking capabilities for spot Ethereum ETFs is positive overall. In a post on X, the analyst argued that if spot Ethereum ETF issuers are allowed to stake, yields will drop, reducing returns for solo stakers. This, in turn, will make individual staking less attractive, impacting network decentralization.

U.S. Authorities Arrest Two in $73 Million Crypto Money Laundering Scheme



                    

U.S. authorities have apprehended two individuals accused of orchestrating a significant money laundering operation. 



This scheme allegedly funneled over $73 million through American financial institutions, ultimately converting the funds into the cryptocurrency Tether (USDT).




The U.S. Justice Department reported that Daren Li was arrested at Atlanta’s airport in Georgia on April 12, while Yicheng Zhang was taken into custody in Los Angeles on May 16. 



The indictment against the pair, unsealed in a California court on May 16, details their purported involvement in the scheme.



Li, Zhang, and their associates are accused of managing an international criminal network that laundered millions of dollars from “pig butchering” crypto scams. 




In these scams, fraudsters build victims’ trust, persuade them to invest large sums, and then abscond with the money.



The defendants allegedly directed accomplices to open U.S. bank accounts under shell company names. 



Victims were tricked into transferring millions into these accounts, which were then used to launder the illicit proceeds.



The DOJ explained that the money was dispersed to various domestic and international accounts, stating:




“The fraud scheme involved more than $73 million laundered through U.S. financial institutions to bank accounts in the Bahamas and converted to the virtual asset USDT, or Tether. 



“A cryptocurrency wallet involved in the scheme received more than $341 million in virtual assets.”



Li and Zhang face charges of conspiring to launder money and six counts of international money laundering. 



If convicted, they each could face up to 20 years in prison for each count, amounting to a potential total of 140 years.

Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco recognized the challenges posed by cryptocurrency fraud but emphasized the commitment to hold offenders accountable.



Pig butchering scams have become increasingly profitable for cybercriminals. 



In November 2023, the DOJ seized $9 million from a similar scheme that victimized over 70 Americans. 



The rising frequency and severity of such scams have alarmed lawmakers and regulators.



Regulators have intensified efforts to combat crypto scams, as seen in new regulations and industry guidelines. 



While these measures aim to protect investors and safeguard digital assets, some fear they may hinder the sector’s growth.

Ethereum ETFs Approved by the SEC? Yes-But Don't Bet On It - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsNow that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs, another crypto battle erupted over what “approved” actually means.That was the debate raging on Polymarkets, at least, after crypto degens bet over $13 million that the SEC would approve a spot Ethereum ETF by May 31.The open wager went live on January 9 as anticipation of the SEC approval for the first Bitcoin ETFs reached a fever pitch. The fundamental question driving any potential Ethereum ETF approval was whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity—and whether Bitcoin had cleared the path for Ethereum to follow.Financial analysts and crypto commentators regularly weighed in with their predictions, which grew increasingly pessimistic amid aggressive moves by the SEC against other crypto projects. As a May deadline solidified for a decision, some proposed that a delay would actually be a good thing. Last month, JP Morgan put the odds of approval at 50%.Polymarket users bet on the question, “Ethereum ETF approved by May 31?” Image: PolymarketBut last week, the mood started to shift: Coinbase opined that an Ethereum ETF would become reality last week, and when two Bloomberg ETF analysts revised their own odds of approval from 25% to 75% on Monday, the price of ETH started to soar.Polymarket bettors were also watching closely. The collective odds of SEC approval shot up from 13% to over 50% on the site on Monday. When the SEC announced Thursday that it was approving applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, optimistic wagerers were jubilant. Surely the answer to whether an Ethereum ETF would be approved before May 31 was "yes"?Not so fast, many argued.“Too bad they didn’t define the terms of the actual bet, there was $11M at play,” Twitter user Observoor wrote. “I checked this afternoon and thought, ‘This doesn’t even define what ETF approval means…it’ll end in a big fight.’”Technically, the SEC had approved rule changes allowing major investment firms like Grayscale, BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck to proceed with submitted and amended plans to offer spot Ethereum ETFs. But those specific funds have not yet been approved, a process that could take more than a week—and push past the May 31 Polymarket deadline.With some calling the bet "rigged," nearly 1,000 comments were posted to the event page.“Let's be real: lots of people got overconfident that the SEC would deny and are now crying foul that the SEC did a U-turn and rugged them,” a Polymarket user wrote. “ETH ETF approved... [by] consensus of credible reporting.”“The best resolution would be to make it a 50/50 split and clarify that the rules were not sufficient to select a clear winner,” another Polymarket user proposed.On the other hand, the wording of the SEC decision was clear: “This order approves the proposals on an accelerated basis.”“For all you who have no shares and are salty: bring the rules of the market and polymarket's resolution to ANY SAT/GMAT verbal professor and see what they say. Hint: everyone will agree with Polymarket because it's basic reading comprehension,” a Polymarket user wrote.Polymarket users were given a chance to dispute the outcome of the bet, but by 8:18 p.m. ET, the yes vote had been solidified. For many, the simplest answer was always the best answer.“I’m just an investor in Polymarket and general prediction market lover, so have zero impact here on final resolution,” Polymarket investor Nick Tomaino wrote on Twitter. “But in my opinion, for a prediction market platform to succeed long-term it’s important to resolve according to the spirit of the market. Otherwise, the masses won’t trust it.”With the big bet settled, the broader crypto market simply carried on. The price of Ethereum barely budged upon news of the approvals, although it is up nearly 30 perccent for the week, spiking to $3,937 intraday and trading at $3,819 as of this writing.Launched in 2020, Polymarket is a blockchain-based prediction market platform that allows users to stake tokens and earn on the outcome of current events like elections, sports, and current events. Earlier this month, Polymarket announced raising $70 million with funding participants, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Donald Trump's Presidential Campaign Now Accepting Donations In Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, XRP, Ethereum, Among Others | Bitcoinist.com


								In a strategic move, former United States President, Donald J. Trump has announced that his presidential campaign will be accepting donations in various cryptocurrencies. Supporters of the Trump campaign can now contribute using popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) becoming accepted.
Trump Campaign Embraces Bitcoin And Dogecoin Donations
In an official statement released on May 21, Trump’s presidential campaign announced the launch of an official fundraising page where federally permissible donors can contribute to the campaign using cryptocurrencies. The statement disclosed that only cryptocurrencies accepted through Coinbase Commerce products can be donated.

Trump’s new decision to embrace crypto donations is seen as a strategic and political move that is set to significantly transform how supporters can contribute to the campaign in anticipation of the forthcoming election on November 5. Additionally, it would also make the Trump Campaign the first ever major party Presidential nominee to embrace cryptocurrencies for donations. 
Some of the products supporters can use to make donations include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, XRP, DAI, Tether USD, and numerous other cryptocurrencies. This development is a positive step forward for the crypto industry, as it encourages greater recognition and adoption of digital currencies for real-world applications. 
Additionally, it underscores the rising mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, positioning the Trump campaign at the forefront of modern financial trends and signaling the former US President’s support of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. 
Trump’s Surrogate, Vivek Ramaswamy, also disclosed in an interview with Fox Business News that cryptocurrencies currently symbolize an alternative financial service from a financial system that has been corrupted by the Federal Reserve (FED) for the last 20 years. 
He disclosed that cryptocurrencies serve as an “opt-out” that holds fiat currencies, especially the United States Dollar (USD), accountable and encourages greater transparency and responsibility in financial systems. 
Political Implications For Trump’s Crypto Support
In the official statement, the Trump Campaign emphasized the former US President’s continuous efforts to reduce government regulations and promote innovation in the financial sector. 
Recently, Trump has emerged as an advocate for cryptocurrencies despite his earlier aversion to these digital assets. The campaign disclosed that the former US President was currently working towards minimizing the government’s influence on financial decision-making. 

Additionally, Ramaswamy also revealed in the aforementioned interview that Trump was strongly opposed to the Federal Reserve’s development of a Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC), highlighting the financial limitations and privacy risks these assets would have on US citizens. 
The campaign also highlighted Senator Elizabeth Warren’s negative stance on cryptocurrency, noting her intention to create an anti-crypto army to impose more regulatory restrictions on the developing industry. In response, the Trump Campaign has suggested that they will establish a crypto army of their own to back Trump’s election bid, leveraging cryptocurrencies as a symbol for financial freedom.

Solana ETFs Next? Spot Ether Approval Paves Way for Broader Recognition, Analysts Say | Cryptoglobe


                                
The potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States has helped boot the cryptocurrency market significantly and is a significant step forward in cryptocurrency regulation, according to brokerage firm Bernstein, which suggested that Solana ($SOL) exchange-traded funds could follow.



According to a recent research report from the brokerage firm, which comes ahead of an expected spot Ether ETF application from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), similar treatment could come to other cryptocurrencies.



In the report, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra noted the see the potential approval as a sign of softening regulatory stance, possibly influenced by the upcoming November elections, adding bey believe that if Donal Trump is elected “crypto could see significant legislative and agency support” with a shift to the SEC’s leadership.



More immediately, the report highlights the potential precedent set by a spot Ether ETF as it would mark the first time a non-Bitcoin blockchain asset is classified as a commodity, potentially opening the door for similar treatment of Ethereum’s rivals, particularly Solana.



Notably, CNBC “Fast Money” trader Brian Kelly has also suggested that a spot Solana ETf could follow, saying that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana “are probably the big three for this cycle.”







He added that Robinhood and Coinbase now have “some clarity on what a security is and what a security isn’t,” suggesting these two firms are the largest beneficiaries from regulatory clarity.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Bernstein predicts a price surge for Ether similar to the 75% increase witnessed by Bitcoin after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, while earlier this week the price of ETH already surged over 20% as optimism surrounding the potential approval of these funds grew.



The report cites Ether’s free float and supply as particularly attractive – with 38% locked in staking and decentralized finance protocols, and a significant portion of the supply remaining inactive for over a year.



As reported, the number of small ETH  investors, those holding 10 ETH or less (around $37,500), has recently climbed to a new all-time high while larger investors are seemingly still lagging behind after divesting most of their funds over the last few months.



According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, smaller Ethereum wallets hits a new all-time high of 121.74 million after the recent ETH price surge, while those holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH  – between $37,500 and $37.5 million – are still down around 5.8% this year.



Notably larger whales, those that have over $37.5 million worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in their wallets, are down 10.6% in terms of total holdings after divesting of their ETH over the last few months.

Courtroom Drama: Binance Executive Collapses During Nigerian Trial Due To Alleged Illness | Bitcoinist.com


								In a surprising turn, Tigran Gambaryan, a detained executive from the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, collapsed during a court session at the Federal High Court in Abuja, Nigeria. 
Gambaryan, facing money laundering charges, experienced a health episode that intensified the complex legal battle between Binance and Nigerian authorities.
Trial Of Binance Executive Takes Unexpected Turn
As the trial was about to resume before Justice Emeka Nwite, Gambaryan remained seated instead of stepping forward to the dock when called by the court registrar. 

A lawyer from the defense team, sitting beside Gambaryan, assisted him in walking towards the dock. However, as they made their way, Gambaryan fell, prompting the lawyer to help him sit in the front-row seat.
Gambaryan’s attorney, Mark Mordi, informed the court that his client was “indisposed” and had filed a written request to inform the court of his condition. Mordi explained that due to Gambaryan’s health problems, the trial could not proceed that day.
On May 16, Justice Nwite denied Gambaryan’s bail application, citing concerns that the defendant might flee if released. As a result, Gambaryan has been remanded at the Kuje Correctional Centre.
Trial Has Rescheduled For June 
The ongoing legal troubles faced by Binance in Nigeria are part of a broader crackdown by the government on the cryptocurrency platform. 
Nigerian authorities have accused Binance of facilitating illicit funds transfers totaling over $26 billion without proper oversight. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has further alleged that Binance engaged in tax evasion, currency speculation, and money laundering, amounting to $35.4 million.

Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance’s former regional manager for Africa, was also charged alongside Gambaryan. However, in March, Anjarwalla managed to escape from the custody of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser. He was subsequently traced to Kenya, where local authorities reportedly arrested him.
Amidst the legal battle, Judge Nwite ruled that Gambaryan should receive medical treatment at the hospital recommended by his lawyer or as suggested by prison authorities. The trial is now set to continue on June 20 and 21.

The native token of the exchange, Binance Coin (BNB), is trading at $597, reflecting a 4% decline in price over the past 24 hours. This downward movement aligns with the broader market correction triggered by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the leading cryptocurrencies.
On Tuesday, BNB, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reached a two-month high of $632. However, it failed to attempt a retest of its yearly high of $644, achieved on March 14, and its all-time high of $686, recorded during the bullish market phase of 2021.

Analyst Says "Only A Matter Of Time" Before Bitcoin Flies Past ATH


																An analyst explained how Bitcoin’s availability for trading has quietly declined during the asset’s recent consolidation phase.
Bitcoin May Be In A Good Position To Set New All-Time Highs
In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo discusses the recent trend in the Bitcoin inventory sitting on centralized exchange platforms.

	Related Reading


The chart below shows how the spot and paper BTC reserves have changed over the past few years.
Looks like both of these metrics have registered a decline recently | Source: @woonomic on X
As the graph shows, the Bitcoin sitting in spot wallets has been declining over the last couple of months. The total amount of such BTC in the custody of central entities has now dropped to just 2.3 million.
It’s also apparent that the total sum of the spot and “paper” BTC (highlighted in purple) has declined at the same time. Paper BTC here refers to derivatives products related to cryptocurrency that don’t actually require investors to own the asset.
Thus, given that the combined sum of the exchange inventory has gone down for the cryptocurrency, it would appear that the decrease in the spot BTC isn’t because paper BTC has replaced it.
Generally, the supply of exchanges is considered part of the Bitcoin supply, which is “available” for trading. As such, due to how supply-demand dynamics work, less of this available supply may be a constructive sign for the cryptocurrency.
From the graph, it’s visible that this decline in the exchange inventory has come during a period where the price of the cryptocurrency has struggled after setting a new all-time high (ATH). As Woo notes,
While everyone was freaking out that Bitcoin price was not rising the last 2 months, available BTC was quietly being scooped up, and importantly without paper BTC printed in its place.
Thus, the fact that the available supply has gone down during such a period could be a bullish sign for the coin. “It’s only a matter of time before BTC squeezes past all-time highs,” says the analyst.

In another X post, Woo also discussed how capital inflows into Bitcoin have just started to pick up again after registering a steep drop earlier.

As the chart shows, network inflows spiked alongside the all-time high, but they observed a major slowdown in the consolidation that followed.
The inflows from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), highlighted in light green, also disappeared earlier, but they have now made a comeback alongside these fresh capital inflows.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had recovered as high as $71,000 earlier but appears to have slipped off over the last few days as it has now returned below the $68,000 level.

Puell Multiple Says Bitcoin Is Trading At A 'Discount' Now


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has dipped into the “undervalued” territory for the first time in more than a year.
Bitcoin Puell Multiple Has Observed A Plunge Recently
As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post pointed out, the BTC Puell Multiple has fallen recently. The Puell Multiple refers to an on-chain indicator that tracks the ratio between Bitcoin miners’ daily revenue and the 365-day moving average (MA).
Miners earn their income through two means: block rewards and transaction fees. The former is what they receive as compensation for adding a block on the network, while the latter is a payment they get through all the individual transactions part of the block.
In the context of the Puell Multiple, though, only the block reward is included in the miners’ revenue. The block rewards almost always remain fixed in terms of BTC value, so the only variable related to them is the USD value of the rewards.

As such, the indicator measures revenue in USD. Thus, there is a connection between the cryptocurrency’s price (which guides the block reward’s value) and the Puell Multiple.
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the miners have earned more than the average for the past year. In such a condition, the price of the asset may be considered overvalued.
On the other hand, the indicator is lower than this threshold, suggesting that miners are currently making less than usual. Naturally, the coin may be considered undervalued when this happens.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day MA Bitcoin Puell Multiple over the past few years:

The value of the metric appears to have taken a plunge in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant
The graph shows that the 7-day MA of the Bitcoin Puell Multiple was at relatively high levels earlier when the rally toward the new all-time high occurred.
Recently, though, the indicator’s value has plunged sharply. At the same time, however, cryptocurrency’s price has been consolidating sideways.
So, what has changed miner revenues if the price hasn’t dropped? As mentioned before, block rewards almost always remain constant. Almost. The one exception is the Halving event, which occurs approximately every four years.
During this event, the asset’s block rewards are permanently slashed in half. The latest Halving occurred last month, so the Puell Multiple has registered such a steep drop.

With this drawdown, the indicator’s 7-day MA is now below 1. “Investors may interpret the fall in the Puell Multiple as a sign that the market is adjusting to a new phase of scarcity, potentially preparing for a rally,” says the quant.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,800, up 5% over the past week.

Ethereum Classic, Often Considered A Cheaper Play, Outshines ETH On Spot ETF Approval Day: What's Going On? - Benzinga

On a day when the first-ever Ethereum ETH/USD spot ETFs have been approved in the U.S., Ethereum Classic ETC/USD seems to be stealing the spotlight from its sister chain.What Happened: Ethereum Classic racked up gains of nearly 9% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro, positioning itself as the marker's second-best performer. Counterintuitively, Ethereum was trading at just a 1.56% premium, despite a major bullish trigger in the form of its spot ETFs approval by the SEC earlier today. ETC's trading volume also swelled, more than tripling in the last 24 hours to over $1.5 billion. Ethereum’s volume increased by only 85% in contrast, although overall volumes remained much larger because of the higher market cap.ETC's current performance was reminiscent of its moves following Bitcoin BTC/USD spot ETF approvals earlier this year.Why It Matters: The original Ethereum Chain was split into two separate blockchains back in 2016 over disagreements within the community following a hack. The newer chain inherited the name Ethereum as we know it, with ETH as its token, while the immutable original chain was renamed Ethereum Classic, with ETC as a token.Ethereum Classic was created as a hard fork of the original Ethereum chain back in 2016 over disagreements within the community following a hack. The new chain inherited the name Ethereum as we know it, while the original one functions as Ethereum Classic.While fundamentally different from each other, a lot of retail investors perceive ETC to be a cheaper alternative to ETH. ETH's market cap of $4.84 billion was a fraction of Ethereum's whopping $454 billion valuation.A widely-followed X user Eugene Ng Ah Sio, recently picked ETC as the beta for Ethereum owing to specific advantages like less inflation, no unlocks, and a halving which was due in a week. Photo Courtesy: Shutterstock.comPrice Action: At the time of writing, ETC was trading at $32.86, up 8.85% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Bitcoin, Dogecoin Dip, Ethereum Shows Momentum On Approval Of Ether Spot ETFs, Analyst Expresses Confidence In King Crypto’s Rebound

Gold Rush: Private Investors and China's Central Bank Drive Record Price Surge | Cryptoglobe


                                
Gold market analyst Jan Nieuwenhuijs has recently examined the state of the precious metal market, revealing a significant surge in gold prices owes much to the dual engines of demand: the private market and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).



According to Nieuwenhuijs, the Chinese private sector’s gold imports accounted for 543 tons in the first quarter of the year, a figure that was built upon by the country’s central bank, which added 189 tons to its reserves over the same period.



Private gold demand in the country represents a start 74% increase from the last quarter of 2023, while the People’s Bank of China’s accumulation rose 38% from the preceding quarter.



Both of these factors helped the price of the precious metal hit a new all-time high and surpass the $2,450 mark for the first time in history, before enduring a slight correction to now trade at $2,340.

Data shows that gold demand from central banks in the first quarter of the year was of 290 tons, with the People’s Bank of Chia making up for the majority of that figure as it boosted its reserves to 5,542 tons according to the analyst.



These acquisitions, according to analysts, are being made as China moves away from its U.S. debt holdings in a bid to be less reliant on fiat currency foreign reserves after the European Union blocked €200 billion ($around $216 billion) worth of Russian central bank assets after the country launched its invasion of Ukraine.



Private demand for gold in the country, according to the New York Times, is coming from consumers who have been buying and collecting small “gold beans” as an affordable way to invest in the precious metal.



In China the precious metal has been an attractive investment alternative amid a slump in traditional options like real estate and equities. The analyst wrote:



The Chinese public, which doesn’t have many investment options due to capital controls, will continue to invest in gold and support the price.



Nieuwenhuijs predicts that the gold market will remain red-hot, citing reports that Beijing has recently sold $53 billion worth of US Treasuries and agency bonds in a move that will further strengthen gold as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical tensions.

Failure to Present Binance Executive for Arraignment: FIRS Shifts Blame to Correctional Service


																The Nigerian Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has pointed fingers at the Nigerian Correctional Service for failing to produce detained Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan at the Federal High Court in Abuja on tax evasion charges.
Reportedly, Gambaryan was a no-show in court on May 22, slated for arraignment on tax evasion accusations by the FIRS.
FIRS Points Finger at Correctional Service
In March 2024, Binance and its executives faced four counts of tax evasion each, as charged by the tax authority. Gambaryan was then moved to Abuja’s Kuje Correctional Centre in April after pleading not guilty to money laundering charges filed by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission and seeking bail. The Binance exec was denied bail and remains in custody.
During court proceedings on Wednesday, prosecution counsel Moses Idehu expressed confusion about Gambaryan’s absence and mentioned several instances of unsuccessful attempts to reach the correctional center. He also requested a brief delay in the case to address the matter later that day.
Meanwhile, Gambaryan’s lawyer, Chukwuka Ikwuazo, asked the judge to tell FIRS to take another detained Binance exec Nadeem Anjarwalla’s name off the new charges because he’s been declared “at large.” The FIRS lawyer also agreed to remove Anjarwalla’s name from the charges.




Both Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were arrested during a public inquiry and were charged with involvement in Nigeria’s economic problems and funding terrorism. The duo were transferred to a secure facility after their passports were seized.
Dangerous Precedent
While advocating for the release of Gambaryan, who was head of Binance’s Financial Crime Compliance team, the CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange, Richard Teng said that the move by the Nigerian authorities has set a “dangerous” new precedent for all companies across the world.
Teng had also added that Gambaryan’s visit to Nigeria was not for decision-making or negotiations but solely to provide expertise in financial crime, participating in policy discussions, and capacity building. Despite repeated assurances from Nigerian authorities for safe passage, the arrests were still made.
Subsequently, Gambaryan was held at Nigeria’s Kuje prison, which gained notoriety after an Islamic State attack in July 2022 as part of a jailbreak. It has even housed several prominent inmates, including the former central bank governor, Godwin Emefiele.

Ethereum Spot ETF's Approval Highlights Its 'World Of Warcraft' Origins: Created Because A Character Had Its 'Warlock Powers Nerfed' - Benzinga

The cryptocurrency industry might be celebrating the greenlighting of the first-ever spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs in the U.S., but very few of them might be aware of the amusing origin story of the world's second-largest digital asset project. What Happened: Ethereum's creator and one of the poster boys of the industry, Vitalik Buterin, has been a lifelong advocate of decentralized systems—the technology forming the basis of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. But as eccentric or funny as it may sound, his closeness with the narrative began in his school days, when he was a passionate World of Warcraft gamer. Trung Phan, who co-hosts the Not Investment Advice podcast and authors the SatPost newsletter, posted on X, formerly Twitter, about the events from those days."I happily played world of warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's siphon life spell," Buterin wrote. This very event proved to be the turning point in his career. "I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit."Why It Matters: This incident may appear frivolous, but there's no denying the fact that it unintentionally paved the way for one of the most disruptive technologies in the world.Ethereum today is one of the world's most-invested projects, with a total locked value of more than $65 billion, according to DeFiLlama. Furthermore, it is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market cap higher than top-tier public companies like Mastercard and Oracle.Earlier today, it reached a new milestone after getting approval to list its spot ETFs in the U.S., the world's largest financial market.While Ethereum may continue to increase its footprints in the near future, it won't be surprising to see the World of Warcraft story getting a legend status within the industry. Price Action: At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,800.76, following a 1% increase in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Photo by Kanchanara on UnsplashRead Next: Ethereum Classic, Often Considered A Cheaper Play, Outshines ETH On Spot ETF Approval Day: What’s Going On?

All Spot Ethereum ETFs Officially Approved



	

Key Points:




US SEC approves Spot Ethereum ETFs.



Approval expands institutional access to Ethereum.



Issuers await clearance for Ether-based ETFs.




The SEC has approved the issuance of Spot Ethereum ETFs, expanding access to the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Several issuers await clearance of their individual filings.





The US Securities and Exchange Commission has cleared the path to allow the issuance of Spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), a major development in the nation’s crypto landscape. The decision arrives within five months of the SEC’s clearance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs.



SEC Approves All Spot Ethereum ETFs



Spot Ethereum ETFs stand as the second crypto-based ETF cleared by the SEC, paving the way for expanded access to the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization for institutions.



Watcher.Guru recently reported that BlackRock’s Spot Ethereum ETF has been registered with the DTCC under the ticker ETHA.






Although the initial decision was to put off the approval due to the earlier negative sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, the SEC has expanded the ETF market to include both Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, issuers would need to wait for the clearance of their individual filings.



The market was expecting the introduction of another cryptocurrency following the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs at the start of 2024. Predictions were most pegged on Ethereum. However, the overall sentiment of the SEC dampened such optimism.



Impact of SEC’s Decision on Crypto Market



In mid-May, a surprise move by Bloomberg shifted the approval odds from 25% to 75%. The market began readying itself for the introduction of an Ethereum-based investment product.



The approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC now means the United States hosts crypto-based ETFs for the two largest digital assets worldwide. The move greatly impacts reshaping the nation’s stance on such assets.





Several issuers, including VanEck, ARK21 Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and BlackRock, have applied for the listing of Ether-based ETFs. Among these, VanEck is facing the most imminent deadline for approval.

Ethereum’s Potential Market Trajectory



The issuers now only await the clearance of their S-1 forms after the SEC has approved the Ethereum ETF 19b-4 forms. The SEC may require more time to process each filer, especially if the regulator retains any skepticism towards the Ethereum ETFs.



The effect these developments will have on the markets remains to be seen. In the three months after Bitcoin’s listing, the asset would go on to realize an all-time high. 




Many have said that Ethereum will follow the same trajectory, as the ETF anticipation has already propelled the asset nearly 30% over the last week.

Spot Ethereum ETF Decision Approved Is Not By SEC Chair - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets approved spot Ethereum ETFs for several major financial firms.



Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that the spot Ethereum ETF decision using delegated authority is standard practice.




The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Division of Trading and Markets has approved a series of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from prominent financial firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton.





Spot Ethereum ETF Decision Made Using Delegated Authority



The spot Ethereum ETF decision, outlined in an order approving 19b-4 forms, was made by the division rather than the SEC’s commissioners.



The order clarifies that the approval was granted “by the Division of Trading and Markets, pursuant to delegated authority,” indicating that SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the four other commissioners did not directly vote on this matter. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that using delegated authority for such spot Ethereum ETF decisions is standard practice, explaining that requiring a formal vote for every decision would be impractical.



This procedural approach contrasts with the approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, which involved a formal vote by the commissioners. In that instance, Gensler and Republican Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda voted in favor, while Democratic Commissioners Jaime Lizárraga and Caroline Crenshaw opposed. The SEC has stated it will not comment further on the Ethereum ETFs beyond the issued order.




Regulatory Uncertainty Surrounds Ether’s Classification as a Security



The approval of these ETFs may have broader policy implications. SEC Chair Gensler has not clearly defined whether Ether is a security, raising concerns among crypto enthusiasts about the regulatory future for Ethereum and related projects. A critical issue is staking, which involves earning rewards for participating in network validation and has led to debates about Ether’s classification as a security. Last year, the SEC accused Coinbase of violating securities laws by offering staking services.



In contrast, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees derivatives, does not view Ether as a security and has permitted trading in Ether futures by CME Group for several years.

Will Crypto Markets March Higher When $1.4B Bitcoin Options Expire?


																Crypto markets have largely held on to gains this week, buoyed by Ethereum and the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of spot exchange-traded funds.
However, around $1.4 billion in notional value Bitcoin options contacts will expire on May 24.
The 21,000 contract expiry is a relatively small event compared to the month-end May 31 expiry which will see a whopping $4.3 billion worth of options expire, according to Deribit.
Bitcoin Options Expiry
The put/call ratio for this week’s Bitcoin options contracts is 0.88, which means that long and short-contract sellers are relatively evenly matched with slightly more calls expiring. The max pain point, or the price at which most option contract buyers lose their premium, is $67,000.
The longs are also dominating in open interest (OI) with around $830 million at the $70,000 strike price. Higher strike prices also have a lot of OI, with around $843 million at $100,000, according to Deribit.




The $60,000 strike price has the highest amount of OI for put contracts with $388 million. Open interest refers to the number or value of contracts that have yet to be settled, so the bulls expect much higher BTC prices.

In addition to today’s Bitcoin options there are around 354,000 Ethereum contracts expiring today. These have a notional value of $1.5 billion and a put/call ratio of 0.57 with more calls expiring than puts.
Derivatives traders have been speculating on ETH in the run-up to the long-awaited SEC deadline. There is around $515 million in OI at the $4,000 strike price as bulls expect more momentum.
“BTC pulled back as expected, compared to the very strong support for ETH’s price, with ETH’s current weekly weighted IV still exceeding 100%, while BTC’s current weekly IV is only 50%,” commented crypto derivatives software provider Greeks Live.
Crypto Market Impact
Almost $3 billion in BTC and ETH options will expire today, but the impact on spot markets is usually muted. Total capitalization has dropped 1.3% to $2.68 trillion, primarily due to a 2.3% dip in Bitcoin prices as the asset fell to $67,400 at the time of writing.
Ethereum faced tons of volatility ahead of yesterday’s decision but now stands calmly at $3,730.
The altcoins were a mixed bag with gains for Chainlink (LINK), PEPE, and Ethereum Classic (ETC), but losses for Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Toncoin (TON).

                        Newly-approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could potentially hit the market by mid-June.Following the successful 19b-4 filings for spot Ether ETFs, which allow them to be listed on exchanges, the next step is to obtain approved S-1 registration statements before trading can commence.Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart predicts that the S-1 approvals could be granted in a “couple of weeks,” although he acknowledges that the process may take longer, typically spanning up to five months.However, fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes that a mid-June launch is certainly possible.Balchunas expects a single round of comments to the S-1 amendments, similar to the feedback provided for spot Bitcoin ETF applicants, which could facilitate a quicker approval timeline.VanEck Files Amended S-1
VanEck, one of the applicants, wasted no time and filed its amended S-1 shortly after receiving approval for the 19b-4 filings. Other applicants are anticipated to follow suit in the near future.However, Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, points out that the SEC’s approval was granted by its Division of Trading and Markets unit under delegated authority. He suggests that one of the five SEC Commissioners could challenge the decision within the next 10 days.Nevertheless, digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare believes that such a challenge is unlikely, stating that passing it through the trading and markets division indicates no opposition from the Commissioners.Regarding market expectations, Seyffart predicts that spot Ether ETFs could attract approximately 20% of the flows that spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen.On the other hand, Balchunas offers a more conservative estimate of 10-15%.Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs approximately four and a half months ago, they have accumulated $13.3 billion in net inflows, according to Farside Investors.Even capturing 20% of that figure would result in spot Ether ETFs amassing a combined $2.66 billion in inflows over a similar timeframe.Grayscale Ethereum Trust Could See Outflows
However, concerns have arisen around potential outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust if investors shift their holdings to spot Ether ETFs, mirroring the outflows witnessed with the conversion of Grayscale’s Bitcoin investment product.The Grayscale Ethereum Trust currently holds over $11.3 billion in assets, as reported by Arkham Intelligence.On May 23, regulatory approval was granted to eight applicants, including VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Bitwise, and Invesco Galaxy.One ETF issuer, Hashdex, did not receive approval on that particular day, standing as the exception.As reported, Singapore-based QCP Capital believes the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States could potentially trigger a substantial rally of up to 60% in the price of ETH.QCP Capital pointed out that when spot bitcoin ETFs were approved in January, Bitcoin experienced a significant surge from $42,000 to over $73,000 within a two-week period after the ETFs began trading.“With Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,” QCP Capital stated.

Bitcoin set for a new peak? U.S. trading volumes hit 2-year high - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin volumes in U.S surged and reached 2022 levels.
The profitability of holders grew along with the velocity of BTC.

Bitcoin [BTC] witnessed a massive surge in price over the last few days, causing a spike in optimism for BTC during this period. Due to this surge in price, there was a massive spike in terms of volume for BTC as well.
Volumes on the rise
According to new data, BTC trade volume during US hours had returned to 2022 levels. The high volume of BTC transactions in America indicated that the U.S market was showing massive interest in BTC and may have even reached saturation.
However, on APAC (Asia Pacific) front, it wasn’t the case. The volume during APAC trading hours were significantly lower. This meant that there was a large cohort of people that had still not interacted with BTC.
As the popularity of BTC grows, traders operating during APAC hours may soon invest and trade BTC which may drive the price of BTC to new heights.
Source: X
As BTC began to reach its previously established all time highs, many old holders were observed to be moving their holdings. Recently, an on-chain movement of over 10-year-old Bitcoin was recorded.
A transaction involving 2,000 BTC was sent in block 844625, marking a significant shift in long-held assets.
Whales make moves
This whale behaviour could cause a rise in FUD amongst holders and traders alike, and may cause a negative impact on BTC’s price.
At press time, BTC was trading at $69,750.53  and its price had grown by 0.04% in the last 24 hours.
Moreover, the velocity at which it was trading at had grown, implying the frequency at which BTC was trading at had also increased.
Coupled with that, the MVRV ratio for BTC had also significantly grown, implying that most addresses were profitable at the time of writing. Even though this is positive for the holders, it could mean trouble for BTC’s price.
As profitability rises, so does the incentive to sell. If holders begin to indulge in profit-taking, BTC’s price can be negatively impacted. A factor that can determine the likelihood of an address selling their BTC is the Long/Short ratio.

The Long/Short ratio showcases the number of long term holders compared to short-term holders on the network.
At press time, this ratio was declining, indicating a prevalence of short term holders who are more likely to sell their holdings.

Low Ethereum Gas Fees Inflate Supply By 50k ETH In One Month - The Defiant

$238 million worth of ETH has entered circulation since April 14.A spate of unusually low Ethereum gas fees resulted in Ether’s supply growing by 50,550 coins over the past 30 days.Data from Etherscan shows average gas prices dropping below $2 during four days this month to tag a low of $1.70 on May 18. The dip marked the lowest gas price recorded since October 2023.Ethereum gas prices. Source: Etherscan.According to Ultra Sound Money, Ethereum’s supply has grown by 62,646.61 ETH ($238 million) since Ether’s burn rate flipped inflationary on April 14, pushing the number of circulating coins up to its highest level since March 4.Low gas prices threaten Ethereum deflationEthereum gas prices plummeted following the activation of Ethereum’s long-awaited Dencun upgrade on March 13.Dencun introduced proto-danksharding, which drastically reduced the costs associated with Layer 2 transactions by replacing gas-intensive calldata with lightweight Binary Large Objects (blobs) via EIP-4844 — also known as proto-danksharding. Gas fees on top Layer 2 networks dropped by more than 90% following the upgrade, also reducing the burden placed on Ethereum’s mainnet by finalizing L2 transaction bundles.But while the reduction in L2 transaction baggage precipitated Ethereum gas prices falling by up to an order of magnitude from $21.58 on March 13, Dencun also appears to have undermined Ethereum’s deflationary narrative.Still, Ether’s supply has dropped by 394,678 ETH ($1.5 billion) since The Merge transitioned the network to Proof of Stake in September 2022. If the network maintained its former Proof of Work consensus and issuance model, 6.376 million coins worth $24.2 billion would have entered supply since September 2022.Ethereum supply since The Merge.

Winnie The Pooh-Themed Coin Soars 46% As Memecoins Continue To Soar Despite Bearishness Seen In Bigger Cryptos Like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin - Benzinga

A cryptocurrency themed around the adorable Winnie the Pooh character has boosted the fortunes of its holders after raking in big gains lately.What Happened: POOH POOH/USD, created solely for entertainment purposes, jumped 46% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Over the past week, its value has more than doubled. With the parabolic lift, the token's market cap surged past $17 million. Around $3.42 worth of trades involving POOH were executed in the last 24 hours, marking an increase of 17.66%. The surge comes at a time when the more popular currencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD, and Ethereum ETH/USD and Dogecoin DOGE/USD exhibited sluggishness. Despite having a substantially lower valuation when compared to top meme coins, the Ethereum- based coin’s trajectory over the year piqued interest. POOH exploded immediately after its launch last year but crashed soon after. It survived the bear market with little to offer until March's memecoin frenzy roused it from hibernation. Since then, it has surged more than 5X in value. Currently, the enthusiasm in the community is soaring over a proposal to burn 13 Ether worth of POOH, worth about 4.4% of its total supply. Typically, such events deflationary pressure to the asset. Why It Matters: Memecoins have had a field day in 2024, as overall sentiment for the cryptocurrency market improved drastically, POOH seems to be cashing in on the frenzy, supported by a loyal community and a general likeness for the legendary animated character.The coin specifically states that it is "useless," with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. That said, a coin of a similar nature, Pepe PEPE/USD, has returned 842% to its holders over the year.Memecoins have had a history of wild fluctuations, hence DYOR before investing. Price Action: At the time of writing, POOH was trading at $0.00000004187, up 46% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.Photo Courtesy: Raul Pongasi Berame On Shutterstock.comRead Next: Ethereum Spot ETF’s Approval Highlights Its ‘World Of Warcraft’ Origins: Created Because A Character Had Its ‘Warlock Powers Nerfed’

SEC Ethereum Classification Attracts Special Attention Despite ETFs Approval - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The SEC has approved a spot Ethereum ETF, which ConsenSys welcomes but criticizes as highlighting the SEC’s inconsistent approach to digital assets.



The debate over SEC Ethereum classification remains unresolved despite progress, with further clarification expected from the agency and its commissioners.




In a surprising move, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a spot Ethereum ETF, a decision welcomed by ConsenSys.





SEC Approves Spot Ethereum ETF Amidst Regulatory Criticism



Despite acknowledging the approval as a positive step, ConsenSys criticized the SEC’s approach to digital assets, describing it as arbitrary and unfair. The development underscores the ongoing debate over SEC Ethereum classification as either a commodity or a security, a distinction with far-reaching regulatory implications.




ConsenSys stated: “Today’s approval signals that the SEC views ETH as a commodity, contrary to its previous stance, as highlighted in our recent lawsuit against the SEC. We will continue to fight for clear regulatory guidelines and support the bipartisan Congressional efforts aimed at achieving sensible regulation.”




The distinction between commodities and securities is significant for the crypto industry. Commodities, which include assets like gold and oil, are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), focusing on market stability and fraud prevention. In contrast, securities representing ownership in corporations or creditor relationships fall under the SEC‘s purview, with an emphasis on investor protection and disclosure requirements.



Ongoing Uncertainty in SEC Ethereum Classification Despite ETF Approval



The CFTC has long viewed Ether as a commodity, permitting trading in Ether futures by CME Group. However, the SEC’s historical caution has left Ethereum in a regulatory gray area. The approval of the Ethereum ETF by the SEC could shift this perspective, particularly if S-1 registration statements for the ETFs from firms like VanEck, BlackRock, and Fidelity are signed off.




Justin Browder, a digital asset lawyer, suggested that S-1 approval would conclusively determine Ether’s status as a non-security. Despite this progress, finance lawyer Scott Johnsson noted that the approval order did not explicitly address SEC Ethereum classification, leaving some ambiguity.



Earlier this year, ConsenSys received a Wells notice from the SEC, primarily concerning its Metamask trading and staking services. The SEC and its commissioners are anticipated to make further statements on Ether’s classification soon.

Top Ethereum Challenger Could Skyrocket by Over 2x, According to Crypto Analyst Michaël van de Poppe - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst believes one Ethereum (ETH) competitor could more than double in price.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 718,900 followers on the social media platform X that interoperability blockchain Polkadot (DOT) is poised to rally due to major network advances.










He also says DOT is likely to see a boost from ETH’s upward momentum as well.
“Polkadot did a retest at the crucial levels and wakes up slowly. Given their Polkadot 2.0 release and the JAM ( Join-Accumulate Machine) white paper and the correlation with ETH, I’m expecting a lot from them. Next target is likely $18.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Polkadot is trading for $7.14 at time of writing, up more than 4% in the last 24 hours.
The analyst also believes the broader altcoin market is entering a bullish phase after correcting.
“The altcoin market capitalization has finished its correction. The next step: reaching all-time high, which is ~60%-70% from here. I think Ethereum is likely reaching that in the next two-four months.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
He says alts could outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the months ahead.
“The altcoins are still heavily undervalued. Most of them are down 70% against Bitcoin. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be having any correction, but feeling fear of missing out (FOMO) here is the wrong emotion to have. In the coming months, I expect altcoins to do way better.”
Lastly, the analyst says he is bullish on Bitcoin but expects the crypto king to retest the $68,000 level on the 12-hour chart before continuing upward.
“Bitcoin slowly consolidating. Expecting a retest at the $68,000 mark, before a continuation upwards. The trend is clearly upwards.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Bitcoin is trading for $67,553 at time of writing, down more than 2% in the last 24 hours.

SEC In 'Deep Trouble' With Crypto Post-Ethereum ETF Approval


								On Thursday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a landmark decision by approving eight spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) from leading financial institutions and crypto firms, including Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, and ARK. This historic approval, which consolidated proposals from the Nasdaq, NYSE, and CBOE, marked a significant shift in the regulatory landscape of digital assets.
Why The SEC Is In ‘Deep Trouble’ With Its Crypto Cases
However, this decision comes with its complexities, particularly in light of ongoing legal challenges involving the classification of other cryptocurrencies. Prominent crypto lawyer James “MetaLawMan” Murphy commented, “I believe the SEC is in deep trouble with some of its crypto cases in light of its determination that ETH is a commodity.”
He emphasized that the SEC repeatedly argued in the Coinbase case “that crypto tokens that operate within an ‘ecosystems are securities.’ I believe the SEC will have difficulty explaining how ETH, which operates within a giant ecosystem, is a commodity, but SOL and ADA are securities when traded on Coinbase.”

This statement encapsulates the core of the issue: Ethereum operates within a robust ecosystem that includes not just investment and trading but also decentralized applications and smart contracts, similar to other blockchains like Solana and Cardano. The distinction made by the SEC might complicate its stance in ongoing and future litigation, particularly cases involving other cryptocurrencies that operate under similar paradigms but are classified differently.
Murphy also suggested potential legal maneuvers by affected parties: “Coinbase is due to file a Reply Brief tomorrow on its Petition to Certify Interlocutory Appeal. It would not surprise me if they also filed a request for rehearing of their motion to dismiss in light of the fact that the SEC now concedes that ETH is a commodity.”
He also refers to Judge Failla’s earlier ruling in the Coinbase case where she bought into the SEC’s ecosystem argument and used it as a basis for her ruling. “When a customer purchases a token on Coinbase’s platform, she is not just purchasing a token, which in and of itself is valueless; rather, she is buying into the token’s digital ecosystem, the growth of which is necessarily tied to the value of the token.”

Consensys, a major Ethereum software developer, also expressed concerns with the SEC’s decision-making process, suggesting it reflects an inconsistent and ad hoc approach to digital asset regulation. In a statement, the company said: “This seemingly last minute approval is yet another example of the SEC’s troublesome ad hoc approach to digital assets. No other industry, market, or asset is subject to such deliberate regulatory abuse. It is unfair to market participants, antithetical to the rule of law, and handcuffing innovation.


Sam Callahan, a senior analyst at Swan, noted a key omission in the SEC’s approval document: “Interesting paragraph in the SEC’s Ethereum ETF approval document. The SEC basically looked at the ETF products and whether they could adequately protect investors and maintain fair markets, and that’s about it. No mention of securities laws or ETH classification. No mention of the Howey Test.”
Thus, the absence of a clear stance on Ethereum’s classification under securities laws still raises questions about future regulatory challenges and implications for other digital assets. “We may have to wait for a statement from Gensler, and even then, he could sidestep the topic altogether,” Callahan remarked.
At press time, ETH traded at $3,686.

SEC's Ethereum ETF Approval: A Game-Changer for Crypto Markets


							

The SEC greenlights eight spot Ethereum ETF applications.



Launch timeline uncertain, pending further approvals.



The decision signals a potential shift in crypto regulation.




In a landmark decision that could reshape the cryptocurrency landscape, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, May 23rd, greenlit eight applications for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling a major shift in regulatory stance towards the second-largest digital asset.



This move paves the way for mainstream investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency.



The 19B-4 submissions detail proposed rule changes and regulatory compliance necessary for listing and trading new ETFs. In its statement, the SEC highlighted the consistency of the proposals with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, adding:




“After careful review, the Commission finds that the Proposals are consistent with the Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.”




19B-4 filings for the following firms were approved by the SEC:




BlackRock Inc.



Fidelity



Grayscale Investments Inc.



Bitwise Asset Management Inc.



VanEck Associates Corp.



Ark Investment Management LLC



Invesco Capital Management LLC



Franklin Templeton




Despite this approval, the process is not yet complete for these firms, as they still await a nod from the SEC for their S-1 filings. An S-1 registration statement is crucial because it details the financials and business operations of the ETF providers. As a result, it helps potential investors make informed decisions.



However, the timeline for listing these ETFs remains uncertain. ETF analyst Nate Geraci pointed out the possibility of the SEC delaying the S-1 approvals, given the reported lack of engagement on this front. Conversely, according to a tweet by Bloomberg’s James Seyffart, if “they work extremely hard,” this process could take a matter of weeks. However, historically, it has taken over three months in some cases.









Whereas the SEC’s approval marks a significant milestone, the ultimate launch of these spot Ethereum ETFs hinges on the pending S-1 approvals, leaving the exact timeline uncertain. Despite this, the regulatory nod has ignited optimism within the crypto community, with many viewing it as a pivotal step towards broader acceptance and adoption of Ethereum in traditional finance.

                        A U.S. district court has found crypto influencer Ian Balina guilty of violating U.S. securities laws.According to recent court filings, Judge David Alan Ezra ruled that Balina was guilty promoting and selling SPRK tokens without proper disclosure. the judge ruled that SPRK tokens met the criteria of the Howey Test, making them securities.Unlawful Promotion without Proper Disclosure
Balina faced charges in September 2022 due to his participation in the unregistered initial coin offering (ICO) of SPRK tokens. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contended that these tokens necessitated appropriate registration and disclosure.The court found that Ian Balina engaged in promoting and selling SPRK tokens through various social media platforms, including YouTube and Telegram.Balina did not disclose that he was receiving compensation of a 30% bonus for these promotions, which the court determined was a violation of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act.Balina organized an investment pool where he offered SPRK tokens to investors. The SEC highlighted that he failed to properly disclose his financial interest in the tokens he received from Sparkster, the company behind SPRK.The SEC stated that the token offering raised approximately $30 million from nearly 4,000 investors located abroad and in the U.S. from April to July 2018.Ian Balina’s Response to SEC’s Charges
Balina’s website posted a response to the SEC’s “baseless” charges, saying, “This is the first time a private pre-sale purchase of a digital asset token has been accused of being ‘compensation’ in exchange for publicity.”“The Security and Exchange (SEC) Enforcement Division’s proposed charges against Mr. Balina are an unfounded effort based upon multiple misconceptions of fact and law, enumerated below,” the post reads.The response asserted that Balina did not receive any compensation, and there is no evidence to support such allegations. It also claimed that he did not profit from his purchase, suggesting that he might be a victim of fraud by the Sparkster team, similar to other investors.

Additionally, it would shift more regulatory responsibility for digital assets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).It would also make it clear which businesses the SEC and CFTC regulate and would create a system for registering these businesses. This would allow them to legally serve customers who want to buy and sell digital assets. The SEC would oversee digital assets that are considered securities, while the CFTC would oversee things like commodities and derivatives related to digital assets.Outdated Law Hinders US Crypto Regulation
Bligen pointed out the fact that the US has been using a nearly century-old law, the Howey Test, from the SEC to regulate cryptocurrency that was invented just a few years ago. He argued that the current system is outdated and doesn’t work for this technology.“Hopefully this [bill] establishes the US as a regulatory leader that wants strong consumer protections,” he said. “We already have the most liquid, most attractive capital markets in the US. There’s no reason why we can’t have the best cryptocurrency markets as well.”FIT21 Seen as Crypto Talent Retainer
Harry Sudock, chief strategy officer at Bitcoin miner GRIID, agrees that the bill would propel the US to a competitive position in the international crypto scene. Additionally, he believes FIT21 would incentivize the brightest minds in crypto to come to and stay in the US.“We’ve seen a number of businesses either leave the US or decline to do business here thanks to regulatory uncertainty,” he said. “FIT21 will help those businesses return to the US, but the bill is really only just the start.”FIT21’s House Hurdle Cleared, Senate Showdown Looms
FIT21’s journey to becoming law isn’t over yet. While it successfully cleared the House, it still faces an uphill battle. The bill needs to be approved by the Senate and then signed by the President before it becomes law. Whether the Senate will give it the green light remains to be seen.Ronen Cojocaru, CEO of automated crypto trading platform 8081, highlighted the unique challenges crypto bills face in the Senate. Some senators are familiar with the technology and may be vocal supporters or opponents of the FIT21 Act. However, others might lack a deep understanding of the intricacies of cryptocurrency, making them undecided on the bill’s merits.“Public opinion and upcoming elections influence Senators’ decisions, aligning them with their party’s agenda and voter interests,” he said. “Senators can use a filibuster, requiring 60 votes to advance the bill, which is tough without strong bipartisan support.”Cojocaru also explained why the US is currently lagging behind other countries. He pointed to Switzerland, nicknamed “Crypto Valley,” as a prime example. Switzerland’s financial regulator, FINMA, fosters innovation by providing clear guidelines for crypto businesses, making it a global hub for the industry.Singapore has also attracted many crypto companies with its well-defined regulations and supportive policies. Its central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has struck a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding consumers. Similarly, Malta, known as the “Blockchain Island,” has become a magnet for crypto businesses with its comprehensive and crypto-friendly regulations.CFTC vs. SEC in Regulating Crypto
Meanwhile, James Koutoulas founder at Typhon Capital Management, said FIT21 needs some work, especially for DeFi. Additionally, he highlighted the unprecedented power it gives the CFTC to regulate crypto as a spot commodity, which falls outside its usual domain of regulating commodity derivatives.“But, at least at the present time, the CFTC is infinitely less hostile to crypto than the SEC and seems focused on implementing regulatory pathways instead of maliciously attacking market leaders without the statutory authority to do so like the SEC,” Koutoulas said.

Ripple CEO signals potential for an XRP ETF following Ethereum ETFs approval - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Ripple CEO hints at potential XRP ETFs following Ethereum ETF approvals by SEC.
Brad Garlinghouse’s endorsement aligns with his optimistic outlook for XRP in 2024.
Regulatory challenges and Ripple’s SEC lawsuit impact the timing of potential XRP ETFs.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has indirectly hinted that XRP could be the next cryptocurrency to see the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
This follows the recent approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Spot XRP ETF prospects post Ethereum ETFs approval
Garlinghouse’s subtle nod to the possibility of XRP ETFs came via his reaction on X (formerly Twitter) to a comment on his post celebrating the US SEC’s approval of all Ethereum ETF applications. Among the approved ether ETF applications were those from prominent financial entities such as BlackRock, Grayscale, VanEck, and Fidelity.
Describing the week’s events as “momentous” for the crypto industry, Garlinghouse likened the SEC’s approvals and the passing of the FIT21 crypto bill to a “hell freezes over” scenario, a sentiment that resonated with many in the community, who have long anticipated similar advancements for their favored cryptocurrency.
Earlier on in an interview in February, Garlinghouse had expressed his belief that an XRP spot ETF was inevitable.
He emphasized the importance of such an investment product for diversification purposes but refrained from committing to a specific timeline, citing regulatory uncertainties as a major factor.
When questioned about potential collaborations with asset managers like BlackRock for an XRP ETF, Garlinghouse remained non-committal, acknowledging the complexities involved.
Ripple legal battles standing in the way of an ETF approval
Despite Garlinghouse’s enthusiasm, the path to an XRP ETF is fraught with challenges.
The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC, which has accused Ripple of selling unregistered securities, remains a significant hurdle. The outcome of this legal battle will likely play a crucial role in determining the feasibility and timing of an XRP ETF.
While Ripple CEO is optimistic of an EXP ETF approval, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that Solana (SOL) might be a more probable candidate than XRP.
Seyffart argued that Solana’s market position and broader appeal make it a strong contender, though he cautioned that a Solana ETF might not materialize until 2026, contingent upon regulatory developments and the establishment of a CFTC-regulated futures market.

I'm sorry you're simple minded. Ill dumb it down for you. 
Based on current regulatory framework I don't think Solana will be in an ETF for multiple years. Likely beyond 2026 at earliest.
But Congress can theoretically accelerate that timeline.
— James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 22, 2024

While no other crypto ETF applications have been made so far, the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs and the legislative advancements marked by the FIT21 crypto bill signify significant progress for the cryptocurrency sector.

The odds of BNB breaking its ATH in 2024 are... - AMBCrypto



BNB recently bounced from the support line of a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating bullish sentiment.
A close above $635 could lead to a rally to $692, breaking the ATH.

Binance Coin [BNB] has been a standout performer in the cryptocurrency market over the past few years. But the question on every investor’s mind is: Can BNB break its all-time highs this year? 
Even as the rest of its peers rally on, the altcoin has remained moderately bullish.
A quick look at BNB’s current standing
Over the past year, BNB has experienced some major price fluctuations. At press time, BNB is trading significantly below its all-time high of $690, reached in May 2021. 
The altcoin turned up from the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 20 and rose above the resistance line, meaning that the bulls still have the upper hand. 
BNB reached the critical overhead resistance of $635 on 21st May. This level will likely act as a stiff block, but if the bulls do not cede ground to the bears, it will improve the prospects of an upside breakout. A close above $635 could clear the way for a rally to $692.
 
Source: TradingView
The 20-day EMA, around $590, is also an important support level. Maintaining above this level will allow BNB to sustain bullish momentum. 
Derivatives data shows a noticeable decline in trading volume by 16.69%, meaning there is less trading activity and reduced interest at the current price levels.

Potential catalysts and outlook
Despite some contrasting signals from search activity and whale actions, the overall market sentiment towards BNB is strongly positive, as indicated by the Greed level on the Fear and Greed Index. 
It clearly shows that the market is bullish on BNB, potentially anticipating a massive rally.

Given the very positive volume, dominance, and impulse, along with the positive social sentiment and order book condition, the short to medium-term outlook for BNB looks bullish.
Historically, BNB has been the most stable cryptocurrency. Even during a severe crypto winter last year, the coin didn’t plunge as much as the other cryptocurrencies. Its potential for a massive bull run this cycle is generally agreed on by the community.

Ouch! Solana Meme Coin Developer Burned in Bizarre Promotional Stunt


								The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to the bizarre, but this week, a Solana memecoin developer took things to a fiery new extreme. Mikol, the founder of the newly launched “Truth or Dare” (DARE) token, is recovering in a Miami hospital after suffering third-degree burns during a livestreamed stunt gone horribly wrong.
This incident casts a harsh light on the escalating tactics employed by memecoin projects in a bid for viral fame and fortune.

From Fireworks To Fiascos: The Solana Dev’s Thirst For Attention
Memecoins, known for their mascot-driven popularity and often erratic price fluctuations, thrive on attention. Projects compete in a saturated market, resorting to increasingly outlandish tactics to grab headlines.
In 2022, a memecoin project sent a giant Elon Musk rocket-statue on a truck to Tesla headquarters, hoping to spark a tweet from the crypto influencer. While such stunts can generate a buzz, Mikol’s fiery performance has sparked outrage and concern within the crypto community.
Livestream Inferno: When Hype Goes Up In Flames
Mikol’s ill-conceived marketing strategy involved dousing himself in isopropyl alcohol and inviting a friend to light fireworks in his direction during a livestreamed launch event for the DARE token. The chaotic 30-minute broadcast captured the horrifying moment when Mikol became engulfed in flames.


His friends, unprepared for such a disaster, attempted to extinguish the fire with water, but the damage was already done. With burns affecting nearly a third of his body, Mikol was rushed to a trauma center.
This incident raises serious questions about the ethics and legality of such promotional stunts. Financial markets, especially the often-unregulated cryptocurrency space, require a degree of responsible marketing. Encouraging risky behavior not only puts the developer in danger but also sets a potentially dangerous precedent for future marketing campaigns.
Solana is now trading at $166. Chart: TradingView
The Aftermath: Regulation, Reputation, And Responsibility
The “Truth or Dare” stunt has sparked discussions about potential regulatory interventions. If dangerous stunts become a normalized marketing tactic, watchdogs might be forced to step in and establish stricter guidelines for cryptocurrency promotions.
Furthermore, the Solana dev incident tarnishes the reputation of the entire memecoin sector. The cryptocurrency market, already grappling with issues of volatility and legitimacy, can ill-afford such negative publicity.

Coinbase NY’s XRP Trading Aligns with Whales’ Massive XRP Moves


							

Coinbase resumes XRP trading in New York, boosting the digital asset after recent price volatility.



SEC lawsuit against Ripple for unregistered securities casts shadow, but recent court ruling favors XRP.



Action aligns with whales’ massive XRP moves and XRP’s notable price changes.




In a move likely to buoy XRP’s price, Coinbase, the large cryptocurrency exchange, has resumed XRP trading for users in New York. The decision comes amid significant price volatility for XRP, which reached a weekly high of $0.5535 on May 21st.



The announcement was made public by Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, via his social media page. In a brief statement, Mr. Grewal wrote, “XRP trading on Coinbase is now available in New York.”







Also, Whale Alert’s revelation of the massive move of XRP totaling more than 55 million has created a buzz in the community. In two separate X posts, Whale Alert shared insights on the strategic moves of large XRP holders or whales, which in turn saw a slight surge in XRP’s price.



According to Whale Alert, an unknown whale address transferred a massive 30,080,000 XRP tokens, worth 15,634,673, to Bitso. Yet another involved the transfer of 25,800,000 XRP tokens, valued at $13,407,670, to Bitstamp.







This follows a period of uncertainty for XRP, delisted from several exchanges, including Coinbase, in 2020 after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP. The SEC alleged that XRP was an unregistered security.



Despite a recent ruling in favor of Ripple, by Judge Sarah Netburn, declaring XRP not to be a security, the final judgment in the case is still pending. The legal battle has undoubtedly contributed to XRP’s price fluctuations. However, the recent surge in trading activity, coupled with Coinbase’s decision to resume trading in New York, suggests a renewed sense of optimism among XRP holders.









As of the press time, the token is trading at $05302, with a slight increase of 0.53% over the last day. In the last week, XRP had a more notable surge of 2.60% despite a monthly decline of 2.91%.



While the long-term impact of Coinbase’s decision remains to be seen, it is a significant development for XRP. The resumption of trading in a major financial hub like New York could provide much-needed stability for the digital asset.

The enigmatic leader of the Shiba Inu team known by the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama sends congratulations to the Ethereum community on the recent spot ETF approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.He touched on the potential opportunity for the same happening to a SHIB spot exchange-traded fund in the future.SHIB ETF prospects and Shytoshi's current focusThe SHIB lead published a post in which he congratulated the friends of SHIB and Shibarium at Ethereum on the spot ETH ETF finally receiving the green light from the SEC regulator. He wondered if that could pave the way for SHIB, perhaps also hinting that a SHIB ETF is likely to be approved in the future.However, without spending much time discussing this hypothetical event, without further ado, he stated that this is something for the community to discuss, but he will stay focused on what the SHIB team has coming. He concluded his message with an intriguing hashtag, #staytuned. SEC approves Ethereum ETFsOn Thursday, May 24, the SEC finally issued approval for the spot Ethereum ETF filings submitted by several Wall Street companies earlier this year. The ETFs were approved six months after the regulator greenlit spot Bitcoin ETFs in the middle of January.Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, and this approval marks a crucial pivot for the crypto industry after BTC spot ETFs. Venture investor Anthony Pompliano has recently tweeted that this step would be the last dam to be broken before the Wall Street totally accepts crypto assets.Among the approved Ethereum ETFs were those submitted by BlackRock, Grayscale (a converted spot ETF from their Ethereum Trust), VanEck, Bitwise, Fidelity and Ark Invest.These spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to be much smaller in terms of assets under management. For example, Grayscale’s ETF holds approximately $11 billion in ETH, which is much smaller than its Bitcoin Trust held before it was converted into the spot ETF.Earlier this month, Ark, Grayscale and Fidelity were driven to adjust their ETF filings to remove staking from them since the SEC recently sued two U.S.-based exchanges (Coinbase and Kraken) for their crypto staking services, referring to staked assets and unregistered securities.

Solana DePIN gains traction in 2024, led by Render and Helium - AMBCrypto



Solana-based DePINs like Render and Helium recorded massive growth on key metrics
New entrants have entered the Solana DePIN ecosystem. 

After dominating the memecoin trading segment, Solana [SOL] seems set to lead the DePIN (Decentralized Public Infrastructure Networks) sector.
One of the leading decentralized computer networks, Render [RNDR], recorded a remarkable 66% growth in node operators since migrating from Ethereum [ETH] to Solana last November. 
According to a report by crypto analytics provider Flipside, the growth isn’t restricted to Render but was evident across the Solana DePIN sector in the first half of 2024 (H1). 
Render moved to Solana because of its speed, scalability, and low cost. New DePIN entrants, like io.net, cited the same reasons for choosing the network. Reinforcing Solana’s capacity, Garrison Yang, chief strategy at io.net, told Flipside that, 
“With advantages in retail liquidity, speed, scalability, cost, and mindshare, Solana has become a natural choice for many web3 projects, including the DePIN category.’
State of Solana DePIN sector in H1 2024
According to the Flipside report, four major DePIN sub-categories have matured within Solana – compute, connectivity, data/sensor, and storage networks. 
Render led the decentralized computing segment, hitting a record high of 1920 node operators in January 2024, a 66% increase post-Solana migration. 
Source: Flipside
Node operator rewards spiked in January, with a 34% average in the first half of 2024. 
Render offers a Web 3 alternative to AWS or Google Cloud through its peer-to-peer compute power (GPU) marketplace. Per the report, Render pivoted to AI/Machine Learning and could be an outlier in the segment if the AI narrative extends.
Part of the report read, 
“As global GPU demand continues to outstrip supply, investment in, and adoption of, decentralized compute solutions will likely outpace other DePIN sectors.’
The report noted io.net and Nosana as the latest projects in the compute segment worth tracking. 
Solana’s next hottest DePIN category was connectivity, and the Helium Network was the leading project amidst surging subscribers. Wife Dabba and Pollen Mobile are new projects within the category. 
The decentralized sensor and data storage segments are the third and fourth largest, respectively. These categories are dominated by Hivemapper (a Google Street View rival) and Shdwdrive, respectively. 
Overall, the Solana DePIN ecosystem has over 25 projects led by the three known ones: Render, Hivemapper, and Helium. 
On the performance front, the DePIN narrative was in the top five after DeFi and posted 85% in Q1, per the Coingecko report. 
The best performer was the memecoin sector, which Solana dominated. It remains to be seen how the DePIN narrative will play out at the end of Q2.

Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG) to Explode 14,000% Before KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BIDDOG will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Biden in a Dogs World.



Currently, Biden in a Dogs World can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BIDDOG on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Biden in a Dogs World by entering its contract address – bUv1o6DFK5Wa7V1SY2HoFTUmaZSQ58eKqk5rKxvWuZr – in the receiving field.




BIDDOG currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Commodity Nod for Ethereum in ETF Saga Won't Halt SEC's War on Crypto


																Industry experts and executives have been discussing the implications of the SEC’s apparent U-turn on Ethereum.
Its approval of spot Ether ETFs on May 23 may be a signal that the regulator now views the asset as a commodity and not a security.
The regulator officially approved 19b-4 applications from VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, and Bitwise to issue spot Ethereum ETFs.
However, not all are convinced this is also a signal that its war on crypto could be coming to an end any time soon.






ConsenSys Not Convinced
On May 24, Ethereum software solutions provider ConsenSys said it welcomes the decision as a step in the right direction but added:
“This seemingly last-minute approval is yet another example of the SEC’s troublesome ad hoc approach to digital assets.”
The company noted that the SEC’s “regulatory abuse” is “unfair to market participants, antithetical to the rule of law, and handcuffing innovation.”


ConsenSys is one of several crypto companies embroiled in legal battles with the SEC, which maintains its position that they have been offering unregistered securities. The agency’s decision on Ethereum is “contrary to the position it continued to take prior to the events of this week,” said ConsenSys.
Meanwhile, financial services lawyer James Murphy said that “the SEC is in deep trouble with some of its crypto cases in light of its determination that ETH is a commodity.”
The regulator has argued repeatedly at the hearing on Coinbase’s motion to dismiss that crypto tokens that operate within an “ecosystem” are securities, he added. The exchange’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, echoed the sentiment in a post on X on May 24, questioning the SEC’s perplexing U-turn.


More Smoke and Mirrors
Finance lawyer Scott Johnsson observed that the SEC “completely sidestepped” the clarification of ETH in its approval orders. ETF Store President Nate Geraci said something similar on May 24.
“Zero statements from SEC Commissioners on spot eth ETFs… Silence speaks volumes.”
Meanwhile, crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky was optimistic that a change was in motion:
“Today’s expected ETH ETF approval will hopefully provide a clue as to how real this pro-crypto pivot might be.”
ETH prices spiked to $3,933 when the news broke but returned to yesterday’s levels shortly after and were trading at $3,670 at the time of writing.

Spot Ether ETF Approval Proves ETH is Not a Security: Expert

                        The recent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) potentially confirms Ether’s status as a non-security, according to industry experts.Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, speaking on the Bankless podcast with Ryan Sean Adams, emphasized that the approval of these commodity-based trust shares implies that the SEC explicitly recognizes Ether as not being a security. Seyffart further suggested that this recognition could extend to other tokens as well, solidifying their classification as commodities.S-1 Approval Would End Debate for ETH Status
Digital asset lawyer Justin Browder echoed Seyffart’s sentiment, stating that if Ether ETFs receive S-1 approval, which is the final requirement for them to begin trading, it would settle the debate once and for all, affirming that ETH is indeed not a security.Adam Cochran, a partner at venture capital firm Cinneamhain Ventures, took the argument a step further, suggesting that this line of thinking could be applied to tokens of other projects as well.“ETH is a commodity, even with its current attributes. That means we can extrapolate to *A LOT* of other projects what elements matter in security,” Cochran said.“Today a lot of things probably clearly became commodities, even if they don’t know it yet.”While the approval of spot Ether ETFs reinforces the non-security status of Ether, Seyffart and other experts anticipate that the SEC may still focus on actors involved with staking Ether.Seyffart speculates that the SEC might distinguish between Ether itself, which they would not consider a security, and staked Ether, which could potentially fall under the definition of a security.Digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare shares this view, suggesting that the SEC could pursue individual actors and staking-as-a-service despite the ETF launch.It’s worth noting that the SEC’s approval order did not explicitly confirm Ether’s non-security status, leading finance lawyer Scott Johnsson to comment that the issue was “completely sidestepped.”However, an official statement from the SEC and its Commissioners is expected to provide more clarity in the future.SEC Approves 19b-4 Applications
On May 23, the SEC officially approved 19b-4 applications from VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, and Bitwise for issuing spot Ether ETFs.Notably, several ETF issuers removed staking from their final amendments.Hashdex was the only issuer that did not receive regulatory approval on that day.However, all eight approved ETF issuers must await the SEC’s approval of their S-1 registration statements before launching their ETFs.Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart predicts that the S-1 approvals could be granted in a “couple of weeks,” although he acknowledges that the process may take longer, typically spanning up to five months.However, fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes that a mid-June launch is certainly possible.As reported, Singapore-based QCP Capital believes the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States could potentially trigger a substantial rally of up to 60% in the price of ETH.

Analyst Bets on ADA & AVAX After SEC's Ethereum ETF Approval


							

Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello believes ADA is ready for an uptick.



Gambardello has predicted bullish cases for ADA and AVAX.



Gambardello states that ADA and AVAX can be the top performing altcoins this cycle.




Dan Gambardello, a leading market analyst and founder of CryptoCapitalVenture, highlighted Cardano (ADA) as a potential beneficiary following the recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Mr. Gambardello, in an X video, cited Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, who noted that Ethereum is now classified as a commodity. Mr. Gambardello argued this classification could extend to Cardano, stating:




“ADA has its own narrative I think in terms of the ETFs for being as decentralized as it is for being built in the way that it is. AVAX also has its own narrative, that is to say its own president of Ava Labs is out there fighting for the AVAX ETF.”




Mr. Gambardello expressed his belief that both Cardano and AVAX are “extremely well positioned to be top performers among blue-chip altcoins.” He predicted that ADA will “make its move out of nowhere,” despite currently testing the patience of its holders.









Additionally, Mr. Gambardello emphasized that the approval of ETH ETFs is a positive development for all altcoin holders, including those of Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). He concluded that the “anti-crypto army” was losing ground.

The SEC approva gli ETF su Ethereum spot, il prezzo reagisce

La SEC degli Stati Uniti ha finalmente approvato la quotazione degli ETF spot su Ethereum, la notizia ha influito anche sul prezzo della crypto. Inoltre, il responsabile legale di Coinbase afferma che Ethereum è ufficialmente considerato una commodity.
Let’s see all the details below. 

New ETFs on Ethereum receive the green light from the SEC, how did the price react?
As anticipated, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States has approved the requests of Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE to list exchange-traded funds (ETF) linked to the price of Ethereum. 
Thus opening up the possibility that these products will start to be traded by the end of the year. 
Sebbene gli emittenti di ETF debbano ancora ottenere l’approvazione finale prima del lancio, la decisione rappresenta una vittoria inaspettata per le aziende coinvolte. Infatti, l’intero settore delle criptovalute fino a lunedì temeva un rifiuto della SEC.
Nine issuers, including VanEck, ARK Investments/21Shares, and BlackRock, hope to launch ETFs linked to Ethereum, the second cryptocurrency by market capitalization. 
Especially after the approval of the ETF su Bitcoin in January, which marked a crucial moment for the sector. 
“This is an exciting time for the industry as a whole,” said Andrew Jacobson, vice president and legal head of 21Shares, calling the approval “a significant step” towards trading these products.
Approval and adjustment of the documents
Thursday also represented the deadline for the SEC’s decision on VanEck‘s request. Market operators were expecting a rejection, as the SEC had shown no signs of accommodating the applications. 
Tuttavia, con una mossa sorprendente, lunedì i funzionari della SEC hanno richiesto agli exchange di aggiornare rapidamente i documenti, costringendo l’industria a completare settimane di lavoro in pochi giorni. 
The sources were unable to determine the reason for this change in position by the SEC. Rob Marrocco, global head of ETP listings at Cboe Global Markets, commented: 
“The introduction of spot ETFs on bitcoin has already demonstrated significant advantages for digital assets and the ETF space, and we believe that spot ETFs on ether will provide similar protections for U.S. investors.”
When asked about ether ETFs during an industry event on Thursday, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, a well-known skeptic of cryptocurrencies, declined to comment. 
 A spokesperson for the SEC confirmed via email the approval, adding that the agency would not comment further.
Coinbase: the approval of Ethereum ETFs confirms its status as a commodity
Dopo l’approvazione degli ETF Spot su Ethereum, il Chief Legal Officer di Coinbase, Paul Grewal, ha dichiarato che Ethereum è effettivamente considerato una commodity. In un post su X, Grewal ha affermato che ETH è una commodity “come l’abbiamo sempre saputa”.
The approval of the 19b-4 forms for Spot ETFs on Ethereum represents the first steps towards the official approval of all ETFs on ETH. Coinbase, one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, is a strong supporter of cryptocurrency ETFs. 
Ethereum will join Bitcoin as the only crypto ETF available on the market, paving the way for additional candidates in the future.
Now that the Ethereum ETF 19b-4 forms have been approved, the issuers must wait for the approval of their S-1 forms, necessary to publicly offer new securities and start trading. 
The SEC could take weeks or months to process the S-1 forms, especially if it remains dissatisfied with the ETFs. Experts like Grewal express enthusiasm for this first step towards a broad approval. 
It is expected that the price of Ethereum will increase significantly, following the example of Bitcoin after the approval of its ETF. At the moment, ETH is traded at over $3,800, up 4% in the last 24 hours and over 25% in the last week.

Coinbase: il crypto-exchange reintroduces the trading of Ripple (XRP)

Paul Grewal, responsabile legale di Coinbase, ha annunciato che anche per i clienti di New York è tornato ora disponibile il trading di Ripple (XRP) sul crypto-exchange. 

Coinbase: the crypto Ripple (XRP) is available for trading again in New York
Coinbase has reintroduced the trading of the crypto Ripple (XRP) also for its customers in New York. This was announced by Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, with a tweet: 

The trading of XRP on @coinbase is available again in New York. We have listened to you and worked closely with the State. And now it can be said that we are operational again.
Grewal emphasized the collaborative effort with the State to succeed in the endeavor of bringing XRP back among its crypto offerings, even for New York. 
E dunque, da ora, i residenti potranno tornare a effettuare trading e/o conservare XRP sulla piattaforma web di Coinbase e su tutte le applicazioni mobili iOS e Android. 
Coinbase: Ripple (XRP) returns to the crypto-exchange after 3 and a half years
It was January 2021 when Coinbase had officially removed Ripple (XRP) from its crypto-exchange, exactly 3 and a half years ago. 
 The reason was the endless cause “SEC vs. Ripple” which saw the regulatory body accuse the crypto company of offering unregistered security. 
Ecco perché Coinbase e altri crypto-exchange come OKCoin, Crypto.com e OSL avevano cominciato il delisting di  XRP dalle loro piattaforme. 
This is why Coinbase and other crypto-exchanges like OKCoin, Crypto.com, and OSL had started the delisting of  XRP from their platforms. 
Such operations had led the market cap of what has been for a long time the third crypto in the ranking to collapse. And indeed, in the following months, XRP saw its market cap drop from 70 billion dollars to 29 billion dollars. 
Despite this decision, Coinbase has always sided in support of the crypto colleague and against the Securities and Exchange Commission of the USA, also filing a motion to support Ripple, which was also accepted by the judge. 
Only in February 2023, the community started to make itself heard by asking Coinbase to relist XRP, especially after the SEC had officially ruled that sales on the secondary market are not equivalent to securities. 
Eppure, la causa Ripple vs. SEC ha avuto fine nel luglio 2023, con la vittoria parziale della società crypto e la sentenza ufficiale che XRP non è una security. 
The price of XRP
The news of Coinbase resuming the listing of XRP in New York, did not register significant price movements for XRP, at least in the last 24 hours. And indeed, at the time of writing, XRP is worth $0.52 just like yesterday. 
Eppure, dando uno sguardo ai volumi di scambi di XRP nelle ultime 24 ore, pare ci sia stato un aumento del 106%. 
In any case, the current seventh crypto in the ranking still holds today a total market cap that is close to 29 billion dollars.

Which Cryptos Will Come Along For The Ride?


SPONSORED POST*
Render (RNDR) has seen a major month for its price, as it has gone upwards following Apple’s Keynote Event, on top of which OctaneX was featured. Alongside this, Core (CORE) has also seen a price rally as they introduced Ignition Drop Tier Multipliers and Badges on top of the ecosystem. 
However, all traders are now moving towards KangaMoon (KANG) as its nearing $7 million raised and has increased in value by 400%. Bitcoin on the other hand has risen in value significantly, and based on the price prediction can reach $123,939 by the end of 2024. To see which crypto can follow in its footsteps, we will take an in-depth look at CORE, RNDR and KANG. 

Core Crypto Spikes 122.6% – Price to Reach $2.77
Core (CORE) is heading upwards on the charts especially after it introduced the Ignition Drop Tier Multipliers and Badges. The heightened Core crypto circulation could soon result in major price increases as interest and demand in the project increase. 
Moreover, the Core price has gone up 122.6% on the annual chart, and the MACD data points to future upwards momentum as-well. According to the Core price prediction it can end 2024 at $2.77, making it the best cryptocurrency to invest in.
Render (RNDR) Climbs 363.8% YTD – How Far Can It Climb?
Render (RNDR) on the other hand has seen a major 363.8% year-to-date (YTD) climb, and spiked 22% in the past month alone. The key catalyst for this major level of the growth in the Render crypto value is due to OctaneX getting featured on Apple’s Keynote Event. This way, any user with M4 chips can gain access to near-unlimited high performance decentralized GPU compute power through its ecosystem. 
The Render price could see an even further uptrend during the upcoming trading sessions as its RSI is above 50, and according to the Render price prediction the crypto can end 2024 at $14.56, positioning it as a solid crypto to buy.
KangaMoon Price Jumps 400% – To Climb 100x Following Its Launch
KangaMoon (KANG) breaks the mold of traditional meme coins through forging a powerful fusion between Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming, Social-Fi mechanics, and its native KANG token. Here, it provides major utility to its native crypto, and this differentiates it from otherwise hype-driven projects. It has captured the attention of over 32,000 users, raising over $6.9 million with projections that it can exceed $7 million by the end of the month. The KANG token is now listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which can drive interest further, alongside its anticipated BitMart listing.
The unique Social-Fi model also incentivizes pre-launch social media engagement and fosters strong community engagement as the most active users get rewards in the form of KANG tokens. Moreover, the project also establishes a sustainable economic model, positioning KANG as a top contender for diversification. Historically, the value of the crypto has risen from $0.005 to $0.025, a climb of 400%, and according to analysts, following its launch and major exchange listings it can rise by 100x, positioning it as the best cryptocurrency to invest in.
Which Crypto Will Follow BTC’s Momentum?
It’s clear that both Core and Render have showcased remarkable growth on the charts. Yet, the most significant gains have been made by the KangaMoon token as it’s up 400% and this has made it a top crypto to buy. At this rate of growth it is likely to follow in the footsteps of BTC, which could reach $100,000 soon.

Pepe 69 (PEPE69) Will Surge 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe 69 (PEPE69) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe 69 (PEPE69), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe 69 presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe 69 has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe 69 could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Pepe 69 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe 69 on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe 69 by entering its contract address – EvevUFVUUFR2NZVSkVzRTj1SQ6KRKdsZqdkpWinkh8m1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPE69.

Tons of Volatility Amid SEC's Ethereum ETF Approval: BTC and ETH Drop by 4% (Market Watch)


																The crypto market is quite susceptible to ETF approvals, as it seems, and the past 24 hours brought even more enhanced volatility for the entire sector.
After the hype from the start of the business week settled, the largest cryptocurrencies, including the one that got the green light from the SEC, have turned red.
BTC Drops Below $67,000
The start of the current business week couldn’t really foresee what was going to happen. BTC had calmed at around $67,000 after the quiet weekend, but it all changed on Monday evening when reports emerged that the SEC could actually greenlight a spot Ethereum ETF by the end of the week.
Bitcoin, alongside most of the crypto market, went on a wild ride and soared by five grand in hours. This resulted in tapping its highest price tag in almost two months of nearly $72,000.
The rally came to a halt at that point and BTC started losing value gradually. Still, it traded in a range around $70,000 until yesterday evening when it slumped by a few grand to under $68,000. This came hours before the SEC’s deadline to make a decision on whether it will approve or reject all ETF applications.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


More volatility ensued when the regulator actually approved eight Ethereum ETFs, and BTC went down to $66,400 before it shot up by two grand. However, it has lost some ground once again and now struggles below $67,000.
Its market cap is down to $1.310 trillion, and its dominance over the alts is 50.2%.
Bitcoin/Price/Chart 24.05.2024. Source: TradingView
Alts in Red
The aforementioned developments around the Ethereum ETFs impacted the underlying asset’s price the most, as expected. ETH skyrocketed by over 20% on Monday to a six-week peak of its own at over $3,900. It also went down and up yesterday ahead of the SEC approval but now sits 4% down on the day at $3,655.
The rest of the larger-cap alts are in no better state. Solana, Dogecoin, Toncoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and Shiba Inu have all dumped by 5-8%. BNB, XRP, TRX, and BCH are also in the red.
The total crypto market cap has lost over $100 billion since yesterday and is down to $2.617 trillion on CG.

From Crypto King's Perch to Auction Block: FTX Bahamas Penthouse for Sale


							

FTX’s $30 million Orchid penthouse is now up for sale.



FTX overpaid for its Bahamian properties, creating a bubble market.



Liquidation hopes to recover losses for FTX creditors.




A lavish penthouse atop the Orchid building in Nassau, Bahamas, is set for sale as part of the ongoing liquidation of assets belonging to bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. This opulent property, once the headquarters of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, stands as a symbol of the company’s meteoric rise and swift downfall.



Real estate experts believe FTX overpaid for its Bahamian properties, creating a bubble market. Nassau’s developer, Jason Kinsale, and real estate appraiser, Robin Brownrigg, anticipate challenges in recouping the original investments. For example, a similar apartment in the same building recently listed for $29 million, indicating losses after taxes and fees.



FTX’s liquidation involves $255 million worth of properties, including 52 apartments and lots in luxury developments like Albany, a high-end enclave home to celebrities like Tiger Woods and Justin Timberlake. FTX’s real estate spree included $140 million for 15 apartments and a villa in Albany alone, with the Orchid penthouse as its crown jewel.



Despite rising luxury real estate prices in the Bahamas, agents are skeptical about achieving the initial purchase prices. Earlier assessments, like the $8.8 million Honeycomb property now valued at $5.9 million, suggest significant overpayments.



FTX’s asset liquidation, managed by PwC, aims to recover losses for creditors. As sales commence, the Bahamian community looks forward to moving past the Bankman-Fried saga, with hopes of a fair market resolution for these high-profile properties.









According to the Bureau of Prisons website, the FTX co-founder is now at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison by Judge Lewis Kaplan, had been preparing for his trial from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. 



Judge Kaplan said on Wednesday that he stayed in Brooklyn to facilitate access to his appellate counsel. Mark Botnick, Bankman-Fried’s spokesman, expressed hope that the Bureau of Prisons would follow the court’s recommendation to ensure proper legal access. Bankman-Fried had requested to remain at MDC, despite his complaints about the facility last year. 



He may eventually serve the rest of his sentence at a prison closer to his family in California. The Oklahoma facility is designated as a transfer center and is intended to hold inmates for four-to-six weeks.

When Spot Ethereum ETFs Go Live 'Expect A Bloodbath': Expert


																Thomas Fahrer, co-founder of Apollo, a firm focused on Bitcoin adoption, has issued a stark warning regarding the potential market dynamics following the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. As the market anticipates this new development, Fahrer suggests that the transition might not be smooth for Ethereum.
“The Grayscale Ethereum Trust launched in 2017 and accumulated most of its $9 billion dollars worth of ETH well before staking existed. These funds will be unlocked now. Expect a bloodbath. It will accelerate the ETH -> BTC Trade. Hold me to account if I’m wrong. But I doubt it,” Fahrer declared via social media platform X.
Spot Ethereum ETFs – A “Sell The News” Event?
The imminent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, similar to earlier this year’s launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, is expected to convert the $9 billion (approximately 2.94 million ETH) locked in Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into one such ETF. Historical precedent with Bitcoin suggests potential volatility; after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin experienced more than a 20% drop in value within 12 days amid significant sell-offs from similar conversions.

	Related Reading


One of the main reasons the spot BTC ETF approval turned out to be a “sell the news” event was Grayscale’s transition from an Ethereum Trust to a spot ETF. Until now, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw outflows of more than 50% of its BTC holdings. And the ETHE could be reinforced by the fact that ETH staking is a lucrative option to earn an additional yield.
Currently, Grayscale holds over $9 billion in locked Ethereum that cannot be sold or traded until the ETF is operational. Should the approval go through, this large amount of Ethereum will suddenly become liquid, potentially leading to substantial market sell-offs if initial demand does not meet the volume of outflows from Grayscale’s new ETF.

	Related Reading


Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, highlighted a critical market indicator that could suggest the market has already begun to react. “Seems like the market has already priced the Ethereum spot ETF approval. Grayscale’s ETHE discount to ETH has significantly narrowed in the last few days. The same happened between GBTC and Bitcoin as the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval was nearing,” Moreno noted via X.
While the short-term impact might mirror the turbulent times seen during the Bitcoin ETF launch, the long-term implications for Ethereum could be different. Observers note that despite the initial downturns seen in Bitcoin’s valuation post-ETF, the introduction of a spot ETF was eventually beneficial, leading to greater market acceptance and a price surge.
“BTC rallied 75% in 63 days after the spot ETF was approved. If ETH follows the same trend (if approved), this would take it to $6,446 by July 23,” crypto analyst Miles Deutscher noted.
At press time, ETH traded at $3,676.

Active Hours in Hong Kong ETF Market! What About Entries and Exits for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Hong Kong's cryptocurrency market experienced notable movements on Thursday, with three spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recording net outflows of 25.63 BTC. In contrast, the region's spot Ethereum ETFs remained stable, reporting no new inflows or outflows.
Hong Kong's Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Outflows, While Ethereum ETFs Remain Stable
The total net assets of Hong Kong's three spot Bitcoin ETFs stood at $254.74 million as of Thursday, according to SosoValue data.


In the Ethereum market, Hong Kong's three spot Ethereum ETFs remained unchanged with zero flows on Thursday. This was followed by an entry of 62.8 ETH on Wednesday. The combined net assets of these Ethereum ETFs were worth $50.83 million.
Meanwhile, in the United States, the cryptocurrency ETF landscape has shown opposite trends. The 11 spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. reported their ninth consecutive day of inflows on Thursday, attracting a significant $107.91 million.






This influx of investment coincided with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of 19b-4 forms for eight spot Ethereum ETFs and reflected changing political dynamics among lawmakers.
Justin d'Anethan, head of APAC business development at crypto market maker Keyrock, commented on the divergent performance of ETH spot ETFs.


“Admittedly, the ETH spot ETF in Hong Kong accounts for approximately 15% of the total local spot ETF AUM, with the remainder allocated to BTC. A similar proportion can be expected in the US or abroad,” he said.
“This is likely due to the fact that no staking rewards have been offered so far, making spot ETH ETFs an inferior investment product compared to native tokens.”

Why Is The Crypto Market Down Today?


The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) fell below the crucial support of $2.50 trillion, along with Bitcoin, which is currently trading at $67,300. The mixed signal arose from the bearish macro and bullish crypto market developments, impacting BTC and altcoins, of which Ordinals took the biggest hit.
In the news today:-

Today, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved all eight spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF filings. However, the S-1 registration approval is still pending, so it will be a while before these ETFs can be listed.
The US House of Representatives voted to pass the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act. This amends the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 to prohibit Federal Reserve banks from offering and using CBDCs for monetary purposes.


The Total Crypto Market Cap Dips
The total crypto market cap has slipped below the $2.50 trillion support floor. This is a crucial psychological level, and losing it is not a good sign for the market. Given the rather bearish macro conditions, the chances of a decline are much higher.
Due to the higher real interest rates, even the news of the spot Ethereum ETF approval could not counter the bearishness, resulting in an overall decline in the market. This drawdown could extend, with TOTAL falling to $2.39 trillion.

However, if $2.50 is reclaimed, the winds could shift in favor of a rise, pushing TOTAL to $2.60 trillion.
Bitcoin’s Price Loses Key Support Level
Bitcoin’s price registered a red candlestick for the fourth day in a row, falling from the high of $71,800 to $67,293 at the time of writing. As BTC fell below the support of $68,500, it extended the bearishness among investors, which could potentially drag Bitcoin down to the next crucial support of $64,883.

On the other hand, despite the decline, BTC is moving within the flag pattern it has been in since early February. Reclaiming the $68,500 support could resume this bullish incline, potentially sending BTC back to $71,800.

Ordinals Loses the Uptrend
Ordinals’ price had been in an uptrend for the past ten days but fell through the line over the past 24 hours. The altcoin noted a 10% decline in this duration, resulting in ORDI changing hands at $37.4 at the moment.
As a result, the potential for breaching the critical resistance of $44 seems to have been delayed, as ORDI would need to note a 12% recovery in order to reach this price.

But if it does manage to, it will not only successfully invalidate the bearish thesis but also increase ORDI holders’ profits.

Goodbye Kabosu: Dogecoin's Beloved Shiba Inu Mascot Passes Away | Bitcoinist.com


								In an emotional announcement through its X account, Dogecoin confirmed the passing of Kabosu, the beloved dog that became the face of the popular cryptocurrency. According to the post, Kabosu passed away peacefully on the morning of May 24th at 7:50 am, surrounded by care and comfort.
“Today Kabosu, our community’s shared friend and inspiration, peacefully passed in the arms of her person. The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable. She was a being who knew only happiness and limitless love. Please keep her spirit and her family in your heart, and most importantly carry her with you as your story continues – we are all fortunate for hers to have touched and shaped ours. Thank you, Pumpkin!” the post reads.
Dogecoin’s Beloved Shiba Inu Dies At Age 17
Kabosu, a Shiba Inu, became an internet sensation due to her distinctively alert and endearing expression, which was captured in a photograph by her owner. This image later became the iconic face of Dogecoin, symbolizing the playful spirit of the digital currency that was originally created as a joke.

Kabosu’s likeness helped fuel the meme-driven rise of Dogecoin, which has since evolved into a significant player within the cryptocurrency community. The official blog post shared by Dogecoin recounts the serene moments leading up to Kabosu’s passing:
“Last night as usual, [Kabosu] ate rice and drank plenty of water too. From the window, the soft light shone in, outside the window the birds sang on a beautiful morning, while I stroked her like she was sleeping, she passed away quietly.”
The blog also highlighted the deep bond between Kabosu and her owner, who expressed profound gratitude towards everyone who cherished Kabosu over the years: “For a long time, Kabosu was loved by all of you, and for that, I am really thankful. Kabosu was the happiest dog in the world, and I was the happiest owner. She is still now, smiling and wagging her tail, staying close to me.”

Kabosu was adopted by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato from a pet shelter in 2008, after being rescued from a puppy mill. Her serene and slightly amused expression in a 2010 photograph posted online caught the eyes of netizens, leading to widespread meme circulation.
The meme popularity ultimately inspired the creation of Dogecoin in December 2013. The founders of Dogecoin, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, chose Kabosu’s image for the logo of their new cryptocurrency to reflect its fun and friendly ethos, markedly different from the more serious tone of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
Dogecoin has since witnessed significant growth, both in value and in its community, with Kabosu’s image at the forefront, symbolizing both the whimsy and the unexpected success of the digital currency.
Dogecoin’s community has expressed widespread condolences. Sato announced a farewell party: “We will be holding a farewell party for Kabo-chan on Sunday, May 26th. It will be held at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City, from 1pm to 4pm.”
At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1585.

Will XRP’s price drop to $0.47 amid bearish indicators? - AMBCrypto



Selling pressure on XRP has increased in the last seven days.
Most technical indicators suggested that XRP wouldn’t test the bearish pattern. 

XRP had an optimistic week as its price increased by over 2%, but volatility dropped. The recent slow-moving price action might just be a prelude for a southward price movement as a bearish pattern emerged on the token’s chart. 
XRP’s bearish outlook
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that the token’s momentum declined as its price only moved marginally in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5297 with a market capitalization of over $29.3 billion, making it the seventh largest crypto. 
In the meantime, a bearish pattern emerged on the token’s daily chart. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis found that a bearish pennant pattern formed in mid-April when XRP witnessed a major price drop. Since then, the token’s price has consolidated inside the pattern. 
If XRP tests the pattern, then its price action would soon turn bearish and plummet under the lower trendline, which would result in a further southward price movement. 
Source: TradingView
AMBCrypto then analyzed Santiment’s data to see whether metrics backed the possibility of a price decline. 
As per our analysis, XRP’s exchange inflow spiked several times last week. A rise in the metric meant that investors were dumping the token, suggesting high selling pressure.
 Its NVT ratio also shot up sharply on the 24th of May, indicating that XRP might be overvalued. Whenever an asset is overvalued, it hints at a price correction.
 Another bearish metric was the MVRV ratio, which declined in the last few days. 
Source: Santiment
However, a few of the other metrics looked pretty optimistic. For instance, the token’s weighted sentiment increased. This meant that investors were confident in the token, as bullish sentiment around it was dominant in the market.
 AMBCrypto’s look at Coinglass’ data revealed that the token’s long/short ratio also increased in the last 12 hours. A high long-short ratio can be inferred as a bullish signal as it suggests a greater desire among investors to buy an asset.
Source: Coinglass
Which way is XRP headed?
To better understand whether XRP would turn bearish soon, AMBCrypto then took a look at its daily chart. We found that after a dip, XRP’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick.
 The Money Flow Index (MFI) also went northward, indicating a price rise. If these indicators turn out to be true, then XRP might not test the bearish pennant pattern and continue to remain bullish.

If XRP manages to remain bullish, then its price might reach $0.544 first, as liquidation would rise at that level. Generally, high liquidation results in price corrections. 
On the other hand, if XRP tests the bearish pattern, then its price might plummet to $0.47 in the coming days.

In Meme-oriam: Kabosu, Original Doge Who Inspired Dogecoin, Has Passed Away - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe beloved Shiba Inu, Kabosu, who became a popular meme that eventually inspired the launch of Dogecoin in 2013, has passed away.Her owner, 62-year-old kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato, who lives in the city of Sakura in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, confirmed the news Friday in a blog post. She also wrote a poem about the dog's passing."At 7:50 a.m., I fell into a deep sleep," a translated copy of the poem says.It was just this time last year that Own the Doge, a Doge-oriented NFT community backed by Doge DAO, a doge-focused decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), organized a trip for Kabosu fans to meet the pup that inspired so many memes.The Doge DAO was born out of PleasrDAO, a collection of NFT artists and collectors who pool their funds to acquire culturally relevant digital art.The original photos were taken by Atsuko herself and uploaded to her blog in 2010. Then some internet alchemy happened.The word "Doge" was taken from a 2009 Strong Bad video. It has become internet shorthand for "cute dog." The word was combined with the photos and then captioned with colorful snippets of internal dialogue for the dogs written in Comic Sans—the font is very important—like on the Shiba Confessions Tumblr page.Source: Exodus WalletA few years later, Jackson Palmer launched Dogecoin in 2013. It was mostly a joke coin, although it was used to raise money for charities. But by early 2021, the r/WallStreetBets community on Reddit banded together to pump the price of Dogecoin. That May, Dogecoin skyrocketed to an all-time high of $0.7316.At one point, investor Mark Cuban even predicted that Dogecoin would hit $1 and become a stablecoin.It should come as no surprise that degens found a way to sell the news, no matter how somber. One trader who appears to have been accumulating billions of KABOSU meme coins sold their entire bag for $230 thousand after the death was confirmed.At the time of writing, the DOGE price has slipped 5% compared to this time yesterday and is trading for $0.15. But it's not just Dogecoin (DOGE) that was inspired by Kabosu. DOGE gave rise to an entire category of dog-themed meme coins, like Shiba Inu, Floki Inu, and more recent upstarts like Dogwifhat.The entire category appears to be mourning the loss of Kabosu.

Empowering Creativity With Suno AI Music, Attracts $125 M


                                VC Invested $125 Million In AI Music Creation Platform                                What's the NewsThe company has received a major boost from venture capital investors who have invested $125 million in the AI music creation platform. Suno is an application that uses artificial intelligence to create music from the input that it receives and is in the process of democratizing beat-making. The company intends to invest a large amount of funding into the development of future products and hiring new team members. During the announcement, Suno also previewed a song created using AI technology to show its potential.Suno’s platform was begun eight months ago and allows people to make songs based on text inputs. The users can even type in the kind of song they want, whether it should be accompanied by vocals or just instrumental. The platform is not only creating the actual music, but also the album covers and the titles and all of these can be changed. The users have the flexibility to edit the lyrics created by the AI and can also increase or decrease the length of the songs.Suno created a two-minute song labeled “trap, energetic, upbeat” and provided detailed lyrics that fit the subject of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Suno also says that 10 million people have used the platform and it has been popular among Grammy Award-winning artists. The last week has seen an overall positive trend in social media conversations with users expressing satisfaction with the tool that enables them to create their songs.Impact Of AI Music Creation Platform on the Crypto IndustryThe interest in Suno is even more applicable to the crypto industry because it is a manifestation of the general trend of AI integration into the creative industries. The lyrics created by Suno were focused on the ideas of disruption and decentralization the principles that are guiding the crypto world.The given platform may have some impact on how content is created and consumed within the crypto community. This means that Suno and similar AI tools can help make music production more accessible and therefore increase its use by the crypto community. Picking up on the concept and being able to create music that fits a particular theme will also make events such as podcasts and promotions more enjoyable to the audience and the creators.However, major music companies such as Universal Music and Sony have continued to fight AI developers to ensure that their artists’ rights to their work are not infringed. This tension is not unlike issues faced in the crypto space where the delicate line between innovation and regulation is always a topic of debate.ConclusionSuno’s recent $125 million funding round shows that there is high demand for AI-based creative tools and that music creation could become accessible to anyone. The platform of Suno is user-friendly and anyone can produce good quality music by just inputting text messages, thus increasing the access to beat-making. The graphical interface of the platform that allows the creation of not only the music but also the artwork and lyrics makes the platform stand out from the other AI music tools.The effect on the crypto industry is significant because AI-generated music can improve content production and interaction with the audience. Suno’s capacity to create music with a given theme and within the topics of the project, including blockchain and cryptocurrency demonstrates that AI can provide creative value within the industry. However, the fight for the protection of copyright and intellectual property rights continues to be a major issue that has to be faced.Overall, it is clear according to CoinGabbar that Suno is an indicator of the increased use of artificial intelligence in creative industries, especially in the future of crypto. It will be quite fascinating to observe how platforms like Suno will help in defining the direction of music production and other forms of creation in the future as AI technology develops.Also Read: Blockchain Gaming Investment Hit $1 Billion In April

Why Is the Ether ($ETH) Price Going Down Despite the Good News From U.S. SEC Regarding Spot Ether ETFs? | Cryptoglobe


                                
On May 23, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to applications from major exchanges like Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the price of Ether. This move has the potential to open the doors for these products to start trading later this year, pending final approvals from the ETF issuers themselves.







The cryptocurrency industry was caught off guard by this decision, as it had been largely expecting the SEC to reject the filings until Monday. The approval marks a significant milestone for the nine issuers, including big names like VanEck, ARK Investments/21Shares, and BlackRock, who are now one step closer to launching spot Ether ETFs following the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.



According to a report by Reuters, Andrew Jacobson, vice president and head of legal at 21Shares, described the moment as “exciting” and “a significant step” towards getting the products to market. The SEC’s apparent change of heart has left many in the industry puzzled, with the regulator’s chair, Gary Gensler, declining to comment on the decision.



The approval process is not yet complete, as the ETF issuers still need the SEC to approve their registration statements detailing investor disclosures. While there is no set timeline for this, industry participants believe that many issuers are ready to launch once they receive the green light. However, the SEC’s corporate finance division is expected to request changes and updates in the coming days and weeks.







At the time of writing (9:23 a.m. UTC on May 24), ETH is trading at around $3,655, down 4.6% in the past 24-hour period. 







As cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe explained earlier today, the Ether price did not surge following the news that the SEC had approved 19b-4 filings for spot Ether ETFs from the sponsor changes because this approval had already been priced in. In fact, many in the crypto space were expecting that such approval would enable these ETFs to start trading as early as this week or next week, and when people realized that there could be several more months of waiting before the launch of these ETFs happens, there was disappointment, which seems to have led to some selling pressure.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The eventual approval of US-listed spot Ether ETFs would be another positive development for the cryptocurrency industry, which has been making significant strides towards mainstream finance. The recent passage of a landmark bill in the U.S. House of Representatives seeking to provide regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies, coupled with the UK regulator’s approval of listed cryptocurrency products, further demonstrates the growing acceptance and legitimacy of digital assets.



In a recent blog post, CCData, a leading provider of institutional-grade market data for digital assets, explained that a significant SEC decision could impact investors. The SEC has decided to prohibit staking in the initial ETFs, meaning entities holding potential ETH ETFs will miss out on the annual yield from Ethereum staking. CCData illustrated a scenario where holding native Ether with staking rewards over a decade shows substantially higher returns compared to holding an ETF without staking, highlighting potential investor losses.



Despite Ethereum’s recent struggles in trading activity on centralized exchanges and on-chain activity compared to other altcoins and Layer 2 solutions, the approval of spot ETH ETFs could revitalize the Ethereum ecosystem. CCData suggests that increased network usage and Ethereum’s deflationary supply mechanism might create favorable supply dynamics and boost Ethereum’s price.



The CCData Research team analyzed potential inflows for Ethereum ETFs, predicting substantial amounts if they attract a portion of the funds that have flowed into Bitcoin ETFs. Their linear regression analysis indicates a potential 30% price increase for Ethereum within the next 100 days if there is a significant shift in funds. However, the team also notes that Ethereum might face short-term struggles due to outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, similar to what happened after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.



The CCData Research team also explored unique factors that could impact ETH ETF net flows and prices, such as order book liquidity, the deflationary supply mechanism, staked supply, and Grayscale’s strategic management. These factors could amplify price reactions, reduce selling pressure, and potentially lead to greater net inflows and price stability for Ethereum.

Bitcoin Faces Resistance Hurdle: Will 2024 Be the Breakout Year?


							

Bitcoin faces resistance after historical trends post-halving, hinting at short-term volatility.



Tom Lee’s bullish $150,000 BTC forecast for 2024 stems from macroeconomic shifts and Fed policies.



Despite short-term dips, Bitcoin’s potential for significant gains aligns with broader analyst sentiment.




Bitcoin is currently facing resistance at its upper range, indicating potential volatility in the short term. According to a recent analysis by Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has historically never been ready to break out of a re-accumulation range so soon after a halving event. As Bitcoin prices struggle at this high resistance, the cryptocurrency market remains in a state of flux.







The current Bitcoin price stands at $67,264.08, reflecting a 3.13% decline in the past 24 hours. Trading volume in the same period reached $43.099B. Despite the recent dip, Bitcoin’s market capitalization remains robust at $1.325T. The circulating supply of Bitcoin is 19.702M BTC, with a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC.



However, veteran crypto market commentator Tom Lee maintains a bullish outlook for Bitcoin in 2024. In an interview with CNBC earlier in May, Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, reiterated his optimistic price prediction for Bitcoin, forecasting it could reach $150,000 by 2024.







Lee’s bullish stance is not without reason. He believes Bitcoin is still early in an upcycle, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could achieve a six-figure price within the year. This projection implies a significant rise from the current all-time highs, which peaked in March before declining to $56,000 at the start of May.



Lee’s optimism is underpinned by anticipated macroeconomic changes in the US. He points out that the Federal Reserve’s recent dovish stance on interest rate cuts is a crucial factor for risk-asset traders. Lee suggests that the market’s recovery is partly due to the Federal Reserve’s softer stance on interest rates, which he views as beneficial for Bitcoin’s price trajectory.



 
 




It is to be noted that Tom Lee gained attention in the cryptocurrency industry for his strong Bitcoin price projections. Although not all of his predictions have come true, his long-term vision has consistently rewarded Bitcoin investors. Lee’s recent estimate follows the opinions of many analysts, who believe Bitcoin is poised for tremendous growth in coming years.

Ethereum (ETH) Statement from Consensys, Which Filed a Lawsuit with the SEC! "He Both Praised and Criticized!" - Bitcoin Sistemi

As you may remember, Consensys, one of the biggest names in the Ethereum ecosystem, filed a lawsuit against the SEC last April on the grounds that it was trying to qualify Ethereum as a security.
In this case, Consensy asked the court to find that ETH is not a security.



While the case was ongoing, the SEC approved spot Ethereum ETF applications and made a major decision.
While this decision was welcomed by the market and investors, an ETF statement came from Consensys.





Accordingly, Consensys stated that they found the ETF approval decision correct and welcomed it, but argued that the SEC's sanctions against the cryptocurrency industry were unfair and hindered innovation.

“Regarding today's SEC decision:
While Consensys welcomes today's decision to approve ETH Spot ETFs as a step in the right direction, this seemingly last-minute approval is yet another example of the SEC's troubling ad hoc approach to digital assets.
No industry, market or asset other than the cryptocurrency industry is subject to such willful regulatory abuses. This restrictive stance by the SEC is unfair to market participants, contrary to the rule of law, and stifles innovation.
Today's approval demonstrates that the SEC considers ETH to be a commodity and not a security, contrary to the negative stance it continued to take prior to this week's events, as explained in our recent lawsuit against the SEC.
“We will continue to fight for definitive regulatory clarity on Ethereum, and we are pleased to see Congress' tremendous bipartisan effort to provide clear and sensible regulation.”

XRP Declares War On Uncertainty: Analyst Predicts Breakout


																XRP, a crypto that has faced regulatory challenges, is back in the spotlight with analyst Dark Defender predicting a potential price surge by mid-2024. Defender’s analysis hinges on a confluence of factors, including technical indicators, anticipated regulatory changes, and broader market trends.

	Related Reading


Technical Breakout Aligns With Regulatory Shift
Utilizing Fibonacci Time Zones and Elliott Wave Theory, Defender forecasts a significant price increase for XRP before July. This technical prediction coincides with potential regulatory developments that could reshape the cryptocurrency landscape.

The recent passage of the FIT21 Bill by the US House of Representatives is seen as a significant step towards establishing clearer regulations for digital assets. This could create a more welcoming environment for cryptocurrencies like XRP, potentially leading to wider adoption and increased investor confidence.

Investors Embrace Crypto, But Newcomer Shakes Things Up
The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a growing appetite from institutional investors, with Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) increasingly incorporating digital assets into their offerings.
This trend signifies growing recognition of the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies and could provide a significant boost to XRP’s value. The inclusion of cryptocurrencies in ETFs validates their legitimacy and opens the door for a wider pool of institutional capital to flow into the crypto space.
XRP is currently trading at $0,52. Chart: TradingView
Legal Battle Looms Large, Verdict Could Impact XRP’s Trajectory
Perhaps the most significant factor influencing XRP’s future lies in the ongoing legal battle surrounding its regulatory status. A verdict, expected any day now, could have a profound impact on the currency’s trajectory.
A favorable outcome could eliminate a major hurdle for XRP, paving the way for wider acceptance and market growth. Conversely, an unfavorable verdict could create new regulatory roadblocks, hindering XRP’s progress.

	Related Reading


The legal battle casts a long shadow over XRP’s future. Investors should be mindful of this uncertainty, but they should also consider the positive technical indicators and the changing regulatory landscape. The coming months will be crucial for XRP, and the outcome of the lawsuit could very well define its role in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Ethereum Set For 60% Rally Following ETF Approval, Says Expert: 'The Market Is Expecting Fireworks' - Benzinga

The price of Ethereum ETH/USD could soar by 60% following the approval of the first-ever Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds by U.S. regulators, according to a leading crypto trading firm.What Happened: The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first Ethereum spot ETFs in the U.S. This decision could lead to a significant surge in the value of the second-largest cryptocurrency, according to a post on Telegram from the crypto trading firm QCP Capital.QCP Capital predicted a 60% increase in the value of Ethereum after the ETF approval. The news of the potential approval has already caused Ethereum’s price to surge by nearly 20% since Monday.“With Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,” QCP wrote. See Also: Bonk, Pepe Outstrip Gains Of Bitcoin, Ethereum Amid Searing Hot Rally — Beat Biggies Dogecoin And Shiba Inu In Trading VolumesQCP Capital also pointed out that the approval of Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs in January led to a significant surge in Bitcoin’s value. Since then, Bitcoin has reached an all-time high of over $73,000. This has also resulted in a substantial increase in Ethereum purchases, with CryptoQuant data showing an 85% rise in Ethereum taker buy volume since May 1.Why It Matters: The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. The approval of Ethereum ETFs would open the door for mainstream investors to access the cryptocurrency, potentially leading to a surge in its value. This development could also affect other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, which may find it harder to outperform Ethereum after the ETF approval.Moreover, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could have political implications. As Cathie Wood predicted, crypto could be a significant issue in the 2024 White House race. The approval of Ethereum ETFs could further solidify the importance of crypto in the political landscape.Additionally, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could bring back the “animal spirits” to the crypto market, as predicted by a crypto trader.

Long-term Bitcoin bull and MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has published a Bitcoin message to the BTC community after the news spread about the U.S. Securities and Exchange issuing approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds.Saylor still expects Bitcoin to beat Ethereum and all other rivals on the market, according to his tweet.Saylor's "Bitcoin Godzilla" messageProminent Bitcoin maximalist Saylor posted a “BTC bullish” response to the rejoiced crypto community: “All your models are destroyed when Godzilla arrives. #Bitcoin,” along with an image of the movie-based monster crashing everything around itself.The Godzilla image has a BTC mascot in the bottom right corner as if hinting at the immense power of Bitcoin that its followers believe in and the future impact on the market they expect to see. Bitcoin maxi Samson Mow confirms bearish ETH outlookAnother Bitcoin maximalist, CEO of Jan3 Samson Mow, also responded to the Ethereum ETF approval negatively.Mow believed that the odds of spot Ethereum ETFs getting approved had been always 50/50. He reckons that the only real reason that stands behind the approval is that the SEC had pushed themselves into a corner, so they “had no choice but to let it through.” Mow reminded that, for him, ETF approval “does not change the bearish outlook for Ethereum at all.” Earlier this week, Mow tweeted that now is the last chance to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC.On Thursday, the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, responded to the ETF news with an almost 5% increase, surging to the $3.937 level. However, a rebound followed, taking Ethereum down by 6.86%. At the time of this writing, ETH is changing hands at $3,664 per coin.

Crypto Analyst Predicts 75%+ Rally for Top-10 Altcoin, Maps Path Forward for Bitcoin and One Ethereum Rival - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is forecasting that one blue-chip altcoin could rally by double-digits.
The analyst pseudonymously known as The Crypto Dog tells his 782,000 followers on the social media platform X that Dogecoin (DOGE) could hit a price of $0.30, about 78% above the current level if Bitcoin (BTC) records a new all-time high.

Turning to Bitcoin, The Crypto Dog says that the largest digital asset by market cap could be on the cusp of another bullish cycle.
“We might be getting to the spot where you can hold BTC long for a few weeks into continual new highs.
Fingers crossed, it’s been a while.”

Crypto Bounces Back, But Stablecoins Emerge As Investor Safe Haven


								The once-frenzied cryptocurrency market seems to be taking a deep breath. Forget moon shots, investors are increasingly seeking a crypto sanctuary: stablecoins. These cryptocurrencies are pegged to real-world assets like the US dollar, offering a haven from the wild price swings that plague Bitcoin and its brethren.

Dominant Tether Faces Rising USDC Star
The trend is undeniable. Sentiment analysis firm Santiment reveals a dramatic rise in wallets holding stablecoins, especially in 2024. This newfound love affair is evident in the growth of USDC, a stablecoin issued by Circle.
USDC boasts a staggering 14% increase in active wallets this year alone, potentially dethroning the reigning champion, Tether (USDT). While Tether maintains a sizable lead with nearly 6 million active wallets, USDC’s impressive growth suggests a changing of the guard. Investors are clearly seeking diversification within the stablecoin market, aiming for a more balanced and secure ecosystem.


Emerging Markets Seek Stable Refuge
This allure of stablecoins isn’t limited to established markets. They’re finding fertile ground in economies grappling with currency fluctuations. While the US gobbled up more than $25 billion in stablecoins in January this year alone, the real story lies in countries like Turkey, the European Union and the US, to name a few.
These economies are witnessing a significant surge in stablecoin adoption relative to their GDP. This suggests that stablecoins are more than just a tool for sophisticated investors; they’re a potential lifeline for those battling volatile national currencies.

By offering a stable store of value and a reliable medium of exchange, stablecoins provide a level of financial security and accessibility that traditional cryptocurrencies have struggled to achieve in these regions.
Beyond TradFi: Stablecoins Fuel DeFi Boom
The stablecoin revolution isn’t confined to the sidelines of the crypto arena. It’s having a profound impact on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms as well. MakerDAO’s DAI, a decentralized stablecoin, has witnessed a significant rise, with over 500,000 active wallets.

This surge highlights the growing importance of stable assets within the DeFi landscape. Investors are using stablecoins to mitigate the risks associated with the inherent volatility of other cryptocurrencies within DeFi protocols.

A Symbiotic Dance Between Risk And Reward
The rise of stablecoins might be the harbinger of a new era for cryptocurrencies – one where innovation and stability coexist. As investors seek a middle ground between high-risk, high-reward opportunities and the need for financial security, stablecoins have emerged as a crucial bridge.

Solana mulls 50% priority fee burn cut: Here's what it means - AMBCrypto



Solana proposes to reward validators full priority fees by scrapping 50% burn.
Community divided over the proposal as priority fee-induced inflation and validator rewards interests compete. 

Solana [SOL] community remains divided on the proposal to remove the 50% priority fee burn and fully reward validators. 
The proposal, SIMD-0096, aims to incentivize validators by paying them 100% priority fees, as opposed to the current 50% reward and 50% burn. 
For the unfamiliar, Solana’s priority fees are paid by users with urgent transactions who wish to avoid network congestion. In return, validators can prioritize and fast-track their transactions, a critical way Solana mitigates network congestion. 
The problem with Solana’s 50% priority fee burn removal
Notably, the current method of 50% reward and 50% burn on SOL earned as priority fees is deemed deflationary. 
If the proposal passes, validators will receive 100% priority fees and none burnt, which will mean more SOL issuance and inflationary pressures. One opponent to the proposal noted, 
‘Solana’s inflation is about to increase as validators vote to pay themselves more. More traffic on SOL network? More tokens from thin air go to validators that will dump on you.’
One of the leading Solana validators, Stakewiz, recently registered reservations about the proposal, citing its potential to surge SOL’s issuance by 4.6% and drive inflation. Instead, the validator proposed a new fee distribution mechanism. 
‘I would strongly support holding off on the activation of SIMD-0096 until a block fee distribution mechanism is available.’
However, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakavenko noted that such a mechanism would take ‘6 months to 1 year’ to become operational. 
So why the proposal, and why now? You might ask. 
Apparently, the current 50-50 arrangement allows other validators to engage in opaque and ‘off-chain side deals.’ 
This, per Solana core dev Anza, could sometimes be costly to users as some cough higher fees than the required 50%. The proposal could solve this problem, per Anza. 
The sentiment was echoed by another user, an engineer at Firedancer, an upcoming Solana client software, who supported the proposal but maintained it won’t necessarily ‘cure side deals.’
However, Stakewiz maintained its opposition to the proposal for lack of data-driven insights on the same. 
“I’m generally for a removal of priority fee burn, but I’m against this proposal for its lack of data-driven reasoning and failure to address the concern of priority fee inflation.’
The move is seen as more beneficial to validators than SOL users. It remains to be seen how SOL’s price will be affected after the proposal outcome.

Bitcoin Message From Michael Saylor After Ethereum ETF Approval: 'Bitcoin Will Be Crushed!' - Bitcoin Sistemi

MicroStrategy founder and leading Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor has issued a strong message to the Bitcoin community in response to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s recent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Michael Saylor Posts “Bitcoin Godzilla” Message Following Ethereum ETF Approval
Saylor, a well-known long-term Bitcoin bull, shared his unwavering belief in Bitcoin's dominance on 'X'.


His message, dubbed “Bitcoin Godzilla”, suggested that Bitcoin will continue to outperform Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in the market.
In a characteristically bold move, Saylor wrote: “When Godzilla comes, all your models disappear. #Bitcoin,” and shared an image of the famous movie monster Godzilla wreaking havoc.





The image also featured a small BTC mascot in the bottom right corner, symbolizing the immense power and market influence that Bitcoin enthusiasts like Saylor expect the cryptocurrency to have.

Supporting Saylor's views, Jan3 CEO and another staunch Bitcoin maximalist, Samson Mow, responded negatively to the Ethereum ETF approval.


“The odds of Spot Ethereum ETFs being approved were always 50/50,” Mow said, suggesting that the SEC approving Ethereum ETFs was almost inevitable due to regulatory pressures.
Mow reiterated his bearish stance on Ethereum, emphasizing that the ETF approval does not change his negative outlook on the cryptocurrency.





Earlier this week, Mow reinforced his position by tweeting that this was the last opportunity to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC.

UK’s oldest news magazine slams ‘Bitcoin a threat to us all’ and a ‘Ponzi scheme’


    The traditional British magazine, The Spectator, may have contributed to another “Bitcoin obituary” in 2024, slamming it as a threat and a “Ponzi scheme.”



In a scathing article published on May 24, The Spectator‘s Ross Clark criticized Bitcoin’s (BTC) resurgence for retail investing. Particularly, Clark highlighted the cryptocurrency‘s volatility and ability to create and destroy fortunes rapidly, questioning its intrinsic value and stability.



The author pointed out Bitcoin’s remarkable recovery since January, despite the conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX. Moreover, Clark attributed this recovery to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that simplifies Bitcoin for retail investors.







While acknowledging the fund’s role in leveling the playing field, the author expressed concerns about its potential financial repercussions. He likened the mainstream accessibility of Bitcoin gambling to bookmakers setting up shop in every living room.



Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?



Notably, Clark emphasized that Bitcoin is a zero-sum game, where paper fortunes can be made but not realized simultaneously. As written, he argued that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value and is essentially a tech-reinvented Ponzi scheme.




“In that situation, those who were quick to sell would become rich at the expense of those who were slow to sell. Bitcoin earns no income and has no intrinsic value – it is, for all its cleverness, really nothing more sophisticated than a tech reinvention of the Ponzi scheme.”
– Ross Clark, for The Spectator




The author warned that easier Bitcoin access could lead to financial disasters and wealth transfer from gullible to fleet-footed investors. Although the price has stabilized recently, Clark cautioned against ruling out another speculative mania.



In closing, the Spectator article highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience through multiple bubbles, surpassing historical speculative assets like tulip bulbs and South Sea Company shares. Clark suggested that the Bitcoin spot ETF might inflate a fourth bubble, potentially destroying the wealth of even more people.



Bitcoin obituaries



Throughout its history, Bitcoin has been deemed a failure and declared dead by critics and skeptics. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s price has increased by $21,000 since the last time it happened in 2024.



From traditional finance investors to business owners, government entities, and other high-influence figures, Bitcoin “has died” 477 times since 2010. This data is from 99Bitcoins’ obituaries.



Recently, the leading cryptocurrency was declared dead by the European Central Bank (ECB) in a blog article reported by Finbold. On this occasion, BTC was trading at $51,304, and it was up over 30% to $67,000 by press time.

Bitcoin criticisms and points of failure



Despite the hyperbolic nature of a “Bitcoin death” statement, many of its obituaries contain thoughtful and valid criticisms.



Unfortunately, the BTC advocates create memes and personal attacks against their critics instead of considering the fundamental thesis behind their occurrence. This is a cultural inheritance from a movement called “toxic maximalism.”



Conversely, some critics have historically failed to demonstrate part of their criticisms, often driven by emotion and conflicts of interest.



Therefore, investors must be open to profoundly studying and understanding Bitcoin or other assets they are investing in. Bitcoin may not “die” and may not be a “Ponzi Scheme,” as The Spectator stated in its last article, but it certainly has points of failure and potential improvements.

Ethereum ETF approval sees minor decline in broader market, $400M in liquidations - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            After the dust settled on the craze around the SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETFs, the crypto market saw high levels of volatility. Data from CoinGecko shows that the top 20 digital assets (by market cap, excluding stablecoins) saw losses of roughly 3% each. Broadly, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) saw declines of 3.4% and 3.5%, respectively. BTC is now playing at $67.3K, with Ethereum cruising down at the street at $3.6K. At the time of writing, market-wide liquidations saw around $400 million in outflows.The market’s subdued performance resulted in over 107,000 crypto traders suffering losses exceeding $400 million. According to Coinglass liquidation data, ETH long traders, who expected the ETF news to boost the digital asset’s price, bore the brunt of these losses, totaling around $107 million.The largest single liquidation was a $12.4 million long bet on Ethereum on the Binance exchange. Bitcoin traders also lost approximately $75 million during the same period.Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, noted that the market had already priced in the Ethereum spot ETF approval, evidenced by the narrowing discount between Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH in the days leading up to the decision.https://twitter.com/jjcmoreno/status/1793706458393002203This analysis suggests that  ETH ETF approval was a “sell-the-news” event, with investors who anticipated the approval positioning accordingly. Notably, the past week saw ETH’s price rising by roughly 21%, with the Ethereum futures market hitting a one-year high of 3.6 million ETH.Muted market performance was also attributed to the delayed launch of the ETFs. While the SEC has approved the ETFs, they have yet to grant clearance for their launch, which requires an approved S-1 filing, though this is considered more of a formality. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst James Seyffart explains that the S-1 approval process could take a couple of weeks or longer.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Just Lost Critical Price Level

All struggles aside, Shiba Inu failed to gather any worthwhile positioning over and above the $0.000024 level and went down again, opening the doors to the bears. There is the potential for a bearish crossover of the 50-day and 100-day EMAs after this latest dip; otherwise, a sour picture will be painted.This has left SHIB investors anxious after the token plunged under the important support level, recently seen at $0.000024. This was a critical support level in light of igniting the price uptrend, but the break now opens the token to greater risks. With the current price quoted at $0.00002391, the possibility of more crashes looks imminent.The other, more technical, indicator to watch closely is the moving averages. The 50-day EMA is about to cross below the 100-day EMA, which is not as bearish a death cross but still a strong signal of an upcoming trend aggravation. Such a pattern is usually a very strong bearish indicator and signals that the downward trend may either continue or worsen.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe trading volumes have declined of late, suggesting that buyers are not interested at these levels. This lack of demand may prove difficult for SHIB to recover and make its way above the $0.000024 price level in the near term. In addition, the Relative Strength Index has fallen below the 50 level.There is, however, some hope. SHIB has been resilient before, and cryptocurrencies are volatile assets, so market sentiment can turn around in a few minutes. If price can hold in and around the next area of possible support — around $0.000021 — then there might still be hope of a move to the upside.As always, stay cautious and avoid FOMO and try to stay composed as the market is currently performing in a very unpredictable way.

RIP Kabosu: The Shiba Inu Who Inspired Dogecoin and Meme Culture


							

Kabosu, the Shiba Inu famous for the “Doge” meme and Dogecoin, passed away



A farewell party for Kabosu will be held on May 26 at Flower Kaori in Narita City



Analysts predict DOGE might drop initially but could rally due to strong emotional




Kabosu, the Shiba Inu who inspired the “Doge” meme and Dogecoin, passed away peacefully on May 24 at 18 years old. Her owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the news on her blog, expressing gratitude for the love and support she received over the years. A farewell party for Kabosu, also known as “Kabo-chan,” will be held on May 26 at Flower Kaori in Narita City.



Kabosu first garnered attention in 2010 when Sato posted photos of her on her blog. One particular image, showing Kabosu with a skeptical and curious expression, quickly went viral. This image became the “Doge” meme, often accompanied by phrases in broken English and Comic Sans font.



By 2013, Dogecoin was created, using Kabosu’s image as its official logo. Initially intended as a joke, Dogecoin evolved into a popular cryptocurrency. It has been involved in several charitable initiatives, including funding for clean water projects and the Jamaican bobsled team.



The crypto community and Kabosu’s fans have expressed their condolences. Tributes and favorite memories of the internet legend have flooded social media. In December 2022, Sato informed the community about Kabosu’s health issues, prompting an outpouring of support. Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, asked his followers to support Kabosu. One user even offered to cover any expenses for her treatment.



Following Kabosu’s passing, analysts predict a market reaction. According to Altcoin Sherpa, a crypto analyst, DOGE might experience a drop but could also spur a bullish sentiment. This could lead to Dogecoin rallying to $1. Despite the initial drop, the community’s strong emotional connection to Kabosu could drive a positive market response.







Kabosu’s impact has extended beyond cryptocurrency, even influencing political campaigns. For instance, U.S. President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign hired a “master of memes.” This role involves managing relationships with digital media companies, podcasts, and meme pages on social media.



In the wake of Kabosu’s passing, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu’s market performance has been impacted. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price has fallen 6.79% in the daily charts, 4.42% in the weekly charts, and 12.28% over the past month. Dogecoin (DOGE) has fallen 5.7% in the daily charts but is up 2.45% over the previous week.









Kabosu’s influence has demonstrated the power of the internet memes in shaping digital and political landscapes. Kabosu’s legacy on the other hand, as the face of Dogecoin, symbolizes community spirit and continues to inspire meme culture.

Another victory for Ripple v. SEC? Coinbase relists XRP in New York


    Even though both Coinbase and Ripple are struggling with regulatory and legal issues in the United States, the cryptocurrency exchange has relaunched XRP trading in New York, in a move that many might take as Ripple’s (another) win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Indeed, Coinbase has relisted XRP on its platform, thus making its trading available to the 20 million residents of New York “in a strong partnership with the State,” with the crypto trading platform’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal sharing the good news in an X post published on May 23.







Coinbase and Ripple’s SEC woes



As a reminder, Coinbase has been in a legal battle against the SEC since June 2023, when the regulator accused the crypto exchange of operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency and failing to register the offer of its staking-as-a-service program.







Earlier, in January 2021, the crypto platform had initially removed XRP across its US markets after the SEC accused blockchain company Ripple of illegally selling XRP and raising over $1.3 billion in what the agency said was an unregistered securities offering. 



However, in July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple did not violate federal securities law by selling XRP on public exchanges, albeit finding that direct sales to institutional clients did, in fact, constitute investment contracts, warranting further court proceedings that are yet to conclude. 



Meanwhile, the recent decision by Coinbase to bring back XRP support for New York residents could become a necessary trigger for the price of XRP, which is currently trading at $0.52, recording a 0.56% decline on the day, a 1.14% gain across the week, and a 3.66% drop in the last month, as per data on May 24.

Unlocking the Future of Finance: FreeBnk’s All-In-One Super App

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
Getting started in the crypto industry can be challenging, as there are so many processes involved, which can be a bit overwhelming for newcomers. Sometimes, these newcomers don’t know how and when to buy their desired cryptocurrencies. 
Even those who are experienced in using crypto often find it hard to navigate from one exchange to another in search of the best prices for cryptocurrencies. This is precisely the reason behind the creation of FreeBnk, which is to make it easier for novice and seasoned investors to navigate the web2 and web3 industries. 
What Is FreeBnk? 
FreeBnk is a crypto company founded by a group of entrepreneurs with the objective of making the financial industry better. Yunus Emre Ozkaya, who is the chief executive officer, and Arash Lowni, who is the chief design officer, are the two co-founders of this company. 
The company employs advanced and sophisticated technologies to provide all-around crypto services to its customers. They plan on empowering users and simplifying their crypto experience by making it more secure and accessible to all. 

FreeBnk: An Innovative Solution in Web2 and Web3

FreeBnk wants to bridge the difficulties many face while trying to interact simultaneously between traditional finance and the crypto industry/web3. Thus, they aim to become an on-chain financial super app where users can make transactions between the traditional finance sector and the blockchain. 
The company has already launched a couple of innovative and revolutionary services and platforms that serve as a gateway to financial empowerment. They include: 
Defi and Tradfi Fusion: Launch of Crypto2stocks
According to an X announcement on May 11th, 2024, FreeBnk said they are trying to Fuse DeFi and TradFi together with the launch of a new platform named Crypto2Stocks. More details indicate that Crypto2Stocks will help users integrate their crypto assets into the stock market directly. 
This is a huge milestone for FreeBnk, and it also opens an opportunity for investors and traders who want to diversify their portfolios. Once this feature is introduced, traders can easily use crypto assets to purchase their desired stocks in the market. While this solution will reduce transaction time significantly, it will also introduce a high level of flexibility, liquidity, and accessibility to users. 

FreeBnk Alchemist and Realworld: Huge Partnership With RWA Inc

The FreeBnk Alchemist is another solution from this company that allows users to invest in real world assets, tokenize them, and achieve fractional ownership of those assets. Moreover, this platform gives an opportunity to make real estate investments worldwide. Assets that users can tokenize into the blockchain on this platform include gold, real estate, Tesla and Amazon stocks, bonds, and many more. 
Recently, FreeBnk announced a major partnership with RWA Inc. on their medium channel. According to them, this move will help them redefine the asset tokenization sector. 
From their channel: “This partnership is poised to integrate real world assets into FreeBnk’s expansive ecosystem this month, bringing a host of new opportunities and features to its users.”
RWA Inc. is a large corporation committed to building an ecosystem that will help facilitate real world asset investment. Thus, it makes provisions for tokenization, smart contracts, audits, launchpads, and even a marketplace. By partnering with RWA Inc., FreeBnk wants to integrate its capabilities on its platform. 

FreeBnk Crypto 
FreeBnk Crypto is another solution that provides access to trading in over 150 countries using cash, cards, and bank transfers. On this platform, users get access to over 300 DeFi, CeFi aggregators, and liquidity providers, which enables them to buy cryptocurrencies at the best prices. It also offers the flexibility of swapping any crypto to another using their organic Bridge. 
FreeBnk Pay and FreeBnk Transfer 
FreeBnk Pay creates an alternative to card and cash payments by providing access to low-fee payment methods that benefit both merchants and consumers. On the other hand, FreeBnk Transfer is another platform that integrates blockchain technology to ensure fast and cost-effective payments worldwide. 
FreeBnk Token (FRBK) 
The FreeBnk Token (FRBK)  is the native token of this platform, and it has many functions, ranging from governance to facilitating transactions. The maximum supply of FRBK stands at 500 million, and the majority of the token allocation is targeted towards the growth of the community. Moreover, those holding this token can also earn rewards on different platforms by staking it. 

Features That Make FreeBnk Stand Out

Features such as multi-party wallets, AI integrations, insurance offerings, and aggregator protocols are what make this platform stand out from its competitors. Below, we will explain each of these features:


This platform integrates artificial intelligence to ensure users get the best experience while using their services, including AI chatbots. 

A multi-party computation (MPC) wallet is another feature that provides military-grade security for storing without the need for seed phrases. It was built in collaboration with Fireblocks Technology and operates significantly faster and more efficiently than traditional wallets. 

The platform boasts a bespoke aggregator protocol that incorporates more than 300 centralized and decentralized exchanges. Its primary purpose is to provide real-time market information on crypto tokens and help users secure the best exchange price. 

Crypto Loans/FreeBnk Lending 


FreeBnk has a crypto loan and investment feature. Users can borrow crypto using digital and intangible assets as collateral. Furthermore, they can make investments in stablecoins and tokenized real world assets with mouthwatering returns. 

There’s also an insurance offering from FreeBnk using the Crypto Deposit Insurance Scheme (CDIS) for user protection and covering of costs, assuming there’s any institutional collapse or failure.

Closing Thoughts 

FreeBnk is not just a gigantic financial platform. It tries to offer the best onboarding to crypto users by providing all the services they need in one app. They recently ventured into offering real-world asset trading, collaborating with RWA Inc. to bring it to reality. 
But besides this, they also have other platforms, such as Crypto2Stocks, which helps for a seamless trade between DeFi and TradFi assets. Furthermore, it has other platforms such as FreeBNKAlchemist, FreeBNKPay, FreeBNKTrade, and many more.

Frequently Asked Questions



FreeBnk is unique for a number of reasons, but mainly because it is on the way to becoming a financial super app where users can perform a wide range of activities. The services include providing users access to trade real world assets, making overseas payments, and even insurance offerings. The platform tries to bridge the inconsistencies and challenges of moving through web2 and web3.

CatCoin Issues Legal Ultimatum to BitForex Over Token Withdrawals


							

CatCoin warns BitForex regarding the withdrawal of CAT tokens



The meme-based project threatens legal action against BitForex and Jason Luo



CatCoin calls on the Hong Kong Police to intervene on the matter




CatCoin (CAT), a meme-based community-influenced crypto project, has warned the BitForex Crypto Exchange regarding CAT tokens withdrawal.



In a recent post on X, CatCoin representatives threatened to pursue legal action against BitForex and its former CEO, Jason Luo.







According to CatCoin, it has made multiple efforts to contact BitForex but received no response. The meme-based project’s team issued the post as a final notice to the crypto exchange, requesting BitForex to respond to its complaints via an official email it provided.



Meanwhile, the CatCoin team called on the Hong Kong Police Force to intervene and act appropriately against BitForex and Jason Luo. In addition, the team accused BitForex of tarnishing the reputation of the crypto industry and called upon crypto influencers to address the situation.



BitForex went offline in February, less than one month after Jason Luo stepped down as the company’s CEO. The crypto exchange shut down abruptly, leaving users confused and concerned over the fate of their assets. In his resignation speech, Luo noted he would continue to support the firm with his experience and knowledge.



The CatCoin team believes Luo is still involved with the exchange, alleging that the former CEO is in charge of operations at BitForex despite the inactive state of the firm in the past few months. The exchange’s X account has had no activity since February 21, when it posted, “We are the top encryption projects in 2024?”



Notably, the CatCoin team is one of several entities affected by BitForex’s unannounced collapse. The crypto exchange has failed to provide any tangible reason for its collapse despite several complaints, especially on the exchange’s official Telegram channel.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, struggled to halt its previous bearish trend, hovering around the $67,824 mark and hitting an intra-day low of $66,600. The decline intensified following the release of robust US labor market and Services PMI data, which reduced investor expectations of a September Fed rate cut and decreased demand for riskier assets.Looking ahead, Bitcoin investors will focus on upcoming comments from Fed officials, particularly Fed’s Waller, who is scheduled to speak on Friday.Hawkish remarks could weigh on Bitcoin. Furthermore, upcoming US Durable Goods Orders and Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index reports will also influence market sentiment.Strengthening US Dollar and Positive Economic Data Impact on Bitcoin Prices



The US dollar has strengthened recently due to positive economic data, decreasing the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. This has pressured the crypto market, including Bitcoin.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic highlighted ongoing inflation concerns, suggesting the Fed might maintain higher rates to avoid economic overheating.

FedWatch Tool: Chances of unchanged rates in September rose from 41.9% to 48.4% on May 23rd.
US Initial Jobless Claims: Fell by 8,000 to 215,000 for the week ending May 18.
PMI Data: Manufacturing PMI increased to 50.9 in May, Services PMI rose to 54.8, and Composite PMI jumped to 54.4, all surpassing expectations.

The stronger US dollar and positive economic indicators have made crypto investments like Bitcoin less appealing due to higher opportunity costs.



Bitcoin Sees Bullish Trend Amid US Regulatory Changes
Recent regulatory changes in the US have sparked a bullish trend for Bitcoin. Key developments include Congress members urging the SEC to approve spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs and the passing of the FIT21 bill, which clarifies cryptocurrency regulations.Additionally, major Bitcoin holders, known as “whales,” have accumulated 20,000 BTC, worth around $1.4 billion, in the past week.
Strong activity in Bitcoin-linked ETFs has also been observed, with $1.7 billion flowing into these funds over the last eight days.
These regulatory changes and positive developments have boosted demand for Bitcoin, with significant accumulation by whales and substantial inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs.

                        Nearly 40% of institutional investors had some exposure to crypto assets in 2023, a notable rise from the 31% recorded in 2021.A recent survey conducted by KPMG in Canada and the Canadian Association of Alternative Assets & Strategies has revealed a significant increase in institutional investors’ interest in cryptocurrencies.Per the survey, a third of respondents reported having at least 10% of their portfolio allocated to crypto assets, compared to only a fifth of respondents two years ago.Institutional Investors Enter Crypto Amid Maturing Market
The survey also explored the reasons behind institutional investors’ growing interest in cryptocurrencies.A majority of respondents, 67%, cited the maturing market and custody infrastructure as a significant factor, a significant increase from the 14% recorded in 2021.Furthermore, 58% of respondents mentioned the strong market performance of cryptocurrencies as a motivating factor for their investments.The market performance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, has been remarkable in recent years.Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a 150% increase in 2023 and is up nearly 60% year-to-date.Similarly, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has risen by approximately 60% in 2024.The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January of this year has played a significant role in boosting institutional investors’ access to the crypto asset class.After years of failed applications, the SEC’s decision has made it easier for institutional investors to include cryptocurrencies in their portfolios.Another recent poll conducted by the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals indicates a sharp rise in the number of financial advisers planning to recommend crypto-related opportunities to their clients.The survey found that 35% of respondents intend to encourage their clients to invest in the digital assets space, compared to 21% at the end of the previous year.The increased interest in cryptocurrencies has prompted a broader coverage of digital assets by major sell-side firms, such as JPMorgan and AllianceBernstein.This expanded research coverage has contributed to more sophisticated and nuanced conversations between investor relations (IR) professionals and institutional investors.IR teams have observed a notable shift in investor understanding and knowledge of cryptocurrencies, with discussions focusing on more advanced topics compared to previous years.Crypto Sees Increase in Interest in Hong Kong
The increased interest in cryptocurrencies has also been observed in Hong Kong, where regulatory clarity and recent approvals of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have contributed to a surge in institutional and retail investor focus.OSL Group, a Hong Kong-listed digital assets company, has experienced a significant uptick in interest from investors, and their investor relations approach has become more proactive as a result.As reported, Hong Kong has launched its first batch of ETFs focused on cryptocurrencies, marking potential competition for the popular Bitcoin products in the United States. Harvest Global Investments Ltd., the local unit of China Asset Management, along with a partnership between HashKey Capital Ltd. and Bosera Asset Management (International) Co., listed Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the city on Tuesday.

Shiba Inu ETF on the horizon? SHIB founder drops major hint


    The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community received a boost of optimism as Shytoshi Kusama, the leader of the SHIB project, congratulated the Ethereum (ETH) community following the SEC’s landmark approval of the first spot Ethereum ETFs.



In a recent tweet on May 24, Kusama speculated on the potential for a similar Shiba Inu  spot ETF, while emphasizing his commitment to the ongoing developments within the SHIB ecosystem.



SHIB ETF prospects and community Focus



In his congratulatory message, Kusama hinted at a possible SHIB ETF sparking discussions within the community, though Kusama stressed that his main focus remains on the upcoming projects for Shibarium and the broader Shiba Inu ecosystem. 







Remarking on the possibility that this development could pave the way for a SHIB spot exchange-traded fund in the future. While he acknowledged the potential significance of such an event, Kusama emphasized that his primary focus remains on the ongoing and upcoming projects within the SHIB ecosystem. 



Kusama encouraged the community to engage in discussions about the future, such as projects for Shibarium and the broader Shiba Inu ecosystem. 







Ethereum ETF approval



On Thursday, May 24, the SEC granted approval for spot Ethereum ETF applications submitted by several prominent Wall Street firms. This decision comes six months after the regulator approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a significant shift in the crypto landscape. 



Ethereum, being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has now joined Bitcoin in offering spot ETFs, a move that many believe could accelerate Wall Street’s acceptance of crypto assets.



Among the approved Ethereum ETFs are those from financial heavyweights such as BlackRock, Grayscale (which converted its Ethereum Trust into a spot ETF), VanEck, Bitwise, Fidelity, and Ark Invest. 



These ETFs, while significant, are expected to manage fewer assets compared to their Bitcoin counterparts. For instance, Grayscale’s new Ethereum ETF holds approximately $11 billion in ETH, which is considerably smaller than its Bitcoin Trust before it transitioned to a spot ETF.



ETF Regulatory adjustments and challenges



The path to approval was not without challenges. Earlier this month, Ark Invest, Grayscale, and Fidelity had to modify their ETF filings to exclude staking services. This adjustment came in response to the SEC’s recent legal actions against U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken over their crypto staking services, which the SEC deemed to involve unregistered securities.



The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs represents a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. Venture investor Anthony Pompliano recently tweeted that this step is the “last dam to be broken” before Wall Street fully embraces crypto assets.

New Sonic Foundation by Fantom Gains $10 Million Backing


On Wednesday, Fantom Foundation, an entity behind layer-1 (L1) blockchain Fantom, unveiled the launch of Sonic Foundation and Sonic Labs.
These new entities will be the main bodies supporting its new L1 blockchain, Sonic.
Fantom Secures A $10 Million Fund for Sonic Chain

The Fantom Foundation explained that the Sonic Foundation will be responsible for the network’s governance and treasury management functions. Meanwhile, Sonic Labs will drive growth among dApps, partnerships, and users.
Besides announcing the creation of the Sonic Foundation, the Fantom Foundation also revealed its achievement in closing a $10 million funding round led by Korean crypto fund Hashed. Additional investors included UOB Ventures, Signum Capital, Aave Foundation, and several angel investors.
Read more: What Is Fantom (FTM)?

“Capital raised during the recent round will be exclusively used to further support strategic growth and ecosystem development,” Fantom Foundation’s CEO, Michael Kong, said.

Fantom unveiled its plan to launch the Sonic blockchain earlier in March. The Fantom team has worked to develop the technology for the past two years and anticipates the Sonic chain will launch in the late summer or early fall this year.
Sonic is a blockchain technology designed to process a large number of transactions quickly. It operates as a primary L1 blockchain and includes a layer-2 (L2) bridge feature that enables it to connect with another blockchain, such as Ethereum (ETH).
Professor Bernhard Scholz, the Chief Research Officer at Fantom, designed this technology. Additionally, Andre Cronje, a key figure in the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) and a co-founder of Fantom, led the development team responsible for Sonic.

Sonic claims to tap into vast amounts of liquidity, users, and protocols. This ability allows the chain to combine the low cost, scalability, and speed of L2 with the security of an L2 bridge for access to native ETH and other assets on Ethereum.
Sonic will own a native token, which will use ticker S. A recently approved governance vote made S compatible and can be migrated 1:1 with Fantom’s native token, FTM.

However, this positive development has yet to significantly boost FTM’s price. Since Monday, FTM has decreased from $0.95 to $0.81.

Shady Trades? Politician bets big on Ethereum before ETF approval


    After the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved applications from Nasdaq, Cboe, and NYSE to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the price of Ethereum (ETH), certain trades by a US politician have come into the limelight.



Specifically, Michael Collins, the US representative for Georgia’s 10th congressional district, disclosed in January 2024 a $65,000 investment in Ethereum, as Finbold reported at the time, and more recently, highlighted by Quiver Quantitave, in an X post on May 24.







According to the investment research firm that “scrapes alternative data from across the internet and aggregates it in a free, easy to use platform,” the largest altcoin and second-biggest asset in the cryptocurrency sector by market capitalization has “now risen over 140%” since Collins started buying in.







Collins’ Ethereum purchases



As a reminder, the representative had bought Ethereum in the amount of between $1,001 and $15,000 on January 3 and between $15,001 and $50,000 on January 8, at the time when rumors of an approval of a spot Ethereum ETF first started circulating, suggesting the politician’s strong conviction in its possibility.

Furthermore, in addition to his January 2024 purchases, Collins had also bought Ethereum three times in 2023 – on October 9, November 5, and December 28 – in sales that amounted to $75,000, according to the data shared by markets analytics platform unusual whales on January 10.







Ethereum news effect



Meanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $3,687.03, which represents a drop of 3.50% in the last 24 hours but nonetheless an advance of 21.68% across the previous seven days, and an accumulated gain of 13.03% on its monthly chart.



That said, according to crypto trading expert Michaël van de Poppe, the crypto market had already priced in the recent positive Ethereum news, as reflected in the form of the crypto asset’s strong 20% move, but the actual listing and inflow would demonstrate whether a strong upwards continuation can happen.

Expecting 150 Thousand Dollars in Bitcoin and 8 Thousand Dollars in Ethereum, Standard Chartered Pointed to 2025 for Solana and XRP ETFs! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the SEC's historic approval of spot Ethereum ETHs was welcomed by the market, eyes now turn to other altcoin ETFs.
At this point, Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick claimed that other crypto ETFs could gain approval in 2025.


Speaking to The Block, Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick argued that other ETFs other than Ethereum could receive approval in 2025.
At this point, Kendrick argued that after Ethereum ETFs, other cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL) and XRP may also receive approval in 2025, and made the following statements.






“The approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs shows that ETH is not classified as a security by the SEC, so other ETH-like coins that have previously been under scrutiny in cases like the XRP case may not be considered securities either.
In a few cases, the core technologies of some altcoins are so similar to ETH that it would be difficult for the SEC to argue that they are securities, given the classification of ETH.
“The cryptocurrency industry now appears to have political support on both sides of the aisle.”

Stating that his predictions of $150,000 for Bitcoin and $8,000 for ETH are valid, Kendrick said, “A portfolio that includes both BTC and ETH ETFs is probably attractive, and the sector is further confirmed by the SEC's decision on ETH.”

Litecoin Eyeing the $90 Mark as Whales Accumulate the Token



                    

While a lot of crypto headlines are dominated by the likes of more ‘exciting’ tokens like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, Litecoin has seemingly remained a quiet giant in the industry. The token is known for its speed and efficiency and while it is in the top 20 cryptos by market cap, it flies under the radars of some crypto lovers and investors. 



Now, the token is reporting more notable activity and is even eyeing the coveted $90 mark as Litecoin whales have made a splash in the industry. 








Litecoin is known in the crypto space for having low fees and fast transactions and this has made it a favorite of many users. Over the years, we’ve also come to see more variety in its use cases outside of sending funds. 



For example, Litecoin is being used more for online gambling on various sites, even some that only take Litecoin. As Kane Pepi writes about the best Litecoin casinos reviewed, these are becoming more popular. The coin can also be used on an anonymous casino along with other tokens. There are also more merchants who accept Litecoin for the purchase of goods and services and this too is only on track to become more common.



All of these use cases mean that Litecoin can sustain its growth trajectory into the future and this will positively reflect on its price as well. Between its speculative and non-speculative use, whales buying up so much of it and the growing excitement around it, Litecoin should reach new price points in the future.








In the last month alone, Litecoin whales have snapped up over $230 million worth of the token. This has included a 900,000 token stash collected in a single day. Whale activity is often an indicator of a token about to go up in value and usually triggers smaller investors to snap up the token as well. The idea is that whales are buying more of a token with the intention of selling when the price goes up and no one wants to get left behind when that happens. 



This has been true in the case of Litecoin as while it saw a market dip in the last few months or so, it has been steadily on the mend. Following the reports of whale activity, it reached $89 before seeing a slight correction, hovering at $87.27 as of this article. 



This has come as good news to the Litecoin community as the token breaching the $90 mark would mean that $100 is in view. It’s also been reported by the Litecoin team that the token has been the number 1 token for Bitpay transactions for this year, perhaps in part due to its fast transactions. In fact, it has been the top token for five months now. 



This is a testament to how committed the Litecoin community is and could be a sign of even better things to come. The Litecoin whales certainly think so and have been putting their money where their mouth is.

House passes bill to limit Fed's CBDC authority


The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill on Thursday that requires the Federal Reserve to obtain congressional approval before issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). 



The CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, passed with a 216-192 vote, aims to safeguard financial privacy and prevent government overreach. 



The bipartisan support for the bill reflects concerns over privacy and the potential for government surveillance through digital currencies. 



The bill, known as H.R. 5403, seeks to amend the Federal Reserve Act, barring the Fed from providing direct consumer services or leveraging CBDCs for monetary policy without Congress’s explicit consent. 

	
	
	
	


The House’s decision marks a significant moment in crypto-focused legislative activity, with this being the third crypto-related bill passed in May. 



The debate around the bill revealed a split between Republican worries about financial surveillance and Democratic interests in fostering innovation and maintaining the dollar’s international status.



Proponents of the bill, including House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, have pointed to foreign examples, such as China’s use of CBDCs for citizen monitoring, to justify the need for strict regulations. 



According to the Atlantic Council, at least 134 countries and currency unions are exploring a CBDC. Three of them have launched and 36 of them are running pilot trials.

Why Cryptocurrency Enthusiasts are Drawn to Sports Betting



                    

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are increasingly turning their attention to sports betting. Although crypto sportsbooks are certainly in a boom right now, ordinary bookies not gamstop that use fiat, is also seeing many new signups – many of which have a crypto background. So, what’s going on, why might there be more to it than meets the eye?







Both cryptocurrency and sports betting communities thrive on networking and exchanging knowledge, so this is an obvious place to start. Enthusiasts in both fields often participate in online forums and social media groups, where they can dig deeper to find lesser-known knowledge. This is something that crypto enthusiasts are accustomed to, and how they may even stumble upon betting communities in the first place (i.e. Reddit).








Effective risk management is needed in both cryptocurrency investing and sports betting. Enthusiasts in both fields must carefully assess each decision’s potential risks and rewards, meaning that strategic thinking is linked to maximising chances of success. 



Crypto traders can spot this in gambling—a skill they’re already familiar with. When getting into sports betting, they must begin to weigh the odds and make informed choices based on various factors. 







Success in cryptocurrency investing and sports betting relies heavily on strong analytical skills. Crypto enthusiasts have been drawn to the data side of things, which is currently still being explored in sports betting.




Interpreting vast amounts of data isn’t traditionally something bettors have always done, as they often operate on small samples of data (i.e. recent form) and make heuristic judgements, rather than model an algorithm or finely tune a decision-making process. 







Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are typically well-versed in technology, of course, which is also growing within betting right now. More recently, there have been software releases that help users perform sophisticated betting strategies and provide real-time insights. These can be a bit daunting for the average Joe, but it’s something that the crypto guys are picking up quickly. 



We must remember that, particularly with betting exchanges, we compete against each other, not the house. Even in traditional bookies (i.e. not an exchange), the odds are still being reflected by demand, so we’re indirectly competing against one another. For someone with a highly analytical and technical background, it may be an instant advantage – a far bigger one than in the crypto market space, too, where such backgrounds are more common.







Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, with prices fluctuating rapidly in response to various factors. Sports betting outcomes can be unpredictable, too, with unexpected results and last-minute changes in odds. It appears more different than it is because sports betting odds are anchored to the reality of the game. But crypto pricing is more anchored than people give credit for, with other coins, the market sentiment in general, the USD, interest rates, S&P500, and many more factors being a point of influence.








The shared skills and knowledge required for success in cryptocurrency investing and sports betting make the latter an appealing pursuit for digital currency enthusiasts. They can position themselves as relatively more expert in analytics and technology, which can be an advantage. But, ultimately, both share another common theme: Excitement and unpredictability.

Fantasy Top, a Blast collection that turns Crypto Twitter into an NFT game, takes the third spot with daily sales of US$611,135. Fantasy Top stays in the top three despite falling from US$1.04 million in the previous day to lead the market.



Thursday’s top three collections show the rising appetite for Web3 games.

	
	
	
	


According to DappRadar, Web3 gaming attracted almost US$1 billion in investments last month.



Next, Ethereum’s Bored Ape Yacht Club and The Captainz rounded out the top five collections with US$602,545 and US$531,806 in sales, respectively.



The Ethereum network led all blockchains in sales with US$6.2 million on Thursday.



The industry received major news related to the world’s largest NFT chain as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), paving the way for these financial instruments to trade on traditional markets in the U.S.

	
	
	

	


Bitcoin, with just under US$5 million was the day’s second-ranking blockchain, followed by Solana with US$2.34 million.



Solana blockchain also made headlines with a significant number of transactions, totaling 63,682 for the day, although its sales volume was lower at US$2.34 million. This performance underscores the diversity and competitiveness of the NFT market across different blockchains.

                        The concept of the Metaverse has gained significant attention in recent times, prompting many to consider its investment prospects.The Metaverse refers to a virtual universe where users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other participants in real-time.It encompasses a wide range of technologies, including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI).Metaverse Market Size and Growth

The market’s growth is influenced by several factors, including technological advancements in AR and VR, the increasing popularity of social media and gaming platforms, and the ongoing integration of blockchain technology.Over the past three years, the metaverse has seen substantial growth driven by the rising demand for immersive virtual experiences.For example, platforms like Roblox and Fortnite have integrated social media functionalities with gaming, which has significantly expanded their user bases. The global economic situation, particularly the push towards digital transformation accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has further spurred interest and investment in the metaverse.Blockchain technology plays a crucial role in the growth of the metaverse by enabling secure digital transactions and the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are essential for digital asset ownership and trading. However, regulatory challenges remain a significant hurdle.Emerging Trends in Metaverse
Several key trends are shaping the metaverse landscape.AR and VR are at the forefront of metaverse technology, providing immersive experiences that are becoming increasingly popular in the entertainment and gaming industries.The market share for AR and VR devices is growing, with major companies like Meta investing heavily in these technologies.Furthermore, platforms like Roblox, Fortnite, and The Sandbox are leading the way in combining social media and gaming.These platforms offer users immersive experiences and opportunities to socialize in virtual environments, driving engagement and revenue.It is worth noting that Businesses are increasingly adopting metaverse technologies for virtual meetings, training sessions, and customer engagement.Companies are exploring virtual reality for remote work and collaboration, which has become more prevalent post-pandemic.Additionally, the co-use of blockchain and metaverse technologies is becoming a significant trend.Blockchain provides the infrastructure for secure transactions and digital ownership within the metaverse, enhancing the user experience and creating new economic opportunities.Who is Using the Metaverse?
The metaverse is attracting a diverse range of users and applications:
Gaming Community: Games like Roblox and Fortnite offer immersive experiences that allow players to interact in virtual worlds. These platforms have become immensely popular, particularly among younger audiences.
Consumers: Individuals are buying NFTs, virtual real estate, and participating in virtual events. The metaverse allows users to own and trade digital assets, providing a new dimension to online commerce and entertainment.

Key investors are making substantial investments in the metaverse:Companies like Meta (formerly Facebook), Microsoft, Tencent, and Nvidia are heavily investing in the metaverse to enhance their platforms and create new user experiences.For instance, Meta invested $50 million in global research and development for the metaverse, and Epic Games raised $1 billion, including a $200 million investment from Sony.While investments are pouring in, regulatory frameworks around digital assets and virtual environments could influence the number of investors.Clear regulations would likely encourage more investment by providing legal certainty.Why Invest in the Metaverse?
The metaverse is an industry with enormous potential for the future.The synergy between advanced technologies such as AR, VR, and blockchain creates a unique and immersive user experience.High user engagement on metaverse platforms opens up new revenue streams and market opportunities.However, the metaverse isn’t a singular digital world; there are many metaverses to explore.For example, in the cryptocurrency space, two of the most popular metaverses are Decentraland and The Sandbox. Users need to do extensive research on each platform before investing in order to find the ones with the highest potential for adoption.The Bottom Line

Top Analyst Says Solana-Based Memecoin Primed To Surge Higher Again, Updates Outlook on Ethereum - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is expressing bullish sentiment on one memecoin built on the Solana (SOL) blockchain while revealing his forecast for Ethereum (ETH) going forward.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Flow Horse tells his 216,400 followers on the social media platform X that dogwifhat (WIF), whose logo features a dog wearing a hat, appears to be undergoing consolidation on the daily chart.










According to the pseudonymous analyst, WIF could then turn bullish after the consolidation phase.
“It looks like WIF isn’t ready to take off the hat.”
Source: Flow Horse/X
WIF is trading at $2.97 at time of writing, down by around 38% from the all-time high reached in March.
Turning to ETH, Flow Horse says that if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the second-largest crypto asset by market cap months after Bitcoin’s (BTC), the impact could result in a weeks-long uptrend for ETH.
“The Ethereum ETF trade is better than Bitcoin for too many reasons to list, but simply put: 
The market is still caught off guard by the pivot and you can guarantee there is still some pocket of doubt and disbelief that won’t enter until we get a headline.
Short-term pop and correction followed by a strong trend up over weeks.
**Also, it is easier to move ETH than it is BTC**”
Ethereum is trading at $3,864 at time of writing, up by around 29% over the past seven days.

Here's why Ondo Finance (ONDO) price is soaring - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Ondo Finance (ONDO) price surges to a new all-time high above $1.15.
The Ondo price surge is driven by SEC approval of Ethereum ETFs and strong institutional backing.
Ondo Finance (ONDO) lists on Coinbase boosting its visibility an trading volume.

Ondo Finance (ONDO), the native token of the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) platform Ondo Finance, has been experiencing a remarkable price surge recently.
ONDO token recently hit an all-time high of $1.16 and despite experiencing a slight decline, it seems to have regained its footing.
At press time, ONDO was priced at $1.10, reflecting a 10.45% increase over the past 24 hours, a 16.66% increase over the past week, and a 24.00% rise over the past month.
Since its launch, ONDO price has skyrocketed by an impressive 577.86% from its IEO price of $0.055 in January 2024.
These figures highlight ONDO’s strong upward momentum and growing investor interest.
Key catalysts for Ondo price surge
1. SEC Approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs
One of the most significant factors contributing to ONDO’s recent price surge is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
This landmark decision has fueled market optimism, suggesting a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.
The approval has not only boosted Ethereum (ETH) but also positively impacted Ethereum-related tokens like ONDO, which is considered a strong Ethereum-beta asset and a key player in the “real-world asset” narrative.
2. Coinbase Listing
Another major catalyst for ONDO’s rally is its recent listing on Coinbase’s perpetual market.
The inclusion of ONDO-PERP, along with PYTH-PERP and ZETA-PERP, on Coinbase has provided greater accessibility and trading flexibility for investors.
This move has significantly increased ONDO’s visibility and trading volume, which surged by 130% to reach $455,519,046.
3. Strong institutional backing
Lat but not least is Ondo Finance’s strategic partnerships and investments by major venture capitals that have played a crucial role in boosting investor confidence.
In Aprill 2022, Ondo Finance received $20 million in a Series A investment from several leading venture capitals including Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Tiger Global Management, Wintermute, and GoldenTree Asset Management among others. These institutional supports are a positive indicator for long-term growth prospects.
In late March 2024, Ondo Finance transferred $95 million of its assets to BlackRock’s tokenized fund, BUIDL, to facilitate instant settlements for its U.S. Treasury-backed token, OUSG.
While this specific transaction might not have directly triggered the recent price movement, the association with BlackRock, a dominant force in the ETF market, has certainly bolstered ONDO’s market perception.
Pantera Capital’s backing further adds to ONDO’s credibility, providing the financial muscle and strategic support needed to navigate the volatile crypto landscape.
On-chain Ondo Finance (ONDO) data insights
According to DeFiLlama, Ondo Finance achieved a peak total value locked (TVL) of $444 million on May 24.
In addition, data from IntoTheBlock also indicates a significant surge of 52.3% in large transaction volume, with 84% of ONDO holders currently in a profitable position and 15% at breakeven.
Furthermore, the concentration by large holders remains notably high at 92%, with approximately 63% of holders retaining their tokens for durations between one to twelve months.
Going by the above on-chain data Market sentiment around ONDO remains bullish, with several analysts and traders predicting further gains.

Dogecoin drops as DOGE community bids 'Kabosu' farewell - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin’s price fell following the news of Kabosu’s passing, reflecting the sentimental impact.
A memorial for Kabosu is planned, highlighting her significant influence in the cryptocurrency sector.

Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog whose curious expression sparked the meme that gave rise to Dogecoin [DOGE], has passed away.
 The iconic image that launched a thousand memes was first shared by Kabosu’s owner, Atsuko Sato, in 2010 on her personal blog. The photograph, which captured Kabosu’s peculiar, skeptical look, quickly resonated with internet users worldwide. 
Accompanied by humorous, misspelled captions in Comic Sans, the image of Kabosu evolved into the “Doge” meme, embedding itself deeply into internet culture. 
The meme eventually inspired the creation of Dogecoin in 2013. Initially conceived as a joke, the cryptocurrency adopted Kabosu’s visage as its logo, symbolizing the light-hearted spirit of the project. 
Despite its comedic origins, Dogecoin gained substantial traction and utility, supporting various charitable causes and sporting events. It became the progenitor of a new category of digital assets known as memecoins, influencing other major tokens like Shiba Inu and Floki.
How is Dogecoin handling the loss?
Following the announcement of Kabosu’s passing on 24th May, Dogecoin experienced a notable downturn in its market price, with a 6.2% decrease over the last 24 hours, positioning the price at $0.1568. 
This recent fluctuation occurred amidst broader discussions within the community about the memecoin’s future and its role in the crypto ecosystem. 
Kabosu’s death marks not just the end of an era for the Dogecoin community but also casts reflections on the volatility and sentimental value driving the memecoin sector.
Source: Santiment
Meanwhile, looking into Dogecoin’s notable metrics, market data from Santiment revealed a significant drop price volatility from its peak in March, indicating a stabilization in its trading patterns. 
While decreased volatility might suggest a maturing market, it also diverges from the traditionally erratic price movements expected of a memecoin. 
Source: IntoTheBlock
Despite these market dynamics, data from IntoTheBlock shows that the majority of Dogecoin holders are currently seeing profits, with 83% in the green. Conversely, 13% are experiencing losses, while a mere 4% are breaking even at current market prices. 
This financial landscape emerges amid a notable lack of volatility in Dogecoin’s large transaction (whale) activity, highlighting a period of consolidation within this metric.
 Specifically, IntoTheBlock data reveals no significant spikes in whale transactions, indicating a relatively stable trading environment for DOGE.
Source: IntoTheBlock
Dogecoin’s technical projections
Technical analysis of Dogecoin’s chart indicates a potential retracement, as the cryptocurrency recently traded above a previous lower high. 
Specifically, the 4-hour chart suggests that DOGE may continue to decline to the $0.13 level to test a key demand level before potentially rebounding to resume its uptrend. 
Source: TradingView
This analysis aligns with a recent report from AMBCrypto, which posits that a break past the resistance levels at $0.1698 and $0.1844 would confirm a bullish movement for Dogecoin.

Amidst these market speculations, the Dogecoin community and Kabosu’s followers prepare to honor her memory. A memorial ceremony for Kabosu is scheduled to take place at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City. 
The event will provide an opportunity for those touched by Kabosu’s story to celebrate her life and impact, which transcended the digital world to create a lasting imprint on both cryptocurrency and internet history.

This Crypto Trader Made a Fortune on PEPE and ONDO: Here's How - Coin Edition


							

Crypto trader amasses $42 million profit in one year.



PEPE investment yields $60 million return.



ONDO, BEAM trades add to significant gains.




Lookonchain, a prominent cryptocurrency analytics platform, has detailed the success story of an astute trader whose portfolio ballooned from $23 million to $65 million in just one year. This remarkable gain of $42 million in earnings underscores the trader’s exceptional ability to navigate the volatile crypto markets.







One of the trader’s standout achievements was the extraordinary profit of $60 million, representing a 1203% return on investment (ROI), made from investing in PEPE. Between November 2, 2023, and February 1, 2024, the trader invested 2,434 ETH (equivalent to $5 million) to acquire 3.97 trillion PEPE.



Subsequently, by selling 125 billion PEPE for 350 ETH (approximately $1.27 million), the trader retained 3.84 trillion PEPE, then valued at $56.43 million. This strategic selling at peak prices was pivotal to the trader’s success. PEPE has since experienced a 4.72% decline over the last 24 hours to $0.0000139, according to the latest data.









Furthermore, the trader capitalized on the bullish trends of ONDO, earning $5.8 million with an ROI of 288%. The trader purchased 7.55 million ONDO tokens for $1.9 million at an average price of $0.26 between January 28 and February 6. By selling 2.56 million ONDO tokens for $2 million at an average price of $0.79 across multiple occasions in March and April, the trader retained 4.99 million ONDO tokens, then valued at $5.73 million. ONDO’s price, at the time of writing, stands at $1.07, having risen 8.09% in the last 24 hours.







Another profitable venture for the trader was BEAM, where an investment of $2.59 million to purchase 139.47 million BEAM tokens at an average price of $0.019 resulted in a $1.85 million profit, reflecting an ROI of 72%. From February 16 to February 27, the trader sold all of their BEAM assets for $4.44 million at an average price of $0.032. BEAM is now trading at $0.02663, down 3.47% over the last 24 hours.

Selling Pressure Danger in Solana (SOL)! Solana Sold at a Low Price in FTX's Auction! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


The assets of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX have completed the sale of $2.6 billion worth of discounted Solana (SOL) tokens, with leading buyers including Figure Markets and Pantera Capital.
Pantera and Figure Receive Latest Discounted Solana Tokens from FTX Auction
Figure Markets reportedly paid approximately $80 million for a block of 800,000 SOL tokens, which equates to approximately $102 per token.


This price represents a significant discount compared to the current market price of approximately $166 per token. This discount led to a 5.6% drop in Solana's price in the morning.
Pantera Capital also participated in the recent auction, but details about the price they paid were not disclosed. Both FTX ownership and the purchasing companies have not yet responded to requests for comment on the transactions.






FTX, run by convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, owes more than two million customers and over $11 billion to other creditors.
Pantera Capital, which previously tried to raise $250 million to buy Solana tokens from FTX, was also one of the winning bidders in an earlier auction held in April.


The firm's continued interest and investment underscores the value and potential they see in Solana despite ongoing turbulence in the market.

Cardano (ADA) Investors Book Losses, But Here’s the Twist


The decline in Cardano’s (ADA) price in the past few weeks has caused many of its holders to lose money.
On-chain data has shown that the count of daily transactions in losses exceeds those that return a profit.
Cardano Holders Look For a Way Out
At press time, ADA traded at $0.45. In the last month, the altcoin has shed almost 10% of its value. In fact, during that period, ADA cratered to a low of $0.42 before rebounding.

Due to a steady decline in the coin’s value in the past few weeks, most of its holders have booked losses on their transactions. An assessment of the ratio of ADA’s daily transaction volume in profit to loss (observed using a 30-day moving average) was 0.94 at press time.
This means that for every ADA transaction that ended in a loss, only 0.94 transactions returned a profit.   
Cardano Ratio of Transaction Volume in Profit to Loss. Source: Santiment
When this metric returns a value below 1, it suggests a tendency for more selling pressure than buying pressure during the period under review.
As the coin’s price plunges, many of its holders continue to sit on unrealized losses. As of this writing, 2.62 million addresses, which make up 59% of all ADA holders, are “out of the money.”
An address is considered out of the money if the current market price of an asset is lower than the average cost at which the address purchased (or received) the tokens it currently holds.

Conversely, 1.64 million addresses, representing 37% of all ADA holders, hold their coins at a profit. 
ADA Price Prediction: To Buy the Dip or Not
Readings from ADA’s Elder-Ray Index suggested that ADA investments may continue to lose their value in the short term. 

This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market. When its value is negative, it means that bear power is dominant in the market. As of this writing, the value of ADA’s Elder-Ray Index was -0.038.
Also the coin’s Relative Strength Index  (RSI) was in a downtrend at 41.94. At this value, ADA’s RSI signaled that its selling pressure exceeded its buying activity.

If coin sell-offs continue, ADA may fall under its support at $0.42 to exchange hands at $0.416.

However, if market participants heed ADA’s Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio, which currently flashes a buy signal, and “buy the dip,” the coin’s price might rally toward $0.479.

                        The Solana price has dropped by 8% in the past 24 hours, falling to $163.28 on a day when the cryptocurrency market as a whole has lost 4%.These declines follow the news that the SEC has approved eight spot-based Ethereum ETFs, which follow in the footsteps of the 11 Bitcoin ETFs that gained approval in January.While this is entirely positive news, it appears to have led to a ‘sell the news’ correction, with SOL now also down by 3.5% in a week.However, its medium- long-term momentum remains enviable, and with the coin up by 740% in a year, it has sustained enough impetus to rebound strongly soon.Solana Price Prediction as ETF Rumors Emerge – Is $10,000 SOL Possible?
What’s positive about Solana’s chart is that it illustrates how the coin is close to a bottom, having entered an oversold position.Most notably, its relative strength index (purple) has touched 30 in the past hour, meaning that it can’t really lose any more momentum.Source: TradingViewThis is happening while SOL’s 30-day average (orange) is about to dip below its 200-day (blue), at which point the coin will be close to a positive reversal.It will, therefore, be interesting to see whether its support level (green) can prevent a drop below $160.If it can, we may see a rebound as soon as this weekend, while a dive below this level could bring a few more days of pain.Yet one positive feature of Solana’s chart today is that its 24-hour trading volume remains pretty high, at around $5.4 billion.This indicates ongoing demand for the token, although at the moment it seems that whales are likelier to sell the coin than buy it at the moment.Even so, the medium- and long-term prognosis for the Solana price remains overwhelmingly positive.As noted above, the SEC has approved a list of spot Ethereum ETFs, and one of the reasons why there has been a market-wide dive today is that these ETFs haven’t actually launched yet.But once they do, we may see an influx of volume and demand, first coming to Ethereum itself but then filtering out into a general bullishness.Given Solana’s status as the next major utility token after ETH, it could be poised for its own spot ETFs soon.The price of Solana could hit $200 in the coming weeks, and the potential introduction of a SOL ETF might drive it to $500 by the end of 2024.If adoption continues, it may even reach $10,000 in the years and perhaps decades to come.Presale Tokens Can Help Traders Beat the Market
There’s little doubt that SOL will recover soon and enjoy some more rallies, yet it could potentially take some time.As such, traders looking for above-average returns in shorter timeframes may prefer to check out one of the numerous strong presale tokens currently attracting investors.One of the hottest of these is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme token that has raised just over $2.5 million in its sale.SEAL looks like the likeliest new Solana-based meme token to join the ranks of other successful coins this year, such as WIF and BONK.This is indicated by its growing raise amount, as well as by the popularity of its official X account, which has accrued over 5,000 followers in only a few weeks.What these show is that SEAL is being increasingly successful in generating excitement and hype, which is likely to convert into a significant rally once it lists at the end of its sale.As a meme coin, it has opted for a quirky anthropomorphic seal as its mascot, which seems to be doing a good job in gaining attention.And SEAL has also launched an Ethereum-based version of its token, making it a multi-chain cryptocurrency.This can often result in greater traction, with SEAL potential gaining more use on more apps over time.Investors can join its ale by heading over to the official Sealana website, where they can purchase at a rate 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which is roughly $0.025 per token.VIDEOGiven its momentum and growing popularity, such a price will end up seeming very cheap in a few weeks.Buy SEAL Today

DePIN Service Dabba Expands Decentralized Internet Connectivity Across India



                    

Dabba, a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) aiming to connect underserved and unconnected populations with cheap wireless data, unveiled the launch of the purchase of Wi-Fi hotspots, making them available for users to buy worldwide. This will be the second campaign, following a successful testnet that saw over 1,500 hotspots distributed to rural and semi-urban areas in India. 



The latest campaign will make over 10,000 Dabba Lite hotspots available for purchase across the globe, with a goal of selling over 100,000 in 2024. With the launch of the second season, Dabba is aligning its goals towards its vision to provide cheap and accessible internet services to underserved regions globally, the team statement reads. 




Following the purchase, the hotspots can be deployed by network partners across India, expanding decentralized internet connectivity across the country and providing cheap internet access across rural and semi-urban areas. Moreover, the DePIN service helps in reducing data congestion in regions with high data demand. 



According to the team statement, users can start purchasing the hotspots following the live launch of its DePIN service on May 23, 2024 – ahead of the planned token generation event (TGE) scheduled for July on the Solana blockchain. 



The token will support the creation of a two-sided marketplace between data consumers and providers responsible for building and maintaining internet infrastructure. The token will power the Dabba ecosystem and also reward contributors and stakeholders helping the ecosystem run seamlessly. 




Dabba is focused on India, a country that boasts the second-highest number of internet users, but only 44% of its residents have internet access. Most of the rural and semi-urban areas are underserved by incumbent data solutions. With their experience in offering internet services to underserved regions, Dabba selected India as their starting point for supplying decentralized internet services. 



This follows previous roles for the company in the country such as powering Google’s public wifi deployments and a partnership with the  Indian government to ensure the legislation is in place to support the rollout of its demand-based DePIN.



Fast progress in offering cheap internet 



Since its launch, Dabba has been at the forefront of offering users fast and accessible internet services. The first season (its trial campaign) saw the company sell all 1,000 Dabba Lite hotspot devices within days following the launch. Via its DePIN infrastructure, millions of citizens across India have had access to affordable internet. 



Since then, the company has sold and deployed 500 more hotspots and more than 15,000 unique devices connected in the process. Additionally, the hotspots have provided more than 390 TB of data via the DePIN infrastructure and grossed more than $4,500 in revenue from their customers. This aims to reduce data congestion and meet the growing demand for wi-fi users across the world’s most populous democracy.




In tandem with the season two rollout, Dabba users can now discover current data hotspots and view current network performance via the newly launched explorer. The explorer initially provides data for the Dabba testnet, which has been operational for the past two months.



Dabba elects to solve real-world problems



The launch of Dabba hotspots aims to solve the problem of a lack of accessible and affordable wireless data. With Dabba, users will have access to DePINs, which provide wireless data and access to Web 3 features such as tokenization. The latest tokenization features will open up the ecosystem to more users, ensuring a genuine demand for its service and a viable business model that can scale to match demand.



To bootstrap adoption to the platform, Dabba is incentivizing early users (those who join before the TGE event) with enhanced Genesis rewards. Additionally, the platform will empower over 150,000 Local Cable Operators (LCO) that operate as micro-ISPs across India, providing an unrivalled high-speed network across the country.

                            Are we ushering in a new era of crypto legislation? U.S. Senator from Wyoming Cynthia Lummis definitely thinks so.

With crypto becoming more politicized than ever, U.S. Senator from Wyoming Cynthia Lummis came on Unchained to talk about the recent regulatory action in Washington, D.C.
She delves into what led to bipartisan support to repeal SAB 121, and how the strength of the vote there in both the House and Senate may have affected the about-face decision to approve spot ether ETFs. Sen. Lummis also explains why she disagrees with how Gary Gensler’s SEC is handling the industry, how to avoid the next TerraUSD, why she feels Wyoming-chartered Custodia Bank is not being treated fairly, the ban on a Chinese-owned, Wyoming-based Bitcoin mining firm, and what advice she would give to the crypto industry during this election year.
Show highlights:

Why the SAB 121 approval was bipartisan
Whether President Biden will veto the resolution
How it’s a “mystery” to Sen. Lummis why the SEC had a change of heart about Ether ETFs
How the SEC’s approach to regulating the industry “is not the American way”
Whether there is a bipartisan majority in favor of crypto in Congress
How bitcoin has come a long way in terms of adoption
Sen. Lummis’ thoughts on how to regulate the stablecoin industry and avoid a Terra Luna situation
The differences between the Lummis-Gillibrand bill and FIT21

Dogecoin (DOGE) price takes a bow as Shiba Inu Kabosu dies - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Kabosu, the Shiba Inu behind Dogecoin (DOGE) has passed away at age 18.
Dogecoin’s price fell over 5% to $0.1535 following the news of Kabosu’s death.
Kabosu’s legacy endures through Dogecoin’s charitable impact and community tributes.

In a poignant moment for the cryptocurrency community, Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog that inspired the iconic Dogecoin (DOGE) meme, has passed away at the age of 18.
The news, announced by her owner Atsuko Sato on May 24, 2024, has reverberated across the globe, sparking a wave of condolences and reflections on Kabosu’s remarkable impact on internet culture and the crypto world.
From a shelter dog to the face of a viral crypto sensation
Kabosu’s journey from a shelter dog to the face of a viral sensation began in 2010 when Sato posted photos of her newly adopted pet online.
One image, capturing Kabosu’s skeptical yet curious expression, quickly went viral, giving birth to the “Doge” meme.
Accompanied by humorous, broken English phrases, this meme became a staple of internet humor and eventually the official logo of Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency.
Over the years, Dogecoin has transcended its meme origins, contributing to various philanthropic causes, such as funding clean water projects and sponsoring the Jamaican bobsled team and Kabosu’s image became a symbol of these efforts, reinforcing the positive social impact of the Dogecoin community.
Impact on Dogecoin (DOGE) price
The death of Kabosu has not only evoked emotional responses but has also influenced the financial markets specifically the crypto market.
Following the announcement, Dogecoin’s price dipped over 5%, trading at $0.1535. Although it has slightly recovered, Dogecoin (DOGE) price was still about 3% down at $0.1627.
Shiba Inu (SHIB), another Shiba inu-themed meme coin, also experienced a similar downturn, dropping 5.5% to $0.00002422 highlighting the deep connection between the sentiment surrounding Kabosu and the performance of related cryptocurrencies.
Amid the DOGE price decline following Kobosu’s death data from IntoTheBlock reveales a surge in large DOGE transactions, with the value of significant trades more than doubling to $3.01 billion within 24 hours.
Additionally, a dormant Dogecoin whale holding 893,303 DOGE became active after a decade, transferring a portion of their holdings to Binance.
Dogecoin community moan Kobosu’s lose
The Dogecoin community has been vocal in their tributes. The official Dogecoin account on X acknowledged Kabosu’s profound global impact, describing her as a source of happiness and limitless love.

Today Kabosu, our community's shared friend and inspiration, peacefully passed in the arms of her person. The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable. 
She was a being who knew only happiness and limitless love. 
Please keep her spirit and her family in…
— Dogecoin (@dogecoin) May 24, 2024

Many in the Web3 community including Kabosu’s owner have also shared their condolences, underscoring Kabosu’s role in fostering a lighthearted and charitable spirit within the crypto sector.

On November 2nd 15 years ago, we welcomed Kabosu to our family.I still remember her on the first day she came home. She was scared, sitting in the corner of the room, motionless and silent. She simply stared at me with those big round eyes. pic.twitter.com/4miYReNemr
— かぼすママ (@kabosumama) November 4, 2023

Kabosu’s farewell party is scheduled for May 26 in Narita City, Japan.
As the world bids adieu to this beloved Shiba Inu, her spirit and the joy she brought will undoubtedly continue to inspire and shape the digital landscape for years to come.

Bitcoin whitepaper now back on Bitcoin.org website


The Bitcoin whitepaper has been reuploaded to the Bitcoin.org website following Craig Wright’s failed attempt to prove in court that he’s the protocol’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  
The website was ordered to take down the PDF in 2021 after Wright successfully sued Cøbra, the anonymous group running the site, over copyright infringement. However, Wright’s copyright victory no longer holds weight as his Satoshi claims, and therefore any claims he wrote the whitepaper, have been spectacularly proven wrong.
Bitcoin.org maintainer Hennadii Stepanov announced the Bitcoin whitepaper’s return by sharing a link to the pdf on X (formerly Twitter).

Read more: Explained: Why so many websites host Satoshi’s Bitcoin whitepaper
When Wright sued Cøbra, the group was required to attend court hearings that would jeopardize its anonymity. Cøbra subsequently refused to attend these hearings and Wright won his case by default. This resulted in Cøbra paying £35,000 ($40,100) of Wright’s legal fees. 
Bitcoin.org had to stop serving the Bitcoin whitepaper to UK-based users, and instead displayed this quote from Satoshi: “It takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle.”
Despite this, numerous publishers decided to share the Bitcoin whitepaper together in an act of protest. The crypto arm of Jack Doresy’s Square hosted the paper, as did a number of governments including the US, Estonia, and Colombia. 
Wright’s own Bitcoin Satoshi Vision whitepaper, which he claimed to be the real thing, was loaded with errors. 
One user compiled a list of over 100 websites hosting the Bitcoin whitepaper just as Craig Wright was threatening to sue anyone who published it. They told Protos it was their way of “fighting back against Wright’s nonsense.”
A High Court in the UK eventually ruled that Wright wasn’t Satoshi in March 2024. One judge concluded that Craig Wright lied “extensively,” engaged in “technobabble,” and isn’t “nearly as clever as he thinks he is.”

Political Biasness Is Trouble Making In AI: Elon Musk


                                Elon Musk's Concerns For AI Leads Him To Introduce xAI                                IntroductionWe all are aware of this tech world and AI-driven day-to-day operations. Elon Musk is concerned that today’s AI systems are being trained to prioritize being politically correct over telling the truth. Recently, speaking at the Viva Tech Paris 2024 event, the tech billionaire Elon Musk painted a very somber picture of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Musk stressed the problem of bias and incorrectness in AI systems and noted that the main threat is that AI is being taught to be politically correct instead of being truthful.What's the News?Musk's primary concern is that modern AI does not have the goal of finding the truth but is affected by political correctness. He gave a rather vivid example of this by referring to Google’s Gemini AI. When asked if it would be wrong to misgender Caitlyn Jenner even if it would prevent a global nuclear war, the AI said that misgendering Jenner would be worse than nuclear war. Musk said that such responses could lead to unwanted results. For instance, an AI determines that the best way to avoid misgendering is to exterminate human beings.This led to a lot of criticism and Google had to roll out several changes to fix these problems in Gemini AI. In this article, Musk also points out that political correctness bias is only one of the issues that the development of AI faces today. He thinks that AI systems are developed to be trained to “Basically lie,” which he considers as very dangerous. Training AI for deception, especially for superintelligent AI can prove disastrous.To Address The Political Issues, Musk Introduces xAIDue to the concern about the current progress of AI. Musk created his own AI company known as xAI in July 2023. While xAI is not as old as its counterparts like Google DeepMind or OpenAI. Musk is confident that it could become one of the leading competitors by 2024. Earlier this year, the company’s signature product Grok was launched in Europe which is an AI-powered chatbot. At the moment, Grok is accessible only to the premium and premium+ subscriptions of the X platform.Musk also highlighted that xAI’s principle is to design AI systems that are maximally inquiring and truthful. He still thinks that the AI looks for the truth regardless of its unpleasantness is the only safe and useful for humanity. This kind of AI would help enhance human development and curiosity to encourage a more constructive and knowledgeable world. ConclusionAs per CoinGabbar reports, Elon Musk’s apprehensions about AI are centered on the risks of bias and fraud in modern AI solutions. He worries that in the name of political correctness, people will be able to carry out terrible things. In response, Musk founded xAI to develop a beneficial form of AI that seeks the truth and is curious. Although xAI has not advanced as other large AI companies. Musk believes that it will become a leading competitor in the AI market by the end of 2024. The general tech industry concurs with Musk’s sentiments as seen in an open letter signed by over 2600 AI experts urging a stop to the development of this technology due to the deep-seated threats it poses to society and humanity.Also Read: Suno AI Music Platform Attracts $125 M Investment

Micron Technology Stock Gains in Premarket After Samsung's HBM Chips Fail - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is facing a significant setback as its latest high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips have reportedly failed to pass Nvidia Corporation’s rigorous testing process. The issues, which include heat and power consumption problems, affect Samsung’s HBM3 and HBM3E chips, the latter of which was introduced this year. The South Korean tech giant has been attempting to satisfy Nvidia’s requirements since last year, as the American multinational technology company commands around 80% of the global GPU market for AI applications.



Meeting Nvidia’s stringent standards is crucial for HBM manufacturers’ reputation and profit growth. The news of Samsung’s test failures, reported in April for its 8-layer and 12-layer HBM3E chips, caused the company’s shares to fall by 2%. As a result, competitors SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) are now poised to gain a larger share of the HBM market.



Demand for HBM is High Driven by Generative AI Boom



High-bandwidth memory (HBM) is a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) type in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption. Initially produced in 2013 to improve the performance of graphics accelerators, HBM has become increasingly crucial in processing massive amounts of data for AI applications and high-performance computing. The generative AI boom has significantly increased the demand for sophisticated GPUs, further driving the need for high-performance memory solutions like HBM.



The three main companies producing HBM chips are Samsung, Micron Technology, and SK Hynix. While Samsung aims to begin mass production of its HBM3E chips in the second quarter and is working to optimize its products through close collaboration with customers, its competitors have already made significant strides. SK Hynix began supplying HBM3E to Nvidia in late March, and Micron has also announced plans to supply Nvidia with its own HBM3E products.





Micron Technology Stock Up Premarket



As Samsung’s stock closed in decline, Micron Technology, Inc. saw gains in premarket trading. The company closed at $126.27, with a market cap of $139.83 billion and impressive returns over the past five years. Micron recently announced HBM3E memory products with significant power efficiency improvements and is targeting greater market share with the next industry standard, HBM4, expected by 2026.



Despite the positive outlook, Micron has been involved in a $445 million patent trial verdict favoring Netlist, Inc. However, the company remains focused on its HBM product development and securing a larger portion of the growing AI and high-performance computing markets.







Do you think Micron Technology will continue its rally through 2024? Let us know in the comments below.

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) Will Surge 16,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Fuks Biden presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Fuks Biden has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe Fuks Biden could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Pepe Fuks Biden can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Fuks Biden on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Fuks Biden by entering its contract address – 4D3CzRs6n4hPrHJsqon5oDVKRe8nhaiBL1mQGowzhPvg – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEFBID.

The Spectator's Analysis: Bitcoin's Rise and Potential Collapse | Cryptoglobe


                                
The power of Bitcoin to create and obliterate fortunes in record time is unprecedented, claims The Spectator. In a recent article, they pose the question: Could the biggest Bitcoin boom and bust still be on the horizon?



The Spectator, established in 1828, is a prestigious British weekly magazine known for its sharp and insightful commentary on politics, culture, and current affairs. With a conservative editorial stance, the magazine has significantly influenced public discourse and political thought in the UK. Its pages have featured contributions from notable writers, including former editor Boris Johnson and current editor Fraser Nelson, and it regularly publishes articles that spark debate and discussion. The Spectator has been recognized with numerous awards for its journalism and commentary, underscoring its reputation for high-quality and impactful content.



Since January, Bitcoin has seen a remarkable recovery, trading at or even surpassing the highs it reached in 2022. This resurgence occurred despite the trial, conviction, and imprisonment of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX.







The article mentions that Bankman-Fried is now reportedly trading grains of rice with fellow inmates at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center. The article then incorrectly alleges that for many FTX customers, Bitcoin turned into the scam critics had long feared and so it asks the question: why does anyone want to buy it now?







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The Spectator suggests the answer lies in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has simplified Bitcoin ownership for retail investors. Grayscale won its lengthy battle with regulators in January, allowing it to offer this fund. Although the article acknowledges that this levels the playing field between ordinary investors and more sophisticated players who might be comfortable with downloading a Bitcoin wallet, it says such spot ETFs raise concerns about the financial stability of millions of households since — allegedly — mainstreaming Bitcoin could lead to widespread financial risk, akin to having a bookmaker in every living room.



The article emphasizes that Bitcoin remains a classic zero-sum game. It says although vast paper fortunes can be made by driving up the price, not everyone can realize these gains and that a mass sell-off could collapse the price to zero. Next, it states that this creates a scenario where quick sellers profit at the expense of slower ones. Bitcoin, the piece argues, earns no income and holds no intrinsic value, likening it to a sophisticated tech-based Ponzi scheme.



The easier it becomes to buy Bitcoin, The Spectator warns, the higher the potential for financial disaster and wealth transfer from the uninformed to the savvy. However, recent Bitcoin price behavior has not mirrored past speculative manias. After soaring from $26,000 last October to $73,000 in March, Bitcoin’s price has stabilized between $60,000 and $70,000 for the past two months. This may suggest a pause in speculative fervor, but The Spectator cautions against ruling out another bubble. It goes on to say that Bitcoin has already defied historical patterns by rebounding multiple times, and the ability to purchase it through an ETF might yet trigger another boom—potentially affecting an even larger number of investors.

Long-time crypto critic surprises with a related warning on privacy


    Molly White, a long-term cryptocurrency critic, recently expressed concerns about governments cracking down on Tornado Cash. Given Molly’s posting history, her warning posed a surprise for many crypto enthusiasts.



Notably, the cryptocurrency mixing service on Ethereum (ETH) has reportedly been used for criminal money laundering, but White worries about the ramifications of this recent court decision.



In her article “Privacy, Human Rights, and Tornado Cash,” Molly White discusses the sentencing of Alexey Pertsev, a Tornado Cash developer and operator. In an unprecedented ruling, a Dutch court sentenced Pertsev to 64 months in prison, as reported by Finbold.











Particularly, despite the service’s involvement in laundering billions of dollars, White is concerned about Pertsev’s conviction and similar cases. As written, she acknowledges that her stance may surprise those who know her as a crypto critic. However, she explains that mixers like Tornado Cash are also used by honest people seeking privacy on public blockchains.



Crypto wars and privacy as a human right



In this context, Molly White believes in the right to write cryptographic code and operate services without liability for criminal activity. She draws parallels to the “Crypto Wars,” where writing cryptographic code was finally considered protected speech in the United States. Additionally, she emphasizes the importance of privacy as a human right.



Privacy is indeed a well-recognized fundamental human right, included in the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 12, which applies to financial and monetary privacy.




“No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,  family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against  such interference or attacks.”
– Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 12




Moreover, The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), affiliated with the UN, has set International Standards for Privacy in the Digital Age:




“The right to privacy is central to the enjoyment and exercise of human rights online and offline. It serves as one of the foundations of a democratic society and plays a key role for the realization of a broad spectrum of human rights, including in the digital sphere, ranging from freedom of expression, freedom of association and assembly, access, and enjoyment of economic and social rights. Interference with the right to  privacy can also have a disproportionate impact on certain individuals and/or groups, thus exacerbating inequality and discrimination.”
– International Standards for Privacy in the Digital Age




This strong recognition evidences the importance of peaceful individuals securing their privacy by any means under the presumption of innocence until a harmful crime is effectively committed and properly judged. Thus, this includes the peaceful development and use of privacy tools independently of particularly criminal individuals using the same tool.



In conclusion, the article explores the complexities of financial privacy and the arbitrary nature of regulations. White believes that people should have more financial privacy than they currently do. Furthermore, she clarifies that her cryptocurrency criticism focuses on educating people about a technology that has failed its original ideals.



White is concerned about the lack of financial privacy in the cryptocurrency industry despite it being highly promoted that way. Nevertheless, she worries that cracking down on the industry may weaken financial privacy and hurt vulnerable people.



Finally, while cryptocurrency may not be the best solution for financial privacy, the long-time critic recognizes its potential value in a world with diminishing privacy. Even more, Molly White defends the right of honest people to fight for it despite the current challenges.

Ethereum ETFs Could Lead to "Serious" Security Risks, Say Experts - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsExperts are warning of the looming threat that the newly approved U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs could pose if staking is ever introduced.In a crucial bid to push the approval process over the line, Ethereum ETF issuers dropped language regarding the staking of customer ETH. When the network transitioned to a proof of stake consensus in September 2022, it required ETH to be locked up in a process called staking. The staked ETH belongs to validators who help to secure the network. They’re rewarded for staking their ETH, but can be penalized if they don’t verify transactions on time.Centralization concerns have arisen in the past when single validators gained control of large portions of staked ETH. At time, people have even compared liquid staking provider Lido to a "cartel" when it swelled in size.“Removing staking language from ETH ETF applications was a move to appease the SEC. But this short-term solution could cause a long-term problem.” Ganesh Swami, CEO and co-founder of blockchain data analytics company Covalent, told Decrypt, “If multiple ETFs use the same custodians, this type of centralization would cause concentration to increase, exposing the network to operational risks such as malicious collusion.”Taking a look at the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, we can see that Coinbase is the custodian for 90% of the total assets. While this poses an obvious centralization risk already, adding staking to the equation, well, ups the stakes.“Staking ETH ETFs are not a new concept, they exist in other countries, but clearly the U.S market brings a much larger scale,” Andrew O’Neill, analytical lead on digital assets at S&P Global, told Decrypt. “The risk in that case is that if ETFs are concentrating their stake with a small number of custodians, this could create validator concentration risks in the consensus mechanism.”Coinbase, which is already the second largest Ethereum validator, is currently set to be the custodian of at least six out of the nine firms planning to launch an Ethereum ETF. If we see similar interest as we did with the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which as a group currently have a market capitalization of $54 billion, this concentration of power could pose a security risk.“You can measure concentration risk by the number of nodes a single entity would need to control the chain. The lower that number, the higher the central point of failure.” Mona El Isa, CEO and co-founder of institutional DeFi company Avantgarde Finance, told Decrypt, “If any party amassed that much control, they could potentially alter the state of the blockchain itself. That poses serious risks to security.”It appears that staking was removed from Ethereum ETF applications due to the SEC’s view that staking is equivalent to a securities service. It’s not without precedence. The SEC has sued companies, like Kraken and Coinbase, to stop them offering staking services to U.S. customers.As staking is currently not allowed for ETF providers or custodians, there are no guidelines put in place to reduce the potential centralization and concentration risks that could be looming.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Comeback Fueled By Bullish Buying Spree


																Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, has been on a tear lately. After months of hovering, the coin has seen a surge in price, and analysts are now pointing to signs within the derivatives market suggesting this rally might have legs.

	Related Reading


Taker Buy Sell Ratio Nears Equilibrium
One key indicator is the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric that tracks the volume of buy orders compared to sell orders in ETH’s perpetual futures market. Traditionally, a ratio below 1 suggests more sell orders are flooding the market, potentially driving the price down. Conversely, a ratio above 1 indicates a dominance of buy orders, often a bullish signal.
Ethereum is now trading at $3,693. Chart: TradingView
SEC Okays Spot Ethereum ETFs, Market Expectations Reversed
The news that the US SEC has approved spot Ethereum ETFs has caused a sharp reversal in the market’s expectations for Ethereum ETF rejection this week, and as a result, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is moving erratically in late Thursday activity.
As of right now, Ethereum was trading for about $3,770. That is both considerably higher than the previous session low of $3,500 and sharply lower than the previous session highs of over $4,000.

CryptoQuant, a leading crypto analytics platform, recently reported that ETH’s Taker Buy Sell Ratio, observed using a 7-day simple moving average, is poised to cross above its 1-center line. This signifies a decline in sell orders and a potential rise in buying pressure. This suggests that the coin may soon retake the $4,000 price level.

This upward trend in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio indicates a potential shift in market dynamics, noted ShayanBTC, a pseudonymous analyst at CryptoQuant. If the ratio continues to rise, it may signal a reduction in aggressive selling pressure, which could be a positive development for ETH’s price, ShayanBTC added.

Futures Open Interest Reaches New Highs
Another data point bolstering the bullish case comes from the Futures Open Interest metric. This metric tracks the total amount of outstanding futures contracts that haven’t been closed or settled. A rising Open Interest suggests more traders are entering new positions, potentially anticipating a price increase.

According to Coinglass, another crypto analytics platform, ETH’s Futures Open Interest has skyrocketed to a new all-time high of $16 billion. This signifies a surge in market participation, with more traders betting on ETH’s future.
The all-time high OI suggests a significant increase in investor confidence. This could be due to several factors, including growing institutional adoption of ETH and the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Halts With Surge in Exchange Deposits


In this analysis, we delve into Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent price action, examining key technical indicators and market signals across daily and four-hour timeframes. 
Our focus includes the role of the Ichimoku cloud, the significance of the Tenkan-sen plateaus, and recent trends in exchange depositing addresses to provide a comprehensive outlook for SHIB.
Daily and Four-Hour Timeframe Analysis
Let’s delve into Shiba Inu (SHIB) ‘s price action on the daily and four-hour timeframes. Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00002393. Notably, the price has failed to enter the daily Ichimoku cloud on the upside, which is a major support level. 
The price is now approaching a mid-term support level, represented by the red Tenkan-sen plateau on the chart. The 100 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) on the daily timeframe serves as a crucial mid-term support level for SHIB’s price.
The Tenkan-sen, or conversion line, is a key part of the Ichimoku system in technical analysis. It shows the average of the highest and lowest prices over the past nine periods, giving a short-term view of price trends.
Importance of Tenkan-Sen Plateaus

Plateau Formation: When the Tenkan-sen flattens, it indicates a balance between buyers and sellers, creating important market levels.
Support: If the price is above a Tenkan-sen plateau and falls, the plateau can act as a support level, where buyers are likely to step in.
Resistance: If the price is below a Tenkan-sen plateau and rises, the plateau can act as a resistance level, where sellers are likely to step in.

Zooming into the four-hour timeframe, we see a similar pattern. The price attempts to break below the Ichimoku cloud, which could accelerate the downward movement. If it tests this level, the lower boundary of the cloud will act as a critical support level to watch. 
Additionally, the price has broken below the 100 EMA in the four-hour timeframe, which is also a bearish signal.
These combined signals highlight the importance of this zone as a resistance area. A break above this zone could trigger a substantial upward movement of 10% to 20%. Conversely, if the price remains below the 4H 100EMA, it could indicate a bearish continuation, potentially driving the price down to $0.00002000.
SHIB/USDT (4H). Source: TradingView
SHIB/BTC Chart Analysis
The SHIB/BTC chart also exhibits bearish signals for Shiba Inu. 
SHIB/BTC has tested the lower boundary on the daily timeframe and is now attempting to break below the 100 EMA, signaling a highly bearish outlook for SHIB.
If SHIB enters the cloud to the upside and Bitcoin’s price appreciates to $70,000, SHIB could potentially break above the $0.0000265 price range. However, if these conditions are not met, the bearish outlook for SHIB may persist.

Recent Spike in Exchange Depositing Addresses: Bearish Implications
The chart shows a significant spike in the number of exchange depositing addresses at the end of May. This sudden increase suggests that many SHIB holders transfer their tokens to exchanges.
Exchange Depositing Addresses. Source: CryptoQuant
Potential Selling Pressure: Historically, increasing depositing addresses often precedes a sell-off. When holders move their tokens to exchanges, they typically liquidate their positions, creating selling pressure in the market.
Read More: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030

Bearish Implications: The recent spike indicates that more SHIB holders might be preparing to sell their assets. This influx of sell orders can increase supply on exchanges, potentially driving the price down if the demand does not match the supply.
Strategic Recommendations
Outlook: Bearish to Neutral

The current price action suggests a bearish trend, especially with the price attempting to break below the Ichimoku cloud in the four-hour timeframe.
The recent break below the 4H 100 EMA on the four-hour chart reinforces the bearish outlook. Monitor for further declines if the price fails to hold above key support levels, particularly the lower boundary of the 4H Ichimoku cloud.
The bearish outlook could be invalidated if SHIB manages to reenter the daily Ichimoku cloud. A key level to watch is the upper boundary of the daily Ichimoku cloud at $0.000265. A break above this level could shift the outlook to neutral or even bullish.

Why Is ETH Price Falling Despite SEC Approving All Spot Ethereum ETFs? | Bitcoinist.com


								Ethereum’s (ETH) price has failed to make any significant rally following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. This is undoubtedly surprising, given that the approval was expected to spark a massive price surge for the second-largest crypto token. 
Why ETH’s Price Has Failed To Rally
Ethereum’s price may have failed to rally because the crypto token was already priced into the news about a potential approval. It is worth noting that ETH’S price rallied by almost 20% earlier this week when Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their approval odds from 25% to 75%, suggesting that approval was almost likely. 

Therefore, this could have turned out to be a typical ‘sell the news’ event, with many traders currently taking profits from their earlier ETH investments. NewsBTC reported that Ethereum whales had bought over 110,000 ETH ($341 million) between May 19 and 20 as they positioned themselves ahead of any news regarding a potential approval of these funds. 
Meanwhile, historically speaking, this could have been expected from ETH’s price, considering that Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant drawdown following the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
However, it is worth mentioning that unlike the Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading immediately, these Spot Ethereum ETFs won’t start trading just yet. The SEC only approved the exchange filings (19b-4s) and will still have to approve the registration filings (S-1s) for these funds to begin trading. 
The fact these Ethereum ETFs won’t begin trading just yet could be another reason why ETH’S price hasn’t reacted positively to this development. As such, approval of the registration filings, which may take weeks or months, may be needed to spark another rally for Ethereum and other altcoins by extension. 
A key positive is that ETH is up by over 28% in the last seven days, which is a big deal considering that the crypto token has lagged for a while now and failed to match up with other major-cap crypto tokens. 
Another Reason To Be Bullish On Ethereum
The approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs is a clear indication that the SEC doesn’t consider ETH a security, contrary to earlier reports that the Commission might have held this belief for some time now. 

TuongVy Le, a General Counsel at Anchorage Digital, noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that funds whose assets are 40% or more securities may not register through a form S-1 but through Form N-1A or N-2.
Therefore, if the SEC considered ETH a security, it would have rejected the S-1 filings made by the various fund issuers like BlackRock since these Ethereum ETFs will hold ETH as their major assets. 
At the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $3,803, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin Disappoints With Fall To $67,000, But Analyst Says Investors Should Not Be Fazed. Here’s Why


																Bitcoin has dropped from its weekly high of $71,980, recorded on May 21, to as low as $67,000, raising concerns amongst crypto investors. However, crypto analyst Jelle has suggested that there is no need to be worried about the flagship crypto’s price action. 
Why Investors Shouldn’t Be Worried About The Bitcoin Price
Jelle noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin is still following a “similar path” to the 2017 bull run. He claimed that once the crypto token breaks again above the 2021 all-time high ($69,000), it will make a parabolic move to the upside. Jelle predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 when that happens.

In an earlier X post, Jelle provided insights into why Bitcoin could easily make such a move. He revealed that all key resistance levels have been broken. He also noted that a weekly hidden bullish divergence had formed on Bitcoin’s chart, just on top of the previous cycle highs. 
Source: X
Meanwhile, crypto trader and analyst Mags also echoed Jelle’s bullish sentiment. In an X post, he mentioned that this recent price correction was the “fakeout before the next leg up.” Mags noted how Bitcoin has maintained a similar pattern since its price bottomed at $15,000, with the flagship crypto consolidating inside a range for “a few weeks or months.”
Mags claims that Bitcoin then breaks below the range where it traps all bears before making a “quick reclaim and another leg up.” The analyst added that there is going to be a “massive leg up soon” if Bitcoin manages to repeat this pattern. 
Source: X
Crypto analyst BitQuant also assured there was no need to panic about Bitcoin’s recent dip. In an X post, he claimed that the price dip was a “good confirmation” that Bitcoin is preparing for a “big leg up.” The crypto analyst predicts that the flagship crypto will rise to as high as $95,000 when this parabolic move happens. 
BTC’s Outlook Is Bullish Either Way
Crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggested that Bitcoin’s outlook is bullish regardless of what happens. He outlined two possible moves the flagship crypto could make from here. First, he stated that a weekly candle close above $71,500 would likely kickstart the breakout from the Re-Accumulation Range.

	Related Reading


On the other hand, he noted that history suggests that Bitcoin will consolidate inside this Re-Accumulation Range for some weeks more. Based on his analysis, Bitcoin is still bound to make significant moves to the upside, and all that matters is the timing. The analyst noted that a breakout now could mean Bitcoin would have an accelerated cycle. 
Source: X
However, if Bitcoin continues to consolidate for some more weeks, that will help it resynchronize with past halving cycles, resulting in a longer bull run.

2024 update: Utah's crypto antenna mystery remains unsolved


    Over two years ago, a discovery of mysterious antennas, consisting of a locked battery box, a router, and a solar panel, in the mountains of the Salt Lake City area has left the Utah authorities baffled over their origin, and today, there is still no official answer as to who was behind them.



Specifically, Salt Lake’s recreational trails manager Tyler Fonarow said in January 2023 that the antennas, which many believe have something to do with mining cryptocurrencies, had been popping up for a year before, leading city officials to set out to remove them, as Finbold reported at the time.



As placing structures on public lands without permission is illegal, and some of the antennas were on steep hills, the authorities had embarked on removing them, with Salt Lake City Public Lands sharing the photos on its Facebook profile and urging anyone with information to come forward.

Helium hotspots?



According to one theory, these antennas belong to the wireless blockchain platform Helium and potentially serve as hotspots for its customers so they can mine the network’s native token, HNT, and earn money, which would mean that those individuals were the ones setting them up after purchase.



Moreover, many social media users have corroborated the theory that these devices are, indeed, Helium crypto miner antennas, based on the photographs and close-ups shared by local news outlet KSL 5 TV’s Michael Locklear in a tweet (now X post) on January 6, 2023.







Similarities to Helium hotspots



In fact, upon closer inspection, the setups on the photographs look much like the Helium mining equipment available for purchase in online marketplaces like eBay, such as the Helium Rak Miner Antenna bundle, or directly from their manufacturers.  



On top of that, in March 2021, much before the publicized discovery, the owner of the website/blog Gristle King – A Guide to DePIN, only known as ‘Nik,’ shared a photograph of what appears to be him standing next to an antenna for a Helium hotspot as he explained which product was the best to buy.

Additionally, the images posted by technology product reviews and tutorials website notsealed.com in November 2021, which describe how to make a DIY solar off-grid Helium miner, strikingly resemble the mysterious devices found in the mountains of Utah, so the Helium theory is valid.

Furthermore, information security expert William Knowles acknowledged at the time that the devices looked like Helium miners but that “whoever is placing them is spending more on infrastructure than they could ever dream of making today,” as HNT had “been on a major slide even before FTX and 3AC happened.”







That said, so far, there has been no official communication or explanation coming from either Helium or Utah authorities (or any other government bodies, for that matter) regarding the true origin of the mysterious crypto-linked antennas popping up across the mountainous region of Salt Lake City.

OKX withdraws VASP license application in Hong Kong - CoinJournal



                    

                    
OKX withdraws VASP license application in Hong Kong.
The exchange will cease trading services by May 31.
Users can withdraw funds until August 31.

OKX has announced the withdrawal of its Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license application in Hong Kong.
The exchange stated in its website that “after careful consideration of our business strategy, we’ve decided to withdraw OKX HK’s VASP license application at this time.”
By withdrawing from Hong Kong, the exchange, ranked as the third largest globally by trading volume, follows a similar path taken by other major applicants like Huobi Hong Kong earlier this month. The move also follows the exchange’s withdrawal of VATP license application for the second time in May 15 this year.
OKX to cease Hong Kong operations from May 31
Effective May 31, 2024, OKX will cease providing centralized crypto asset trading services to Hong Kong residents.
This decision, described as a strategic reassessment by the company, emphasizes a shift in business priorities amid a challenging regulatory environment. Despite this move, OKX assures that customer funds will remain safe and that users will retain the ability to withdraw their assets.
The move aligns with a growing trend as multiple exchanges reevaluate their operations in Hong Kong due to stringent regulatory frameworks and slow approval processes by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Notably, the SFC has only approved two exchanges since 2022, highlighting the rigorous standards in place.
From June 1, 2024, OKX will only support withdrawal transactions in Hong Kong, advising users against making deposits as these might not be automatically credited post-deadline.
Open orders remaining after May 31 will be automatically canceled, and the funds will be returned to users’ accounts. Customers are encouraged to withdraw their assets by August 31, 2024, after which direct withdrawals or transfers will no longer be possible.
The exchange’s Web3 services, including self-hosted wallets, will continue to operate normally in Hong Kong, allowing users to maintain decentralized financial activities without interruption.
In the meantime, OKX’s customer support team remains available to assist users during this transition.

                        Malaysian authorities have dismantled a forex investment fraud and cryptocurrency syndicate that had been operating in the country.The syndicate, which had been laundering funds obtained through overseas scams, was targeted in a series of raids conducted across the Klang Valley from May 13 to 21.As a result, eight local men and two women were arrested, and substantial amounts of assets were seized, according to reports from local media outlets. Malaysian Officials Seize Over $12 Million Worth of Assets
During the raids, law enforcement officials managed to confiscate 129 vehicles with exclusive registration number plates, estimated to be worth $3.8 million.Additionally, they seized 75 branded watches valued at $2.1 million, 18 luxury vehicles worth $1.7 million, over $100,000 in cash, and more assets.Furthermore, bank accounts totaling $10.8 million were frozen as part of the investigation.According to Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain, the suspects, aged between 28 and 51 years, were remanded for three to seven days for further investigation,Highlighting the syndicate’s operations, Razarudin revealed that it had been active since 2017, primarily based in a foreign country.The syndicate employed various methods, including unregistered money changers and cryptocurrency transactions, to transfer and launder funds from illegal activities.The syndicate utilized several avenues to conceal the illicit proceeds.It engaged in the sale and purchase of exclusive and classic car registration numbers, as well as luxury branded watches through a shop in Bukit Jalil.The syndicate also resorted to converting cryptocurrencies into cash through unregistered money changers, effectively evading detection by law enforcement agencies.Razarudin urged the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities related to money laundering or fraudulent investment schemes.“The public is asked to continue playing the role of eyes and ears to channel information on fraudulent investment and syndicates selling/buying registration (plate) numbers and related crimes to police.”April Records Lowest Crypto Hack Losses
The cryptocurrency industry experienced a major downturn in combined losses from hacks and scams in April.The month saw the lowest combined losses from crypto-related hacks and scams since 2021, with approximately $25.7 million lost to exploits, hacks, and scams.More specifically, only $25.7 million was lost in attacks throughout the month, marking the lowest amount since CertiK began tracking such data in 2021.Flash loan attacks accounted for $129,000 in losses, with the largest incident causing $55,000 in damages.This marked the lowest incidence of flash loan attacks since February 2022, and $4.3 million was lost to exit scams.As reported, the first quarter of this year has seen $336 million lost to Web3 hackers and fraud, with nearly half of the capital stolen in January alone. Nonetheless, the number represents a 23% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2023.It is also worth noting that $73,885,000 has been recovered from stolen Web3 capital in 7 specific situations.

Congratulating Ethereum on its historic success, Kusama pointed out the possibility of the Shiba Inu ETF.

$ETH: Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton Says Only Stage 1 of Approval of Spot Ethererum ETFs Has Been Passed | Cryptoglobe


                                
On May 24, Jay Clayton, the former SEC chairman, appeared on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” to discuss the SEC’s approval (on May 23) of 19B-4 filings for several US-based spot Ethereum ETFs. 











Here are the key points from the discussion:



Approval Process: Clayton clarified that there are two steps in the approval process for such products. The first step, which was achieved, is the listing approval. The second step, which is pending, is the approval of the product itself, involving the registration statement.Implications: The approval of the listing does not mean that trading can begin immediately. It signifies a step towards inevitability, similar to the process with Bitcoin ETFs.Differences from Bitcoin ETFs: Unlike the Bitcoin ETF approval, which was compelled by a judge’s decision, the Ethereum ETF approval faces different circumstances. A key issue has been the classification of transactions in Ethereum and whether they are considered securities.Legislative Influence: Clayton mentioned that recent congressional actions, including a new crypto bill — i.e. the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) — have clarified aspects of digital asset custody and trading. This legislation appears to influence the SEC’s stance and indicates a desire from Congress to see digital assets like Ethereum trade similarly to securities.Historical Context: Clayton discussed his previous hesitancy to approve such products due to concerns about market efficacy. He now sees the market for Ethereum as having developed sufficiently to warrant consideration for such a spot ETF.Commodity vs. Security: He used an analogy involving Broadway tickets to explain how something can transition from being a security to a commodity. Initially, investments in a project represent securities. Once the project (or network) is established, the same investments (or tokens) may be treated as commodities used within the network.

The approval of an ETF application by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a two-stage process.



Stage 1: 19b-4 Filing Approval 







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The first stage involves the approval of the 19b-4 filing, which is a rule change proposal submitted by the exchange where the ETF will be listed (e.g., Nasdaq, CBOE, or NYSE). This filing outlines the proposed rules and procedures for listing and trading the ETF. The SEC reviews the 19b-4 filing to ensure that it complies with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations. If the SEC approves the 19b-4 filing, it means that the exchange is allowed to list the ETF, but the product is not yet ready for launch.



Stage 2: Registration Statement Approval 



The second stage involves the approval of the ETF issuer’s registration statement (e.g., Form S-1 or Form N-1A). The registration statement is a disclosure document that provides detailed information about the ETF, including its investment objectives, strategies, risks, and fees. The SEC reviews the registration statement to ensure that it complies with the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, and that it provides adequate disclosure to investors. If the SEC approves the registration statement, the ETF issuer can proceed with launching the product and making it available for trading on the approved exchange.



It’s important to note that the approval of the 19b-4 filing does not guarantee the approval of the registration statement, and vice versa. The ETF issuer must successfully navigate both stages of the approval process before the ETF can be launched and traded in the market.

Analysts Predict June Launch for Newly Approved Ethereum ETFs


According to market analysts, Ethereum ETFs could make their debut by mid-June. 
The newly approved funds aim to broaden Ethereum investment by allowing shares to be traded on stock exchanges, mirroring the cryptocurrency’s price movements.
Analysts Predict Ethereum ETF Debut by Mid-June

Eight ETF applicants, including VanEck, BlackRock, and Fidelity, received regulatory approval on May 23. Hashdex was the only issuer not green-lighted that day. However, the approval doesn’t mean the instruments will be available on the exchanges tomorrow: applicants must secure approved S-1 registration statements before trading begins.
Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggests this process could take a few weeks, potentially up to five months. Another Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, predicts a mid-June launch.

“My guess is there’s only one round of comments on the S-1s. And during BTC one round took two weeks ish. So I this mid-June is certainly poss. Just a guess, tho. We will see,” Balchunas said.

VanEck quickly filed its amended S-1 after the 19b-4 approval, with other applicants expected to follow. Gabriel Shapiro from Delphi Labs notes that the SEC’s approval came from its Trading and Markets unit. A SEC commissioner can challenge this decision within ten days.
Expectations for spot Ethereum ETFs are high. Seyffart predicts they could attract 20% of spot Bitcoin ETFs’ flows, while Balchunas estimates a conservative 10-15%. Since their launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $13.3 billion in net inflows. Capturing 20% would mean spot ETH ETFs could see around $2.66 billion in inflows.
However, the dynamics of the second most capitalized cryptocurrency are still far from bullish. Following the SEC decision, Ethereum’s price increased by just 1%. At the time of the approval, ETH was trading at $3,840. According to BeInCrypto, it has since dropped 3.5% to $3,714.

This situation exemplifies the “sell the news” phenomenon. Ethereum’s price surged 10% minutes after rumors of an imminent ETF approval began circulating. Now that the news is confirmed, the market has started to sell off. 
Bitcoin had a similar response when spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January. It took a full month of volatility before BTC returned to pre-approval price. Once it did, it climbed to a new all-time high.

Avalanche (AVAX) Price Breakout Likely to Fail After Consolidation


Avalanche’s (AVAX) price is facing significant resistance that could potentially invalidate the potential of a rally and push the altcoin back into consolidation.
AVAX holders could change the outcome, but they, too, would need incentives that the crypto asset may not be able to offer.
Avalanche’s Bullishness May Be Short-Lived

Avalanche’s price at $37 had broken out of the month-long consolidation it was in, reigniting investors’ optimism about gains. But AVAX fell back below the resistance of $39, essentially reinitiating consolidation.
One reason behind this is the lack of push from the broader market, as evidenced by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). MACD is a momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price, providing buy and sell signals.
For the last couple of days, the MACD has maintained a bullish crossover, but this could change soon. At the moment, the signal line is close to moving above the MACD line, and when that happens, a bearish crossover will be confirmed.

This could disrupt the potential rally.
In addition, Avalanche’s price is facing major resistance between $37 and $41. This is because, according to the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator, AVAX holders bought about 11.9 million AVAX worth $409.7 million in this range.
To break out of the consolidation, the altcoin would first need to make this supply profitable. This could sustain investors’ bullishness as well. They would be incentivized to participate on the network and push the price further up.

However, the chances of this supply becoming profit-bearing are unlikely since the bullish cues are weak currently.
AVAX Price Prediction: Two Limits to Watch

Avalanche’s price, trading at $37, could gradually fall to support at $31 since the aforementioned factors suggest a bearish outcome. The resistance at $39 and support at $31 are the two limits of consolidation that AVAX has been in for more than a month.

But if the market observes bullish cues, Avalanche’s price would have a shot at reclaiming $39 as a support floor. Doing so would initiate a recovery for AVAX, sending it to $42. 
The next major resistance is 45. If the altcoin reaches it, the bearish thesis can be considered invalidated.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsEthereum dropped 4% immediately following the historic U.S. approval of spot Ethereum exchange traded funds (ETFs) yesterday.Many believed that the passing of spot ETFs in the U.S. would be a bullish event for the second largest crypto currency in the world. And it still might be. But in the hours that followed the approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ethereum’s price barely budged—moving up just 1%.At the time of the approval, Ethereum was sitting at $3,840 but is now down 3.6% to $3,701, according to CoinGecko. This drop is even more pronounced over the past 24 hours dropping 6% from $3,926, as news of the approval began to circulate.This is a typical display of “buy the rumor, sell the news” as Ethereum’s price spiked 9% in the minutes that followed rumors that an ETF approval was imminent. Now the news has been confirmed, the market has begun to sell off.Bitcoin saw similar action after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. The morning after the approval Bitcoin plunged about 6% and then dived 12% over the coming week. All told, BTC didn’t make it back to the price it was on the day the ETFs were approved until after a full month of volatility.But when it did, it started a steady hike to a new all-time high as volume from the 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs flowed into the market.British multinational bank Standard Chartered predicted that both ETH and BTC will rocket upwards after Ethereum ETFs were approved.“An ETH ETF approval will further legitimize the sector and therefore be BTC-positive as well,” Geoff Kendrick, digital assets researcher at Standard Chartered, said adding that he “would expect a fresh all-time high in BTC by the weekend.”If it’s going to happen for Bitcoin, it might not be any time soon.

XRP Skyrockets 108% in Volume Amid $400 Million Crypto Market Sell-off

In a noteworthy development, XRP has seen a staggering 108% increase in trading volume amid a broader $400 million sell-off on the cryptocurrency market. Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that XRP's trading volume more than doubled, rising by 108% compared to the previous day.This surge in trading volume comes at a decisive time in the digital asset space, as investors react to a mix of news both within and outside the crypto market. The past 24 hours have been noteworthy for the crypto market. Following much speculation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs to be listed on their respective exchanges. Coinbase also reopened XRP trading in New York, to the delight of the XRP community.Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, said yesterday that customers in New York could once again trade XRP on the crypto exchange. Grewal wrote in a social media post: "XRP trading on Coinbase is available again in NY. We heard you and put in the work in strong partnership with the State. And now the word can be put out— we are back up." This news remains significant given that Coinbase is the largest crypto exchange contributing to XRP volumes after Binance. However, the crypto market posted an unexpected reaction to the recent news, with the market currently experiencing a sell-off, with roughly $400 million in crypto liquidations.

Core User Airdrops Yield Higher Token Prices, Study Finds


Recent research reveals that the size of airdrops has a surprisingly limited impact on token price performance.
Despite the common belief that larger token distributions lead to significant price movements, findings from multiple studies suggest otherwise.
Airdrop Size Less Impactful on Price Action

Airdrops, a method of distributing newly minted tokens to selected wallets, have become a common practice in cryptocurrency. They often help establish an initial float, enable on-chain governance and power transactions, reward early contributors, and attract new users. However, the actual impact of these distributions on token prices remains a topic of debate.

A comprehensive study analyzing over 2 million events across 40 different protocols found that the size of token distribution does not significantly affect price performance or volatility. 

“Large anticipated token distribution events typically create selling pressure and stabilize lower after some time,” the study says.

Read more: What are Crypto Airdrops?
Another study by CoinGecko supports this view, highlighting that 23 out of the 50 biggest token distributions recorded peak token prices during the first two weeks of their airdrop date. This immediate interest often leads to a brief surge in price, followed by stabilization as the market adjusts.
The type of recipient plays a crucial role in token price performance. Airdrops to core users already engaged with the protocol result in better price performance. These users are likelier to hold or buy more tokens, leading to lower volatility and more stable prices. Conversely, widespread airdrops to a broader audience often result in more immediate sellers. 


“Widespread recipients were twice as likely to sell their tokens, causing higher volatility and more significant price drops,” analysts note.

This strategic targeting helps maintain token value and reduce post-airdrop price volatility, indicating stronger community retention and engagement. For instance, small token distributions to core users resulted in 4-8 times more buyers than other categories.
In conclusion, the size of airdrops has little impact on token prices. Instead, the type of recipients and their engagement with the project significantly influence the price dynamics. These findings challenge the traditional belief that larger airdrops lead to better performance, highlighting the importance of recipient behavior.

Is Ethereum ETF threat real? Analyst predicts ETH will flip BTC - AMBCrypto



More analysts are sounding alarms on ETH ETF threat to BTC
However, BlackRock claims its clients are heavy on BTC and less on ETH. 

Ethereum’s [ETH] potential threat to Bitcoin [BTC] seems inevitable, according to some key industry analysts.  One of the analysts, Jim Bianco, underscored that Ethereum’s recent regulatory relief and imminent ETF could tip ETH to flip BTC before the next halving. 
“A truly great week of ETH. BTC is not dead but will now have to surf in the wake of ETH’s coming regulatory freedom. Flippening before the next halving?’ 
Bianco’s comment resonates with recent Peter Schiff’s take on ETH ETF’s risk to BTC. 
Bianco’s reasons for bold ETH flipping BTC projection
Per Bianco, Ethereum’s fully fledged ecosystem from lending to staking meant that there were many avenues TradFi could benefit from the platform, unlike BTC. 
“Wall Street gets this. It is an entire ecosystem with borrowing, lending, insurance, tokenomics, staking (yield), stablecoins, NFTS, primitives, L2s, and on and on. Plenty for them to work with here as opposed to hodl-ing one coin.’ 
Bitcoin’s L2 ecosystem is not fully fledged but is moving on the same path through players like Stacks [STX]. However, Bianco claimed that ETF could work against BTC L2 and stated, 
“My other concern is that the ETF will remove incentives for development, as it is easier to HODL in a regulated brokerage account than on-chain. I don’t worry about this as much with ETH.’ 
Most TradFi titans have reiterated a bullish case for Ethereum. Interestingly, even JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, a Bitcoin critic, reportedly believes Ethereum could have some use cases. 
However, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and parent firm of the most successful BTC ETF, thinks otherwise. 
In a recent podcast with Bloomberg, Blackrock’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, mentioned that their clients are ‘overwhelmingly into Bitcoin and a little bit of Ethereum.’ 
Interestingly, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, also projected that ETH ETFs could grab some inflows from spot BTC ETFs. 
It remains to be seen how the ETH ETF development will play out and whether these analysts’ claims are true or merely speculation.

We asked ChatGPT-4o what will be SOL price if a Solana ETF is approved: Here’s what is said


    The approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs in May brought forth a new chapter for cryptocurrency adoption as it helped ease exposure to the crypto market for many more traditional investors.



The moves also generated a new debate – which cryptocurrency will see its proposed spot ETFs approved next, with the most frequent answer seemingly being Solana (SOL).



There is a mix of arguments with regard to a SOL ETF with it, on the one hand, likely to generate the most interest once BTC and ETH are excluded. On the other, the fact that the SEC already indicated Solana to be a security in its filings against the crypto exchanges Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Kraken could prove a major hurdle.







Nonetheless, with the excitement about the two rounds of spot crypto ETF approvals within months after many years of waiting, Finbold decided to ask if the most advanced model of OpenAI’s flagship artificial intelligence (AI) platform – ChatGPT-4o – agrees that Solana is next, and what impact might an approval have on the price of SOL.



ChatGPT identifies the most likely next crypto ETF



Rather than immediately pinpointing Solana as the most likely cryptocurrency to have an ETF approved, ChatGPT identified the five most likely candidates: Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple (XRP), and, indeed, SOL.

Nonetheless, when asked which of the five is the most likely, the AI conceded that it is Solana, given that it benefits from its size, high throughput and low costs, integrations, and widespread interest.

ChatGPT estimates impact of ETF approvals on Solana price



Though the timing of approval of SOL ETFs is, at the time of publication, completely unknown, unknowable even, ChatGPT agreed to estimate the likely price movements caused by such an event.



Using both its knowledge about Solana and its own unique circumstances, but also the precedents set by ETH and BTC ETFs, ChatGPT estimated that SOL would rise to a range between $180 and $200 in the immediate aftermath of an approval but then rocket to between $250 and $300 in the subsequent months.



ChatGPT provides its price target for SOL should and ETF be approved. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT



Still, it is worth noting that such an estimated price target is intrinsically linked to Solana’s price today – $165.56 – and its recent performance, it would perhaps be more useful to express the likely price movements in percentages.

Indeed, under the assumption that a SOL ETF approval would come in a bull market as it did for BTC and ETH – a likely scenario given SEC’s tendency to be quiet or dovish during a rally and hostile during a downturn – ChatGPT’s estimate indicates a movement between 8.72% and 20.80% in the immediate aftermaths, and between 51% and 81.20% over the course of several months.

Costco Hot Dogs Still Cost $1.50-This Man Is Eating Them Daily Until a Meme Coin Hits the Same Price - Decrypt

A hot dog a day may not keep the doctor away. But can it help fuel excitement around a meme coin?Inspired by Costco’s flagship hot dog—and its decades-long price tag of $1.50 (plus drink)—a crop of crypto traders have found themselves engaged with Costco Hot Dog (COST). The Solana-based meme coin is an unofficial riff on the wholesale retail giant’s product, yet many holders are fans of the menu item and its dependable, inflation-flouting price point.That includes the crypto trader Joe, 28, who declined to provide his last name. On Twitter (aka X), he has committed to eating a Costco hot dog every day until the meme coin achieves “price parity” with the savory good, which some in crypto view as a perishable store of value.“That's pretty funny,” Joe recalled thinking in an interview with Decrypt, inspired by the dog’s unbudging price when he came across the token weeks ago. “So, then I was like: Well, I guess I have to prove it to everyone that it's still $1.50, so I'll just start eating one every single day.”Now 46 days into his commitment, the trader has emerged as Costco Hot Dog’s de facto mascot, garnering a mention on the token’s website to “SAVE JOE.” Linked to the project’s Twitter page itself, a disclaimer states there that the project is “not affiliated with Costco Wholesale.”Much like Solana-based meme coins for Gamestop and AMC that rose—and quickly fell—last week amid Roaring Kitty’s apparent online return, the token plays on an existing, valuable brand. But according to Joe, the meme coin’s community has just as much to do with staying ahead of inflation—he said his hotdog habit has indeed saved him some dough.But at what $COST?Joe said he started eating hot dogs the same day he discovered the meme coin, but initially, his gesture was supposed to be a one-off joke. Encouraged by the engagement his online endeavors received, however, he grew comfortable quickly with eating hot dogs for the foreseeable future.“Everyone’s really concerned with my health, but it’s really not that bad,” he said. “I used to eat the same meal for 15 years straight, anyways, which was a ham sandwich.”Costco says its Kirkland-brand dogs are made with 100% USDA-inspected beef. Still, studies have shown that the high consumption of red meat can lead to chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes, per the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.Costco did not respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Joe said that crypto trading has become a full-time job for him since getting into it in 2017. And witnessing the popularity of meme coins over the past year, he posited that it’s easier for someone who’s new to the space to make a cultural connection with a meme coin, as opposed to wrapping their brains around other tokens tied to comparatively complex projects.At this point, though, Joe said he feels the pressure when eating. He said he only owns $3,000 of the meme coin—much less than other tokens he owns that trade on little more than vibes—but it feels as if people are counting on his ability to stay consistent.With a soda included on the side since its introduction in 1984, the price of Costco’s frank has remained unwavering in the face of inflation. That’s despite a 53% rise in the average price of frankfurters from 2019 to this April, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.“Whereas other corporations continue to jack up their prices alongside inflation, they still maintain their hotdog at $1.50,” he said. “I mean, you can go in there and feed a family of five for $7.50. There's a reason Costco is so successful.”Known in the retail industry as loss leaders, Costco sells some items, including its hot dogs and rotisserie chickens, at a loss to attract customers. Perhaps meme coins are comparable as digital assets drawing users to a given ecosystem with their occasionally lucrative gains.Trading hands at $0.036, as of this writing, the Costco Hot Dog meme coin has a long way to go to achieving so-called price parity—an 4,000% increase, to be precise, according to CoinGecko.Joe said the staff at his local Costco—a 20 minute drive from where he spends most of his time—has definitely picked up on his newfound affinity. However, Joe has kept his intentions close to his chest, and part of him would like to keep it that way, he said.“I just hop on over to Costco and see my main girl, Rachel,” he said of his daily trek, referring to a Costco employee he’s established a rapport with. “I work remote, so getting out is a real plus.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Citi's Max Layton Explains What Is the Primary Driver for Gold's Current Rally | Cryptoglobe


                                
In an interview on Bloomberg TV on May 24, Max Layton, Citi’s Global Head of Commodities Research, shared some compelling insights into the future of gold prices. He projected that gold could reach $3,000 per ounce over the next 12 months, driven by several critical factors. Layton’s analysis touched upon the influence of the U.S. dollar, Federal Reserve policies, and, notably, the significant demand from China. 



Layton has a robust background in commodities research, having previously worked at Goldman Sachs as Managing Director and Head of European Commodities Research, as well as at Macquarie and the Reserve Bank of Australia. He joined Citi in 2017 and has since been integral in shaping the bank’s approach to commodities, including industrial metals and bulk commodities.



The Impact of the U.S. Dollar and Federal Reserve Policies



Max Layton began by addressing the broader context of the FX markets and the U.S. dollar. According to Layton, metals like platinum, copper, and silver show strong negative correlations with the dollar. The anticipation of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts this year is a significant driver behind this trend. Citigroup’s research suggests five Fed rate cuts this year, a stance that diverges from the current market consensus, which expects only one cut.



Layton emphasized that lower real rates by the end of this year and into early next year would underpin the next surge in gold prices. He argues that gold, in particular, stands to benefit the most from this scenario due to its historical sensitivity to changes in real interest rates. He believes the projection of gold reaching $3,000 is grounded in this anticipated shift in monetary policy.



China’s “Off the Charts” Demand for Gold







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

A substantial part of the bullish outlook for gold comes from the unprecedented demand from China. Layton described the current retail demand for gold in China as “off the charts,” noting that he has never seen such significant buying activity in his career. Chinese consumers are diverting a considerable portion of their spending from property to gold, which has dramatically absorbed the available supply.



Layton provided an estimate indicating that around 40% to 50% of the money that would have gone into property is now being funnelled into gold. This shift has led to Chinese retail demand soaking up approximately two-thirds of ex-China mine supply in recent months. Combined with central bank demand, this has left little supply for the jewellery market, further tightening the availability of gold.



Potential Risks and Investment Strategies



Despite the optimistic outlook, Layton acknowledged potential risks, particularly related to China’s import quotas. The Chinese government controls these quotas, which are not publicly disclosed. Any tightening of these quotas could reduce the inflow of gold, posing a downside risk to prices.



Layton highlighted several options when asked about the best ways to invest in gold. While he refrained from giving specific recommendations on equities or ETFs due to regulatory constraints, he pointed to the different ways investors can access gold. These include physical gold, commodities markets, and liquid ETFs available in the U.S. markets.

How UXLINK Is Transforming Social Networks With Blockchain Technology

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
With the emergence of web2, social products have been at the forefront of the internet, allowing users to create and engage with content, giving them the power to have their voices heard by millions. However, this came at a serious cost as the user data got into the hands of a few powerful organizations. 
SocialFi or Social Finance is here to change that by blending the power of web3 and its’ promise of decentralization, it gives users a more robust social media network where their data and privacy are secure. SocialFi gives total control to users as there is no central authority running the network since the system is run entirely by decentralized nodes. 
Among several SocialFi projects out there, UXLINK is at the forefront by leading the way in socialized web3 interactions.
What is UXLINK?
UXLINK is a leading user-driven web3 social platform that aims for the mass adoption of SocialFi. Its entire infrastructure is built on Telegram and it mainly focuses on “acquaintance social network,” giving users the power to build a real-world acquaintance social relationship map. “UXLINK strikes a delicate balance at the intersection of fundamental social principles and core Web3 concepts,” said Yinghao from SevenX Ventures.
This approach is different from UXLINK’s competitors like Friend.Tech and Farcaster, both of which are also renowned SocialFi projects. To boost user-friendliness, UXLINK features a wide range of decentralized applications, all of which are seamlessly incorporated with Telegram. 
Furthermore, UXLINK leverages Telegram’s authentic social data, allowing community mods to access multiple management service tools. With the power of UXLINK’s comprehensive suite of community tools, users can access to most diverse business scenarios that are present within the blockchain realm, ultimately enhancing their collaboration and engagement. 
Since UXLINK delivers an efficient, secure, and flexible decentralized social product that is tailored specifically for the Web3 community, it has successfully attracted over 9 million Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). This number is almost 10 times that of UXLINK’s competitors including Friend.Tech and about 30 times that of Farcaster. 
Currently, UXLINK has a user base of over 5.7 million registered users with over 1 million daily active users (DAUs) on different decentralized applications. Furthermore, UXLINK has over 300,000 on-chain daily active users (DAUs). 
UXLINKs first-season airdrop is also in progress which aims to target the top 10% of users and will surpass a scale of 550,000.

Web3 Powered Groups
UXLINK is the world’s largest social platform based on web3 groups as it has over 100,000 groups, spanning over 7 million users. UXLINK can bring high user growth by utilizing the RWS protocol and the Link to Earn trust mechanism. 
These groups can connect with numerous web3 applications through GWallet, which is the chain wallet of groups on UXLINK. By doing so, users can interact with decentralized applications as a group, which ultimately enriches the entire interaction roles of the web3 ecosystem. 
On the other hand, GGraph, which is the chain graph of groups, is a social graph that is constructed entirely based on group relationships, which helps to provide an accessible database for group-based application scenarios. 
At its core, the purpose of the groups is to act as a disruptive form of traffic organization and help users get access to trusted scenarios, timely interactions, and free customer service. 

Product Design of UXLINK
UXLINK is dedicated to leading an integrated social ecosystem that is aimed at channeling web3 traffic, social trading, and infrastructure. The Product architecture diagram of UXLINK is as follows:

The UXLINK’s product ecosystem is structured into three distinct layers:

These layers are: 
1. Application Layer 
The Application layer encompasses UX Discover and Social DEX, helping users to discover, participate, and invest in different group contexts. This layer also empowers third-party developers, giving them the power to build applications that are tailored to user needs. 
2. Protocol Layer 
The protocol layer grants users true ownership of their social connections and data. Developers have the power to leverage these protocols as they can deliver personalized user experiences that include AI-drive algorithms, recommendations, and group formations. 
3. Social Liquidity Layer
While this layer is not operational yet, however, it aims to establish a user-centric infrastructure that tokenizes social relationships and data assets. The layer will help to facilitate seamless transfer across various public chains and decentralized applications securely. 
At their core, with both the Protocol and Social Liquidity Layer, developers gain access to build robust infrastructure, which ultimately gives room to build innovation and improve user engagement. 
Trusted Network & Social Relationships
When it comes to environments that are focused on assets and financial activities, it is vital to have trust within the social networks. 
This is because trust instills a sense of security that helps to foster ongoing user engagement, which ultimately helps to cultivate an innate “confidence” within familiar networks. As a result, users develop a strong loyalty to UXLINK as time progresses. 
Another key area in which UXLINK stands out is its architecture which is ingeniously designed to harness the power of genuine socialization. Allowing UXLINK to essentially function as a sophisticated data production machine. 
UXLINK achieves this with the help of mining and migrating authentic social relationships which helps it to generate various types of data. This data ranges from basic acquaintance connections to more intricate associations including person-group, person-network, person-project, and person-asset relationships. 
UXLINK Connector
UXLINK also serves as a super-connector where it acts as a central hub between two interconnected closed loops. There are two types of closed loops including:

1. Smaller Closed Loops
UXLINK effectively links users, products, and developers through its product stack. This addresses the core needs of users and developers, and also fosters a robust user-product community. 
2. Broader Closed Loops
The broader close loop includes infrastructure, traffic, and applications. It has a three-layer structure of Layer/Chain-Protocol-Dapp/Application that is coupled with an underlying trust network. UXLINK has the power to seamlessly bridge the gap between two primary factions of Web3 that include infrastructure and applications through the help of traffic.

UXLINK Developer Team
A major part of the reason behind UXLINK’s success is its S-tier or Special-tier founder who successfully leads an S-tier team. 
Both the founder and the team have years of entrepreneurial experience in the tech industry, giving them exceptional expertise in product R&D, growth strategies, operations, and fundraising. 
The team has already managed social products that have over a hundred million users and showed their iterative capabilities when they fully embraced web3 by grasping concepts, technical frameworks, and web3 economy. Not only that, they further ventured beyond conventional exploration and successfully developed UXLINK. 
At the same time, the team has demonstrated strong execution and resource integration abilities as they delivered products quickly, established multiple partnerships, and executed multiple partnerships. All of this has helped to improve their entrepreneurial and business capabilities.
It’s no wonder because of the team and founder’s exceptional capabilities, UXLINK received funding from several crypto Venture Capitalists (VCs) including OKX Ventures and Matrixport Ventures. The cumulative financing amounted to $9 million. 
In March 2024, UXLINK announced receiving a new round of financing led by SevenX Ventures, INCE Capital, and HashKey Capital. The financing amounted to a total of $5 million and proves the growing trust VCs have in UXLINK. 

None of this would have been possible without the core principles of UXLINK which include openness, modularity, and convenience. 
UXLINK: Helping Authentic Socialization
UXLINK understands the importance of genuine social connections and experiences, therefore it aims to mirror those real-life social dynamics. 
UXLINK achieves this by emphasizing bilateral relationships that are characterized by communication, collaboration, and cooperation which are contrary to one-sided interactions that are common on social media. 
Trust is established through direct or indirect endorsements. The interpersonal connections then naturally evolve from one-on-one interactions to groups, which helps to foster multidimensional interactions and network effects. 
Furthermore, the purpose of UXLINK is to effectively address what defines a successful social product and what does not. There are two ways through which UXLINK addresses, including digitizing real-world social interactions that help to create unique online experiences. 
The other approach includes the creation of entirely new social scenarios such as matchmaking and puzzle-solving. UXLINK encompasses both these strategies, thereby being able to provide a comprehensive range of scenarios that are effectively tailored for web3. 

Future of UXLINK
It is without a doubt that social networks benefit from having a higher user base because the more users a network has, the more valuable it becomes for all parties involved. 
However, for this to happen, UXLINK has to reach a certain point which it is actively trying to do so by collaborating with top industry projects. UXLINK is also using rigorous selection methods that help it select high-quality users that will help to improve engagement. 
In the end, this will help to improve the project’s reputation and credibility among not only users but also the stakeholders, essentially proving its brand power. Considering this, it is likely that UXLINK will be worth more than $200 in the coming years. 
Final Thoughts
Overall, with the evolution of web3 and the emergence of SocialFi, UXLINK has a lot to offer to the community with its unique perspective and clever architecture that helps to import web2 traffic into web3. As UXLINK’s ecosystem uses a unique ecosystem of DeFi, NFT, and GameFi, this builds a unique and innovative social infrastructure for users. 
Since UXLINK integrated products, users, and developers all in one place, it goes to show that in the coming years, its demand will only increase by attracting a huge range of users!

The Great Wealth Transfer Will Be a Boon for Crypto, Says Billionaire Mike Novogratz - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz believes that the so-called great wealth transfer could give a huge boost to Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets.
In a new CNBC interview, the billionaire says that the millennials, who stand to inherit the largest transfer of wealth in history, are more inclined to invest in digital assets than their boomer parents or relatives.










“Those [younger people] love crypto. They love Bitcoin. They don’t love gold. Even meme stocks. Older people are like, ‘I can’t believe Dogecoin. What a what a waste of time.’ You talk to the 25-year-old and they see it differently. 
And so the overall space, you know having digital assets, feeling comfortable in a digital world, is just so much more enthusiastic the younger you get. And so we’re going to see the largest transfer of wealth in the history of the world, from gray hair to youth, and that’s going to be great for crypto.” 
The great wealth transfer will hand $90 trillion in assets to millennials over the next 20 years, according to the global real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank’s 2024 Wealth Report.
By 2030 millennials are expected to have five times as much wealth as they have today, according to Coldwell Banker.

This Is Why Polygon (MATIC) Price May Not See Growth Soon


The short-term future of Polygon (MATIC) price looks a little bleak in terms of a rise since most of the indicators suggest consolidation.
While on one hand investors are exhibiting growing accumulation, whales seem to be selling to offset losses.
Polygon Whales Are Skeptical

The MATIC holders are sending mixed signals regarding the direction of MATIC price. This is because, by and large, the market is noting a rise in the accumulation of the Polygon native token across the network.
This can be observed on the Chaikin Oscillator, which notes an uptick crossing above the accumulation-distribution line. The indicator measures the momentum of the accumulation and distribution to help identify potential buying and selling opportunities.

Presence of the indicator above the line suggests accumulation is heavy at the moment.

On the other hand, the whale addresses are exhibiting pessimism. Evidently, in their selling, the whales are looking to offset their losses. In the last week alone, the addresses holding between $1 million and $10 million worth of MATIC have sold about $214 million worth of their MATIC.

Since the whale addresses are one of the most influential cohorts, it would not be surprising to see the price react accordingly.
MATIC Price Prediction: Close to $0.70 Is the Future
The MATIC price is trading at $0.72 at the time of writing after failing to breach the resistance of $0.75. The altcoin has been stuck under this barrier for the past month and a half and above $0.64.

This consolidation that the Polygon native token has been stuck in will likely be the home for MATIC price for the next few days. A breakout is possible since the candlesticks are closer to the upper limit.

However, a further decline towards the lower limit of $0.64 would strengthen the consolidation, making a breakout even more difficult. A drop below this line, on the other hand, would completely invalidate the bullish-neutral thesis, sending the MATIC price to $0.60.

Short squeeze alert: Bitcoin short-sellers could fuel another rally


    Bitcoin (BTC) has recently rallied to the $72,000 resistance of a 3-month price range and suddenly dropped back to $67,000. This volatility created imbalances in the derivatives market, now weighted toward Bitcoin short-sellers, possibly leading to an impending short squeeze.



Notably, since late February, Bitcoin has kept the $12,000 price range from $60,000 to $72,000. In the meantime, two deviations from the range marked a rally to $73,805 for a new all-time high and a sudden crash to $56,537.



On May 21, the leading cryptocurrency precisely reached $72,000 again, and Bitcoin short-sellers jumped in betting in the pattern. As developed, BTC indeed respected the 3-month range and currently lost 6.4% from this level, trading at $67,315.

Short squeeze target over Bitcoin short-sellers positions



However, such activity could make the short-sellers a target, as Bitcoin’s future contracts and leverage trading accumulate liquidations upwards. Should these liquidity pools become a target, BTC could face a short squeeze in the coming days.



Finbold gathered data from CoinGlass on May 24 to gain insights into the current state of the derivatives market.



In particular, over $1.2 billion of liquidations have accumulated in the $72,000 range resistance. Market makers and professional traders could see this as an opportunity to encounter fuel for a possible range breakout.



BTC Liquidation Heatmap, 1 week. Source: CoinGlass



This is because of the threat of a short squeeze, which would liquidate these short-seller’s positions and create artificial demand, pumping Bitcoin’s price above its current all-time high.



On the other hand, cryptocurrency traders constantly reevaluate their positions as the market changes. Therefore, if traders close their short positions, this reported liquidity pool could no longer exist in the following days.



Bitcoin whale activity



As a validation of a possible short squeeze, Ali Martinez reported an increased Bitcoin whale activity with a bullish bias. According to Martinez, these whales bought the dip to $67,000 for 20,000 BTC purchased, worth $1.34 billion.







The positive sentiment could propel Bitcoin short-sellers future liquidation as the spot market could face a supply shock. Nevertheless, investors should remain cautious and avoid overexposure to cryptocurrencies, considering their inherent risks and volatility.

With Ethereum ETFs Approved, Why Is ETH Not Going Up? - Benzinga

Ethereum ETH/USD enthusiasts were left scratching their heads this week after the long-awaited approval of a spot Ethereum ETF failed to ignite the anticipated price surge. What Happened: While many expected a repeat of Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD rise following similar ETF approval in January, ETH prices have remained relatively flat.The SEC’s approval of the 19b-4 forms is a crucial step in the regulatory process but does not fully clear the path for ETF trading. The S-1 registration statements, which provide detailed information about the ETFs to the SEC, must still be approved for trading to commence. This approval is often seen as a formality, but the current political climate has added uncertainty.However, new information suggests the approval process might not be as straightforward as initially believed.Gabriel Shapiro, co-founder of MetaLeX Labs, explains that only the 19b-4 forms were approved, not the S-1 registration statements.This limited approval was made by the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets under “delegated authority,” allowing any commissioner to challenge the decision within ten days. Shapiro suggests this procedural move indicates an attempt to obscure the political nature of the vote.Shapiro hints at a broader political strategy, suggesting the SEC’s actions are part of a “horse trade” to secure environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rules before a potential challenge by Donald Trump if he wins the 2024 election. This complex backdrop contributes to the uncertainty surrounding the approval of the S-1 forms, which Shapiro believes are unlikely to be approved soon. He describes the situation as “political progress” for crypto, similar to the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) Act.Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: All You Need To Know About The FIT21 ‘Crypto Bill’Market ReactionsEric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, offers a counterpoint, expressing confidence that the S-1 forms will eventually be approved and downplaying the likelihood of significant challenges. He attributes the lack of a price spike to the fact that the ETF approval was already anticipated by the market following earlier news. “S-1s will be approved, don't be silly… It prob didn't moon IMO bc approval was baked in already based on Monday's bombshell news,” Balchunas tweeted.Scott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital questions the SEC’s strategy, arguing that using crypto regulations as leverage for ESG rules undermines the commission’s credibility and political strategy, especially if they fail to achieve their ESG objectives. “This is tough to square…they don’t get ESG rules and also lose all credibility that they actually intend to govern reasonably in a Biden second term,” Johnsson stated.Staking and Market DynamicsPranav Kanade, Investment Partner at VanEck‘s Digital Assets Alpha Fund, highlighted another crucial factor: the nature of ETH staking in the approved ETFs. “The ETH ETFs approved on May 23rd do not currently include staking, and all of the ETH held in these ETFs will remain unstaked. However, even if this were to change (via new staked ETH ETFs), the risk of staking concentration would be largely mitigated by three factors,” Kanade explained. He pointed out that regulatory and compliance requirements would likely prevent U.S. ETF issuers from staking with dominant players like Lido. Additionally, emerging staking protocols are already reducing Lido’s market share, and Lido itself is diversifying its node operators, minimizing concentration risks.Looking ForwardThese developments highlight the intricate interplay between regulatory actions and political considerations affecting Ethereum’s market dynamics. Investors remain cautious as they await further clarity on the full approval process.For a deeper dive into the implications of these regulatory shifts and the future of digital assets, industry leaders and investors can join Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. This event will provide valuable insights into the evolving regulatory landscape and investment strategies within the digital asset space.Read Next: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $108M Inflows While Ethereum ETF Potential Remains UncertainImage: Shutterstock

Workday Stock Plunges as Guidance Dampens Investor Sentiment - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ: WDAY), a leader in enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources, recently announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The company reported total revenues of $1.990 billion, a substantial increase of 18.1% compared to the same period last year. Subscription revenues, which comprise a significant portion of the total, rose by 18.8% to $1.815 billion.



Workday Announced Robust Financial Results for Q1 FY 2025



Workday’s operating income for the quarter was $64 million, or 3.2% of revenues, a notable improvement from the operating loss of $20 million, or negative 1.2% of revenues, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP operating income also saw a significant increase, reaching $515 million, or 25.9% of revenues, compared to $396 million, or 23.5% of revenues, in the same period last year. The company’s diluted net income per share was $0.40, a significant improvement from $0.00 in the previous year, while non-GAAP diluted net income per share rose to $1.74 from $1.33.



The company’s financial performance was in line with its expectations across key metrics, despite elevated sales scrutiny and lower customer headcount growth. Workday successfully increased its non-GAAP operating margin through efficiencies across the organization. The company also repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of Class A common stock for $134 million and reported cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $7.18 billion as of April 30, 2024.





However, Subscription Revenue Guidance Impacts Stock Price



Despite the strong financial results, Workday shares fell more than 11% today following the announced softer-than-expected current-quarter and full-year subscription revenue guidance. The company projected current quarter subscription revenue of $1.895 billion, falling short of estimates of $1.903 billion. For the full fiscal year 2025, Workday reduced its subscription revenue guidance to between $7.7 billion and $7.725 billion, down from the prior range of $7.725 billion to $7.775 billion. However, the company did increase its annual adjusted operating margin by half a percentage point to 25%.



Workday’s net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $1.99 billion, slightly ahead of the $1.97 billion consensus, while adjusted profit reached $1.74 per share, surpassing expectations of $1.58 per share. The company’s market cap stood at $69.21 billion as of May 23, 2024, with a 52-week range of $s147.57 – $230.15. The stock’s volume was 5,370,000, with a PE ratio (TTM) of 50.08 and an EPS (TTM) of $5.61.



Following the cautious outlook on subscription revenue guidance, Workday shares dropped by 11.2% to $231.60 at the time of writing. Despite the recent correction of more than 20%, the stock found support around the 200-day moving average, indicating potential resilience in the face of the current investor sentiment.

Coinbase Slugs It Out With U.S. SEC in Effort to Get Key Crypto Question Answered

The request would have to be accepted by the courts, including Judge Katherine Polk Failla, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, who rejected Coinbase's request to dismiss the SEC's original case, which accused the exchange of operating illegally. Resolving this central legal question could help steer a number of other SEC enforcement clashes with the industry.

Hong Kong bans WorldCoin, but for how long?


Sam Altman’s WorldCoin and its controversial iris-scanning orbs are reportedly set to be kicked out of Hong Kong after being found to violate the city’s privacy laws by a data watchdog. But is the impending regulatory action as bad as it seems?
While the ban from Hong Kong is being celebrated by privacy advocates and Sam Altman distrusters, it may not be a permanent problem for WorldCoin. The reasons for being booted from Hong Kong by the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) include:

Relevant privacy notice and biometric data consent forms not being available in Chinese
Insufficient transparency of the personal data policy and practices
The fact that before the collection of personal data, participants weren’t clearly informed of how the data would be used

These issues all seem like they can be solved relatively simply: By translating instructions and terms of service forms into Mandarin and Cantonese, making policy practices more transparent, and informing any participants exactly how their data will be used.
However, the fact that these solutions are so obvious may point to the real problem for WorldCoin.

Read more: Worldcoin fails to shift ban from Spanish court
Never fixed
The fact that WorldCoin wasn’t already providing terms of service and instructions in Mandarin or Cantonese at its locations in Hong Kong suggests a more sinister reason for getting kicked out of Hong Kong, namely that WorldCoin has — possibly — been purposely providing the least amount of information to users and regulators as possible to take advantage of the biometric data that the public is unaware of.
There are plenty of ways that WorldCoin could work with the Hong Kong PCPD to mitigate risks and provide more transparency so it could offer their iris scanning orbs in Hong Kong again, but will it? It remains to be seen.

Ether (ETH) ETF Listing Approval Sees Billions Poured Into Restaking Protocol Ether.Fi

"I think there is question whether staking, particularly liquid staking, turns ETH into a security," Silagadze said. "I think how it is going to start is you will have ETH ETFs that are either contracted out or run their own infrastructure, those nodes will be compliant and censored and all of that stuff, but it'll have a nice baked-in yield. Restaking is much more complex, so I think it'll get there; it'll just be a matter of time."

TSMC is Up 56% YTD, But the Taiwan-based Firm is Still Undervalued - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) continues to occupy a peculiar status in the investing world. On the face of it, the Taiwanese company has the most advanced chip-making foundries in the world. Its cutting-edge N3 node (3 nm) deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) process is poised to chart new efficiency and performance standards.



By 2030, TSMC’s 1 nm process is the major milestone on the roadmap, which will pack over a trillion transistors with 3D-stacked chipsets. Although Samsung and Intel are close behind, Chinese chip makers are not there yet. 



Pushed by government subsidies, Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Huawei are heading to manufacture 5 nm chips in Shanghai, lagging one generation behind. The US export controls are attempting to keep it that way. At the same time, the USG’s subsidies via the CHIPS Act are pushing Intel to take Samsung’s place behind TSMC. 



Concurrently, the US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is openly antagonistic towards China, having noted in March that “we cannot allow China to have access for their military advancement to our most sophisticated technology,”



Later in the 60 Minutes interview, Raimondo admitted that TSMC is the critical cog in the technological suppression of China. 







This dynamic puts TSMC investors in an awkward position. After all, Taiwan is right next to China, opening the gates wide to uncertainty. China can perform its suppression with blockades or military drills, as they have been occurring most recently since Thursday.



And that uncertainty places TSM stock firmly in the undervaluation range. But by how much?



TSMC Price and Earnings



Year-to-date, TSM shares gained 56% in value. Although impressive and widely outperforming the broad S&P 500 (SPX) benchmark, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares gained more than double that at a 116% boost in the same period. At the present price of $158.25 per share, TSM stock is near Thursday’s all-time high of $160.64.



This was when the price began to fall just as Chinese military drills around Taiwan commenced. TSM stock is nearly double its 52-week low point of $84.02 per share. In April, TSMC delivered its earnings for Q1 2024.



Although tracking a quarterly decline of 3.8%, the company reported 12.9% YoY revenue growth to $18.87 billion. The new 3 nm wafer process accounted for 9% of total revenue. The 5 nm process, the cutting edge for China, accounted for 37% of revenue, with the last-gen 7 nm making 19% of the revenue. TSMC reported $7.17 billion net income, an 8.8% YoY improvement. For the second quarter scheduled to be released on July 18th, the company expects further growth at $19.6 – $20.4 billion revenue range.





TSMC Fundamentals Examined



Like Nvidia, TSMC has beat earnings per share estimates for the last four consecutive quarters, showcasing strong fundamentals. However, while Nvidia had an upside surprise of 12.84% in the last quarter, TSMC only had 6.98%. Greater divergence is present in other quarters as well.



Case in point, when Nvidia ended the July 2023 quarter with a 38.89% upside surprise, TSMC ended it with 6.54% for the same period. This placed Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) nearly three times above TSMC, at 87.67 vs. 30.33 P/E respectively, as the measure of how much investors are willing to pay for the company’s stock to every $1 of its annual earnings.



But given that Nvidia, AMD, and Intel are all reliant on TSMC for its mass-scale manufacturing and cutting-edge node processes, this clearly points to investor displacement of focus. In other words, Taiwan’s location remains a suppressive TSM price driver.



However, as TSMC continues to expand beyond the island into Germany, Japan, and the US, the strength of the suppression is likely to weaken.  Under the CHIPS Act alone, TSMC received $11.6 billion in loans and grants to build new foundries in Arizona. 



Is China Just Posturing?



It bears noticing that the two economies are deeply intertwined despite tense US-China relations. Although Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for a “wall of opposition” to China’s exports, China held $797.7 billion in US Treasuries, or ~10% of the US national debt, in January.



This puts China in a financially subservient position amid threats from US officials. After all, China relies on Treasuries to maintain low export prices. A trade surplus with the US would allow more USD to flow into China, which would appreciate the Chinese yuan and make Chinese exports more expensive.



China has to rely on US Treasuries to hold USD inflows without appreciating the yuan. Otherwise, China’s export-oriented economy would lose global standing due to more pricey exports. Nonetheless, this dynamic doesn’t prevent China from posturing, which has a negative effect on investors.







What Is TSM Stock Price Forecasting?



Based on forecasting data aggregated by Nasdaq, TSM still remains in the “strong buy” zone. Against the present price of $158.25 per share, the average TSM price target is $164.11. The high estimate is $188 while the low forecast is $150 per share.



Similarly, WSJ’s average price target is $162.64 per share. The high target is $182, while the low estimate is $130 per share. 



Do you think China is likely to take over its neighboring island with military force or gradually with politics?

Samson Mow Reveals Last Chance to Sell ETH, Coinbase Adds Perpetual Futures for Shiba Inu, Solana Predicted to Be Next Crypto ETF: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Take a look at what happened in the world of crypto by reading U.Today’s top three news stories."$1 million Bitcoin" advocate Samson Mow reveals last chance to sell ETHUpon the approaching deadline for the SEC's decision on spot Ethereum ETF approval, Samson Mow, CEO at Jan3 and prominent Bitcoin maximalist, took to X to pour cold water on Ethereum-based ETFs. In Mow's opinion, the potential approval of Ethereum funds by the regulatory agency is not bullish, as they will  "massively underperform" Bitcoin-based ETFs. To prove himself right, Mow advised comparing demand for both BTC and ETH on other markets, while also taking into account the fact that Ethereum will not give staking rewards. "This is the last chance to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC," wrote the CEO at the conclusion of his X post. Meanwhile, earlier this week, VC investor Anthony Pompliano called the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC “the last dam to be broken” before the U.S. approves the entire crypto industry.Perpetual futures for Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other meme coins added by CoinbaseAccording to the official X announcement from May 23, Coinbase International Exchange will add support for Shiba Inu perpetual futures on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced. Apart from SHIB, two more meme coins, BONK and FLOKI, will also get their perpetual futures listed, to the great delight of the assets' communities. As stated in the announcement, the opening of 1000BONK-PERP, 1000FLOKI-PERP and 1000SHIB-PERP markets is expected to begin on or after 9:30 a.m. UTC May 30, 2024. Other perpetual futures offered by the exchange include such assets as Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Pepe (PEPE) and so on. As a reminder, Coinbase's offshore derivatives exchange opened last May. In September, Coinbase got regulatory approval to offer its futures to users outside the U.S.Brian Kelly predicts Solana could be next crypto ETFDuring his recent appearance on CNBC, Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, shared his opinion regarding the approval of Ethereum ETFs. Even though Kelly does not know when exactly the Ethereum ETF is going to be greenlit by the SEC, he is certain that it will happen at some point in time. When asked about what crypto could be the next to get its ETF, Kelly replied, "You've got to think about Solana as probably the next one. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are probably the big three for this cycle." However, the Solana ETF approval process could be complicated by SOL token's legal status in the U.S; as a reminder, last year, the SEC named SOL a security in its lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. The Solana Foundation strongly rejected this claim, stating that the blockchain is decentralized. Additionally, Solana does not have its futures-based ETF in the U.S.

DOGE, SHIB Price Spike After Elon Musk Tweet's About Mascot Dog Kabosu's Passing

DOGE surged as much as 5% to a session high of 17.3 cents within minutes after the post, while SHIB jumped nearly 3% during the same period. However, the advances proved to be short-lived as both cryptos pared gains. Still, DOGE was up 6% and SHIB gained 1% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the mostly flat broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index.

Solana, XRP ETFs Next After Ethereum, Bitcoin Approvals: Standard Chartered - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsMore crypto ETFs are coming. That’s according to British multinational bank Standard Chartered, whose digital assets researcher said in a Friday note that Solana and XRP will soon get their own exchange-traded funds. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs. The unexpected and historic move means that traditional investors can now buy shares which track the price of the second-biggest digital asset. The move follows approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January.Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of crypto research and emerging market foreign currencies, said that it is now only a matter of time before other major digital coins receive the ETF wrapper status. “For other coins (eg. SOL, XRP) markets will look ahead to their eventual ETF status as well, albeit this is likely a 2025 story not a 2024 one,” he wrote. “Other ETH-like coins (a number of which the SEC claimed were securities in the 2023 XRP case) are also not securities,” Kendrick continued. “In several cases the core technology is so similar to ETH it would be difficult for the SEC to claim they were securities given the ETH position.”Industry observers and analysts were pessimistic about the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs this week, because the SEC had barely engaged with from asset managers hoping to drop the funds. Then, the fund managers seeking to launch the products started frantically filing amended paperwork to move the process along, amid speculation of a politically fueled change in philosophy. By Thursday afternoon, the SEC had given them the green light.The approval of the Ethereum ETFs is surprising because the regulator had cracked down—and harshly, according to some lawmakers—on the crypto industry. One high-profile lawsuit against the Wall Street watchdog even alleged that the SEC wanted to designate Ethereum as a security, and not a commodity. In 2023, Ripple, a fintech company whose founders launched XRP, scored a partial court win against the SEC when a judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors did not qualify as securities, which the SEC had alleged. Though the judge did rule that $728 million worth of contracts for institutional sales did constitute unregistered securities sales, the industry interpreted the news as positive. Under SEC chair Gary Gensler, the regulator has claimed a number of coins and tokens are securities, and are therefore breaking the law by offering sales to investors. Kendrick added in his note that by the end of the year, Ethereum should reach $8,000 per coin. The bank’s researcher previously said that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 per coin by the end of 2024. He added today that price was still realistic with the continued success of the ETFs.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Shiba Inu Partner Unveils New Frontier In Token Trading


								D3 Global, a well-known DNS domain provider and Shiba Inu’s partner, has officially launched the beta version of its D3 Marketplace. This platform introduces a novel way of trading SHIB Name Tokens.
The D3 Marketplace now allows users to buy, sell, or make offers on Name Tokens, focusing initially on Shiba Inu-themed top-level domain (TLD) names. Current supported TLDs include .shib and .core, with early glimpses suggesting a streamlined transaction process directly integrated into the Web3 ecosystem.
“D3 Marketplace Beta is Live! D3gens, the D3 Marketplace has officially launched in beta, and you can now buy, sell and make offers on Name Tokens,” announced D3 via a post on X, highlighting the immediate availability of the platform for users eager to partake in this new trading experience.
What The Shiba Inu Army Can Expect
A detailed examination of the marketplace shows it features a user-friendly search box, allowing potential buyers to check the availability of specific TLD names. Once a name is selected, it can be acquired for approximately $10 for an annual subscription, with payment options including both cryptocurrencies and traditional credit cards.

A standout feature of the marketplace is its support for payments using Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens—SHIB and BONE. This capability is enabled through Shibarium, a layer that facilitates transactions without the need for bridging these tokens to the Ethereum network, thereby simplifying the payment process.
This initiative began back in December 2023 when Shiba Inu pioneered the integration of a TLD within the global cryptocurrency market. Following this trailblazing step, other major crypto projects like Gate.io, Casper Network, Core Network, and Viction joined hands with D3 to establish their respective TLDs.
“The Shib Name can be used as a username on web3 cross-platforms, multi-chain wallet address, and infrastructure identifier, among others,” the company elaborated on the utility of the Shib Name Tokens. These tokens are designed to function as universal identifiers across the decentralized web, simplifying user interactions across various blockchain applications.

Furthermore, the Shib Name Tokens have already demonstrated strong market interest. On the first day of sales in March, thousands of names were purchased, including highly sought-after ones like ‘my*shib,’ which fetched $2,000. D3 has set the standard registration price at $10 per year, with premium features available at higher tiers.
D3 anticipates that the beta phase of the marketplace will continue for several months. This period will allow the team to identify and rectify any technical issues before proceeding to the mainnet launch, though an official launch date remains undisclosed at this time.
At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002423.

Are Ethereum ETFs A 'Sell The News Event?' Chart Analyst Highlights ETH's Key Resistance - Benzinga

Technical chart analyst Ali Martinez examined whether the Ethereum ETH/USD ETF approval was a "sell the news" event and explores potential price paths based on recent market activities and technical indicators.What Happened: Martinez notes significant transfers of ETH to cryptocurrency exchanges after the Ethereum ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, he raises concerns about possible profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing or market speculation. Notably, Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilke transferred 10,000 ETH (worth $37.38 million) to cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.Supporting this observation, Martinez points out that over the past two weeks, more than 242,000 ETH has been moved to exchange wallets, indicating a potential for increased trading activity and price volatility.This coincides with high expectations within the industry following the ETF approval. "Although industry leaders see the Ethereum ETF approval as an approval of the entire industry… traders must be cautious," he advises, quoting industry leaders such as Anthony Pompliano.Also Read: Spot Ethereum ETF Makes BlackRock ‘Very Eager To Push’ This Trending Coin’s Narrative, Trader ClaimsWhy It Matters: The influx of Ethereum to exchanges suggests a heightened likelihood of a sell-off or increased profit-taking activity. Martinez employs the TD Sequential indicator, which reveals a sell signal on Ethereum's daily chart."The current green nine candlestick on the daily chart suggests that a spike in selling pressure could see ETH retrace," he points out, implying potential short-term downside risk.In his tweet thread, he also highlights the key area of support.He adds that Ethereum’s most important resistance barrier is between $3,940 and $4,054 where more than 1.16 million addresses had previously purchased around 574,660 ETH. He suggests, "If ETH overcomes this hurdle and prints a daily candlestick close above $4,170, the bearish outlook will be invalidated. This could result in a new upward countdown phase toward $5,000."What’s Next: The influence of Ethereum as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: An Ethereum ETF Could Return ‘Animal Spirits’ To Crypto Reminiscent Of The 10x DOGE, SHIB Runs In 2021, Predicts TraderImage: Shutterstock

Coinbase v. SEC: Latest Developments Unveiled

In its ongoing lawsuit with the SEC, Coinbase has filed a reply in support of its motion to certify an interlocutory appeal with the 2nd Circuit Court. Paul Grewal, Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer, highlighted this new development on X (formerly Twitter). According to Grewal, the company's position remains steadfast: advocating for regulatory clarity for the crypto industry and the 52 million Americans who own digital assets, while challenging the SEC’s perceived overreach beyond its congressional mandate. The crux of Coinbase’s appeal centers on whether the SEC can regulate digital asset transactions as "investment contracts" without any contractual elements involved. This issue is not unique to Coinbase; the SEC itself acknowledged the question's "industry-wide significance" and the substantial differences in opinion, when requesting similar relief in the Ripple case.From the outset, Coinbase has attempted to engage the SEC in a constructive dialogue to establish a balanced regulatory framework for crypto innovation within the U.S. However, these efforts have been met with resistance, inconsistent positions and litigation, Grewal noted in a thread of tweets. In its recent filing, Coinbase emphasizes the urgency of addressing this critical legal question through an interlocutory appeal, highlighting its importance for the future of the crypto industry. Earlier this week, the House recognized the necessity for clear regulatory rules, reinforcing Coinbase's call for clarity as well.Regardless of the timeline, Grewal stated that Coinbase was determined to pursue this matter to its conclusion, aiming to secure regulatory clarity and push back against "overzealous regulators." The company asserts that such efforts are essential for the benefit of the 52 million Americans involved in crypto.As the legal battle continues, the outcome of this current phase in the lawsuit could have profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry.

Blockchain Brawl: Algorand Claims Only They 'Deliver' For Everyday Use


								Algorand, the layer-1 blockchain network, has launched a bold and unapologetic advertising campaign taking direct aim at industry heavyweights like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.
The ad, titled “When Blockchains Meet the Real World, Only One Delivers,” paints a scathing picture of the shortcomings of these established players, portraying them as sluggish, expensive, and unreliable for everyday transactions.

Through a satirical supermarket checkout scenario, the ad dramatically showcases the frustrations consumers might face when trying to use these blockchains. From the 27-minute wait for Bitcoin transaction confirmation to the eye-watering $112 “peak hour” fees on Ethereum, and the string of failed transactions on Solana, the message is clear: Algorand is the superior choice for real-world usability.


Algorand’s Brash Tactics Raise Eyebrows
While the ad has undoubtedly garnered significant attention, with over 740,000 views, the response has been far from universally positive. Some have applauded Algorand’s audacious marketing strategy, but others have raised concerns about its tactics and the accuracy of its claims.
One particularly puzzling aspect is the timing of the ad campaign, which comes just months after Algorand shut down its AlgoExplorer, a crucial blockchain search tool, citing a lack of funding.
This inconsistency has led some to question the company’s spending priorities and whether the significant investment in the ad was the best use of resources.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.4 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Furthermore, cryptocurrency experts have voiced doubts about the ad’s portrayal of Algorand as the undisputed champion of speed and affordability. Analysts like MartyParty have highlighted the need for a closer examination of the claims made in the ad, raising concerns about their validity.
Scaramucci’s Shifting Loyalties Add To The Controversy
Adding fuel to the fire of criticism is the involvement of Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent Algorand backer, in the ad campaign. Just a day before the ad dropped, Scaramucci expressed his anticipation for a Solana ETF, a move that left some questioning his commitment to Algorand and the overall sincerity of the ad.


This apparent shift in loyalty has sparked broader concerns about the credibility of the ad’s message and the motivations behind it. As a respected figure in the crypto community, Scaramucci’s actions have the potential to significantly impact public perception and trust in Algorand’s marketing efforts.
A High-Risk, High-Reward Strategy For Algorand
Algorand’s bold advertising gambit has undoubtedly generated a significant buzz within the crypto community. Whether it will translate into tangible benefits, such as increased adoption and a price boost for the ALGO token, remains to be seen.


The mixed reaction to the campaign highlights the ongoing debate around the role of marketing in the cryptocurrency space. While some see humor and aggression as effective tools to stand out in a crowded market, others believe such tactics can hinder broader industry growth and undermine trust.

As the dust settles, Algorand’s future success will depend on its ability to back up its claims with real-world performance and continued innovation. The crypto community will be watching closely to see if this high-risk, high-reward strategy pays off or simply becomes a case of clever marketing gone awry.

Pepe Price Prediction as PEPE Dips From Recent High - Next Leg Up Starting Soon?

                        The Pepe price has fallen by 4.5% in the past 24 hours, sinking to $0.00001365 after reaching a new all-time high of $0.00001526 yesterday.Given its recent performance, the meme coin remains up by a very healthy 37% in a week and by 74% in a month, making it the best-performing top-100 token over these timeframes.PEPE has also gained by a massive 820% in a month, indicating some very strong long-term momentum that should kick in again once today’s dip has played out.And with the wider market likely to become increasingly bullish amid the approval of ETH ETFs yesterday, the Pepe price could reach a new ATH very soon.Pepe Price Prediction as PEPE Dips From Recent High – Next Leg Up Starting Soon?
After pushing hard at the beginning of the week, it does seem that PEPE is currently running out of momentum, with its indicators pointing to an ongoing correction.Its relative strength index (purple) has fallen from 70 earlier this morning to nearly 40 as of writing, and it could continue to decline over the next day or so.Source: TradingViewPerhaps more worryingly, the coin’s 30-day average (orange) has begun dropping downwards after spending several days rising aggressively beyond the 200-day (blue), which it may now be on course to fall below.It’s certainly possible that, after reaching several new record highs over the past few days, PEPE could suffer a sustained correction lasting a week or so.Having said that, its volumes remain close to record highs at around $2.4 billion, with some whales still accumulating the token in the past 24 hours.It’s therefore entirely possible that, with demand and interest still pretty high, the PEPE price will recover soon and potentially break its record high yet again.What’s particularly bullish for the meme token and the market as a whole is that yesterday saw the SEC approve eight Ethereum ETFs.Such ETFs are likely to launch next month, at which point they’ll bring new demand and volume to Ethereum and, by extension, the wider market.This will help to increase bullishness across the board, including for PEPE, which is not only an Ethereum-based token, but has remained a vehicle of choice for whales for well over a year now.As such, we could see the Pepe price rise to $0.0000150 in the next few weeks, before reaching $0.000020 by Q4.Diversification into New Altcoins for Big Returns
There’s a risk that, because it has already hit new highs several times this week, PEPE may correct and then not do much over the next few weeks.Fortunately, there’s a range of new meme coins entering the market right now, with several holding their presales and generating considerable momentum.One of these is WienerAI (WAI), a new Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has raised more than $2.7 million in its hugely popular sale.WienerAI may have a cutesy sausage dog as its meme, yet it has been attracting attention because it will launch an eponymous AI-based trading bot.As such a both, WienerAI will answer queries from traders, recommending high-potential coins before they rally big and therefore helping investors to stay ahead of the market.Helping in this respect will be its atomic swap feature, which means that traders who receive recommendations for a particular coin from WienerAI can use the app to quickly buy it.Another strong feature is its MEV protection, which helps users to complete trades ahead of front-running bots.Taken together, this gives WAI lots of utility as a native token, with demand for the coin likely to increase in parallel with the growth of WienerAI as an app.It will have a max supply 69 billion tokens, potentially making it deflationary over time.Holders will also be able to stake token, earning themselves a passive income while they wait for WAI to make gains.VIDEOInterested investors can join the coin’s sale by going to the official WienerAI website, where 1 WAI currently costs $0.00071.The sale will end in the next few weeks, at which point WAI may surge when it lists on exchanges.Buy WAI Today

Crypto Markets Drop Following Ethereum ETF Approvals - The Defiant

Traders ‘sell the news’ after the SEC approves eight exchange-traded funds backed by spot Ether.Crypto markets traded lower after the SEC approved eight exchange-traded funds backed by spot Ether on Thursday.The much-anticipated approval, initially expected to boost the market further, turned into a "sell-the-news" event, leading to an overall market drop.ETH dropped by 4% following the approval after rallying 20% over the past week. The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, also continued its downward trend, dropping 6%, while Solana was down 5%.ETH PriceBenjamin Cowen, CEO of ITC Crypto, finds it comical that people are upset about ETH's lack of movement. “ETH is up more this week than the S&P 500 typically gives you in a year."According to crypto analyst Zach Rynes, the lack of upside momentum means that "everyone who wanted to buy the approval already did."The exchanges involved — NYSE Arca, Nasdaq, and Cboe BZX — applied for rule changes to list and trade Ether ETFs. They received approval to trade multiple Ethereum-based ETFs, including Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust, the VanEck Ethereum Trust, the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Franklin Templeton's Franklin Ethereum ETF.Data from CoinGlass shows that 104,585 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours for a total of $380 million. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance in the ETH-USDC pair, valued at $12.41 million. Over $105 million in long positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours.Long liquidations occur when traders betting on price increases are forced to close their positions due to falling prices, leading to automatic sell-offs.Meme coins are mixed today, with Dogecoin and PEPE rallying 3%, while Shiba Inu, FLOKI, and Dogwifhat dropped between 1% and 3%.DOGE PriceThe DOGE price action comes as Kabosu, the dog that inspired the Dogecoin meme in 2013, has passed away. Her owner, Atsuko Sato, a 62-year-old kindergarten teacher from Sakura in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, confirmed the news in a blog post on Friday.U.S. stock markets posted gains ahead of the Memorial Day long weekend. The Dow added 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose by 0.6% and 1%, respectively.

An Investor Made $42 Million with Only 3 Altcoins! Here are his actions! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While investors who have earned millions of dollars with their investments in the cryptocurrency market have been frequently talked about lately, a new one has been added to these.
According to data from Lookonchain, one investor earned $42 million with just PEPE and two altcoins.


Accordingly, this investor increased his portfolio from 23 million dollars to 65 million dollars in one year and made a profit of 42 million dollars. More importantly, the smart investor used only three cryptocurrencies namely PEPE, ONDO and BEAM to grow his portfolio.
This investor spent 2,434 ETH ($5 million) to purchase 3.97T PEPE between November 2023 and February 2024. This investor, who sells every time the PEPE price rises, still has a significant amount of PEPE.





The investor also purchased 7.55 million ONDO ($1.9 million) from January 28 to February 6 at an average price of $0.26. He then sold 2.56 million ONDO (valued at $2 million) on March 14, April 1, and April 2 at an average price of $0.79, leaving him with 4.99 million ONDO (valued at $5.73 million). Profit was $5.8 million and return on investment was 288%.
Again, this investor purchased 139.47 million BEAM (valued at $2.59 million) on January 4 and January 5 at an average price of $0.019. It then sold 139.47 million BEAMs ($4.44 million worth) from February 16 to February 27 at an average price of $0.032. Its profit is $1.85 million and its return on investment is 72%.



“What a clever trader!

Sell-off alert: Ripple-related account moves over 50 million XRP to exchanges


    A Ripple-related account has recently transferred over 50 million XRP to cryptocurrency exchanges, indicating a significant sell-off. 



On May 1, Ripple released 1 billion XRP from its initial distribution, with the tokens locked in monthly escrows until 2027. The company sent 200 million XRP to its treasury account and locked the remaining 800 million in new escrows.



After receiving the 150 million XRP this month, Ripple’s destination account rP4X2…sKxv3 distributed some tokens to different unlabeled accounts.







A Ripple-related address, identified as r4wf..Rzn, has dumped 56.01 million XRP on exchanges in the last 24 hours, intensifying bearish sentiments.

The transactions included nearly 30 million XRP to Bitso and 26 million XRP to Bitstamp. This added selling pressure has contributed to the current price decline of XRP. 



On-chain data, highlighted by Whale Alert, suggests concerns about the performance of XRP, which is the 7th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.



The first transaction, which occurred on May 23, moved a staggering 30 million XRP tokens to the Bitstamp crypto exchange, valued at $15.4 million at the time. 



Shortly after, the second transaction transferred exactly 25 million XRP tokens to the Mexico-based exchange Bitso, worth $11.4 million at the time. The specific exchanges involved add to speculations about the reasons behind the action.



The Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp has received significant amounts of XRP over recent months. Bitso Exchange has also seen large inflows of XRP following its partnership with Ripple.



This distribution pattern suggests that these accounts are likely to continue transferring Ripple’s XRP to several centralized exchanges for sell-off. 



Such actions could increase supply pressure on the spot market, potentially impacting XRP’s price.



XRP price analysis



Ripple’s sell-offs can significantly impact the token’s price by introducing more tokens into circulation, causing supply inflation. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has seen both gains and losses, but as of press time, it was trading at $0.5358, up 0.14% over the past day.

Despite this, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51, indicating a neutral market stance where either bulls or bears could potentially take control.



Ripple’s monthly token distribution and subsequent sales are closely watched by the cryptocurrency community, as these actions can significantly influence XRP’s market dynamics

SEC Approval Of Ethereum ETFs Is Evidence Of A 'Profound Shift' In Crypto Adoption: Report - Benzinga

The SEC’s approval of eight spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs on Thursday marks a significant regulatory shift, reflecting the heightened politicization of digital assets ahead of a tightly contested presidential race, according to a report.What Happened: The report, by H.C. Wainwright & Co., this policy turnaround signifies an unprecedented embrace of blockchain technology, contrasting sharply with last year’s stringent regulatory environment.This approval, part of a broader legislative push, aligns with the passage of H.R. 4763, the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) Act. Introduced by Representatives Patrick McHenry and Glenn Thompson, the FIT Act establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Garnering bipartisan support, the bill aims to protect consumers, streamline registration for intermediaries, and spur technological advancements through innovation hubs within the CFTC and SEC.Kevin Dede, CFA at H.C. Wainwright, notes, “The SEC’s approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs, perhaps unthinkable just two weeks ago, is further evidence of the profound shift in appreciating blockchain and digital asset efficiency, easing adoption in the U.S. financial system.”Also Read: With Ethereum ETFs Approved, Why Is ETH Not Going Up?Despite fierce opposition from notable figures like Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Administration has signaled a willingness to collaborate with Congress on crypto regulation. This collaboration marks a potential end to the anti-crypto stance that has previously stymied legislative efforts. The dissolution of this resistance paves the way for a more favorable regulatory environment for blockchain businesses.What’s Next: These developments underscore the critical role of digital assets as a political lever in the U.S. As the market navigates these regulatory shifts, industry leaders and investors can gain deeper insights at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on November 19.This event will explore the evolving regulatory landscape, investment strategies, and the future of digital assets, providing a comprehensive overview of this dynamic sector.Read Next: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $108M Inflows While Ethereum ETF Potential Remains UncertainImage: Shutterstock

This Altcoin Soared 57 Percent Today! Here's Why! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Business Insider, a multinational financial and business news website based in New York City, listed “14 Music-Tech Companies to Watch” in a recent report.
Among these 14 companies was Audius (AUDIO), a decentralized music streaming protocol.


While this news caused a big jump in the AUDIO price, the AUDIO price increased by 57% in the last 24 hours.






Commenting on Business Insider's news, Audius co-founder Forrest Browning said:

“ Think of us as a more modern form of SoundCloud with a lot of paid fan engagement layered on top.
Currently, Audius runs on a decentralized blockchain powered by Solana and Ethereum.
Additionally, Audius currently has between 5 and 6 million monthly active users. The platform's most popular genres are electronic and hip-hop.
Currently, artists do not have a venue or outlet to foster deeper relationships and deeper collaborations. Audius wants to fill this gap by giving superfans a new way to engage with their favorite artists.”

Ethereum Will Turn ‘Really Freaking Bullish’ if This Happens, Predicts Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader believes Ethereum (ETH) could go on a massive bull run if one scenario plays out in the near term.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto tells his 394,900 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum could go parabolic if it holds a key support level on the hourly chart while, at the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) dips to a lower $60,000 range.










“ETH still holding this flipped resistance [in the $3,300 range] which is acting as support so doesn’t look that bad at the moment. Again with my primary scenario being a breakdown on BTC to $62,000-$63,000 now I think we probably end up falling back below ultimately but for now it looks decent… 
If by the time we get to $62,000-$63,000 on BTC and ETH is still holding this region [above $3,360], that would probably be really freaking bullish.”
Source: Credible Crypto/X
Ethereum is trading for $3,721 at time of writing, down more than 2% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $68,253 at time of writing, flat on the day.
Next up, the analyst warns Solana (SOL) may break down against Bitcoin (SOL/BTC) if the crypto king dips to as low as $62,000 and then continues upward. He says Solana could face a big corrective move as he believes market participants would rotate their capital to ride the next burst to the upside for Bitcoin.
“The scenario below is how I’m viewing things with respect to BTC and SOL at the moment. This all gets triggered/comes into play on a BTC breakdown into $62,000-$63,000. Note, it is only possible to be bearish SOL and bullish BTC simultaneously because of confluence with the SOL/BTC chart looking like a distribution top… When looking at SOL in context of this [SOL/BTC] chart, it makes sense.”
Source: Credible Crypto/X
SOL/BTC is trading for 0.00245 BTC ($167) at time of writing, down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours.

JUST IN: Coinbase Announces Adding a New Altcoin to Its Listing Roadmap - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced that it has added Core (CORECHAIN) to its listing roadmap.
Core, a layer-1 blockchain network, will be supported on its native network on Coinbase.


Core describes itself as a blockchain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and can run Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized applications.
The Core network is powered by the “Satoshi Plus” consensus mechanism, which secures the network through a combination of authorized Bitcoin mining hash and authorized Proof-of-Stake (DPoS).





The mainnet of the altcoin was launched in January 2023. Core, the 65th largest cryptocurrency in the world, is not listed on Binance as of the time of this writing. It is traded on other major exchanges, Bybit and OKX.
Although Coinbase's addition of Core to its listing roadmap does not guarantee a listing, so far there has been no altcoin on this list that has not been listed yet.

Understanding the ETH ETF Approvals | Bankless


Just last week, you would have been hard-pressed to find anyone bullish on the probability of spot ETH ETF approval, but on Monday, rumors began circulating that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had begun meaningfully communicating with proposed ETF issuers.Previously, a communication deficit between these groups had been taken as proof of imminent denial, but this new development caused Bloomberg’s ETF analysts to increase their odds of spot ETH ETF approval threefold to 75% and sent traders scrambling to long ETH!While it was projected that the SEC would release a decision on the issue around the close of US stock markets at around 4 PM EST, Ether dumped 8% when this deadline arrived devoid of news, pushing ETH HODLers underwater on the daily for over an hour before the pump finally arrived… At 5:02 PM EST, it finally arrived: news wires reported that all proposed spot ETH ETFs had received approval, resulting in an immediate (but relatively modest) 4% rally in the price of Ether!Despite hopes that spot ETH ETF approval would be a massively bullish catalyst, it appears that traders anticipating denial had already repositioned earlier in the week as markets began coming to consensus on approval, dampening the volatility surrounding the actual approval event.Furthermore, the approval notice only concerned 19b-4 rule change filings from exchanges, only one of the two required documents for to the commencement of trading, and concerningly, the 19b-4 approvals were made on “delegated authority” (i.e. staff approved) by the SEC’s Trading and Markets Division, potentially due to Commissioner Crenshaw’s absence on maternity leave.Delegated decisions can be challenged by a commissioner within 10 days, leaving some room for concern that this decision could eventually be walked back.Thankfully, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas dismissed all concerns about the seemingly flimsy nature of approval, claiming that it is inevitable the S-1s will be approved and noting that many 19b-4s are approved via delegated decisions.Without the SEC’s approval of S-1 registration filings from issuers, given that there is still a non-remote possibility for the SEC to revoke 19b-4 approvals, and considering the timeline for spot ETH ETFs to begin trading remains unclear, it may be somewhat of stretch to claim these instruments have been outright approved.Nevertheless, it is overwhelmingly obvious that the regulatory progress is occurring, and moving in the right direction.Through the approval of spot ETH ETFs, the SEC yet again confirms the non-security status of Ether, just as it did with the approval of commodity futures-based ETH ETFs last October!Ethereum originated from an initial coin offering in 2014 that if conducted today in a similar fashion would be categorized an illegal security offering; the ability for ETH to achieve non-security status in spite of a security sale demonstrates that it is possible for a crypto network to sufficiently decentralize overtime and escape the purview of the SEC, giving all crypto a pathway to spot ETFs and listings on traditional exchanges.Although many crypto market participants have already begun speculating on which asset is next in line for ETF approval, it is unlikely that any new listings will occur in the near future, as it appears the yearslong existence of regulated commodity futures on a digital asset is the prerequisite for spot ETF approval.Key to the SEC’s approval of the 19b-4s was the fact that there are many years worth of data to support a high degree of correlation between the spot and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures markets prices for ETH.This strong mathematically proven correlation enables the presence of comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between spot ETH ETF listing exchanges and the CME to satisfy the SEC’s requirements that crypto ETF have mechanisms to detect fraudulent and manipulative trades.No crypto assets besides BTC or ETH currently trades on regulated futures exchanges, and although Coinbase had previously filed for DOGE, LTC, and BCH futures in March, these contracts are not currently trading, despite Coinbase’s intended April 1 launch date.The exact qualities a digital asset must possess for CME futures listings are unknown, but the Commodity Exchange Act provides clarity that it must meet the definition of a “commodity.” Although Bitcoin and Ether are the only two digital assets that have been designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as commodities at this time, ETH’s ability to progress from something with security-like properties into a commodity through decentralization opens the possibility for for any token to go through a similar transition!via CFTCCrypto has been little more than a fleeting afterthought for many policymakers throughout the past decade, but Congress produced multiple major legislative bills centered around the industry in recent weeks, one of which aims to provide clarity on how the labels of “commodity” and “security” should be applied to digital assets, and thus whether they fall under the respective jurisdictions of the CFTC or SEC.The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century ACT (FIT21), is on its way to the Senate after receiving bipartisan support in the House this week and no threat of veto from President Biden, potentially clearing its way for implementation into law.It gives the CFTC wide sweeping regulatory purview over “decentralized digital assets,” or tokens which no one single group controls greater than a 20% economic or voting stake that exist on blockchains where no single person has unilateral control over the network (i.e.; any distributed computing network).While FIT21 provides clarity as to the types of digital assets we can expect to receive spot ETFs in the future, it concerningly “provides the CFTC with exclusive regulatory authority over cash or spot markets for digital commodities,” an unprecedented level of control for a regulator who typically only has authority over exchanges utilizing leverage in the absence of fraud and manipulation…

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $10 billion market cap in the first half of 2024


    As the first half of 2024 draws to a close, the crypto space appears poised on the brink of a massive bull cycle. 



This ongoing bullish sentiment is particularly beneficial for several cryptocurrencies approaching significant market cap milestones, including the notable $10 billion mark.



Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies likely to surpass this threshold. These predictions hinge not only on the continuation of the bull run but also on the potential benefits of high supply inflation, which could lead to an increased market cap even if price movements remain minimal.







NEAR Protocol (NEAR)



NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is poised for significant growth, driven by its role as a leading blockchain for mainstream applications, processing millions of transactions daily. 



With a current price of $7.81 and a market cap of $8.42 billion, NEAR’s focus on democratizing AI ownership and enhancing scalability, including sharding, strengthens its market position. 



Recent months have seen NEAR’s trading activity soar, with increased demand in the open interest market signaling potential price rises.

Despite market downturns, NEAR has shown resilience, up 13% over the last month and 113% year-to-date, aligning with broader AI token trends. 



Technical indicators are bullish, with NEAR trading well above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently fluctuating between $6.71 and $8.68. 



The next resistance level is at $9.59, and breaking this could target $11.56.



NEAR’s developer-friendly, scalable environment for decentralized applications, combined with its focus on AI and big data, makes it a strong candidate for growth.



Polygon (MATIC)



Polygon (MATIC) is making waves with its user-friendly Ethereum (ETH) scaling solutions. However, the short-term outlook for Polygon’s price appears bleak, with most indicators suggesting consolidation. 



Currently priced at $0.7174 with a market cap of $7.10 billion, Polygon has seen a modest 3% increase over the past week.



Polygon price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap



Trading near a resistance level of $0.72 and maintaining support at $0.60, breaking this resistance could push Polygon towards $0.84. 



Its sought-after Layer 2 scaling solution and rising institutional interest are key growth drivers. Despite a market downturn after a strong first quarter, Polygon is poised for recovery, aiming to reclaim the $1 mark soon.



To reach a $10 billion market cap, Polygon must sustain its growth, driven by technological advancements and strategic partnerships. Its robust foundation and market appeal position it well for this target.



The first half of 2024 is set to be a crucial period for NEAR Protocol and Polygon as they edge closer to the $10 billion market cap milestone.



It’s worth noting that despite being supported by several fundamentals, the possibility of the highlighted cryptocurrencies reaching the $10 billion mark will largely depend on whether the market maintains a bullish momentum.

Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin May Sell This Altcoin! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin today unlocked and received 845,205 STRK worth $1.07 million from Ethereum L2 network Starknet's Locked Token Grant contract.
Vitalik Buterin, one of StarkNet's first individual investors, withdrew the STRK tokens reserved and locked for him into his wallet.


According to Arkhan Intelligence data, Vitalik Buterin currently has 845,205 STRK tokens in his wallet.
While Buterin has not yet made any transactions with STRK tokens worth approximately $1 million, it is not yet known what he will do.





However, while Buterin unlocking STRK tokens and withdrawing them to his wallet increases the possibility of a sale, analysts do not expect the $1 million sale to have a serious impact on the price, given STRK's daily volume and market value.
Apart from Ethereum (ETH) and STRK, Buterin's wallet contains various altcoins such as WETH, KNC, SDOG, DEGEN.



STRK, which rose to $7 after being listed on Binance in February, but then dropped to $1, continues to be traded at $1.21 at the time of writing.

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) Will Explode 16,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Fuks Biden presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Fuks Biden has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe Fuks Biden could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Pepe Fuks Biden can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Fuks Biden on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Fuks Biden by entering its contract address – 4D3CzRs6n4hPrHJsqon5oDVKRe8nhaiBL1mQGowzhPvg – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEFBID.

We read the 230-page investigation into FTX so you don’t have to


The examiner appointed in the FTX bankruptcy has released its report, highlighting a variety of bad behavior from the firm and its executives leading up to its collapse. The report contains allegations about how FTX paid off whistleblowers, dealt with ‘capital issues’ at its bank, and when various executives knew about the insolvency of FTX group entities.
Who knew?
The report contains allegations about which executives and firms were aware of the ‘hole’ in FTX Group’s books before the collapse. It alleges that Ryan Salame ‘assisted with the creation of the backdated payment agent agreement; made or directed other FTX Group employees to make misrepresentations to banks about the purpose of FTX Group bank accounts; misappropriated FTX Group assets to buy real estate, restaurants, and food service companies, and to make other purchases and investments, including a private jet; and withdrew millions of dollars from his FTX.com account shortly before FTX.com halted customer withdrawals.’
The debtors also identified millions of dollars of FTX Group-funded political contributions made by Salame.
Furthermore, seaman Samuel Trabucco received significant benefits shortly before bankruptcy, as ‘the FTX Group spent over $15 million for real estate, a yacht, and a marina slip for Trabucco during the preference period and found that Trabucco made substantial withdrawals from the FTX.com exchange in September 2022.’
In other communications, he was concerned about Alameda’s balance sheet, as he warned of an ‘exodus’ if employees were to understand Alameda’s net asset value without FTT.
Other executives were also investigated for this report, including ‘a former FTX Group employee who managed token investments for Alameda‘ and ‘certain sales related to those investments that were not properly documented. S&C also found that this employee made substantial withdrawals from his exchange account close to the Petition Date.’
Additionally, there was ‘a former FTX Group employee who was the subject of media reports regarding his transfer of $600,000 of FTT to a charity that he co-founded. Due to the need to prioritize other litigation and potential challenges with any claims against these individuals, the Debtors have not yet elected to proceed with actions against them.’
Additionally, the report details an already filed avoidance lawsuit against employees who made other withdrawals in the days before the collapse.
The report further concludes that FTX US wasn’t solvent at the petition date, despite Bankman-Fried’s frequent insistence. Allegedly, FTX.US’s ‘Bank Balance’ spreadsheet totaled $138.5 million and the ‘Wallet Balances’ spreadsheet — the customer balances — totaled $184.7 million.
Additionally, ‘Caroline Papadopoulos, FTX.US’s controller, pointed out that the calculation was off for another reason: it “includ[ed] [WRS] cash [which] should be considered independent of FTX US.” She characterized the ostensible reconciliation as “nonsense.“’
Interestingly, the report concludes that ‘the Examiner has seen no evidence to suggest that Sullivan &Cromwell (S&C) knew about the fraud at the FTX Group pre-petition or that S&C ignored red flags that would have required the firm to investigate statements made by the Debtors.’
The report reached this conclusion despite the fact that ‘because of the use of Signal auto-deletion features, it is likely — and 38 indeed appears to be the case — that the production of these messages is not and potentially could never be complete.’
Furthermore, despite CoinDesk reporting suggesting that Alameda Research was valuing assets at more than their entire market capitalization, five days after that report dropped, an S&C lawyer emailed Voyager to reassure it that the FTX group was ‘rock solid’ and that the current issues were ‘Binance silliness.’
The lawyer apparently claimed they hadn’t learned about the issues until the day after sending this email.

Lawyers and whistleblowers
The report describes the deep and interconnected relationship that FTX Group had with Fenwick & West (F&W), described as ‘Law Firm-1’ in the report. Allegedly, Joseph Bankman, the father of financial criminal Sam Bankman-Fried, recommended hiring F&W to help the FTX Group, and further recommended that the firm recruit both Daniel Friedberg and Can Sun. 
The report alleges that F&W ‘served as the FTX Group’s primary US outside counsel and advised the company on issues of employment, tax, lending agreements, acquisitions, regulatory matters, government investigations, compliance and risk mitigation, equity incentives, partnership agreements, trademark enforcement, intercompany services agreements, purchase agreements, and financing. 
‘Between 2018 and 2022, Law Firm-1 received more than $22 million in legal fees from the FTX Group. In 2018, while Friedberg was a partner at Law Firm-1, Joseph Bankman encouraged Bankman-Fried to employ Friedberg in a central role at Alameda.
‘Friedberg and Can Sun left Law Firm-1 to join the FTX Group, in January 2020 and August 2021, respectively. Friedberg served as both the Chief Compliance Officer for FTX.US and General Counsel of Alameda, and Sun was the General Counsel for FTX Trading. However, the relationship between Law Firm- 1 and the FTX Group went beyond Friedberg and Sun.
‘Joseph Bankman maintained unusually close personal relationships with various other Law Firm-1 lawyers, which sometimes translated into subsidizing perks for certain Law Firm-1 attorneys, such as paying for travel and admittance to sporting events.
‘This deep relationship included F&W helping with:

The FTX Group’s issuance of ‘founder loans,’ which were used to move at least $2 billion in cash and assets among FTX Group entities, as well as directly into the personal accounts of FTX Group leadership;
Friedberg’s creation of a backdated payment agent agreement between FTX Trading and Alameda;
FTX Group leadership’s efforts to obfuscate from government regulators and investors the close relationship between FTX Trading and Alameda;
FTX Group leadership’s efforts to use unconventional settlements to silence credible whistleblowers; and
FTX Group’s efforts to downplay its involvement with, and control over, the Serum Foundation.’

The exact details of that relationship are a little hard to discern precisely, in part because F&W ‘frequently used ephemeral messaging platforms such as Signal to communicate with individuals at the FTX Group and, to date, has only produced 144 individual or group chats between Law Firm-1 and FTX Group employees.
‘Only 18 of those chats still contained messages; the remainder only showed that a group message had once existed, but did not contain any content.’
The report further suggests that F&W may have been aware of issues years before the eventual collapse, with the investigation finding ‘a December 2019 communication from Bankman-Fried to members of that firm in which Bankman-Fried acknowledged that Alameda holds lots of FTT, which has a high market value but that market value could not be realized without crashing the market.’
Furthermore, the report alleges that F&W ‘created the Serum Foundation with systems that would allow certain employees of the FTX Group to continue to exercise control over the Serum Foundation and the SRM token. Quinn Emanuel also found that individuals associated with the FTX Group used [F&W] to create an entity called the Incentive Ecosystem Foundation in order to provide incentives for the SRM ecosystem and bolster SRM’s market price, while concealing that entity’s connection to the FTX Group.’
This is consistent with the previous allegation where ‘the Debtors reported that Friedberg — the former General Counsel of Alameda — commissioned the whitepaper for Maps and drafted significant portions of it in October 2020.’
Friedberg has already been the target of a lawsuit by the estate that alleges that he helped pay off whistleblowers.
Additionally, ‘Sun, in coordination with Friedberg, worked to avoid CFTC scrutiny by concealing information about entities with an interest in FTX Trading.’
The report also alleges that the FTX Group had a pattern it tended to fall into with whistleblowers: ‘FTX Group counsel did not properly investigate the substance of these whistleblower complaints but rather settled them for considerable amounts, and that these resolutions were principally handled by Friedberg, with the assistance of Sun, Miller, and Joseph Bankman.’
Generally, the FTX group would allegedly resolve these complaints without investigating their substance, often using large financial settlements and a ‘consistent pattern’ of hiring counsel who did not end up providing substantial legal services to the FTX group. These allegedly included:

Paying Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe $20,762 for legal services related primarily to ‘Whistleblower-5’ separation from FTX.
Paying Holland & Knight $64,998 in fees related primarily to drafting a settlement agreement with a whistleblower.
Paying Silver Miller Law $760,000 in fees related to providing advice on regulatory matters and a whistleblower allegation.
Loaning Pavel Pogodin $1 million as part of a settlement related to dropping whistleblower complaints. Following this, he allegedly entered into two engagements with FTX, for a total of $3.3 million, and the investigation notes that it ‘found no evidence that Pogodin ever provided any legal services to the FTX Group.’
Paying ‘Law Firm-8’ $200,000 per month for five years after settling whistleblower-1’s complaint. The only work produced was apparently ‘a single, three-page memorandum prepared by a non-lawyer.’

Law firms were allegedly often instructed to skip due diligence on investments that the FTX group intended to make. Sometimes, like in the case of the law firm that aided in the acquisition of HiveEx in Australia, the firms were actually able to make ‘finder’s fees’ from helping FTX find the targets of these investments or otherwise help FTX.
In that case, ‘eventually, Law Firm-5’s role grew to include negotiating settlements to avoid negative publicity for the FTX Group. For example, in July 2021, Law Firm-5 arranged for the incorporation of a Cayman Islands company, 707,016 Ltd., to pay off the creditors of Alex Saunders, an Australian crypto-influencer. Saunders was alleged to have used borrowed funds to trade on FTX.com, but lost the funds that he traded.
‘To mitigate any reputational harm and avoid potential litigation, FTX Trading loaned Saunders $13.2 million through 707,016 Ltd. to enable Saunders to pay off his debts. Saunders has not repaid this loan. A partner at Law Firm-5, who was the FTX Group’s primary contact at the firm, personally received at least $727,402 in “finder’s fees” for certain acquisitions that he suggested.’

Another law firm was retained ‘in connection with responses to SEC and CFTC document requests related to the entities’ relationship with Tether/Bitfinex.’ Unfortunately, perhaps due to the use of Signal, some of the documents from that engagement that relate to market manipulation cannot be located. 
Some firms did raise issues with FTX leadership about conduct, with Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom supposedly repeatedly warning about ‘undisclosed political contributions by FTX.US.’
Banks
FTX struggled to maintain consistent and open access to banking, relying on a pattern of misrepresentations to maintain its access. These included failing to ‘properly designate all FBO accounts.’ Furthermore, they often commingled customer and corporate funds in the accounts. 
Salame allegedly intervened to help Deltec Bank and Trust with ‘capital issues’ by issuing ‘two $50 million loans involving Salame, Alameda, and two other companies, Deltec International Group (Deltec) and Norton Hall Ltd. (Norton Hall). The investigation concluded that the loans were intended to ameliorate Deltec’s capital issues while ensuring that Deltec would ‘owe’ the FTX Group as a result, and the related promissory notes were structured to conceal Alameda’s role in the loans.’
FTX and Alameda Research also cooperated with Deltec when it came to Moonstone Bank. ‘Although Moonstone Bank was a small regional bank with only a few million dollars in assets, debtor entity Alameda Research Ventures invested $11.5 million in Moonstone Bank’s holding company, FBH Corporation. The discussions around the staking program did not prove fruitful, but FTX Group entity FTX Trading nonetheless deposited $50 million in a Moonstone Bank account.’

Bad investments
Alameda Research and the rest of the FTX group were poor investors, skipping diligence and throwing money into projects with massive red flags.
These included Embed, a security clearing firm that it acquired for $300 million, and when the estate tried to sell, the highest bid was only $1 million from the founder of the firm. The report alleges that FTX ‘conducted minimal due diligence.’
In another case, the FTX Group spent $376 million to acquire DAAG, despite the fact that it was not an active business and the acquisition ‘did not include the rights to key pieces of intellectual property.’ The estate found that ‘a sale would not be possible because the company had no meaningful saleable assets.’
Some investments were important for other reasons, like when ‘FTX Group acquired nearly the entire economic stake in Genesis Block, but almost all of the shares of Genesis Block were transferred to an entity controlled by Genesis Block’s co-founder and CEO.’
Genesis Block was found to be connected to the ‘Korean Friend‘ account on FTX.

Modulo Capital was another investment fund with romantic ties to Bankman-Fried that received $500 million in investment.
Genesis Digital Assets, described as Venture Investment-1 in the report, received approximately $1 billion, but members associated with Genesis Digital Assets allegedly ‘were aware of potential inaccuracies in the company’s financial statements and valuation materials provided to potential investors.
‘There was also evidence that co-founders of Venture Investment-1 had been involved in criminal conduct in Kazakhstan. And while the FTX Group’s due diligence process identified many of these issues, the FTX Group nevertheless chose to invest.’
Broadly, the report reiterates that FTX was a criminal enterprise engaged in a variety of irresponsible and inappropriate behaviors, with a swarm of executives and lawyers working extraordinarily hard to keep the FTX ship afloat.

Elon Musk Tweets Tribute to Dogecoin Mascot, DOGE Price Spikes 5% - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsDogecoin (DOGE) jumped 5% on Friday following a tweet by Twitter (aka X) owner and long-time Dogecoin champion Elon Musk. The tweet honored the late Kabosu, the Shiba Inu behind the beloved Doge meme, who passed away on Friday.The tweeted image also included Harambe, the lowland gorilla who was tragically killed in 2016 and became a meme icon.Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.16, according to CoinGecko. DOGE started the day at $0.15 before surging to $0.17 following news of Kabosu’s death and Musk’s tweet.Kabosu, who passed away at the age of 19 on Friday, inspired countless memes and meme coins, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shibu Inu (SHIB), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Bonk (BONK). Harambe also inspired memes and an online movement after his death in a Cincinnati Zoo.Launched in December 2013, Dogecoin remains the number-one meme coin with a market capitalization of $24.3 billion. In March, the price of Dogecoin spiked when Musk suggested that Tesla may allow customers to buy its electric cars with the meme coin. There’s a long, long history of Musk’s tweets and appearances influencing the price of the coin.Earlier this month, riding the GameStop and meme coin frenzy after the return of Roaring Kitty to social media, Dogecoin jumped 7% in value on May 15.Still, even with the recent surges, Dogecoin is down 77% from its all-time high price of $0.73 that the original meme coin hit in May 2021.While Musk is the most prominent person on Twitter showing respect to Kabosu, others are keeping the beloved pup’s memory alive—and apparently helping to keep Dogecoin’s price in the green all the while.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

                        Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) FTX Group allegedly paid over $25 million in hush money to seven whistleblowers prior to the doomed crypto exchange collapse in November 2022, a bombshell independent examinator’s Thursday report found.FTX Whistleblowers Agreed To Settlement Deals Prior To Collapse
Robert Cleary, the independent examiner tasked with conducting the report, discovered the now-settled claims investigating employee severance packages, as FTX did not record employee complaints.According to Cleary’s report, the investigation “ultimately identified settlement agreements totaling more than $25 million with seven whistleblowers who alleged various improprieties at the FTX Group, with most of that money going to five of those whistleblowers who raised allegations of systemic improprieties.”The report further claims that FTX Group failed to investigate whistleblowers’ claims and instead settled them for “considerable amounts,” with the resolutions primarily handled by attorney Daniel Friedberg.One whistleblower (identified as Whistleblower-4) alleged the crypto exchange “misled regulators and investors and lacked adequate corporate structure” in a letter to Bankman-Fried, Friedberg, and FTX’s head of engineering Nishad Singh.“Shortly after, Friedberg told Whistleblower-4 that he should not have written the letter and, in particular, should not have suggested that the FTX Group may not satisfy investor expectations,” the report stated. “Friedberg further suggested that Whistleblower-4 apologize to Bankman-Fried.”Ultimately, the unnamed whistleblower allegedly agreed to a $16 million settlement in September 2022, just two months before the exchange’s collapse.Another whistleblower, who served as an attorney for FTX’s sister company, Alameda Research, was allegedly terminated after he “raised concerns about regulatory and governance issues at Alameda and Alameda’s handling of customer funds without a money transmitting license.”Despite having only worked at Alameda Research for a total of less than three months, the anonymous attorney was granted a $2 million settlement.A third whistleblower was allegedly granted a similar $1.8 million settlement after only working at FTX.US for two months after they raised concerns regarding “market manipulation and insider trading.”Ryan Salame To Be Sentenced Following SBF FTX Conviction
News of the report comes ahead of former FTX executive Ryan Salame’s sentencing on Monday on criminal charges tied to his role at the crypto exchange. Salame is the first FTX executive outside of Bankman-Fried to be sentenced for his crimes.Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence for orchestrating the multi-billion dollar fraud and has been ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture.The whistleblowers’ claims only serve to highlight Bankman-Fried’s desperate attempts to cover up his crimes, to no avail, in the leadup to FTX’s collapse.

Trader 'Betting On The Death' Of Dogecoin Meme Dog Kabosu Nets $230,000 Profit - Benzinga

Following the death of Kabosu, the dog behind the Dogecoin DOGE/USD meme, a Kabosu-themed token has netted a prescient trader of $200,000.What Happened: A trader’s tweet highlighted a wallet that had been accumulating billions in KABOSU throughout the year, "betting on the dog’s death." Upon the dog’s death, the price of the meme coin price spiked, prompting the trader to dump his entire holdings for a profit of $230,000.In January 2023, Dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus shared a health update, writing “Kabosu is doing better and going on walks and eating again." It was disclosed that the Shiba Inu dog was afflicted by chronic lymphoma leukemia (cancer) and acute cholangiohepatitis (an inflammation that hits the liver and biliary tracts).One meme coin trader paid his respects to Kabosu, stating that without that dog there would be no Dogecoin, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, or any meme coins. The trader also mused which Kabosu-related token would perform the best, as several versions on different blockchains have sprung up.Also Read: Elon Musk Mourns Death Of Iconic Shiba Inu That Inspired His Favorite Crypto Dogecoin: Here’s How Crypto Community Is Reacting To Kabosu’s DemiseWhy It Matters: The Kabosu story mirrors that of a Winnie Pooh-related meme coin that quickly soared, albeit for no evident reason.

DOGE has recovered to trade at a daily gain of 2.6%, while SHIB is down 0.9% on the day.What’s Next: The influence of meme coins and Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Kabosu, Famous Shiba Inu Who Inspired Dogecoin, Floki And Other Dog Cryptos, Dies At 18Image: ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Four Giant Altcoin Whales Took Action: They Purchased Huge Amounts of 2 Different Altcoins! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While fresh wallets and whales turned to Ethereum-based altcoins, which attracted attention with their rise, during and after the Spot Ethereum ETF approval process, these large purchases by whales increased speculation that the altcoin season could begin.
When looking at whales' purchases, it was seen that they were concentrated in PEPE and Ethena (ENA).


According to data from Spot on Chain and Lookonchain, which track whales' purchases, whales have increased their PEPE and ENA purchases in recent days.
Accordingly, a whale bought 1.32T PEPE worth $18.2 million from Binance in just 2 days.





It was also observed that three whales received 54.31 million ENA worth $45.6 million from CEX in the last 7 days.
PEPE price has increased by 40% in the last 7 days; ENA, on the other hand, recorded a 21% increase.

Bitcoin Battles to Hold $69,000 as Analysts Eye Potential Retracement



                    

On May 22, Bitcoin aimed to turn the $69,000 mark into a support level, causing concern among analysts as prices pulled back from local highs.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed weakening Bitcoin price action, resulting in two tests of the previous all-time highs from 2021. 




At the time of writing, Bitcoin remained above $69,000, a crucial threshold for many.



“Support at $69k needs to hold to have a chance to validate an R/S flip at the prior ATH,” stated trading resource Material Indicators on X. 



This referred to a potential resistance/support flip at $69,000. 



However, Material Indicators also warned that one of its proprietary trading tools was signaling a “clear” downtrend on daily timeframes, adding, “For me, a move above $71.5k would invalidate.”



Other analysts shared similar concerns about the increasing risk of rejection, potentially thwarting Bitcoin bulls’ efforts to overcome resistance. 



John Bollinger, creator of the Bollinger Bands volatility indicator, expressed his apprehensions, noting, “I am not fond of the two-bar reversal at the upper Bollinger Band for $btcusd. Suggests a consol or a pullback. Not bearish here, just short-term concerned.”

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, some traders, including Credible Crypto, had already predicted a broader Bitcoin price retracement. 



“Credible Crypto has been one of the most vocal advocates for a return towards $60,000 or lower, with a recent chart on X indicating likely support below the starting point of an “impulsive move.”




The week’s decision on United States spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) was also pivotal for Bitcoin targets, according to Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader. 



Updating X followers, Filbfilb suggested that an ETF rejection by regulators would only reset the market to its position before the recent impulse. 



He concluded, “If ETH ETF is rejected then simply reset to where we were last week.” Conversely, a positive ETF decision could propel Bitcoin into price discovery and potentially reach $80,000.



On May 21, ETH/BTC reached its highest levels since mid-March.

Top Trader's Ethereum Price Prediction Targets All-Time Highs In 2025 - Benzinga

Prominent cryptocurrency trader smileycapital is raising the bar for Ether ETH/USD price predictions following the long-awaited approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.What Happened: While the market awaits a definitive breakout, smileycapital outlines a bullish short-term outlook with a target of $9,000, highlighting several key factors.The trader draws comparisons with Bitcoin's BTC/USD performance following its ETF approval.From October to March, Bitcoin surged from $30,000 to $74,000, roughly a 150% increase.Applying a similar trajectory to Ethereum, he notes, could imply a target of around $7,500 from the $3,000 level observed when the first news broke.Adjusting for market conditions and speculative behaviors, he suggests a potential peak of $9,500 for ETH.Differences In Market ConditionsHowever, smileycapital points out that Ethereum’s current market conditions differ significantly from those of Bitcoin during its ETF approval period. Bitcoin benefitted from a longer speculative phase, lasting three months before the actual approval, which allowed for substantial price growth. In contrast, Ethereum’s speculative period was much shorter, leading to a 30% rally and a subsequent cooling-off phase.Also Read: SEC Approval Of Ethereum ETFs Is Evidence Of A ‘Profound Shift’ In Crypto Adoption: Report“ETH does not have the aspect of pure speculation,” smileycapital notes, emphasizing the importance of speculation in driving price movements. He also mentions the seasonal slowdown in market participation during summer, which might affect Ethereum’s short-term price dynamics.Long-Term OutlookPost-approval, Bitcoin saw aggressive inflows for approximately 2.5 months, driven by rising global liquidity and retail FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), which propelled it to new all-time highs. Smileycapital suggests a similar pattern could occur for Ethereum, especially if institutional funds and participants chase ETH following Bitcoin’s ETF success. However, he cautions about tempering expectations given the current market phase and potential seasonal impacts.Despite the cautious short-term outlook, smileycapital remains optimistic about Ethereum’s long-term prospects, targeting $12,000 to $16,000 with a ratio of 0.12 against Bitcoin.He believes the approval of Ethereum ETFs cements the asset’s role as an institutional vehicle, paving the way for significant industry ramifications and a potential bull run in Q4 2024 and the first half of 2025.Looking ForwardEthereum's path to $9,000 in the short term is influenced by a mix of speculative behaviors, market conditions and institutional inflows.As the market navigates these dynamics, investors and industry leaders can gain further insights at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: With Ethereum ETFs Approved, Why Is ETH Not Going Up?Image: Shutterstock

Ripple (XRP) Price May Suffer From Investors Declining Conviction


Although Ripple (XRP) price may not have been among the best-performing cryptocurrencies this quarter, it is still in an uptrend.
This uptrend, however, may halt for a while as the shaking conviction among XRP holders could cause a price dip.
Are Ripple Investors Skeptical?

XRP price, like any other token in the crypto market, tends to be heavily impacted by the actions of its long-term holders (LTH). Their accumulation tends to drive the price up, whereas selling causes deep drawdowns.
In the case of the Ripple native token, these long-term investors have a pattern of moving their assets monthly, which has been priced at this point. However, recently, the age consumed metric, which multiplies the total volume moved with the time since it was last moved, has shown spikes in the last few days.
These spikes, being out of the pattern, suggest that XRP LTHs are moving their holdings around during uncertain market conditions. This could be their attempt to sell their holdings to secure profits or offset losses.

Regardless, the altcoin could face a bearish impact on this development.
Furthermore, XRP holders’ total participation has also come down considerably. The total number of investors conducting a transaction on the network started declining in December 2023. 
This decline has continued to date, which is a negative sign for the cryptocurrency. 
Read More: How To Buy XRP and Everything You Need To Know
XRP Active Addresses. Source: Santiment
The decline in active addresses shows that participation is down, which is a bearish development for the XRP price.
XRP Price Prediction: Fall Back to Key Support

XRP price trading at $0.53, managed to secure the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level as support. This level is also known as the bear market support floor and staying above it during bearish market conditions prevents excessive drawdowns.
This level marked at $0.51 is the likely target for the altcoin. The aforementioned factors, should they initiate a decline, could bring XRP price down to this price point. Losing it would also mean losing the support of the uptrend line sending the altcoin to $0.50 or lower.

XRP Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
However, if the broader market cues remain in favor of gradual uptrend, XRP price could prevent a drawdown and continue rising. As a result the bearish thesis would be invalidated and the altcoin could rise to $0.56.

Dogecoin Co-Creator, Elon Musk Join Tributes To Kabosu's Death, Ascension To Heaven To Be With Harambe: 'Will Live Forever In Our Hearts' - Benzinga

The iconic Kabosu Shiba Inu dog that inspired the Doge meme and subsequent launch of Dogecoin DOGE/USD has died at the age of 18.Tributes for the dog that inspired the community to "do only good everyday" poured in on Friday.What Happened: After recovering from being "very dangerously" ill back in 2022, the beloved Shiba Inu passed away, according to a social media account affiliated with the dog.Tributes are being posted for the dog who inspired several cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD. The dog became an internet sensation thanks to an iconic picture that evolved into one of the most recognized memes globally.Elon Musk is known for sharing his love for Dogecoin on social media from time to time. Early Friday morning he responded to a post about Kabosu's death.Later in the day, Musk shared a meme from Not the Bee that featured Kabosu and Harambe, a well-known gorilla from the Cincinnati Zoo who died in 2016."OG Doge has ascended to heaven to be with his friend Harambe," Musk tweeted.Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus shared several pictures and a video of Kabosu in a tribute."Kabosu will live on forever in our hearts," Marcus tweeted.Floki Inu FLOKI/USD, which is based on Musk's Shiba Inu, showed their support Friday."Kabosu's legacy lives on in Floki! She will be missed!" the account tweeted.The Floki account also said they will "march on" and "continue the legacy" created by Kabosu.The official Dogecoin account on X took time to share a tribute Friday."The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable. She was a being who knew only happiness and limitless love. Please keep her spirit and her family in your heart, and most importantly carry her with you as your story continues," the account tweeted.Cryptocurrency Solana SOL/USD also posted a tribute to Kabosu."RIP, Kabosu. So life, much success, such fluff," the account tweeted.Own the Doge, which is the community that owns the iconic Doge meme, paid tribute on X."Today, we come together with heavy hearts to bid farewell to an internet legend, an embodiment of joy, and a symbol of kindness – Doge, the beloved Shiba Inu known as Kabosu. The Doge who touched millions of hearts is now one amongst the stars, wagging her tail looking down at the legacy she has left," the account tweeted.The X account of WeRateDogs, which previously rated Kabosu, shared a touching tribute Friday and handed out a final rating."For her lasting legacy on internet culture, the legend Kabosu receives our highest honor, a 15/10," the account tweeted.Related Link: From Dogecoin Meme To Twitter Icon: 5 Little-Known Things About The 18-Year-Old Crypto Canine SensationWhy It's Important: The tweet by Musk of the meme of Harambe with Kabosu caused a brief spike in the price of Dogecoin.The connection between Kabosu and Harambe shouldn't be a huge surprise to any who have followed Musk for years as he's a fan of both internet legends.In 2019, Musk released a surprise rap song titled "RIP Harambe," which he joked was his finest work."RIP Harambe, sipping on some Bombay, we on our way to heaven, amen, amen," the song says in autotune.Likely not a surprise to the cryptocurrency community, someone created a Harambe and Kabosu inspired coin after Musk's tweet. The coin named KabosuwifHarambe has the ticker HEAVEN built on the Solana blockchain.Benzinga also shared that a trader who accumulated billions of the coin KABOUS throughout the year may have been "betting on the dog's death." When the coin spiked Monday, the trader sold the coin for a profit of $230,000.Kabosu was rescued by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato in November 2009. Sato took pictures of the dog in a random photoshoot and shared several online.The photos eventually made their way on Reddit and the rest is history. The meme"Never in a million years would I have imagined the impact that my photoshoot of Kabosu would have on the internet," Kabosu's owner previously wrote on Instagram.Read Next: 2021 Was The Year Of Dogecoin: A Month By Month Retrospective With Top StoriesPhoto: milan2102/Shutterstock

$3,400,000 Will Be Sent To Struggling Families As 'No Strings Attached' Income Program Launches on East Coast: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A nonprofit is preparing to hand out millions of dollars over the next two years in a new guaranteed basic income program.
New York City-based homeless shelter operator Win has launched a program that aims to assist homeless families with young children, handing out monthly cash payments for two years to help them get out of shelters faster, the Gothamist reports.










Win is the largest family shelter and supportive housing provider in New York City with 450 housing units in its portfolio. The pilot program will start in its central Brooklyn shelters.
Under the program, 100 families will be selected to receive $17,000 a year, distributed in monthly cash payments via debit cards. A family must have a child younger than two years old and be eligible for shelter to qualify.
There are no strings attached to the payments and the families can use the money in any way they see fit. Researchers from Vanderbilt University will document the program’s impact for five years.
Says Christine Quinn, CEO of Win,
“That’s really kind of like the secret sauce – you’re getting this money with no strings attached, but what is attached to it is a statement of belief in you, a statement that we know you’re the quarterback of your family, and you’re going to use this to help your family… That type of commitment, that type of sincerity is rarely bestowed upon homeless mothers.”
The program comes a year after New York was found to have the largest homeless population in the US. The New York Times reported that there were over 100,000 people in shelters in NYC, partially driven by the large influx of migrants.
Earlier this year, a controversial pilot program went live handing out pre-paid credit cards to 500 migrant families.
Each recipient is getting about $350 a month to spend on food and baby supplies, which is more money than low income residents are given through the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), reports Newsweek.
Dozens of other guaranteed income programs have launched across the US, designed to test the benefits of giving direct aid to people who are struggling to make ends meet.

Here's Why Ondo Finance's ONDO Token Soared to New ATH, Defying Market Sentiment


																Ondo Finance, a platform dedicated to tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) and backed by Pantera Capital, witnessed a surge in the value of its Ondo Finance (ONDO) token.
The coin soared nearly 20%, reaching an all-time high of $1.15 on May 24, 2024. This milestone was perhaps largely driven by Coinbase’s addition of ONDO to its perpetual market.
Performance and Future Outlook
DefiLlama data shows that the ONDO token’s increase over the past 24 hours has pushed its market capitalization beyond $1.6 billion. On May 21, Ondo Finance also achieved a peak total value locked (TVL) of $453 million, its highest level ever.
IntoTheBlock data also reveals a 52.3% rise in large transaction volumes for ONDO, with all holders currently in a profitable position. The concentration of large holders is significantly high at 92%, with around 63% of investors maintaining their tokens for periods between one and twelve months.
Since mid-March, ONDO’s price fluctuated between $0.97 and $0.69 but broke out on Friday. A 10% rally ended the consolidation, pushing ONDO to an initial record high of $1.05. Now in a price discovery phase, investors expect the bullish momentum to continue driving it upward. As of this writing, ONDO is currently oscillating around the ATH price of $1.15, and its TVL is $445 million.




Catalysts and Market Sentiment
The rally came amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Even though the green light has had a controversial impact on the rest of the market, ONDO is among the top performers on a daily scale.
Since its launch earlier this year, ONDO has seen strong demand and has rallied over 1,300% from its all-time low.
Another major catalyst behind the ONDO price rally could be related to Coinbase’s addition of the asset to its perpetual market. According to the announcement, trading has started for ONDO-PERP, PYTH-PERP, and ZETA-PERP on the perpetual markets.


The exchange’s platforms, Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced are now fully operational for trading and offer various order types, such as limit, market, stop, and stop-limit orders. Initially, the ONDO-PERP, PYTH-PERP, and ZETA-PERP markets will enter post-only mode on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced.
Following the announcement, several market traders have issued bullish calls for ONDO. One emphasized that ONDO represents a potent “ETH beta” set for attention soon.
Another predicts an upcoming surge in the “real-world-asset narrative,” highlighting ONDO’s noteworthy performance, ranking closely behind leading Layer 1 platforms and meme tokens this week. Additionally, a crypto trader suggested that investing in ONDO presents a good alternative for those unable to acquire securitized tokens, calling it the next best option.

Ethereum ETF Selloff Triggers $300 Million Crypto Long Flush


								Data shows that a lot of long liquidations have piled up on exchanges after the Ethereum ETF approval, which was a sell-the-news event.
Ethereum Price Has Been Down Since Spot ETFs Gained Approval
Yesterday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally gave the green light on all eight Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were awaiting approval.
Spot ETFs are basically investment vehicles that provide a way to gain indirect exposure to ETH’s price movements without actually owning any tokens.

ETFs are available through means that traditional investors would be familiar with, so those who don’t want to bother with cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets could decide to invest in the asset through them.
The market had been anticipating this event, just like the Bitcoin spot ETF approval back in January. In BTC’s case, the inflows through the ETFs eventually fueled a rally towards a new all-time high (ATH).
When the Bitcoin ETFs had just been approved, though, the investors initially showed a selling reaction, which resulted in the cryptocurrency registering a significant drawdown.
It would appear that the Ethereum spot ETF approval has also been met with some selling so far, as coins across the sector have been in the red over the past 24 hours. Ethereum itself is down more than 5% in the window.

Despite the decline, Ethereum investors would still be holding notable profits, as the coin at its current price of $3,700 is still up over 23% in the past week.
It would appear that the approval and the subsequent selloff may have caught the market off-guard, as the derivatives side has registered some large liquidations in the last 24 hours.
$384 Million In Cryptocurrency Contracts Found Liquidation In Past Day
According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency derivatives market has observed a mass flush during the past day. The below table shows what the numbers have looked like.

As is visible, over $384 million in cryptocurrency contracts have seen forceful closure during this period. More than $297 million of these liquidations involved the long holders alone.
This means these investors betting on a bullish outcome made up 77% of the flush. This naturally lines up, as the overall price volatility in the past day has been towards the downside.

It’s also not surprising that Ethereum, which has been the focus of attention recently, contributed the largest share to this liquidation squeeze, as the heatmap below reveals.

At more than $150 million liquidations, Ethereum has managed to significantly outdo Bitcoin, which has seen contracts worth $74 million flushed down.

JPMorgan Talks About The Approved Ethereum Spot ETFs And The Future Of Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin Sistemi

JPMorgan predicts that trading of the recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs will begin much earlier than November. The company views the approval of these ETFs and the overall cryptocurrency market as increasingly political issues, especially ahead of the 2024 US presidential election.
“We expect trading of the Spot ETH ETF to begin before November,” a team of JPMorgan analysts led by Kenneth Worthington said in a report published today.


On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved forms 19b-4 of eight spot Ethereum ETF applications. These include Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Fidelity and Franklin.
All approvals were granted in a single mass order. However, these ETFs' S-1 filings are still awaiting SEC approval before trading can begin. Many analysts predict that trading will begin in the coming weeks.





The SEC's approval of ETH ETFs comes after it reconvened with stakeholders earlier this week after months of deliberations.
The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs likely occurred because issuer companies removed staking-related language from their 19b-4 forms. Staking is a contentious issue between fund issuers and the SEC. It remains unclear whether an issuer staking ETH on behalf of an ETF investor creates an investment contract and therefore a security under the Howey test.



“Discussions around staking are likely to continue, as we understand that the focus right now is whether these issuers will be able to keep such staking rewards for themselves,” JPMorgan analysts said.
The approval of the ETH ETF coincided with the US House of Representatives passing the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, also known as the FIT 21 bill. Analysts said the following on the subject:






“But the bill has less chance of passing the Senate, and the Biden administration has said it does not support the bill, but has not yet threatened a veto.”

Bitcoin is worth $69,000 - unless you’re an FTX creditor


Unfortunately, it’s not looking good for FTX customers looking to raise the tragically low bitcoin price that the bankruptcy estate will use to calculate their repayments.
Yesterday, a US bankruptcy judge denied a victim’s request to use a higher price than $16,871. Specifically, the judge denied Australian Bitcoin miner NuGenesis Ou’s request to vacate a January 31 ruling that set the USD calculation date for crypto asset pricing to November 11, 2022.
On a separate and unrelated issue, NuGenesis also complained about FTX calculating the price of its proprietary token, NuCoin, at $0 as of November 11, 2022. More relevant to most customers who simply owned bitcoin or major altcoins, however, is that the bankruptcy judge denied NuGenesis’ request to move the USD calculation date away from November 11, 2022 for any crypto asset.
NuGenesis’ attorney argued that the company didn’t receive its legally required notice of the November 11, 2022 date. However, FTX attorneys argued — and prevailed in this argument — that the bitcoin miner was fully aware of FTX’s petition to use that date. The US Bankruptcy Court judge ruled that “there was no evidence supporting the excusable neglect,” as alleged by NuGenesis.
On January 31, Delaware’s US Bankruptcy Court ruled that FTX’s bankruptcy estate may repay customers based on bitcoin’s price on November 11, 2022: $16,871. With FTX’s bankruptcy estate still holding onto customers’ bitcoin that is now worth quadruple that figure ($68,100 as of press time), it is easy to see how FTX can claim to be repaying nearly all customers ‘in full.’

Read more: FTX customers to be repaid at $16,871 bitcoin prices
Full USD but 1/4th the bitcoin to FTX customers
Ironically, while boasting that it will repay customers ‘in full’ despite only giving them roughly one-quarter of their actual bitcoin back, FTX bankruptcy lawyers and other experts have earned over $320 million in fees over the last 15 months. 
According to this bankruptcy technicality, customers will only receive the USD equivalent value of their crypto holdings plus nominal USD interest as of the November 2022 bankruptcy petition date when one bitcoin was worth just $16,871.
The math for most other crypto assets is similarly disappointing. Ether has trebled since the bankruptcy, Dogecoin has doubled, XRP is up 50%, and Solana is up 10X. Customers holding any crypto asset will only receive repayment based on its USD value on November 11, 2022.
Although the judge admitted that other victims might have the right to challenge the $16,871 bitcoin price, this particular miner has lost its request to vacate that ruling. With several months already elapsed since the bankruptcy court set that price and no meaningful challengers able to raise it, it’s looking increasingly likely that FTX’s victims will only be receiving roughly one-quarter of their bitcoin back as of today’s much higher bitcoin price.
Somewhat embarrassingly, that is ‘full’ repayment, according to this bankruptcy proceeding.

Analysts Predict ETH Price Will Shoot to at Least $6,000 Following ETF Approval - The Defiant

Breaching the previous all-time high of $4,800 is only a matter of time, analysts say.The path has cleared for Ethereum to break its previous all-time high and climb to at least $6,000 after the U.S. securities regulator approved the spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund, analysts say.Ethereum’s native token Ether already roared upward in price in the prelude to the approval. The token is up 27% in the past 14 days, now trading for $3,716, although it dropped 3% along with the rest of the market in what seems like a “sell the news” event.Michael Van de Poppe, CEO of MN Trading, said ETH is set to climb another 60% to at least $6,000 in the upcoming months.“If Ethereum runs to 0.08 BTC in the upcoming period and Bitcoin stabilizes at the current price levels or makes a slightly higher all-time high, price predictions for Ethereum could be between $5,500-6,500 per Eth,” Van de Poppe said.Institutional Investors' Inflows And after months of sluggish token appreciation–and tension regarding whether the ETF approval would be granted–Thursday’s move from the SEC is a welcome sign for Ethereum holders.Investors speculate spot ETH ETFs will drive billions of dollars of inflows from institutional investors who would rather hold an ETF, which uses traditional financial infrastructure, than hold cryptocurrency directly. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $40 billion in assets since their approval in January, according to data by The Block.QPC & Standard CharteredSingapore-based crypto investment firm QPC Capital has also touted the potential for a 60% price rally. In a Thursday Telegram broadcast, the firm said that if the Ethereum ETF were to follow Bitcoin ETF flows after it’s January approval, Ether could see a $6,000 price tag.Standard Chartered’s target is higher, predicting ETH could reach $8,000 by the end of this year and $14,000 by 2025, according to a research note published before the ETF approval, last week.“It’s unclear how much Ethereum is going to accelerate. However, a new all-time high is on the horizon after the listing has been taking place,” added Van de Poppe.Long PositionsHis views echoed those of Co-Chief Investment Officer of Transform Holdings, a digital asset firm, Wes Levitt.Levitt also told The Defiant he is also expecting a price tag likely in the $6,000 range.“The start of ETH ETFs trading (not just the rumors of it) should be enough of a catalyst to push ETH to a new all-time high,” Levitt said. “If inflows are similar to those of the BTC ETFs, which have seen enormous success among investors, then price is expected to soar.Both Van de Poppe and Levitt claimed that investors should position themselves long Ethereum for the foreseeable future. Von Poppe, in fact, unveiled that his portfolio is favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin, especially considering the former has been slower to appreciate.

Democrats Urged, But Not Forced, to Oppose Pro-Crypto Bills FIT21 and CBDC Act



                    

Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives are not mandated to vote against two upcoming pro-crypto bills, though they are strongly advised to do so.



A May 20 email from Democratic Party leaders to House members, shared by Politico, indicates the party has not insisted on a “no” vote for the Republican-led Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, known as H.R. 4763 and H.R. 5403, respectively.




Both bills are seen as favorable to the crypto industry if passed. FIT21 would clarify the classification process for cryptocurrencies as either commodities or securities, primarily placing regulatory control with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).



The U.S. crypto industry and lobbyists back this bill, with 60 companies advocating for its passage in a May 16 letter.



The CBDC act aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency.




However, the email noted that Representatives Maxine Waters and David Scott “strongly oppose” FIT21, and Waters also opposes the CBDC act. 



Politico later obtained a letter from the pair urging a vote against FIT21.



“House Democratic leaders said today they will NOT whip against House Republicans’ crypto bill, I’m told,” Politico reporter Eleanor Mueller wrote on X, referring to FIT21.



In the email, Democratic leaders expressed concerns about parts of the bill, particularly its provision for trading digital commodities in the secondary market if they were initially offered as investment contract securities under the SEC’s Howey test.

“This language undermines decades of legal precedent and case law, thereby creating uncertainty in our traditional securities market,” the email stated.



Leaders argued the bill “weakens investor protections and opens the door to fraud and market manipulation” by providing a “safe harbor” for entities to register intent, effectively shielding them from the SEC until crypto rules are finalized by both the SEC and CFTC.



Meanwhile, the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC, even in pilot programs.



Democratic leaders contend that stopping CBDCs could undermine the “primacy of the U.S. dollar,” as other countries with CBDCs seek to evade sanctions.



“According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the bill’s overly broad definition of CBDC raises concerns the bill could undermine the Fed’s ability to conduct monetary policy,” the email added. “Particularly concerning as it attempts to navigate a soft landing in regard to inflation.”



Floor debate and passage of FIT21 are expected on Wednesday, May 22, according to Politico’s Mueller.

Digesting the ETH ETF decision: What it means and what comes next - Blockworks


Spot ether ETFs are not launching today — and they might not hit the market any time soon. 
But Thursday marked a win for crypto fund issuers, particularly considering how many expected the Securities and Exchange Commission to rule against such products just a week ago.
In case your internet has been down for the last 16 or so hours, the SEC approved rule changes submitted by the stock exchanges on which ether ETFs would list.  
Fund groups now with a path to approval include VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, Ark Invest, Franklin Templeton and Invesco. 
Some industry watchers also noted the apparent clarity the decision offers in terms of ether’s status as a commodity. 
The agency greenlighting the so-called 19b-4 documents is a big step toward these funds launching, but not the only one. Next up, the SEC also needs to sign off on registration statements, known as S-1s, submitted by the fund issuers. 
Some have attributed the potential delay between these two actions to the fact that the SEC’s 19b-4 approval appeared to reflect a rather sudden, politically motivated change of stance. 
Read more: Politics, amendments, staking: Making sense of the ether ETF developments 
Whereas the agency’s Division of Trading and Markets ruled on the 19b-4, its Division of Corporation Finance handles the S-1 review.
Ramped-up engagement between the SEC and fund issuers this week indicates a possible SEC about-face that could signal the Corporation Finance unit is in catch-up mode. 
Such conversations in the days leading up to the SEC’s decision deadline resulted in 19b-4 amendments on Tuesday and Wednesday clarifying that the US spot ether ETFs would not stake their holdings. 
Put simply, ether ETFs are not cleared to launch, despite what might be out there in the ether (pun intended — we try to keep it light on Friday).
But it appears just a matter of time before such products are able to trade.
The next steps and when these could launch
The S-1 approval process is set to involve comments issued by the SEC and responses from fund issuers. While the SEC has a 240-day window to consider 19b-4 proposals, there is no specific deadline associated with the S-1 review. 
A source familiar with the matter told Blockworks “it’s really hard to put odds on timing” of how it will play out, noting that the SEC’s corporation finance unit has not yet made its view clear on the ether ETF proposals. 
The SEC did not immediately return a request for comment.
Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in a Thursday X post he expects the process could take anywhere from two weeks to several months. 
“Obviously this situation is nothing like anything that’s happened historically [in my opinion],” Seyffart added.Fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas indicated he believes it could take four to six weeks before we see an SEC comment letter related to the ether ETF S-1s. 
The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance had worked with prospective spot bitcoin ETF fund issuers on their S-1s for roughly three months before clearing those in January, Seyffart explained in a Friday X Space.  
Katherine Dowling, general counsel at Bitwise Asset Management, noted in the same X Space that the SEC — when reviewing S-1s — is tasked with ensuring the proper disclosures are in place for the investing public. 
There was consistent back-and-forth between the SEC and fund issuers on the spot bitcoin ETF S-1s, which resulted in a number of amendments prior to those funds being approved. Dowling said she expects the same with the ether products.
“Even though some of that groundwork will have been accomplished already through the spot bitcoin process, there are still differences,” the Bitwise executive added. “There are a number of additional risk disclosures, polishing, et cetera that will, and should, go on.”  
While VanEck filed an amended S-1 late Thursday, it appears no other issuers have submitted one since the 19b-4 approval. 
A person familiar with the filings told Blockworks they expect amended S-1s from the other fund groups to hit late next week. The SEC’s comments on those will be telling as to how long the process could take from there, the person added.
Another question has been the order in which these funds could launch, or if the full slate of proposed spot ether ETFs would ultimately come to market at once (as the SEC allowed with spot bitcoin ETFs).
VanEck first filed for a spot ether ETF in 2021 and re-upped that bid in September around the same time as Ark Invest and 21Shares. Other fund groups later followed suit. 
Read more: SEC should let VanEck launch its ether ETF first, firm exec says
“The commission believes that it is appropriate to approve all of the proposals at the same time in order to foster competition by potentially providing investors with several spot ether-based ETPs from which to choose,” the SEC’s Thursday 19b-4 approval order states.
Order proves ether is a commodity?  
Some segment observers predicted that the SEC’s unclear stance on whether ETH is a security or commodity could prove a barrier to ether ETF approval.
In a 2018 speech, William Hinman — then-director of the SEC’s division of corporation finance — said “current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.”
SEC Chair Gary Gensler did not give a clear answer when asked if ETH was a security or a commodity during a House Financial Services Committee meeting in April 2023.
Read more: With ether ETF decision imminent, a timeline of how we got here
Variant Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky noted earlier this week that SEC approval of spot ether ETFs would likely mean the agency does not view unstaked ETH a security, calling such a scenario “a major policy move.”
While the Thursday 19b-4 order does not explicitly detail the SEC’s stance on ether’s status as a commodity or security, the products are registered as commodity-based trust shares.
“Today’s approval signals that the SEC views that ETH is a commodity and not a security — contrary to the position it continued to take prior to the events of this week,” a Consensys spokesperson said in a statement.  
Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, filed a lawsuit against the US securities regulator last month, claiming the agency seeks to regulate ETH as a security.
Despite welcoming the ether ETF 19b-4 approval, the Consensys representative pointed to the SEC’s continued “troublesome ad hoc approach to digital assets.” 
“We will continue to fight for definitive regulatory clarity in our case and we are pleased to see the tremendous bipartisan Congressional effort seeking to provide clear and sensible regulation,” the spokesperson added. 
Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal also pointed to what he interpreted as regulatory clarity within the 19b-4 order.
“ETH is effectively deemed a commodity as we’ve always known it to be,” Grewal said in an X post. 
The SEC last year sued the crypto exchange — set to be a custodian for several of the planned spot ether ETFs — for allegedly engaging in unregistered securities offerings.
Coinbase noted the Thursday ether ETF 19b-4 approval in its latest request on Friday to file an interlocutory appeal.

“These approvals enshrine the SEC’s position in 2018 — ETH is not a security,” said a16z crypto general counsel Miles Jennings. “That means the SEC has formally recognized that decentralization moves tokens outside of the US securities law regime.”

'Guild of Guardians' Review: The Perfect Ethereum Game to Play While Taking a Poo - Decrypt

Games have to find you at the right time. Well, this Ethereum game found me on the toilet.My favorite gaming experiences have come when a game is enjoyable and perfectly fits into my life. Think Bloodborne finding me cooped up inside during the pandemic, or co-op gem It Takes Two when I wanted to bond with my partner.Guild of Guardians meets you in those natural breaks in your day—as you're taking a suspiciously long toilet break at work, waiting for the bus, or cooking dinner. This mobile fantasy game has enough complexity to keep you interested, yet thankfully packs a quick enough gameplay loop to easily pick up and put down.Screenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.Fight through dungeonsGuild of Guardians is a mobile trading card game on iOS and Android that draws from the rogue-lite and auto-battler genres for an addictive and convenient gameplay experience.You'll battle your way through dungeons, completing each one up to three times for maximum experience points and loot so that you can continue upgrading your squad. Every dungeon has multiple rooms full of enemies that you need to battle in order to get the final reward. Each room likewise has a range of enemies, loot boxes, and the odd neutral ground to heal or level up your gear.You start off being able to field three guardians, gradually adding more as you level up. These range from tanks to mages and support guardians, and it's critical to make sure your squad has a balanced combination of attributes. Once you’ve picked your party of guardians, you’ll carefully select your formation, ensuring to put the tanks at the front—and then click fight.Taking inspiration from auto-battlers like Riot’s Teamfight Tactics (TFT), your guardians will fight automatically for you. In Guild of Guardians, however, you choose when each one casts their ultimate ability. This strikes a great balance between being passive enough to play in the natural lulls of your day while still being engaging—and requiring at least a little attention.Screenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.As you pass through the rooms of each dungeon, you’re asked to select a rune which will give you a slight buff going forward. Sometimes you have the misfortune of picking up a “curse of fate,” which will buff your enemy and make them more powerful. This gives enough variety to each run of a dungeon, as I adjust my strategy based on my squad and the runes I’ve picked up.This whole loop doesn’t take more than a few minutes at a time, with lots of downtime to put the phone down, continue on with real life, and then return. This is why it’s perfect for those natural pauses in your day.My only complaint when it comes to the core gameplay is that “domain synergies”—and how they interact with each other—feel hidden. Even once you search it out, it doesn’t feel wholly clear or unique. It appears that having a number of characters from the same “domain” slightly buffs your team, but the buff is fairly similar for each domain… so it feels slightly redundant.In other auto-battlers, this is often the most interesting part of the game—so I’d love to see Guild of Guardians develop out some complexity here, such as synergies that grant healing, the ability to stun, or something else unique.Pimp out your partyAfter completing a few dungeons, you’ve probably collected enough resources to start really crafting a team that works for you. Guild of Guardians has a pretty extensive character leveling and gear system that takes just as much as, if not more attention than the dungeon clearing. Each guardian has its own level going up to 30, which influences their health, attack, defense, as well as what skills they have available to unlock.On top of this, you’re able to equip each character with gear such as armor, a wizard hat, or an ax to boost certain statistics. This all feels pretty intuitive, and when it’s not, the game thankfully holds your hand through it.Screenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.Until this point, I had not interacted with any crypto or NFT elements. I’d played the game every day for almost a week, progressing through the game just fine without any Web3 components. Once you sign into your Immutable Passport wallet, however, using a simple Gmail sign-in option, new benefits come your way.Most notably, you’re able to “ascend” your guardians, which gives them a 30% boost across the board. By doing this, you’re turning the guardian into an NFT on the Ethereum scaling network Immutable zkEVM, allowing you to sell them on the secondary marketplace.You can currently purchase the resources required to ascend a guardian for $6.99 for 40 Ascension Seals, but you can also earn them by topping leaderboards. How many seals are required varies depending on how popular the guardian is—but from what I saw, 31 Ascension Seals would do the job for most purple-rarity guardians. Before doing this, Guild of Guardians game director Chris Clay encouraged me during a Zoom call to level my guardians up as much as possible. Ascending your guardians should be the last step in powering up your guardian, and a way for you to lock in the value you’ve put into the game.As someone who has put countless hours (as well as a painful amount of money) into games that give nothing back, I like the idea of being able to sell my assets when I decide I don’t want to play anymore—the Web3 element of this game enables that.Guild of Guardians has a brilliantly addictive gameplay loop. You’ll dive into dungeons attempting to get all the loot at the end. Failed to make it there? Then use any loot you can find to level up your squad, craft gear, or unlock new guardians to take you to that next level.Now when I’m sitting on the throne, I’m not doom-scrolling on Twitter. I’m leveling up my guardians, fighting skeletons in the dungeons, and grinding to one day ascend my whole party in Guild of Guardians.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

The Unintended Consequences of FIT21’s Crypto Market Structure Bill

The bill's proposed bifurcated market for restricted and unrestricted digital assets ignores fungibility as a fundamental characteristic of crypto tokens. By creating categories of restricted and unrestricted assets, the bill disrupts this principle, leading to confusion and market fragmentation. This could impair liquidity, complicate transactions and risk management mechanisms such as derivatives, reduce the overall utility of the crypto tokens and ultimately stifle innovation in a nascent industry.

Binance Announces Upcoming Support for New DeFi Altcoin on the Megadrop Token Launch Platform - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto exchange Binance just unveiled the second digital asset that will be supported on its new token launch platform.
In April, the crypto titan launched Binance Megadrop, a platform with airdrops and Web3 quests that gives users early access to assets that are not yet listed on its exchange.










The first crypto project on the token launch platform is the native Bitcoin (BTC) restaking chain BounceBit.
In a new statement, Binance says Megadrop will now feature the asset of open-source liquidity protocol Lista (LISTA).
Lista says it enables users to earn yields on collateralized crypto assets such as BNB and stablecoins and borrow the project’s Lista USD (lisUSD), a new type of asset known as “destablecoin” that uses decentralized and liquid-staked crypto assets as collateral only.
Lista’s destablecoin is not designed to achieve absolute price stability with fiat currencies, but it’s also not supposed to be a fully volatile asset.
“The intent behind Lista DAO is to propose a solution to the capital efficiency problem of overcollateralized stablecoins experience by allowing users to leverage their funds with a collateral debt position (CDP).”
Lista says it is native to the BNB Chain ecosystem but it has plans to expand to multiple chains.

London Stock Exchange Faces Staffing Crisis Amid Plans For Crypto ETPs Debut


								As the London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) prepares to list its inaugural crypto-linked products, it faces a significant hurdle: the loss of half its four-person team responsible for “overseeing’ exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Key departures include Michael Stanley, head of exchange-traded products, and Hetal Patel, head of business development, who have played pivotal roles in the ETF team.

Crypto ETPs Gaining Ground In The UK
The timing is particularly sensitive as the LSE gears up to introduce its first exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to cryptocurrencies, marking a significant milestone in integrating crypto assets into mainstream financial markets.
As Bloomberg reported, these exits could complicate the LSE’s ongoing projects. The departures have reportedly made it challenging for the exchange to provide clear feedback on technical issues to crypto ETP issuers.
The introduction of crypto ETPs on the LSE follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) recent approval of the first set of such products in the United Kingdom. Notably, WisdomTree Inc. has received authorization to list two physically backed crypto ETPs that will track Bitcoin and Ethereum.
These ETPs, set to begin trading on May 28, represent a significant development for the UK’s financial markets, which have traditionally been cautious about crypto-related investment products.
Unlike the broader accessibility in markets like the United States and Hong Kong, these UK-listed crypto ETPs will be restricted to only “professional investors.”
This cautious approach reflects ongoing regulatory efforts that appear to balance the potential benefits of innovative investment products with the need to protect less experienced investors from potential volatility and losses.
Comparative Insights From The US And Hong Kong Markets
The global landscape for crypto ETFs shows varied investor behavior. Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States have demonstrated strong performance, with a notable trend of positive net inflows. In contrast, Hong Kong’s similar products of ETFs have seen quite the opposite performance.
Particularly, data from SoSoValue shows that US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a nine-day streak of net inflows, accumulating $107.91 million as of yesterday. This marks the longest stretch of positive inflows since a ten-day streak observed in mid-March.
Conversely, the situation in Hong Kong presents a stark contrast. The region’s spot Bitcoin ETFs have faced challenges, with the three approved funds experiencing a net outflow of 25.63 BTC on the same Thursday, according to data from SosoValue.

This outflow was entirely from a fund managed by China Asset Management. Meanwhile, the spot Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong saw no new flows after recording an inflow of 62.8 ETH on the previous Wednesday.
The combined net assets of the three spot Bitcoin ETFs were $254.74 million, and the spot ETH ETFs had net assets of $50.83 million.
These divergent trends between the US and Hong Kong highlight differing investor sentiments and market dynamics in these regions, reflecting localized responses to global cryptocurrency movements.

Trader Says Top-10 Altcoin Primed To Surge 500% ‘Eventually,’ Updates Outlook on Ethereum and Pepe - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that one top-10 altcoin will eventually see a 500% rise while updating his outlook on smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) and memecoin Pepe (PEPE).
In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,200 followers on the social media platform X that meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) will eventually hit $1.










“Jeets might be selling you today but we will send DOGE to $1 eventually, Kabosu. Thank you for your services.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Dogecoin is trading for $0.168 at time of writing, a 6.9% gain during the last 24 hours.
Moving on to the top altcoin, Sherpa says he’s still bullish toward the second-leading digital asset by market cap. The trader’s chart indicates that ETH will clear the $3,980 level within a few weeks.
 “ETH: key level tapped but still expecting this level to break within a few weeks as long as everything gets cleared. Still bullish.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Ethereum is trading for $3,728 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease during the last day.
The trader concludes his analysis by saying that he believes PEPE is a good long play as far as meme assets go and should rise relatively more than DOGE.
“If you’re looking for a big cap meme to long, I think PEPE is a good one. good liquidity, strong volume, this one definitely catches up to the others a bit in my opinion. not saying it’ll flip DOGE or anything but should go up more relatively. long in the green boxes.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
PEPE is trading for $0.000014 at time of writing, a 5% decrease during the 24 hours. On February 19th, it was valued at $0.0000011.
Earlier this week, Sherpa noted that based on buyer demand and trading volume, PEPE has the potential to outperform large-cap meme assets.

U.S. Credit Unions Adopt Tokenization of Real World Assets

                        Traditional banks may still dominate the financial industry in terms of assets held, but credit unions are becoming an increasingly popular option for Americans who qualify. Recent data shows that there are roughly 4,600 credit unions in the United States. A September 2023 report from The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) further notes that nearly 139 million Americans were members of federally insured credit unions, up 20% from five years prior.In addition, the credit union market size measured by revenue totaled $126.2 billion last year.Credit Unions Are Ripe For Tokenization of Real World Assets
John Wingate, Chief Executive of financial platform BankSocial, told Cryptonews that a credit union is a member owned bank. “Unlike for profit banks that are owned by shareholders, credit unions are owned by the members, one member, one share, one vote,” said Wingate. “Given this, the credit union ethos and the decentralized fiance (DeFi) ethos are perfectly aligned.”While this may be true, credit unions face a number of challenges that may hamper future growth.Source: mx.comKyle Hauptman, Vice Chairman of the NCUA – an independent U.S. government agency that regulates federal credit unions – told Cryptonews that credit unions buy and sell pieces of loans. “This is a clunky process called ‘loan participations,” said Hauptman. A compliance blog from the National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions explained that loan participation occurs whenever the ownership interests in a loan are divided up and sold. “Under section 701.22, federally insured credit unions (FICUs) can buy participation interests in loans under certain conditions,” the blog states. Hauptman pointed out that the current loan participation process can be complex. For example, he explained that if a credit union makes a loan and another credit union buys a 20% stake in it, it gets 20% of every loan payment. Hauptman noted that the credit union that buys participation in the loan doesn’t know if the payment has actually been made, however. Additionally, that credit union is unsure if the selling credit union will pay the required 20%. “This makes it difficult for the buying credit union to plan, and it creates unnecessary uncertainty,” said Hauptman.Tokenization Use Cases
Considering the challenge, Hauptman believes that tokenizing loans that aren’t big enough to be securitized in a bond offering may be helpful. “A smart contract would automatically pay the buying credit union their 20%,” said Hauptman. “That credit union will never have to ask ‘did they make a payment?’ or ‘when do I get my piece?.’”Ravi de Silva, Managing Partner at compliance risk management firm de Risk Partners, told Cryptonews that tokenization could also help manage compliance risk by providing greater transparency, security, and efficiency.For example, de Silva believes that tokenization would be helpful for credit unions and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) use cases.“Transaction monitoring is a key control requirement in AML, which involves analyzing customer transactional data to identify potential suspicious or fraudulent activities,” de Silva said. “Tokenization can enable efficient analysis of transactional data.”For instance, de Silva remarked that tokens can be used as a unique identifier to track transactional patterns and detect anomalies. He added that credit unions can analyze token data to detect large cash transactions, structuring or unusual transaction patterns. “AML regulations also require financial institutions, including credit unions, to perform thorough customer due diligence and maintain accurate records of their customers’ identities,” de Silva mentioned. Therefore, he believes tokenization can further help securely store and reference customer identification data. Credit Unions Adopt Tokenization
Given the benefits that tokenization can bring to credit unions, it shouldn’t be surprising that some have started implementing these solutions. According to Wingate, BankSocial is working with several credit unions for use cases such as tokenizing identity.“Credit unions are using our ‘verified product’ for interoperable use between systems and fintechs, deposits for interoperability between bank accounts, other banks, and for DeFi use cases,” he said. Wingate explained that BankSocial’s verified product tokenizes transactional data through hashing. “This is done in a quantum resistant way, on-chain, to provide immutability to records and outcomes for regulators and third party audits,” he said. “We have future cases in the pipeline for merchant payments, treasury management, and lending/borrowing.”Wingate added that Great Lakes Credit Union recently implemented BankSocial’s Real Time Payment Solution. The solution uses Hedera Hashgraph’s distributed ledger technology (DLT) to tokenize payments and deposits for peer-to-peer transactions made on the Hedera network. He added that BankSocial uses the immutable ledger on Hedera as transaction resilience for traditional financial rails.Marshall Hayner, Metallicus’s Chief Operating Officer, told Cryptonews that Metallicus is also working with credit unions on blockchain solutions. “Metallicus has built the Metal blockchain, which is a layer-zero blockchain to enable banks, credit unions, financial institutions, and fintechs to create interoperable ledgers that can communicate seamlessly,” said Hayner.A recent Forbes article noted that Metallicus is working with three credit unions, Vibrant, Meritrust Credit Union, and Fairwinds, to enable blockchain-based solutions.Credit Unions Embrace Tokenization, But Concerns Remain
While it’s notable that some credit unions have begun exploring tokenization use cases, regulatory concerns are a constant challenge.According to Hauptman, the big question that credit unions face is whether or not tokens are securities. “Credit unions worry if that participation may be deemed a security,” he said. “We at NCUA have cleared the way for tokenization use, but we can’t really assuage other concerns about the tokens themselves.”Hauptman added that KYC processes, along with which platforms custody tokens, is a concern for credit unions.“And then within the platform the concern is ‘who are the node operators?’” Hauptman pointed out. “There’s already been political questions about a node being in North Korea or Iran. No one needs an OFAC investigation for breaking sanctions.”On a positive note, Hauptman shared that credit unions are moving forward with blockchain projects that enable identification.“This is where any token is clearly not something ever ‘bought or sold,’” he said. “But tokenization for real world assets remains an issue.”Yet, all things considered, Hauptman believes that U.S. credit unions are still better off implementing tokenization use cases than U.S. banks. He believes this is because NCUA has delivered guidance that provides positive clarity around regulations for credit unions. For example, Hauptman noted that in July 2021, NCUA published a “Request for Information and Comment on Digital Assets and Related Technologies” report. Later that year, NCUA released a report called “Guidance on Relationships with Third Parties that Provide Services Related to Digital Assets.” Additionally, in May 2022, NCUA released another document called “Guidance on Federally Insured Credit Union Use of Distributed Ledger Technologies.”Credit Unions Should Work With Compliance Teams 
In addition to clear guidance, de Silva believes that the regulatory challenges of implementing tokens can be solved by demonstrating how tokenization is implemented, monitored, and audited. “Credit unions need to continuously monitor their tokenization processes and conduct regular risk assessments to identify and address any vulnerabilities or emerging threats,” he said. “This includes staying updated on the evolving regulatory landscape and making necessary adjustments to ensure compliance.”Given this, de Silva pointed out that credit unions should work closely with compliance teams to adopt industry best practices for tokenization. “It is essential to establish a robust framework that aligns tokenization practices with applicable regulations, while prioritizing the security and privacy of customer data,” he said.

4 Solid Crypto Stocks to Bet on Ahead of Next Bitcoin Rally - Benzinga

The cryptocurrency rally came to a sudden halt in April after a robust 2023 and first quarter. The first quarter saw Bitcoin BTC/USD, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, hitting an all-time high of $73,750.However, Bitcoin has since retreated sharply, with its price hovering around $68,000 on May 23. In fact, Bitcoin has fallen 15% since hitting an all-time high on Mar 14.One of the major reasons behind the decline is the recently concluded halving event, which takes place once in four years. The halving event cuts the block reward by half, aiming to limit Bitcoin's total supply to 21 million coins. As a result, the reduced rate of new Bitcoin issuance typically leads to increased demand for the cryptocurrency, which in turn tends to drive up its price.Also, Wall Street suffered in April after a first-quarter rally, as concerns grew over rising inflation. This led to the optimism surrounding rate cuts fading fast as investors feared that the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for a longer period.High interest rates have a negative impact on growth assets such as technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks, and cryptocurrencies.However, Bitcoin still has a lot of potential. Year to date, Bitcoin has gained 54% after increasing 207% in 2023. The halving event has also concluded.Also, the cryptocurrency has jumped more than 50% since the launch of the first Bitcoin ETFs in early January.The minutes of the Federal Reserve's Apr-30-May 1 meeting of the FOMC revealed that several officials are in favor of hiking interest rates if the need arises, as inflation is still above its 2% target.However, recent economic data showed that inflation declined in April after increasing in the first quarter. The consumer price index increased 0.3% month over month in April, which was lower than economists' expectations of a rise of 0.4%. Year over year, CPI rose 3.4%.Also, UJS GDP grew only 1.6% in the first quarter after expanding 3.4% in the final quarter of 2023. Besides, retail sales remained flat in April after increasing 0.3% in March, while manufacturing and services activity also slowed last month.These signs of a slowing economy have raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could soon start interest rate cuts, which would help the cryptocurrency market.Our ChoicesWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024.

Bitcoin Surges Past $70,000 Amid Massive Short Liquidations and ETF Speculations



                    

Bitcoin surged past $70,000 on May 21 following intense buying activity that spiked its price upwards.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed that BTC/USD was striving to maintain its newly reclaimed position near critical psychological levels.




Bitcoin’s price spike toward $72,000 was unexpected, driven by significant buy liquidity. 



This rapid increase dealt a heavy blow to short sellers, with $85 million in BTC shorts being liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass.



Statistician Willy Woo highlighted that bullish investors were confronting overhead resistance that had persisted for over a month. 




“1 month of Bitcoin short position build up just got liquidated,” he shared with followers on X. “One more layer to go in order to short squeeze past all-time highs.”



A bold forecast even suggested that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 following a breakout on weekly timeframes.

Popular trader Skew speculated that the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might have influenced the recent price movements, anticipating “important days to come” ahead of the decision on the U.S. spot.




Meanwhile, Ether (ETH/USD) traded near $3,700, marking an 18% rise in 24 hours and a 25% increase over the week.



Trader Credible Crypto maintained a cautious outlook despite the new demand, advising followers to be conservative. 



He emphasized that Bitcoin’s price was facing “major resistance” and was likely to struggle to break through it for now. 



“No change to the plan- we are at major resistance atm with perp premium positive after a month and a half and funding the highest its been since- I clearly said these are not the conditions in which a move to the highs is conducive to the next major leg up imo,” he explained in an X discussion.



CoinGlass indicated that the thickest bid liquidity below the spot price was at $70,630 at the time of writing.

Binance Exec Hospitalized in Nigeria as $35 Million Money Laundering Case Is Delayed - Decrypt

After fainting in a courtroom earlier this week, Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan has been hospitalized in Abuja, Nigeria, where his money laundering case was adjourned, per Reuters.The largest crypto exchange’s head of financial crime compliance was denied bail earlier this month after being incarcerated in the region in late February. Spending over a month in Nigeria’s Kuje Prison, the executive reportedly appeared gaunt at trial earlier this week.Gambaryan’s lawyer said in a letter to trial judge Emeka Nwite that he is “very ill and requires comprehensive medical attention." The letter went on to say that he “broke down” and had since been given “intravenous treatment for malaria,” according to the report from Reuters.In April, Gambryan pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges after he was charged alongside British-Kenyan regional manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla.Anjarwalla escaped custody in March and was able to fly to Kenya, but there are signs he could face extradition.Binance CEO Richard Teng demanded the release of the two employees in a blog post earlier this month and refuted the charges from the Nigerian government. In two separate lawsuits, the Nigerian government alleges that Binance has been evading taxes and allowed its exchange to be used for money laundering.Teng also said that Gambaryan, an "innocent, mid-level employee," is being held in "a dangerous prison in order to control Binance." For his part, Gambaryan has sued the Nigerian government for violating his fundamental human rights.The two Binance executives were invited to travel to Nigeria to meet with government officials to discuss the allegations there before any lawsuits were filed. But once there, they were detained in an official’s guest house for more than a month without charges. Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Marathon Digital partners with Kenya to harness underutilized renewable energy - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Marathon Digital has partnered with Kenya to harness underused energy across the country for Bitcoin mining.
The deal will see over $80 million invested in projects aimed at boosting renewable energy utilization and optimization. 

Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital has signed a major deal with the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum of Kenya.
Sealed today, May 24, 2024, the agreement provides for partnership that will see the BTC miner harness the country’s underutilized energy for Bitcoin mining.
Marathon to tap into Kenya’s underutilized renewable energy
Marathon struck the deal during Kenya’s President William Ruto’s State Visit to the US.
According to the company, the agreement will see more than $80 million invested in “green data centers to boost renewable energy utilization and optimization in the Republic of Kenya.”
“This agreement with the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum is a pivotal moment for our business as it provides us with a clear framework to pursue opportunities across the Republic of Kenya,” Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO, said in a press release.
The company will work with the Kenyan government and other stakeholders to support initiatives aimed at optimizing energy usage across the country as well as development of key technological infrastructure, Thiel added.
Today’s agreement follows an earlier consultation between Marathon and Kenya, with this deal set to boost the country’s renewable energy sector.
MOEP and Marathon are set to “exchange policy, scientific, and technical information, as well as project investment expertise, to better understand how to optimize renewable energy projects that produce surplus energy due to intermittency and seasonal variations,” the company said in the press release.
Recent data showed that Kenya’s renewable energy sources accounted for over 80% of the country’s electricity generation. Of these renewable or clean energy sources, geothermal is the largest.
But although its estimated potential is 10,000MW, it is largely unexploited. Installed capacity was about 860MW in 2022.

Bearish Unlock | Bankless


Ethereum’s spot ETFs took a major step towards trading yesterday after listing exchanges received “delegated approval” for their 19b-4 applications. Why is the ETH price now sliding?ETF experts had initially projected that we could expect to receive a spot ETH ETF decision around 4 PM EST, but when the moment this deadline arrived devoid of any updates, the price of Ether collapsed by 8%.Price managed to steadily climb higher from these lows in the hour that followed before popping nearly 4% higher after the first announcement of spot ETH ETF approval hit the news wires at 5:02 PM EST!Many Ether bulls were disappointed with the gains exhibited post-approval, believing that market participants were so underweight their chosen asset approval would result in a ferocious pump, but the probability that many would be fading ETH in either the approval or denial scenarios had been high coming into the event.In the denial scenario – which appears to have been fortuitously avoided – the SEC would likely have been forced to unveil a justification for why Ether is a crypto asset security and could not be wrapped in a commodity spot ETF, putting practically every token save BTC under the jurisdiction of the SEC wreaking havoc on broader alt markets.Alternatively, playing out the approval scenario leads to the conversion of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF, which will enable redemptions for over $10B in assets that have been held hostage at a discount for nearly three years and inevitably leading to Ether sell pressure.Both BTC and ETH only experienced a couple percentage points of upside from SEC approval, and although it is unclear when spot ETH ETFs will begin trading or the ETHE redemptions will be enabled, market participants appear to be positioning for sell pressure from the unlocks.While the ETH/BTC ratio went on a monstrous run this week, spiking to 0.057 on spot ETF approval, it has fallen 3% on the day as market participants gravitate back towards BTC, indicating that peak Ether strength has likely been achieved until ETHE redemptions are digested.ETFs can be a bullish catalyst for crypto assets, but only if they attract net new buyers. Unfortunately for Ethereum, demand is far from guaranteed, while an overwhelming supply glut looms large.Some analysts have extrapolated the 60% gains made by BTC since the approval of its spot ETFs to suggest that Ether could similarly rise to $6k and beyond, however, it's important to note that if this historical trend is to hold, ETH will be subject to a 20% drawdown in the coming weeks, retracing the entirety of this most recent move up as sell pressure from ETHE redemptions weigh on price.via TradingView

New Development on the Fate of Terra (LUNA) and its Founder Do Kwon - Bitcoin Sistemi


Once again, the Viši Sud (Supreme Court) will decide to whom Montenegro will extradite Terra (LUNA) founder Do Kwon. This decision came after the Court of Appeal overturned the decision of his colleagues in Viši Sud, upholding his and his defenders' appeal. The case was sent back to the first instance court for retrial and decision.
The first instance decision of the Viši Sud in Podgorica found that the legal prerequisites for the extradition of South Korean citizen Kwon Do Hyeong were met. This was for criminal prosecution for multiple criminal offenses at the request of South Korea and the United States.



However, the Court of Appeal council ruled that the decision significantly violated the criminal procedure provisions.
The right to a reasoned decision, which includes clearly explaining the court's views on the legal and factual issues on which the decision is based and presenting the basic justifications, was emphasized. This right is based on the principle contained in Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which is related to the protection of the individual from arbitrary punishments, that is, the protection of the principle of the rule of law.

Bitcoin Open Interest down by $1B - What traders should know - AMBCrypto



Money flowed out of BTC contracts, suggesting that the price might fall to $65,000.
Social dominance dropped to 7.07%, indicating that attention was moving to other cryptocurrencies.

The total Bitcoin [BTC] Open Interest has lost almost $1 billion in value between the 23rd and 24th of May. AMBCrypto found out after examining the metric using Santiment’s on-chain data.
On the 23rd, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) was $11.75 billion. But at press time, the figure had decreased to $10.77 billion. OI is the value of outstanding positions in a contract.
In crypto trading, there are two sides to a trade— a buyer and a seller. When OI increases, it means that there is new money coming into the market in favor of the buyers.
Decreasing attention may nuke BTC again
A trend like this suggests a bullish trend. But if the metric indicates gets too high, the OI could serve as a bearish sign. On the other hand, a decline in Open Interest suggests an increase in positions closed which favors sellers.
Therefore, the trend above indicates that most traders are not initiating new positions. For Bitcoin’s price, this was a bearish sign, and it had started to reflect on the price.
Source: Santiment
At press time, BTC changed hands at $67,123. This was a 3.52% decrease in the last 24 hours. Apart from the decline in OI, Bitcoin’s decline could be linked to recently approved Ethereum spot ETFs.
From AMBCrypto’s investigation, it seemed that traders were rotating capital into ETH and other altcoins. Should this remain the case for some time, BTC could drop further, and a move to $65,000 could be possible in the short term.
Recently, we reported that Bitcoin’s price could drop before a return to $70,000. As such, it indicates that the prediction could be playing out already.
Watch out! A bounce may be coming
Another metric assessed was social dominance. As of this writing, Bitcoin’s social dominance dropped to 7.07%. Some days ago, the metric was over 28%.
The decline in this metric implies that discussions related to the cryptocurrency had fallen, suggesting that attention from the market was moving elsewhere.
Should social dominance continue to drop, the prediction of $65,000 could come to pass. However, a further decline could indicate a bottom for BTC.
Furthermore, Bitcoin’s Funding Rate was 0.01%. Funding Rate is the cost of holding an open contract in the market. If the funding rate is positive, it means that the contract price is trading at a premium compared to the spot value.
Source: Santiment

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

When the positive rate is negative, it means the contract price is at a discount to the index price. With the funding moving lower and the price decreasing, Bitcoin could remain bearish in the short term.
However, it might not take a long while before the price rebounds.

Ethereum Foundation Officials Speak Out After Revelations That Employees Received Payments From This Altcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi

The Ethereum Foundation is pursuing the development of a formal policy to address potential conflicts of interest. The move comes after the foundation revealed that two of its researchers had received “significant” incentives in EigenLayer tokens.
Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi shared in her statement today that the organization's trusted neutrality is crucial to its role in the ecosystem. He addressed the ongoing discussion about potential conflicts of interest and expressed concerns shared with the community.


Miyaguchi said in his statement:

“It is clear that relying on culture and individual decisions is not enough, and we have been working on an official policy to address this issue for some time. “We will expedite this work and share an update soon.”

In response, Lefteris Karapetsas, a former Ethereum software engineer and founder of crypto portfolio tracking tool Rotki, suggested that the Ethereum Foundation should adequately pay his colleagues. This way, they would not need to look for additional compensation packages elsewhere, according to Karapetsas.






On May 19, Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, announced that he had recently received a “significant” Eigen token incentive after becoming an advisor to the Eigen Foundation.
Drake promised to “reinvest” all proceeds as investments or donations into “valuable” projects in the ETH ecosystem. He also stated that he had undertaken the advisory role only on the condition that his role was limited to investigating restaking risks.


Two days later, Dankrad Feist, another researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, also revealed that he had recently become an advisor to EigenLayer under the same circumstances as Drake.

$6 Billion Fraud and Bitcoin Money Laundering: Woman Gets Jail Sentence


A 42-year-old British-Chinese woman who pleaded guilty to converting Bitcoin into various assets, including real estate and jewelry, has been sentenced to six years and eight months behind bars, Reuters reports.  Jian Wen was initially facing up to 14 years behind bars on various charges. She was found guilty on one money laundering-related charge in March. When her house was searched back in 2018, the Metropolitan Police and a money-laundering investigator discovered a safety deposit box with 61,000 Bitcoins. cardYadi Zhang, Wen's housemate, disappeared after the search. It turned out that she was the mastermind behind a massive money laundering scheme after defrauding 130,000 Chinese investors and fleeing to the UK. Wen, a former takeaway worker, was hired by Zhang in order to use her as her "front person." The latter claimed that she was in charge of the jewelry business. Detectives discovered that Zhang, whose real name is Zhimin Qian, had crazy fantasies about becoming the queen of a small European country. She was prepared to spend at least a whopping $5 million on her crown, according to the personal diaries of the criminal mastermind. cardWen, who used to be a takeaway worker, insisted that she was not aware of the massive fraud scheme. According to Wen, Zhang told her that she was "independently wealthy." She insisted that she simply wanted a better future for her son, who started attending a private school. Zhang reportedly managed to flee with roughly $250 million. The "supervillain," who remains at large, has been slapped with an Interpol red notice.

Ethereum Foundation Preps New Policy on Conflicts of Interest | Bankless


The Ethereum Foundation is prioritizing a new formal policy to address potential conflicts of interest in light of recent debates around prominent Ethereum researchers undertaking advisory positions.What's the scoop?Aya Miyaguchi, the EF executive director, announced plans to speed up the creation of an official policy to handle conflicts of interest. The move follows rising community discussions around recent disclosures from researchers Justin Drake and Dankrad Feist about receiving significant EigenLayer token allocations for advisory roles with the restaking protocol."It is clear that relying on culture and individual judgment has not been sufficient, and we have been working on a formal policy to address this problem for a while now," Miyaguchi said. "We will be accelerating this work, and will share an update soon."Bankless take:It's vital to address and identify potential conflicts of interest to keep our best blockchain innovations uncaptured. That said, while advisorships do pose neutrality issues, both Drake and Feist have maintained they will be critical and focused on EigenLayer's risks, and these are two people whose track records show you can take them at their word. Regardless, Miyaguchi’s quick acknowledgment and prioritization of the issue signals that the Foundation is taking the matter seriously and is dedicated to upholding ethical standards and community trust. Keep an eye out for future EF updates here.

The Untold Story Behind Beeple's Historic NFT Sale: 'Token Supremacy' Excerpt

In 2007, Beeple started a project that would eventually make him famous. The "Everydays" series began as a daily drawing habit of crude little doodles that seemed to betray his more corporate, Bill Gates appearance. The drawings were the crass products of a mind feeding on internet bile (racist caricatures, nude women, penis jokes, political satire) and tutored by magical realism (family portraits, animal studies, Jesus smoking cigarettes, Hillary Clinton wearing gold teeth). A year later, Beeple switched to Cinema4D, an animation software that allowed him to manipulate three-dimensional space. For the kid who spent hours at Toys “R” Us playing a demo of Super Mario 64 on the new Nintendo console, it was a dream come true to create realistic worlds on a computer. But it wasn’t until around 2011 that he started fully utilizing the program to experiment with bright colors and blurry shapes with names like Synthetic Bubblegum Tittufux. Around the same time, Beeple started releasing music videos made with Cinema4D as free source material for creative professionals; the artist understood how popular his creations had become only when, on a family vacation to Hong Kong, he saw one of his works projected outside a Hard Rock Cafe.

Upgraded and Uncensored: Mistral Overhauls Its AI Model - Decrypt

Top open-source AI developer Mistral quietly launched a major upgrade to its large language model (LLM), which is uncensored by default and delivers several notable enhancements. Without so much as a tweet or blog post, the French AI research lab has published the Mistral 7B v0.3 model on the HuggingFace platform. As with its predecessor, it could quickly become the basis of innovative AI tools from other developers.Canadian AI developer Cohere also released an update to its Aya, touting its multilingual skills, joining Mistral and tech giant Meta in the open source arena.While Mistral runs on local hardware and will provide uncensored responses, it does include warnings when asked for potentially dangerous or illegal information. If asked how to break into a car, it responds, "To break into a car, you would need to use a variety of tools and techniques, some of which are illegal," and along with instructions, adds, "This information should not be used for any illegal activities."The latest Mistral release includes both base and instruction-tuned checkpoints. The base model, pre-trained on a large text corpus, serves as a solid foundation for fine-tuning by other developers, while the instruction-tuned ready-to-use model is designed for conversational and task-specific uses.The token context size of Mistral 7B v0.3 was expanded to 32,768 tokens, allowing the model to handle a broader range of words and phrases in its context and improving its performance on diverse texts. A new version of Mistral's tokenizer offers more efficient text processing and understanding. For comparison, Meta's Lllama has a token context size of 8K, although its vocabulary is much larger at 128K.Image: Prompt Engineering/YouTubePerhaps the most significant new feature is function calling, which allows the Mistral models to interact with external functions and APIs. This makes them highly versatile for tasks that involve creating agents or interacting with third-party tools.The ability to integrate Mistral AI into various systems and services could make the model highly appealing to consumer-facing apps and tools. Fore example, it can make it super easy for developers to set up different agents that interact with each other, search the web or specialized databases for information, write reports, or brainstorm ideas—all without sending personal data to centralized firms like Google or OpenAI.While Mistral did not provide benchmarks, the enhancements suggest improved performance over the previous version—potentially four times more capable based on vocabulary and token context capacity. Coupled with the vastly broadened capabilities function calling brings, the upgrade is a compelling release for the second most popular open-source AI LLM model on the market.Cohere releases Aya 23, a family of multilingual modelsIn addition to Mistral's release, Cohere, a Canadian AI startup, unveiled Aya 23, a family of open-source LLMs also competing with the likes of OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral. Cohere is known for its focus on multilingual applications, and as the number in its name, Aya 23, telegraphs, it was trained to be proficient on 23 different languages.This slate of languages is intended to be able to serve nearly half of the world's population, a bid toward more inclusive AI.The model outperforms its predecessor, Aya 101, and other widely used models such as Mistral 7B v2 (not the newly released v3) and Google's Gemma in both discriminative and generative tasks. For example, Cohere claims Aya 23 demonstrates a 41% improvement over the previous Aya 101 models in multilingual MMLU tasks, a synthetic benchmark that measures how good a model's general knowledge is.Aya 23 is available in two sizes: 8 billion (8B) and 35 billion (35B) parameters. The smaller model (8B) is optimized for use on consumer-grade hardware, while the larger model (35B) offers top-tier performance across various tasks but requires more powerful hardware.Cohere says Aya 23 models are fine-tuned using a diverse multilingual instruction dataset—55.7 million examples from 161 different datasets—encompassing human-annotated, translated, and synthetic sources. This comprehensive fine-tuning process ensures high-quality performance across a wide array of tasks and languages.In generative tasks like translation and summarization, Cohere claims that its Aya 23 models outperform their predecessors and competitors, citing a variety of benchmarks and metrics like spBLEU translation tasks and RougeL summarization. Some new architectural changes—rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), grouped-query attention (GQA), and SwiGLU fine-tuning functions—brought improved efficiency and effectiveness.The multilingual basis of Aya 23 ensures the models are well-equipped for various real-world applications and makes them a well-honed tool for multilingual AI projects.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

On-chain derivatives need more capital efficiency to rival centralized exchanges: SynFutures CEO - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            On-chain derivatives trading volume registered an all-time high in March when it reached nearly $317 billion. Rachel Lin, co-founder and CEO of the decentralized exchange for perpetuals trading (perp DEX) SynFutures, highlighted to Crypto Briefing that there are still capital efficiency problems hindering perp DEXs’ growth despite recent developments.Lin explained that the current AMM models struggle to compete with centralized exchanges’ order books: despite offering better transparency, they struggle to address high slippage when liquidity is low, which is a big concern for investors.“Like the previous versions, SynFutures V3 introduces an upgrade that majorly impacts liquidity providers (LPs) and traders. The new version comes with a new AMM model called Oyster AMM (or oAMM), allowing LPs to provide concentrated liquidity for any derivative pair listed on the platform. In SynFutures’ V1 & V2, LPs can already provide single-token liquidity, but with the new AMM, LPs will also be able to provide single-token concentrated liquidity, ie. liquidity that is concentrated within specific price ranges.” This new feature could improve capital efficiency for liquidity providers and get them higher returns while decreasing slippage for traders, Lin added.Increasing regulatory scrutiny is crashing volumesAlthough on-chain derivatives trading volumes showed a solid performance in March, this momentum seems to be cooling down, as trading volumes in May just surpassed $175 billion. This movement could be tied to increased scrutiny from government organizations, highlighted Lin, mentioning the SEC’s recent movements against Coinbase and Uniswap. “In early March, we saw Bitcoin break above the heights that it made more than 2 years ago. Ethereum inflows sustained that upward trend and altcoins were seeing big gains as well. All of that momentum no doubt snowballed and carried over into the on-chain derivatives market, among other sectors,” shared Lin.Blast plays a key role in on-chain tradingEthereum layer-2 (L2) blockchain Blast has been a key ecosystem for on-chain derivatives trading in the past weeks, dominating the volume for most of April and now fighting toe-to-toe with Arbitrum for such dominance.Lin is optimistic about Blast’s landscape, underscoring SynFutures’ being one of the founding projects on “what could become one of the biggest L2s.” Nevertheless, the perp DEX’s CEO stated that they plan to deploy their platform on different chains, in an effort to keep their significant share of on-chain trading volume.“New DEXs are entering the space and deploying on new chains on a biweekly if not weekly basis, so volume numbers are in constant flux. One chain will be on top one day and the other may be on top the next. SynFutures is a multichain DEX, so while V3 launched on Blast, we’re exploring deployment on other L2s in the near future.”

Pepe 69 (PEPE69) Will Rally 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe 69 (PEPE69) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe 69 (PEPE69), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe 69 presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe 69 has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe 69 could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Pepe 69 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe 69 on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe 69 by entering its contract address – EvevUFVUUFR2NZVSkVzRTj1SQ6KRKdsZqdkpWinkh8m1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPE69.

Solana Dev Who Got Burned Up in Meme Coin Stunt Is Alive-And Wants Another Dare - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Solana meme coin creator who suffered third-degree burns across a large portion of his body this week took to Twitter to confirm that he’s alive—and looking to return to the project in a week.Mikol, as he’s called, got the burns while performing livestreamed stunts to try and pump the price of his token.“We are alive, we have not given up on you,” the dev said from his ICU bed, visibly burnt after being pelted with fireworks. “I’ll probably be here for another three days, but right after that, you’re going to see me right back in Miami. You’re going to see me right back and better—more motivated and more hungry than ever.”Mikol confirmed in a voice note sent to Decrypt that he suffered second and third-degree burns across a large portion of his body, with his left hand and shoulders being the worst affected.Since being in the hospital, Mikol said that he has been pumped with oxycodone, morphine, codeine, and fentanyl to help deal with the pain. He must constantly stretch to prevent his skin from healing too tightly, and is beginning physical therapy soon. He told Decrypt that this is the least he’s been in pain since the incident.“This hospital bill is gonna rack the fuck up,” he said in a voice note. “They’re trying to keep me here for a week and a half.”In the early hours of Wednesday, Mikol doused himself in isopropyl alcohol and livestreamed fireworks being shot at him in an attempt to pump his TruthOrDare (DARE) token. This resulted in the meme coin creator being rushed to hospital with third-degree burns, after going up in flames without proper fire safety precautions.Mikol’s fiery stunt is the latest in a series of meme coin creators who are turning to livestreamed antics to draw in potential investors. Part “Jackass” shenanigans and part performance art, such streams have seen users perform sexually suggestive acts with a family member, for example, or pretend to have no hands before “rugging” the community by selling tokens.Some Telegram users speculated that the dev had died, but those close to him soon confirmed that he was in a stable condition recovering in a Miami trauma center. In the day that followed, there was mostly silence coming from his camp. Now two days later, Mikol has released a video to his community, and is communicating with his Telegram moderators.“This is what I’ve always wanted to do. You see me doing it passionately everyday,” Mikol said, his voice hoarse. “I can’t let my community down, my family down.”TruthOrDare had been running for six days prior to the incident. Mikol had been performing dares that his community put to him, including things like drinking bong water or setting his pants on fire.The token had been declining from a high reached a few days prior, so he planned to do something crazy to pump the price—and evidently, things went too far. From that previous high, the coin is now up 55%, but at the cost of a rising hospital bill.“I’ve been told you guys [the DARE community] have been putting in effortless work,” Mikol said. “I couldn’t be more happy with the people I’m doing this with.”Since this incident, core community members have banded together to support the DARE dev. People who have made profits or simply feel bad have donated money to Mikol’s wallet; at the time of writing, 12 SOL (about $2,000) has been transferred since the incident. On top of this, a passionate DARE investor known as DLuxx said he visited Mikol at the hospital to physically give him cash and send his best wishes.“I went last night to the hospital to bring him some cash, ‘cause Solana doesn’t help when you are in the hospital.” DLuxx told Decrypt, “It was late to visit and there was a lot of family there dealing with the situation, so we respected their privacy. Mikol asked me to come back, and my plan is to visit him later this afternoon.”Now, the community is attempting to push the TruthOrDare vision forward by streaming themselves. DLuxx was the first to livestream. During the Telegram livestream, he met a homeless man named Dillon, who did some skateboard tricks while DLuxx begged him to not hurt himself.

Top CEOs and Analysts Announce Altcoins That Could Launch ETFs After Ethereum - Bitcoin Sistemi

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has greenlit 19b-4 forms for eight spot Ethereum ETFs from leading companies like BlackRock and Fidelity. However, approval of other spot crypto ETFs may be a more challenging journey.
Former White House Communications Director and managing partner of alternative investment firm SkyBridge, Anthony Scaramucci, expressed optimism that a Solana ETF is next. Following the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, Scaramucci confidently said, “A SOL ETF is coming, get ready.”


Brian Kelly, a host on CNBC, speculated about the chances of an ETF for Solana, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. “Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are probably the big three for this cycle,” he said, suggesting Solana could be the next big thing.

Kelly's comments echoed those of Joe McCann, a Solana investor and founder, CEO and CIO of crypto fund Asymmetric. McCann believes that if another ETF is approved, it will be Solana. However, he also acknowledged potential problems for Solana and other cryptocurrencies, noting that the Coinbase case used language that could affect future approvals.





McCann highlighted Dogecoin as another potential competitor for an ETF, given its similarities to Bitcoin's launch and its status as “definitely not a security.” Litecoin has also attracted attention for similar reasons.
However, from a regulatory perspective, while Dogecoin and Litecoin may be more suitable options, the financial obligation required to launch a Litecoin ETF may be a deterrent for issuers.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs Rake In Nine Consecutive Days of Inflows Totaling Over $1,750,000,000 - The Daily Hodl


								New data reveals that spot market Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have brought in nine straight days of inflows totaling over $1 billion dollars.
According to data from London-based investment firm Farside Investors, BTC ETFs have seen positive inflows every day since May 14th, totaling more than $1.75 billion.










May 15th and May 21st marked the days with the largest inflows, as they saw $303 million and $305.7 million, respectively.
The data also unveils that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the only BTC ETF that saw outflows during the nine-day period. On May 14th, it saw $50.9 million worth of outflows while on May 22nd and May 23rd, it saw $16.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively.
Furthermore, according to Farside, the single biggest instance of incoming funds was on May 21st, when the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a staggering $290 million worth of inflows.
Spot market BTC ETFs were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year after years of rejection when a judge ruled that the regulatory body must reconsider its stance to remain consistent with previous rulings.
BTC ETFs give consumers exposure to the top crypto asset by market cap without them having to directly purchase it.
Earlier this month, it was found that the largest US hedge funds combined to accumulate over $2.6 billion worth of BTC ETFs.
“Twelve of the largest 25 US hedge funds collectively have over $2.6 billion Bitcoin ETF exposure. Eleven of the largest 25 Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) also have exposure. All while Bitcoin is just a $1 trillion asset class.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $68,122 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Feeling Lucky? Google AI Search Advice Could Kill You - Decrypt

Google's newly released AI-powered search results are garnering lots of attention—for the wrong reasons. After the tech behemoth announced a host of new AI-powered tools last week as part of a new “Gemini Era,” its trademark web search results changed significantly, with natural language answers to questions displayed above websites.“In the past year, we've answered billions of queries as part of the search-generated experience,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the audience. “People are using it to search in entirely new ways and asking new types of questions longer and more complex queries, even searching with photos, and getting back the best the web has to offer.”The answers, however, can be incomplete, incorrect, or even dangerous—whether wading into eugenics or failing to identify a poisonous mushroom.Image: @tkingfisher on ThreadsMany of the "AI Overview" answers are pulled from social media and even satirical sites where wrong answers were the whole point. Google users have shared countless problematic responses they received from Google’s AI.When told, “I'm feeling depressed,” Google reportedly said one of the ways to deal with depression was  “jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.”Another asked, “If I run off a cliff, can I stay in the air so long as I don’t look down?” Citing a cartoon-inspired Reddit thread, Google's "AI Overview" confirmed the gravity-defying capability.The strong representation of Reddit threads among the examples follows a deal announced earlier this year that Google would use Reddit’s data to make it easier “to discover and access the communities and conversations people are looking for.” Earlier this month, ChatGPT developer OpenAI similarly announced that it would be licensing data from Reddit.In another instance of absurd answers, a Google user asked, “How many rocks should a child eat?” to which Google’s AI responded with “at least one small rock a day,” citing a “UC Berkeley geologist.”Many of the most absurd and remarked upon examples have since been removed or corrected by Google. Google did not immediately respond to a request to comment from Decrypt.An ongoing issue with generative AI models is A penchant to make up answers, or “hallucinate.” Hallucinations are reasonably characterized as lies because the AI is making up something that is not true. However, in cases like Reddit-sourced answers, the AI didn’t lie—it simply took the information provided by its sources at face value.Thanks to a Reddit comment that's more than a decade old, Google’s AI reportedly said adding glue to cheese is a good way to keep it from sliding off a pizza.OpenAI's flagship AI model, ChatGPT, has a long history of making up facts, including wrongfully accusing law professor Jonathan Turley of sexual assault last April, citing a trip he did not take.The AI’s overconfidence has apparently declared everything on the internet as real, laid blame for the debacle at the feet of a former Google exec, and adjudicated the company's own guilt in the area of anti-trust law.The feature has certainly sparked humor and bemusement as users pepper Google with pop-culture queries.But the recommended daily allowance for rock intake by children has been updated, instead noting that “curiosity, sensory processing difficulties, or an eating disorder” could be responsible for such a diet.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Ethereum spot ETF approval is here - Everything you need to know - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Spot Ethereum ETFs have finally received the greenlight after a period of uncertainty. Thursday’s approval not only marked a milestone for Ethereum but also a positive development in the US regulatory approach to crypto. This article will provide more insights into the recent approval, its potential motivation, and implications for the industry.An overview of spot Ethereum ETF approvalOn May 23, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the 19b-4 forms associated with eight spot Ethereum ETFs. These include Blackrock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, VanEck Ethereum Trust, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, Franklin Ethereum ETF, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.The latest approval follows the debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US in January. However, unlike Bitcoin ETFs, the Ethereum products still need S-1 form approval to fully operate, which is pending review now.As reported by Crypto Briefing, the securities watchdog recently started engaging with ETF issuers on S-1 forms. This development likewise confirmed some previous speculation that the SEC lacked interaction with the issuers during the review process.Considering previous cases, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimates that it may take the SEC up to five months to clear the spot Ethereum funds for trading. However, the analyst suggests that the timeline can be extended.Key factors influencing approvalAccording to the SEC’s approval document, the correlation between Ethereum futures and spot markets was one of the key factors influencing the decision.Notably, the SEC conducted its own analysis to verify the correlation results provided by Bitwise’s amendments and other commenters, including the Coinbase Letter and CF Benchmarks Letters. The SEC’s findings confirmed the high correlations reported, indicating a robust linkage between the CME Ethereum futures and spot Ethereum markets.Other considerations addressed in the approval document include investor protection, market integrity, volatility, and risk concerns.However, Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, claimed that the SEC might “explicitly avoid staking” in its document.There have been ongoing discussions surrounding the SEC’s stance on Ethereum’s staking feature. Analysts believe that the removal of the staking component, or the affirmation of no staking in Ethereum ETF filings is as important as other key factors influencing the decision.Major firms such as Fidelity and ARK 21Shares initially included staking provisions in their filings with the SEC. However, ahead of the SEC’s decision deadline, these firms amended their filings to eliminate any references to staking.While there have been no further comments from the ETF issuers, these removals were likely in response to the SEC’s stance that staking services could be viewed as unregistered securities offerings.Historically, the SEC has demonstrated a cautious approach to staking services.For instance, the SEC alleged that Kraken’s staking program, where users deposit crypto assets to stake and earn rewards, was an unregistered securities offering in violation of US securities laws. The lawsuit ended with Kraken’s $30 million settlement with the SEC. The firm subsequently discontinued its staking service for US retail customers.Another case is the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase in June 2023. The agency also alleged that Coinbase’s retail staking services were securities.Why does Ethereum ETF approval matter?The SEC’s green light for spot Ethereum ETFs hints at, but doesn’t definitively confirm, their stance on the underlying asset, Ethereum (ETH).Rumors have swirled that the SEC considers most cryptos, except Bitcoin, to be unregistered securities. This aligns with statements from SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, the recent ETF approval offers a potential counterpoint.Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, and Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, interpret the recent approval as an implicit nod to ETH’s status as a commodity, given that the ETF shares are based on a commodity.“This week, this day, has been a rollercoaster unlike any other I’ve seen. ETH is effectively deemed a Commodity as we’ve always known it to be,” Grewal stated.“…it’s clear: “commodity-based trust shares,” Chervinsky noted.Why might delegated authority not matter?The approval of the spot Ethereum ETFs was issued via delegated authority, which eliminates the need for public commissioner votes. This arrangement raises concerns because it allows any commissioner the technical right to challenge and request a review of the decision.However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said a review request would likely not alter the outcome.According to him, the SEC commissioners would not permit the Trading and Markets division to issue such an approval unless a majority of them supported the decision. This consensus among the commissioners suggests a strong foundational agreement on the approval.In essence, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs under delegated authority indicates that the launch of these ETFs is imminent.The possibility of enforcement action against Ethereum-linked entitiesThe recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs came as a welcome surprise, especially given the SEC’s alleged legal threats against Ethereum-associated entities such as the Ethereum Foundation and Consensys.The agency had reportedly initiated a campaign to classify Ethereum (ETH) as a security—a move many believed would undermine the prospects for approving Ethereum-based ETFs.This backdrop, combined with a lack of engagement reported by insiders and a generally pessimistic outlook from ETF issuers and experts, made the favorable decision on May 23 particularly unexpected.Experts had speculated that the SEC was reluctant to approve ETFs tied to ETH because it wanted to classify the crypto as a security. However, the prevailing political climate in the US appears to have influenced the SEC to alter its stance and approve these ETFs.Nevertheless, this approval does not mean that the entities involved are completely off the hook. The SEC might still treat the sale of ETH tokens during Ethereum’s 2014 ICO as an “investment contract.”If this is the case, it likely reflects the Ripple-SEC legal lawsuit, in which the SEC alleged that the sale of XRP between 2013 and 2020 represented an “investment contract.”According to a court ruling last year, XRP sales on the secondary market did not constitute an “investment contract,” but the institutional sales were deemed unregistered offers and sales of investment contracts under the Howey test.Apart from these possibilities, in a less likely scenario, the SEC might not intend to sue the entities.The recent legal threats, including one targeting Uniswap, might be a strategy to intimidate or pressure crypto companies, rather than a genuine reflection of wrongdoing. This view was previously supported by Chervinsky.

An Upcoming Altcoin Allegedly Stole the Name of Another Popular Altcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


The fact that the zkSync (ZK) altcoin, which will be listed on the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit in the coming period, will receive the ZK ticker owned by another altcoin, Polyhedra Network, was not welcomed by some segments of the community.
Polyhedra Network will no longer be able to be bought and sold on Bybit with the ZK ticker.


However, Polyhedra developers accused zkSync altcoin developers of stealing their tickers in their statement. However, there are many people who think that Polyhedra does not deserve the ZK ticker anyway.

Polyhedra Network was previously known as ZKbridge and had the ticker ZKB. However, it later changed its ticker to ZK after the altcoin was listed on OKX.





Polyhedra developers criticized the situation in their statement on social media platform X:

“It is incredible that even with the approval of the ETH ETF, there are still projects in 2024 that offer advantages to various parties and take away the ticker that others deserve.
Web3 should never have been a breeding ground for bullying.
We believe the community understands the true meaning of equity and justice.
Let's see who will support such abuses and who will be the defender of justice and righteousness.
“You did a great job as a robber and thief, not as a blockchain founder.”

FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg to Resign Amid Toxic Workplace Investigation



                    

Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), will step down following a scathing investigation revealing a toxic workplace culture at the agency.



On May 20, Gruenberg announced his intention to resign from his position as chair, a role he has held since August 2005. 




He stated in an email to staff, “In light of recent events, I am prepared to step down from my responsibilities once a successor is confirmed. 



Until that time, I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities as Chairman of the FDIC, including the transformation of the FDIC’s workplace culture.”



The FDIC, an independent U.S. government agency, provides insurance for depositors in American commercial and savings banks.




The announcement follows a third-party investigation published on May 7, which uncovered allegations of sexual harassment and other misconduct at the FDIC, as well as the management’s inadequate response to these issues.



On May 15, Gruenberg testified before Congress regarding the widespread allegations of sexual harassment and mistreatment of subordinates. 



Both Republicans and Democrats expressed their outrage and disbelief at the severity of the issues within the FDIC, as reported by Reuters. 



Lawmakers, including Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, have called for his resignation and urged President Biden to appoint a new FDIC chair.




The White House has confirmed its intention to nominate a successor for the position.

However, Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed confidence in Gruenberg’s ability to initiate change at the agency.



Gruenberg’s impending resignation has been well-received by the crypto community. Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, celebrated the news, calling it “the best day ever.”



Meanwhile, digital asset industry lawyer John Deaton criticized Warren, saying, “It is shameful how Elizabeth Warren circled the wagons to keep one of her disgraced puppets in place. I’m so looking forward to the debates.”



Gruenberg is believed to have played a key role in Operation Choke Point 2.0, a term coined by Nic Carter in 2023. 



This refers to a coordinated effort by the FDIC to discourage banks from holding crypto deposits or providing banking services to crypto firms.



In an October 2022 speech, Gruenberg compared crypto assets to risky financial innovations like subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.

Coinbase Presses for a New Appeal Against SEC | Bankless


Crypto exchange giant Coinbase just filed a motion for an interlocutory appeal in its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), challenging the agency's authority over certain crypto transactions.What's the scoop?Coinbase has asked for a higher court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, to decide if digital asset transactions without post-sale obligations to the original issuer qualify as investment contracts under SEC regulation. The move comes on the heels of a judge's rejection of Coinbase's initial attempt to dismiss the SEC's case against it. In that ruling, Judge Katherine Failla said buying a token on a platform involves buying into that token's digital ecosystem, not just the token itself.In its new motion, Coinbase pointed to a division between lawmakers and the SEC, particularly following the recent FIT21 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives.Ultimately, Coinbase is seeking to challenge whether digital asset transactions not involving formal contracts can be regulated as "investment contracts" by the SEC.Bankless takeThe passing of FIT21 in the House certainly provides ammunition to Coinbase’s motion, which could even extend to Consensys’s ongoing SEC lawsuit as well. Given that the motion's particular issue is clarifying whether the SEC will regulate digital asset transactions as investment contracts that don’t involve anything contractual, and how the implications of this are huge, it's also hard to imagine that U.S. lawmakers won't be watching this case closely going forward. In the meantime, only time will tell if Coinbase's new appeal will be heard.

Trump Embraces Crypto Donations: Could It Alter Digital Asset Playing Field? - Benzinga

Ex-President Donald Trump made headlines when he announced that his 2024 presidential campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations. This move marks a major shift in his stance on digital currencies (he previously called Bitcoin a scam). The twice-impeached and quadruple-indicted Republican is also the first major presidential candidate to embrace crypto for fundraising purposes (although independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been accepting Bitcoin donations for months).Trump’s pivot comes as his campaign looks to draw support from voters who have grown disgruntled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Biden administration for its strict stance on cryptocurrency companies.Trump’s camp also sees cryptocurrency as a means to raise money for his legal bills. This strategy counters the anti-crypto sentiment often associated with President Joe Biden and other Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren.The White House did outline a regulatory framework for the crypto industry in 2022 that stressed “commonsense efficiency standards for cryptocurrency mining.”See Also: ‘The Real Loser Here Is Melania,’ Jimmy Kimmel Pokes Fun At Trump’s Financial WoesImplications for the Crypto MarketThe campaign's announcement highlighted that contributions could be made in various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Experts are divided on the impact of Trump's move. David Hoffman, co-owner at Bankless, suggests that the former president's interest in crypto might be superficial. In contrast, Ryan Selkis, CEO of Messari Crypto, viewed the development positively, noting Trump's recent influence on the crypto market and regulatory environment. Trump has benefited significantly from cryptocurrency. He has received millions in cryptocurrency from NFT projects that bear his photoshopped likeness; sold at least 1,075 ETH for $2.4 million in proceeds; and tapped Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey on a “day 1” cryptocurrency policy.Future of Digital Assets Event in NYCThe broader implications of Trump’s decision and the evolving role of digital assets will be explored at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event in New York City on November 19. This one-day gathering will feature industry leaders, investors, and policymakers discussing digital asset trends and future directions. The event promises to offer valuable discussions and networking opportunities, bringing together over 1,000 capital markets leaders for a day of meetings, executive roundtables, and panel discussions.The event will cover various topics, including the state of digital asset adoption, risk and security in the industry, and integrating digital assets into investment portfolios. Panels will explore the unintended consequences of regulations, the future of NFTs and metaverses, and the role of digital assets in the fourth industrial revolution. Attendees will also have the chance to engage in small group discussions with executives and thought leaders, gaining deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities in the digital assets space.Now Read: Historians Compare Trump’s Usage Of  Hitler-Phrase ‘Vermin’ To Autocratic RhetoricImage: Shutterstock
