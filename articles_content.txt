SBF maintains his innocence as he trades rice in jail

FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried still maintains his innocence despite getting 25 years in jail for fraud and while he plans his appeal, he’s taken to commodities trading — namely bags of rice.In his first in-person chat with the media since being locked up in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in August 2023, Bankman-Fried spoke to Puck News’ William Cohan in an interview published May 9 which Bankman-Fried’s mother Barbara Fried was involved in organizing.The ex-FTX CEO’s diet sees him get vegan meals that fellow inmates think “literally [smell] like shit” so he lives on beans and rice — the latter has “become one of the currencies of the realm inside MDC.”The alum of trading house Jane Street Capital and co-founder of trading firm Alameda Research reportedly joked about how much better the arbitrage opportunities are in jail compared to his former life as a high-frequency trader.Bankman-Fried was “considerably thinner,” losing 25 pounds (11 kilograms) and was “less pudgy, less manic, less fidgety," with no bags under his eyes, Puck reported.He looked Cohan in the eyes “pretty much the whole time," during the interview — something he “rarely did” before — but the jailed founder admitted he’d “become good at faking” that he was doing well.Source: Tiffany FongBankman-Fried is cordoned off with 35 other male inmates — half reportedly murderers who are cooperating with the government — in a large open dorm-style room in a part of the MDC mostly for female inmates. He’s reportedly extremely bored with only four TVs and a non-internet-connected tablet for entertainment which he plays games on.He’s not worried about his safety but doesn’t sleep well as other inmates wake him to ask about his bags of rice as they want to use them for bartering.SBF thinks he’s “the fall guy”Last month, Bankman-Fried filed notice that he’s appealing his fraud and money laundering conviction, something his lawyers said he’d do when found guilty in November.He speaks to his new lawyer “nearly every weekday for an hour or so” and his approved prescription medication has him “thinking clearly," said Cohan. The former exchange head told Cohan he was “set up to be the fall guy” for the collapse of FTX — saying his only slip-up was negligence that put FTX in a place “vulnerable to a bank run and the devious actions of its competitors” adding a reasonable punishment would be civil, not criminal penalties.Related: Changpeng Zhao gets 4 months, Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years — Why? Cohan noted Bankman-Fried “still doesn’t believe he committed any crimes” and painted himself as an innocent participant who didn’t get a chance to negotiate sufficiently with prosecutors.He was also “not exactly apologetic” about the roughly $8 billion in customer funds he was convicted of helping to misappropriate.Bankman-Fried claims the army of lawyers that he passed FTX off to, pinned him for the collapse of the firm. The former CEO believed if he stayed at FTX’s helm, it would not have collapsed into bankruptcy but would instead be a thriving company worth $80 billion.He added he should’ve tried harder to find someone other than ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison to lead Alameda after his lawyers convinced him it was a conflict of interest to run the trading firm and FTX simultaneously — or just ignored them and continued to run both.Bankman-Fried has asked to stay at the MDC until he files his appeal which should come in July. He can, however, be moved at any time and will likely be placed in a facility near his parents — on the other side of the country in California.If that happens, it’s reportedly likely to be in a prison bus which can take up to four months as it journeys across the United States, which picks up and drops off inmates as it goes.Magazine: Inner City Press says ‘less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: X Hall of Flame

                        Arch Labs has secured a $7 million investment to develop a Bitcoin-native application platform.The seed funding round was led by Multicoin Capital with other participants and contributors including Portal Ventures, OKX Ventures, Big Brain Holdings, CMS Holdings, Tangent, Cypher, and Newman Capital.Bridgeless Bitcoin-Native Network
The company planned to utilize this fund to advance Arch’s development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, bypassing the need for secondary layers or bridges.The reliance on secondary layers often complicates the user experience and compromise the inherent security benefits of operating directly on the Bitcoin network.“Ordinals marked a foundational shift in Bitcoin’s evolution. It signaled the beginning of a new era where Bitcoin could serve as more than just a payment ledger,” said Arch co-founder and CEO Matt Mudano.“This moment paved the way for Arch,” stated Mudano. “We’re building on Bitcoin’s unmatched security and liquidity to unlock an entirely new application ecosystem on the world’s more secure and liquid blockchain.”The funds were raised primarily for the expansion of the platform’s development team. By bringing on additional skilled developers, Arch Labs aims to accelerate the creation and refinement of decentralized applications.
Arch’s Features and Rollout Plan
Arch is a parallelized, proof-of-stake that features a Rust-based zkVM, known as the ArchVM, and a decentralized verifier network, forming a trustless execution environment within the blockchain.“We’ve evaluated several Bitcoin Layer 2’s and all of them make the same set of trade offs that sacrifice security in exchange for speed,” said Multicoin Capital Investment Principal Vishal Kankani.“Arch is explicitly not a Layer 2 in the sense that takers do not have to bridge assets to some untrusted chain to use it,” said Kankani.In addition to expanding its team, Arch Labs is set on launching a public development network (devnet) followed by a mainnet release scheduled for the latter half of the year.This progression will enable early testers and future users to explore the capabilities of the platform, improving stability and functionality before a full-scale public rollout.

Japanese Financial Giant Starts Running XRP Ledger Validator


SBI VC Trade, the cryptocurrency exchange of Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings, has announced the launch of their validator on the XRP Ledger.With its recent move, SBI aims to reflect the voices of its customers who hold the XRP cryptocurrency, according to the company’s announcement. Vet, operator of the XRP Ledger dUNL, has stressed that this is a “huge step” since a large enterprise is now running infrastructure for the XRP Ledger. Ripple initially partnered with SBI back in 2017. It has also offered year-end benefits for shareholders in the XRP cryptocurrency.In 2023, SBI Remit, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, expanded its XRP-powered services to several countries, including Vietnam and the Philippines. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has repeatedly touted Japan as one of the most cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdictions. In 2020, he even suggested that Ripple’s headquarters could be relocated to Tokyo before the SEC took the company to court. In April, Ripple expanded its presence in Japan by announcing a tie-up with Tokyo-based HashKey DX. The aim of the collaboration is to use the XRP Ledger for developing enterprise solutions for customers in Japan.

Notcoin Listing Triggers Over 11% Spike in Toncoin


OKX and Binance, two leading global crypto exchanges, recently announced the Notcoin (NOT) listing on their respective platforms.
The crypto community expressed their enthusiasm following these announcements.
Will Notcoin Enhance the TON Blockchain Ecosystem?
OKX will use its platform for new crypto projects, Jumpstart, to let Toncoin (TON) holders stake their coins for NOT tokens. They have set a staking limit of 4,000 TON per participant. The staking process will start at 06:00 UTC on May 13, 2024.
Binance Launchpool has also introduced Notcoin as its 54th project. Users can farm NOT by staking BNB and First Digital USD (FDUSD). The farming will start on May 13, 2024, at 00.00 UTC.

Notcoin, a community token within the TON Blockchain, gained initial popularity from a viral tap-to-earn game on Telegram. This game has 35 million participants. It also has engaged users and introduced them to Web3 technologies.
Notcoin is now focusing on building an ecosystem. The current focus includes a gaming platform and Web3 project exploration tools.
However, the official launch date for Notcoin remains unannounced. Yet, its listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap suggest the launch is imminent.
This development has positively impacted Toncoin, the TON Blockchain’s native token. Its price increased by about 11.32% in the last 24 hours, trading at $6.57 at the time of writing.

Besides the much-anticipated launch of Notcoin, TON Blockchain has been making headlines lately, notably due to its partnership spree. Among the significant developments is the substantial investment from Pantera Capital. Although the amount is undisclosed, Pantera Capital claimed that TON is their “largest investment ever.”
In a recent blog post, Pantera Capital’s CEO, Dan Morehead, articulated his views on blockchain’s transformative potential—influenced partly by his interactions with Telegram founder Pavel Durov. Morehead highlighted Durov’s commitment to principles of freedom and openness, which are foundational to the Telegram platform and, by extension, to the TON Blockchain.

“We are honored to partner with people of such strong conviction. Pantera recently made the largest investment in its history in TON,” Morehead stated.


Ryan Barney, a partner at Pantera Capital, also shared his thoughts. He further explained the rationale for their TON investment.

“Telegram is a community integrating blockchain technology. That’s just got to be easier. They’ve begun rolling out a blockchain wallet to their 930 million users,” Barney outlined.

The crypto and Web3 sectors have shown increased interest in gaming-themed tokens. For instance, Binance’s listing of SAGA, a native token of layer-1 (L1) gaming blockchain Saga, attracted significant attention. Saga claimed that over $13 billion worth of BNB and FDUSD got staked within 24 hours of its launch on Binance Launchpool.

Venture capital also continues to shape the Web3 gaming niche. Massive investments from firms like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in Web3 gaming projects highlight the industry’s renewed interest.

Russian opposition activist launches zero-knowledge voting app to challenge Putin's inauguration - Crypto Briefing




Russian opposition activist and former Pussy Riot lawyer Mark Feygin has launched a referendum on the zero-knowledge voting app Russia2024, challenging the legitimacy of the recent Russian elections and Vladimir Putin’s inauguration as president.The vote, which went live on May 10th, three days after Putin’s inauguration, is the first protest vote on the app following months of audits and stress tests.Russia2024 was built using Rarimo’s Freedom Tool, an open-source, surveillance-free voting solution that leverages blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography to ensure citizens can poll, vote, and protest without being tracked. The app was first announced in a broadcast on March 9, 2024.Following the announcement, the Kremlin attempted to obstruct the app by filing against it, temporarily removing it from the Apple store, and sponsoring negative reviews, a strategy exposed by a whistleblower who expressed support for the app.“Dissent in Russia is growing more risky and public opinion harder to track. It is critical that we provide reliable, surveillance-proof avenues for protest and polling. Russia2024 and its underlying technology has enabled that,” Feygin said in a press release shared with Crypto Briefing.The app was developed by Kyiv-based Rarilabs, with key contributions from activist developers working anonymously inside regimes around the world. Rarilabs is a privacy-first social protocol backed by Pantera Capital. In 2022, the company raised $10 million at a $100 million valuation for its Series A funding round.According to the project’s whitepaper, the app uses Russia’s machine-readable passport information submitted by a user.The data is then decrypted and verified locally (on a device). Digital identity, once authenticated, is resolved using a generated keypair, which is then used to interact with the app’s smart contract. The image below illustrates how the app works.Zero-knowledge cryptography severs the link between the pass and passport data, and votes are published directly on Arbitrum, an Ethereum L2, where the data then becomes tamper-proof.“Freedom Tool was built to help give a voice to people living in regimes. Its implementation in Russia is an early example of how blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography can meet the urgent need around the world for privacy technology,” said Lasha Antadze, co-founder of Rarilabs.Antadze previously worked on the Ukrainian government’s e-identity and digitalization reform, as well as the EU’s Stork 2.0 digital signature standardization.

Japanese company Metaplanet acquires an additional 19.87 BTC Worth 200 Million Yen | Cryptopolitan

The Japanese company Metaplanet made headlines after acquiring close to 20 BTC in what looked like Microstrategy’s approach to accumulating Bitcoin. Metaplanet Inc. has embarked on an aggressive approach to buying and holding Bitcoin. Considering this recent purchase, Metaplanet Inc. has a total of 117.7 Bitcoins, currently valued at approximately $7.3 million. Metaplanet’s Inc. is a large investment and consulting firm in the heart of Tokyo, and its decision to aggressively purchase Bitcoins is a clear indicator of a shift in investment strategy. Understanding the Magnitude of Metaplanet’s BTC investmentDepending on who’s reading this, a $6.5 million investment in Bitcoin could represent a significant investment or not. The company’s decision to invest this much in Bitcoin is better understood by looking at its total market cap. Reportedly, the Japanese company’s Bitcoin holdings now account for approximately 33% of its total market capitalization. This is a significant investment in Metaplanet’s books, indicating how valuable the Japanese company perceives Bitcoin. The Japanese Investment and Consulting company follows in the footsteps of pro-Bitcoin corporations like Microstrategy, which have also continued accumulating Bitcoin as part of their primary asset holdings. Metaplanet’s Grand Plan with BitcoinTokyo’s financial institution has completely embraced the corporate Bitcoin standard. Dylan LeClair, who recently joined the company as the Director of Bitcoin Strategy, shared how the company will strategically leverage public capital markets to acquire additional Bitcoin for shareholders over time. According to Dylan, the financial repression in Japan has left investors with limited investment options to choose from. As a result, the company is looking for alternative options like Bitcoin to insulate its balance sheets from realities such as the structural weakness of the yen. The institution’s grand plan is not only to strengthen its balance sheets but also to capitalize on it. Bitcoin is viewed as a safer alternative to hedge against inflation, triggering corporations to explore its benefits. Larger institutions like Microstagey are leading the way. Metaplanet Inc. is looking to be a pioneer of corporate Bitcoin in Japan. The bold steps by the Japanese company set the stage for financial institutions alike to accept Bitcoin as a digital asset, impacting its balance sheets. As a result, the revolution continues to grow, and more investors get exposed to Bitcoin, leading to mass adoption as intended.

Eclipse Founder Accused of Sexual Misconduct, Steps Down


							

Neel Somani, the founder of Eclipse, has been accused of sexual harassment.



Somani maintained his innocence, adding that he never sexually assaulted anyone.



Somani is stepping down as the public face of Eclipse. 




Neel Somani, the founder of Eclipse, Ethereum’s fastest L2 solution powered by the Solana Virtual Machine, focused on privacy, security, and decentralization, has faced allegations of misconduct, ranging from inappropriate social media conduct to serious accusations of sexual assault. 



Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at crypto VC firm Dragonfly Capital, stated in an X post that his company passed on investing in Eclipse while conducting due diligence on the L2 solution. During the process, Dragonfly found a history of sexual harassment surrounding Somani. 









Qureshi concluded that the fact that Somani received funding and successfully sold millions in secondary for a pre-launch token despite his history is “embarrassing.”



On the other hand, Somani maintained his innocence, stating that he had never sexually assaulted a woman. He said that he’ll quit his role as the “public face” for Eclipse because it wouldn’t be fair to the team and the L2 solution “to have this situation weighing on their reputations,” adding:




“I’ll be temporarily reducing my role as a public face for Eclipse. The senior leaders at Eclipse are well equipped to take on these responsibilities and this will allow these conversations to unfold and the truth to emerge about these allegations.”




Further, in a statement, Eclipse stated that it “remains committed to maintaining the highest personal and professional standards, including gender equality and fair treatment.” The firm will closely monitor the situation and reveal details about the other senior members who are leading Eclipse.Eclipse co-founder Sam Thapaliya commented that his firm is “committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity and accountability” in all its operations.

Analysis of the crypto Qubic, Kaspa and Render

The crypto world is now extremely vast, and in this article we will analyze in particular the trends of Qubic, Kaspa and Render.

The recent performance of the crypto Qubic, Kaspa, and Render
Qubic is a new layer-1 project based on Proof-of-Work (PoW).
PoW is the consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin. Even Ethereum was initially based on PoW, but in September 2022 it switched to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).
Although initially most cryptocurrencies were based on PoW, now most of them are instead based on PoS, because it allows for greater scalability.
PoW, however, remains more secure, even though the level of security achieved by PoS is still high, and that’s why crypto projects based on PoW also survive. For example, Bitcoin is very unlikely to abandon it.
Qubic for example claims to be able to guarantee feeless transactions, even though it is based on PoW. It also claims to use artificial intelligence (AI).
The cryptocurrency QUBIC landed on the crypto markets at the end of 2023, with an initial price around 2.6 millionths of a dollar, although since the bull run had already started by then, the price rose to 5.4 thousandths already during the first week of presence on exchanges.
However, until early February it dropped, even significantly below the initial price, without benefiting from the December bull run. 
Nevertheless, starting from mid-February it began to benefit from the bullrun, rising up to 12.2 thousandths of a dollar. 
However, it was a speculative mini-bubble that burst starting from March. For example, when the price of Bitcoin reached its all-time high, Qbic had already dropped to 9 millionths of a dollar.
The price then continued to decrease, reaching the current 5.8 millionths. 
These seem to be predominantly speculative movements, and since Qbic only capitalizes half a billion dollars, it is possible that its price will remain volatile for a long time. 
At this moment it is difficult to imagine if the project has significant long-term development potential, and given the volatility at this moment its cryptocurrency should be considered a predominantly speculative asset. 
The trend of Kaspa 
Kaspa is also a crypto project based on PoW. 
However, this is a project that has been existing for almost two years, and so far it has grown almost constantly. 
His cryptocurrency KAS debuted on the crypto markets in May 2022, with an initial price of 0.2 thousandths of a dollar. 
Already in the course of the same 2022 it recorded a real first boom, with the price rising to over 9 thousandths of a dollar, and in 2023 the upward trend continued.
After the initial boom in 2022, it has recorded at least three more.
The second one was at the beginning of 2023, when taking advantage of the rebound in the crypto markets, the price of KAS even reached 37 cents. At that point, in less than a year, it had gained 18,000%. 
In light of this performance, it is possible to affirm that the initial price was widely underestimated, although surely the excellent start of 2023 for the crypto markets as a whole must have helped a lot. 
However, he then recorded two more booms, although with lower percentage gains. 
With the beginning of the bullrun, in October of last year, the price of KAS started to rise again, reaching 140 thousandths of a dollar ($0.14) in November. At that point, the initial +18,000% had added another +280%.
However, the crypto bullrun continued in 2024, and so in February the price of Kaspa rose to almost 180 cents of a dollar. 
Since then it has dropped a bit, even reaching below $0.14 in February. 
This trend suggests that the great bull run of Kaspa may have already run its course, and that it probably only served to bring KAS’s market capitalization to the level it deserved, above three billion dollars. 
This is a level comparable to Stellar’s XLM, and only slightly lower than that of CRO. In other words, although it is only in 38th place overall, Kaspa has now entered the ranks of the top 50 cryptocurrencies in the world. 
Prices and latest Render news
A different speech is instead the one concerning Render.
It is indeed a project born in 2020, before the last major bull run of the crypto markets.  
It does not have its own blockchain, but a token called RNDR on the Ethereum blockchain.
Although the price of this token has gone through the great bull run of 2021, its performance over time has remained extremely interesting.
The thing that stands out is that after reaching $7.8 in 2021, in the course of 2024 it managed to do better, setting a new all-time high in mid-March at $13.6. 
This is a remarkable performance, because while in mid-March Bitcoin set a new all-time high of about +6% compared to 2021, RNDR in 2024 performed even 74% better than 2021. 
Furthermore, having debuted on the crypto markets at 0.06$, the performance in 2021 was already remarkable: +13,000%.
It is also worth noting that during the bear market of 2022, the price only managed to return to $0.4, a figure much higher than the $0.1 it had before the start of the great bull run, and that before the start of the late 2023 bull run it had already returned to almost $2.5. 
So although it is a token with a decidedly volatile value, it seems to have an excellent long-term trend, at least up to now. 
It is no coincidence that it has a market capitalization of almost 4.4 billion dollars, which puts it ahead of Ethereum Classic and just slightly below UNI from Uniswap. 
It is difficult to say if this upward trend can last much longer, but for now its trend is definitely positive,

Prices and news of the crypto Solana, Dogecoin and Jupiter

Our column dedicated to the analysis of the crypto world is back: today we analyze three important assets, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Jupiter (JUP).

Prices and market statistics of the crypto Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Jupiter (JUP)
The current price of Solana (SOL) is 153.54 USD, marking an increase in the last hour of 0.76%, 5.87% in the last day, and 10.26% in the last week.
This performance shows a strong interest from investors towards Solana, placing it in fifth place in terms of popularity in the cryptocurrency market.
Its market capitalization is 68.9 billion USD, with a trading volume in the last 24 hours of 2.3 billion USD. The amount of SOL in circulation is 448.3 million units.
 Solana holders maintain their positions on average for 145 days, indicating a medium to long-term confidence in the project and its future prospects. The all-time high recorded for SOL was 260.00 USD, demonstrating that the currency has growth potential and can attract further investments. 
The current price of Dogecoin (DOGE) is 0.15 USD, showing an increase of 0.36% in the last hour, 2.63% in the last day, and 13.16% in the last week. 
This positive trend reflects a growing interest from investors in this cryptocurrency, ranked ninth in terms of popularity in the market. Dogecoin has a market capitalization of 21.8 billion USD and a trading volume in the last 24 hours of 1.1 billion USD.
 The circulating supply is 144.2 billion DOGE. Dogecoin holders maintain their positions on average for 85 days, indicating a moderate confidence in the currency. 
The all-time high for DOGE was 0.74 USD, suggesting that, despite its volatile nature, Dogecoin has the potential to reach higher valuations. 
The current price of Jupiter (JUP) is 1.11 USD, with a market capitalization of 1.5 billion USD. These data indicate a stable presence in the cryptocurrency market. 
The trading volume in the last 24 hours stands at 134.8 million USD, demonstrating active participation from investors. With a circulating supply of 1.4 billion JUP, this cryptocurrency shows a wide distribution among holders.
Jupiter has reached a historical high of 1.84 USD, suggesting that the value of JUP has the potential to grow beyond the current price, based on its historical performance. This historical peak provides an important reference point for investors interested in Jupiter’s future prospects in the competitive context of the cryptocurrency market.
NFT Solana: Explosive Growth in the Number of Traders, But Sales are Declining. What’s Happening?
Despite a surprising 111% increase in the number of traders in the NFT market on Solana, total sales are showing an opposite trend.
Recently, data has revealed that the volume of NFT sales on this blockchain has experienced a significant decline. This scenario raises questions about the dynamics behind the increasing interest of investors compared to the decrease in actual transactions.
The enthusiasm for NFTs on Solana is clearly visible from the increasing number of traders, attracted by the low transaction fees and fast processing that the network offers. 
However, the decrease in sales volume could be attributed to several factors. Among these, market saturation and changing investment trends play crucial roles.
Industry experts suggest that, as more individuals are exploring the NFT market as a potential source of income and collecting, caution has become predominant among buyers due to price fluctuations and general economic uncertainty. 
Furthermore, the exponential growth in the number of available NFTs may have made it more difficult for buyers to find unique works that offer long-term value, resulting in a lower frequency of high-profile sales.
This divergence between the entry of new traders and the decrease in sales highlights the complexity and volatility of the NFT market, and suggests that the future of this sector may depend not only on technological innovation, but also on a better understanding of market dynamics and investment strategies by participants.
Dogecoin (DOGE) Price on the Edge: the Threat of the Death Cross
Dogecoin, the popular meme coin, is in a critical phase, with the imminent threat of a death cross that could trigger a significant price correction. 
The death cross, a technical term used in trading to indicate the bearish crossover between the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average, is seen as a strong negative signal by market analysts.
In addition, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), an indicator that helps identify changes in momentum and price direction, is showing signs of an imminent bearish crossover. This signal could further strengthen the already observed bearish trends, increasing pressure on traders.
The critical price area for Dogecoin is currently between $0.15 and $0.14, where approximately 12.46 billion DOGE are held. A drop below this level could trigger cumulative losses of around $1.8 billion, accentuating the climate of uncertainty and potential selling panic among investors.
This scenario highlights the intrinsic volatility of Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the importance for investors to carefully monitor market indicators and be prepared to adjust their strategies in response to rapid changes in the financial landscape.

Binance Fined by Canada’s FINTRAC Over Policy Breaches


							

Canada’s FINTRAC levied a $4.4 million penalty on Binance.



Binance failed to comply with AML laws, claims FINTRAC.



The regulator also found significant gaps in Binance’s compliance procedures.




Canada’s financial crime watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC), has fined Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, a hefty penalty of 6 million Canadian dollars, equivalent to about $4.4 million USD. 



As per a report from Bloomberg, this fine comes as a consequence of Binance’s failure to comply with laws related to money laundering and terrorist financing.



Fintrac identified several administrative violations, including Binance’s failure to register as a foreign money-services business and its alleged failure to report large virtual currency transactions of C$10,000 or more, along with the required information. These violations point to significant gaps in Binance’s compliance procedures.



This latest penalty adds to Binance’s growing list of regulatory and legal issues. The exchange has been under scrutiny by various regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 









Last year, Binance faced accusations of prioritizing profits over user protection. In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money-laundering regulations, resulting in a $4.3 billion fine. Additionally, the SEC has filed a civil lawsuit against Binance.



It is important to note that administrative penalties like the one imposed on Binance are aimed at encouraging businesses to change their behavior rather than being purely punitive. These penalties are intended to drive improvements in compliance practices across the industry. 



Under Canada’s Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act, regulatory bodies like FINTRAC have the authority to issue such penalties in order to promote a more compliant and secure financial environment.

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) to Surge 8,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

BlockFi partners with Coinbase for fund distribution, shuts down web platform

Bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi is completing its wind-down of operations, revealing its intention to shut down its web platform in May. BlockFi has partnered with Coinbase to allow clients to access and withdraw funds.In a blog post, the company stated that its collaboration with Coinbase will enable “eligible BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIA), Retail Loans, and Private Clients” to withdraw their funds.In November 2022, BlockFi declared bankruptcy following FTX’s collapse, and in 2023, BlockFi announced its closure and outlined plans to return customers’ crypto holdings, with a withdrawal request deadline set for April 28, 2024.The lender informed clients on Thursday, May 9, that as the deadline to withdraw digital assets from the current estate distribution has passed, they will receive instructions on setting up a Coinbase account to facilitate withdrawals, whether using an existing or new Coinbase account.Source: BlockFiThe company is providing an additional opportunity for verification via the BlockFi platform for those who missed the withdrawal deadline and the May 10 deadline. Clients who do not establish an approved Coinbase account may have their assets liquidated into cash and distributed accordingly.The plan administrator will continue to use Coinbase for upcoming distribution rounds, potentially involving recovered funds from FTX.BlockFi stated that it does not intend to partner with any other platforms for cryptocurrency distributions. Therefore, investors are advised to stay cautious to avoid potential scams from third-party entities.Related: FTX victims describe ‘irreparable harm’ ahead of Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencingBlockFi has faced fraudulent activity in the past, with individuals receiving deceptive emails that mimicked legitimate communications, falsely claiming immediate withdrawals of their remaining balances.BlockFi reached an $875 million in-principle settlement with the estates of FTX and Alameda Research in March. The settlement resolved BlockFi’s claims against FTX, totaling approximately $1 billion, and also saw FTX waive “millions of dollars of avoidance claims and other counterclaims” against BlockFi.BlockFi’s CEO Zac Prince, who testified as a government witness in Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial, said that the actions of the FTX founder directly led to BlockFi’s bankruptcy.In September 2023, the bankruptcy court approved BlockFi’s Chapter 11 plan to repay its 10,000 creditors. Estimates show BlockFi owes up to $10 billion to over 100,000 creditors, including $1 billion to its three largest creditors and $220 million to bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.Magazine: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?

Luxor Q1 report predicts recovery in Bitcoin hashprice over next five months | CryptoSlate

Quick TakeThe Bitcoin mining sector has faced challenges with historically low hashprices in recent weeks following the halving event. However, hash prices surged to multi-year highs on the day of the halving, buoyed by increased fees attributed to Runes.According to Glassnode data, the hash price is $51,915 in USD terms and 0.84 BTC, nearing all-time lows. However, May 9 saw a recent uptick in hash price due to the biggest difficulty adjustment drop since November 2022.Miner Hashprice (Revenue Per Exahash): (Source: Glassnode)Glassnode defines the miner revenue per exahash metric as a tool for gauging daily miner earnings in relation to their proportional contribution to network hash power. It’s derived by dividing the total miner income (combining subsidies and fees) by the current hashrate (in EH/s). This data is provided on a daily basis, offering insights into the daily revenue earned per 1 EH/s of hash power contributed by miners to the network.Luxor, a mining pool and hashrate marketplace, released its Q1 2024 report on the state of Bitcoin mining. The report suggests that the hash price may have reached its bottom, at least in the short term, and anticipates a rise over the next five months. This projection is based on the expectation of either higher transaction fees or a decrease in mining difficulty.The report says:“This means that Luxor Hashrate Forward traders expect hashprice to increase over the next five months by way of either an increase in transaction fees or a decrease in Bitcoin mining difficulty”.Luxor Hashrate Forward Curve (06-May-24): (Source: Luxor)In addition, Luxor’s hashrate forwards are trading above the current spot price through October, also known as Contango.“Luxor’s Hashrate Forwards are trading in contango through October, which means that the contract prices for these forward contracts (which are essentially future contracts, although they trade OTC and not on an exchange) are trading above the current spot price”.The report suggests that hashrate traders are bullish on transaction fees in the short term.“Hashrate traders have been bullish on transaction fees, which they are baking into their expectations for hashprice in the coming months”.I see two potential scenarios for increased fees: First, if the Bitcoin bull run continues, we could see increased adoption and network congestion. Alternatively, another surge in Inscriptions and Runes could also drive up fees.

Memecoins & SocialFi Apps Drive Base Network’s Growth


							

The Ethereum Layer 2 network, Base, has seen a vast growth in adoption and activity.



Franklin Templeton hints at the emergence of a Base Season, reflecting on the platform’s growth.



The rise of SocialFi applications and the growth of Base memecoins have significantly contributed to the popularity of Base.




Base, a relatively new Ethereum Layer 2 network launched by Coinbase, has seen increasing adoption driven by the rise of SocialFi (Social Finance) applications and the growth of Base memecoins. Asset manager Franklin Templeton, in a recent X post, acknowledged the growing demand for Base as the emergence of a “Base Season.”







According to a recent report released by IntoTheBlock, the L2 networks of Ethereum stand out with unique user engagement and transaction management. Among the Ethereum L2s, Base has gained traction, boasting 1.48 million transactions per day.



The blockchain’s ability to maintain large-scale operations is one of the major reasons for the users’ preference for Base over other L2 networks. In addition, the supply of USDC on Base has also increased, currently exceeding $2.5 billion.









Franklin Templeton’s report spotted the surge of SocialFi applications like Friend.Tech is the key driver of the Base’s demand. While most of the crypto-related SocialFi apps are built on Base, more than 46% of transactions on Base are connected to these applications. The report stated, “[It is] positioning itself well to capture a material share of SocialFi activity and remain a leader in the Ethereum L2 sector going forward.’



Sharing insights on Base’s widening adoption and Franklin Templeton’s report, Chinese reporter Colin Wu posted a message on the X platform. Wu wrote, “Driven by memecoins and Friend tech, Base activity has increased significantly.”







Friend.Tech is one of the most popular SocialFi apps built on Base. Users can monetize their content through “key shares” or “tokenized attention.” The report asserted that the contribution of Friend.Tech in the growth of Base activity is much significant. The platform added that Coinbase has had a supporting hand in the growth as it helped the L2 network to capture about half of the SocialFi market share.

Marathon Digital's Mixed Q1: Growth Amid Setbacks


Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc., a US-based Bitcoin mining company, showcased a mixed financial performance in the first quarter 2024.
This period brought significant growth in hash rate and revenues. Yet, it also presented several operational challenges.
Marathon Digital Faced Financial and Operational Challenges Amidst Growth
Marathon’s Q1 2024 revenues soared by 223% compared with Q1 2023 to $165.2 million. Its net income rose 184% to $337.2 million from the same quarter in 2023.
Additionally, the company produced 2,811 BTC, a 28% increase from Q1 2023. However, compared to the Q4 2023, this figure marks a decrease of roughly 34%.

Read more: How Much Electricity Does Bitcoin Mining Use?
Fred Thiel, Marathon Digital’s CEO, explained the reason behind it. He cites unexpected equipment failures and maintenance issues adversely impacting the company’s Bitcoin production.

“Bitcoin production, and therefore revenues, generated during the quarter was negatively impacted by unexpected equipment failures, transmission line maintenance, and higher than anticipated weather-related curtailments at Garden City and other sites during the quarter,” Thiel stated.

Indeed, Marathon’s Bitcoin production trails behind Core Scientific, another US-based Bitcoin mining company. Core Scientific reported 2,825 Bitcoin (BTC) mined during Q1 2024.
Nonetheless, the start of 2024 has been a period of notable expansion for Marathon Digital. The company reported a 142% increase in its energized hash rate, reaching 27.8 exahash per second (EH/s). The figure is up from 11.5 EH/s in the same period last year.

Marathon also expanded its technological infrastructure and product offerings. This quarter saw the introduction of Anduro, a new multi-chain Bitcoin layer-two network. Anduro aims to foster Bitcoin’s development and adoption.
Moreover, Marathon launched several innovative products to enhance the efficiency and performance of Bitcoin mining operations. Among these were Slipstream, a service for speeding up Bitcoin transaction confirmations, and MARA UBC 2100, a control board developed internally to optimize mining operations.
Furthermore, the company has aggressively pursued expansion through acquisitions. It added more than 1.1 gigawatts to its mining capacity.

Notably, 54% of this capacity is now under Marathon’s direct control and operation. This strategic expansion is aligned with Marathon’s ambitious target. It aims to boost its hash rate to 50 EH/s by the end of 2024, doubling its current capacity.
However, Marathon’s overall performance in the quarter didn’t meet analysts at Zacks Equity Research’s estimation. Marathon’s reported revenues missed the Zacks consensus estimate by 14.80%. This led Zacks to adjust the current rank of Marathon Digital’s stock (MARA) status to “hold.”

Marathon Digital’s stock (MARA) price dropped after the earnings report. During after-hours trading, MARA’s price dipped to $18.60 on May 9. In a longer time frame, MARA’s price has been down 14.30% year-to-date.

Ethereum: for the SEC the crypto is a threat to banks

Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, has released statements regarding the behavior of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the USA against cryptocurrencies. 
According to Lubin, the SEC sees Ethereum as a threat to the banking landscape, and is acting to hinder innovation in the United States. 

Ethereum vs. SEC: according to Lubin, the crypto threatens banks and finance in the USA
At FT Live at the Crypto and Digital Asset summit in London, Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, spoke about how the SEC is acting against cryptocurrencies.
Specifically, Lubin believes that the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States is engaging in strategic enforcement actions, rather than having a meaningful dialogue with the cryptocurrency industry.
The lack of regulatory clarity and these actions against crypto, suggest that the SEC is intentionally hindering innovation, which threatens the current banking and financial landscape of the country.
And indeed, according to the co-founder of Ethereum, the actions of the SEC are intended to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt for the cryptocurrency industry “in an attempt to paralyze” and force the company to go offshore.
Regarding this, Lubin said:
“The SEC seems to have reclassified Ether as a security without telling anyone that it is doing so. It is proceeding with a strategic series of executive actions rather than an open discussion and a clear definition of the rules”
Ethereum vs. the SEC: the crypto ETF issue could further scare banks
Lubin then spoke about two other issues concerning the SEC against Ethereum. One is the decision by Consensys to sue the SEC, after receiving a Wells notice from the agency. 
Just with the goal of obtaining greater clarity, the company’s counteraction against the SEC will go to a US court. However, it is worth considering that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had previously classified Ether ETH as a commodity.
On this subject, here is the tweet from Consensys that explains its position:

“It’s not just about protecting a digital asset, but safeguarding the future of innovation in the United States. It’s about safeguarding the future of innovation in the United States. An overly zealous financial regulator should not hold a revolutionary technology hostage.” – @ethereumjoseph in today’s edition of @FT”
The other issue regarding the SEC vs. Ethereum case, instead, concerns the upcoming deadline for Ethereum spot ETFs, which must be approved or rejected by the end of this month of May 2024. 
Here too, Lubin emphasizes that the SEC’s decision could depend on both the success of capital inflows for the Bitcoin spot ETF and the lack of readiness on the part of banks and the traditional financial system. 
In this sense, Lubin has also hypothesized that the perspective that customers in the banking sector will move assets into digital forms, using decentralized finance constructs, could scare many banks and other financial institutions.
Vitalik Buterin’s new revolutionary proposal: EIP-7702
And while on one hand there is concern about whether government and institutions are ready for the great Ethereum, on the other hand, the other co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, is dealing with his continuous technological progress. 
Recently, Buterin together with Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs and Matt Garnett, presented a new revolutionary proposal: EIP-7702.
Basically, the proposal aims to refine the concept of “account abstraction” on Ethereum. 
It proposes to introduce a new feature and capability to externally owned accounts (EOA), like normal wallets, allowing them to temporarily assume the functions of a smart contract during a transaction.

Solana Surpasses Ethereum in DEX Volume


Solana has managed to top Ethereum in 24-hour daily volume in decentralized exchanges, according to recent data. The two popular blockchains recorded $1.3 billion and $1.29 billion, respectively, in DEX trading volume. BSC comes in third place with $604 million worth of DEX trading volume. Arbitrum and Base are in fourth and fifth places after generating $510 million and $286 million in DEX trading volume, respectively. Another flippening? It is also worth noting that Solana’s total fees are now at 50% of Ethereum’s fees over the past few days. For comparison, the ratio was just 1% during the 2021 bull run. Some analysts expect Solana to flip Ethereum in fees this month, which would be a major development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, it is worth noting that the capital moving to layer-2 solutions is one of the reasons for this changing dynamics. Solana surges 6% The price of the SOL cryptocurrency has surged more than 6% over the past 24 hours, which makes it one of the best-performing altcoins. The token is currently changing hands at $154 on major spot exchanges. Its market cap currently stands at $68 billion. For comparison, ETH is currently up a modest 1.23%. Yet, with its valuation of $365 billion, it still dwarfs Solana.

                        Rich Dad Poor Dad author and renowned investor Robert Kiyosaki believes that the US dollar is losing value and expressed his support over crypto investments.During a recent episode of the podcast “The Rich Dad Channel,” Kiyosaki discussed the importance of portfolio diversification including cryptocurrencies. Speaking to Andy Shechtman, CEO of Miles Franklin Precious Metals, Kiyosaki advocated investors to turn to gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum.He stressed that the dollar decline is imminent, which is why accumulating alternative investments is vital to be prepared for adverse financial conditions. “Our money is fake,” he noted.“It’s a reason to buy gold, silver, Bitcoin, and all this because our currency is screwed up now, it’s going to get worse because our debt keeps going up.”Kiyosaki revealed that he bought Ethereum “for the same reason.”Further, he criticized the lack of financial literacy education in schools, particularly when there is an already dire financial situation. Kiyosaki also pointed out the absence of counterparty risk issues when it comes to borrowing money.“If I borrow money, who’s the guy to pay me back? And gold and silver – you don’t need that – the same as Bitcoin, you have no counterparty risk.”
Kiyosaki’s Highly Bullish Bitcoin Stance
The bestselling author in March, described the world’s largest crypto – Bitcoin – as “the perfect asset at the right time.” However, he is also having a cautious approach to the asse-class, doubting its potential to be scam or Ponzi scheme.Kiyosaki has maintained a bullish stance on Bitcoin over the years. In November 2023, the financial educator said that Bitcoin is the “best protection” against hyperinflation because it is people’s money. He drew a historical comparison and urged his followers to consider Bitcoin as a means of protection against hyperinflation.However, he wasn’t keen on the spot Bitcoin ETFs, claiming that these financial products are apt for institutional investors. He rather favors direct ownership of physical assets due to his entrepreneurship pathway.Kiyosaki has invested in a mix of assets like gold, silver, Bitcoin, which according to him are bargains today.

Ethereum Spot ETF Dream Dashed? Expert Pessimistic On Approval Prospects | Bitcoinist.com


								Within the cryptocurrency investment space, there has been much debate and conjecture around the possibility of an Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). However, in light of ongoing regulatory obstacles, senior Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas has offered a gloomy view of the products, noting that the firm is now more pessimistic than ever about the likelihood of the funds being approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Ethereum Spot ETF Pessimism Prevails
Eric Balchunas’ insights came in response to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Fizen Leo Vu’s post regarding Grayscale’s CEO Michael Sonneshein’s optimism toward approval of Ethereum spot ETFs. According to Michael, he is very confident that the SEC will grant the company’s request to convert its Ethereum trust into a spot ETF.

Responding to the post, Balchunas expressed his displeasure with the CEO’s claims, highlighting his disagreement and Bloomberg’s constant pessimism toward the products. While Balchunas believes that the funds might be authorized in the foreseeable future, he thinks it will not happen within a year. However, the election in November and what Grayscale says about denial are significant factors that could trigger a shift in the forecast.
Balchunas further noted that Sonneshein mentioned that Grayscale decided to withdraw its ETH futures ETF filed under the Securities Act of 1933 because it wanted to concentrate more on its Spot ETF. Meanwhile, the major purpose of filing the ETH futures under the 1933 Act, as opposed to the 1940 Act, was to create a legal opening.
The expert thinks a potential reason why Grayscale made the move might be because they do not want to pay the whole cost once more to give Blackrock a massive ETF progress, as seen following the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs while taking a lot of crap from people due to unlock outflows.
Shared View On Grayscale’s ETF Withdrawal
Balchunas’ insights have caused quite a stir in the crypto community. Scott Johnsson, a finance lawyer and author, has expressed his agreement with Bloomberg’s analyst overview.

Johnsson may be in line with Balchunas’s perspective on why Grayscale withdrew its Ethereum futures; however, he believes by taking such action, the firm displayed its true intentions. “Can I blame them? I don’t know, but don’t piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining,” he added.
He further stated that without pulling ETHE itself, Grayscale could not claim to be trying to convert ETHE while simultaneously engaging in the single most significant action to obstruct that objective.
Thus, Balchunas concurred with Johnsson saying that the part where he mentioned Grayscale taking a bunch of crap from people was due to high cost, which the company is to blame. “I’m not letting them off the hook for what they said re conversion but rather trying to get others to see it from their perspective/self-interest. When you do everything starts to make sense,” he added.
It is worth noting that the approval odds for Ethereum spot ETFs today now stand at merely 9%, indicating a nearly 90% drop since the first filings were made.

UAE's Crypto Scene Friendlier Than US Due to Political Stability


                        
                            UAE Offers Friendlier Crypto Scene Than US Due to Political Stability: Komodo CTO

                        Komodo CTO Kadan Stadlemann said the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) political stability fosters a friendlier environment for crypto businesses to flourish, compared to the challenges they face in the US.In a jab at democracies, he said the UAE’s biggest advantage is its monarchy. The exec believes the UAE’s stable leadership, free from the back-and-forth policy changes of democracies, creates a more friendly environment for crypto businesses to grow.In an interview with CryptoNews, he credited the country’s “very stable political basis” as key to its startup friendliness. He also pointed to the UAE royal family’s “genius approach,” which he believes has laid the groundwork for the country’s booming economic growth.Stadlemann was attesting to the UAE making efforts to welcome crypto companies. All virtual asset service providers need to get licensed from the Virtual Asset Regulatory before they can operate there.The CTO also highlighted that UAE’s low crime rate creates a safe environment that supports business growth. He attributes this to strict laws that target crime effectively.On the other hand, he criticized the US for its overregulated crypto environment.
Crypto Exec Advocates For US Regulatory Reform for Crypto Growth
The Securities and Exchange Commission is typically called out for its “overreach” in handling crypto-related matters. In 2023, the regulator filed 46 enforcement actions within the industry and raked up fines worth $2.8b.“I believe the US (crypto economy) is being let down,” Stadelmann said. He added that he knows of several crypto projects that have chosen to relocate from the US to more welcoming regions like Latin America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the UAE.“I believe they need industry experts involved, with all due respect. But I believe that’s what you get when you have a bunch of boomers and noobs try to regulate something they really literally don’t understand,” he said.“After years of struggle within the regulatory layer, you just get tired of it. And that’s kind of where we are.”The crypto exec called for a smarter approach to crypto regulation. He emphasized the industry’s wealth of expertise in core blockchain technology and its principles. This knowledge, he says, can be harnessed to develop regulations that protect investors and prevent illegal activity, without stifling innovation. Stadlemann believes regulators need to re-evaluate their current frameworks to find a more balanced approach.
Stadelmann’s Relocation Shows UAE Wins Crypto Talent as Netherlands Loses Grip
For over 7 years, Stadlemann part of the team at Komodo, an open-source, end-to-end blockchain and cryptocurrency platform. JL777, an anonymous leader, spearheaded Komodo’s creation in 2014. This decentralized platform allows developers across industries to conduct anonymous transactions.The exec now plans to relocate from Amsterdam to the UAE, leaving what he sees as growing hostility towards crypto in the Netherlands.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC) dipped slightly by 0.20%, settling at $63,000, yet maintains a bullish stance in the latest bitcoin price prediction. The rise in jobless claims to 231,000, the highest since August 2023, suggests a cooling U.S. labour market, prompting anticipatory actions by the Federal Reserve.This could lead to rate reductions earlier than projected, influencing Bitcoin’s appeal as a non-traditional investment.
U.S. Jobs Data Sparks Rate Cut Speculation—What’s Next for BTCThe Labor Department reported a notable increase in initial jobless claims for the week ending May 4, reaching 231,000—22,000 more than the previous week and well above the Dow Jones estimate of 214,000. This marks the highest level since August 26, 2023, signalling possible economic strains and a cooling labour market that had previously shown resilience.Initial Jobless Claims – Source: Tradingeconomics Continuing claims also increased, rising by 17,000 to 1.78 million, while the four-week moving average of claims climbed to 215,000. These figures suggest a gradual economic slowdown, prompting discussions about the Federal Reserve’s potential early rate cuts to stimulate growth. Such a softening in the labour market has historically been a catalyst for Bitcoin price as investors turn to non-traditional assets.
Nonfarm Payroll Adds to ConcernApril’s nonfarm payroll data added to these concerns, showing a gain of only 175,000 jobs, far below the expected 240,000. This was the smallest increase since October 2023. However, the unemployment rate remains stable at 3.9%, under 4% since February 2022, indicating that the job market is not in crisis but may be normalizing.Analysts Christopher Rupkey and Robert Frick have noted the volatility and surprising rise in jobless claims, suggesting potential further fluctuations in the labour market. Officials of the Federal Reserve, whose goal is to maintain a 2% inflation rate, carefully examine these circumstances.
The recent spike in U.S. jobless claims suggests a potential economic slowdown.
April’s modest job gains and stable unemployment hint at market normalization.
The Fed may cut rates sooner, possibly boosting Bitcoin investment as lower rates reduce fixed-income asset yields.
As expectations mount for the Fed to ease monetary policy in response to a weakening job market, possibly starting rate cuts as early as September, Bitcoin could benefit. Lower interest rates make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies more appealing. Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC) observes a minor decline of 0.20%, with the current trading price at $63,000, however, bitcoin price prediction still remains bullish.The pivot point at $61,011 sets the stage for determining directional movements, with immediate resistance observed at $64,851. Should bullish momentum prevail, subsequent resistance levels at $67,084 and $69,356 could be tested.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewConversely, immediate support forms at $58,852, with further downside protection seen at $56,677 and $54,327. The RSI at 54 indicates a relatively neutral market stance, while the 50-day EMA at $62,375 provides underlying support near the $62,000 mark, suggesting a balanced yet cautious market sentiment.A decisive move below $62,500 could trigger a significant selling trend, highlighting the importance of this threshold in BTC’s near-term price actions.

R. Kiyosaki's stark warning: Stop living in Disneyland and prepare for depression


Not long after stressing that a financial crash was already here and that it would be a ‘bad one,’ the popular investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ Robert Kiyosaki, has warned his followers to get ready for a depression instead of living in ‘Disneyland.’
As it happens, Kiyosaki said he didn’t want a depression to happen but that “it is better to be preparing for the worse rather than live in Disneyland, which most people are doing,” adding that “for years,” he could “see this crisis coming,” as he elaborated in an X post on May 9.
Specifically, as examples of things he was doing to prepare for the crisis he saw coming years ago, the finance educator listed writing his ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ book, starting his own business, using debt as money to buy cash-flowing assets such as rental properties, and saving gold, silver, and Bitcoin (BTC).


Additionally, he pointed out the opportunities that such a time can offer for those well-prepared for it, even arguing that “depression can be the perfect time to get rich, really rich,” telling his followers to “stop living in Disneyland and prepare to get rich… very rich.”

Getting rich during crash
As a reminder, when sharing his earlier warning of a particularly ugly crash and his rules to stand by during such a time, Kiyosaki also expressed his view that “crashes are the best time to get rich” because “bargains will float to the surface,” as Finbold reported on May 3.
Back in early April, he also highlighted that “most people have no idea” what the previous confession by United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that inflation was higher than expected meant for them or their families or to the world,” and that, in simple language, it meant “we’re F’d.”
At the same time, the author continues to advise saving gold, silver, and Bitcoin instead of the “fake money” like the US dollar, arguing that the rich save the above assets, while the poor and middle-class work for fiat, which they then invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Warns Of Impending Regulatory Crackdown On Crypto Staking: 'It's Going To Be A Bloodbath' - Benzinga

Veteran trader Peter Brandt has sparked a discussion within the cryptocurrency community with his recent remarks on X.What Happened: On Thursday, Brandt predicted a severe regulatory crackdown on crypto staking, describing the future landscape as a “bloodbath.” “If the crypto community is upset over the @SECGov treatment of $XRP, $ETH et al as securities, Prediction: Wait until the @USOCC @SECGov @USTreasury do a full assault attack over staking It’s going to be a bloodbath,” he wrote.Brandt’s comments reflect concerns over potential aggressive actions from not only the SEC but also the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the U.S. Treasury.See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Trade Sideways, Trader Asks: ‘Does It Matter If You Buy Bitcoin At $62,000 OrWhy It Matters: There have been a series of legal challenges and regulatory actions that have heightened tensions within the crypto market. A recent court ruling against Coinbase Global Inc. COIN largely dismissed the company’s motion to fend off SEC allegations of unregistered securities activity, particularly concerning its staking program.Furthermore, the market has seen significant volatility with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD experiencing price dips following regulatory scrutiny. Notably, Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD reported a substantial increase in crypto trading volume despite receiving a Wells notice from the SEC, indicating a complex and defiant landscape.Amid these developments, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has accused the SEC of hampering the growth of the crypto sector. His company, Consensys, is embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC over Ethereum’s classification. Additionally, the U.S. House of Representatives has taken a stand against the SEC’s crypto custody rules, a move that President Joe Biden has vowed to block, further highlighting the contentious regulatory environment.Read Next: Here’s How Much $1,000 Invested In Dogecoin Would be Worth If You Invested When Elon Musk First Tweeted About DOGEImage via Shutterstock

Ripple Teams up to Build a Secret Management Protocol


Ripple, the issuer of XRP tokens, has formed a strategic alliance with Algorand and Hedera, aiming to revolutionize secret management. 
This partnership inaugurates the DeRec Alliance, which also includes Swirlds Labs and XRPL Labs among its founding members.
What is DeRec Alliance?
The DeRec Alliance is dedicated to enhancing digital asset recovery through an open-source protocol. This system allows for the secure and confidential recovery of digital secrets, such as passwords and keys, using a method based on secret sharing.
Founding members, including Ripple, are pivotal in the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). They influence governance and policies that shape the future of digital asset security. The TOC provides expert oversight and direction, which is critical in guiding the alliance’s strategic initiatives.
Read more: What is a Private Key in Crypto?

The demand for such a system has surged as digital asset adoption increases. Traditional recovery methods often leave assets at risk or completely irrecoverable if the owners lose their keys. 
For example, Rain Lõhmus of LHV Bank cannot access 250,000 Ethereum worth over $700 million. Also, former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas is locked out of a Bitcoin (BTC) wallet due to a forgotten password. Thomas’ 7,000 BTC are worth over $441 million.

The DeRec protocol involves a network of ‘helpers’ – either friends or businesses – who each hold a part of a user’s digital secret. If the user loses access to their device or data, these helpers can collaboratively reconstruct the secret. This system ensures that no single helper accesses the complete secret, maintaining high security and redundancy without compromising privacy.
Additionally, the system is designed to automatically adapt to changes, such as when helpers join or leave. This feature maintains the integrity of the secret, ensuring continuous security despite changes in the user’s network of helpers.

“The DeRec Alliance addresses one of the biggest challenges facing mainstream crypto adoption—secure and user-friendly management of private keys. By establishing clear standards for key recovery, this collaboration across the crypto industry empowers individuals to take control of their digital assets with confidence,” Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President of RippleX, said.

Despite progress, Ripple faces ongoing legal challenges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For instance, on May 7, the SEC objected to Ripple’s plan of issuing a “new unregistered crypto asset.”

However, the SEC has not mentioned more details about the new crypto asset.

'Age of Ethereum' Incoming for 5 Key Reasons

Despite some skepticism, Ethereum has five compelling reasons that it has a bright future, presented from a balanced perspective.Superior ecosystem compared to Bitcoin’s L2:While Bitcoin's layer-2 (L2) applications are developing, they currently lag behind Ethereum in terms of functionality and user experience. Ethereum has established itself as the preferred platform for developers, largely due to its more mature ecosystem and broader acceptance. Despite the noise around Bitcoin’s potential for application development, Ethereum remains the go-to for developers looking for robust, tested and versatile solutions.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewRegulatory challenges may not be pivotal:There is a lot of talk about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) possibly classifying Ethereum as a security. However, the outcome of this regulatory scrutiny is still uncertain. Even if Ethereum faces some regulatory hurdles, its integral role in the finance and tech sectors — backed by significant support from big tech and traditional finance (tradfi) asset managers — suggests it could withstand potential challenges.Scalability and competition from Solana:Solana has been marked as a more scalable blockchain platform with faster growth in applications. However, its scalability benefits are accompanied by technical risks and less diversity in the client base compared to Ethereum.Adoption by major financial players:Major financial institutions like Visa, MasterCard, JP Morgan and Citibank have explored blockchain solutions separate from Ethereum. Yet, the interoperability and established network of Ethereum could eventually attract these giants. The blockchain’s ability to operate on a trustless, global scale makes it an attractive backbone for future financial operations.Symbiotic relationship with layer-2 solutions:There is a misconception that value primarily accrues to layer-2 technologies rather than Ethereum itself. In reality, Ethereum and its layer-2 solutions enjoy a symbiotic relationship. The success of applications running on Ethereum's network enhances the core platform's value, akin to how railways benefit from the businesses they enable.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Appears Headed for a 'Golden Cross'

During DOGE's early 2021 run, interest rates were near or below zero worldwide, which catalyzed unprecedented risk-taking across all corners of the financial market. That's not the case any more, with rates in the U.S., the world's largest economy, at multiyear highs above 5%.

Livepeer (LPT) Coin is Trending: Announcement Coming Up for Web3 Social Media Platform | Cryptopolitan

Livepeer (LPT) undergoes another boom cycle with a vertical price climb. LPT reached $19.33, within one price move from its yearly peak above $25. Demand for the token led LPT to a monthly peak in trading volumes above $106M in 24 hours. In 2024, LPT achieved two other vertical climbs and moved to a higher tier as interest returned to Web3 projects. The hope for LPT is to return to its all-time peak, when the token traded above $68 during the 2021 bull market. LPT remains at risk for deep corrections. Its most active trading pair on Binance, LPT/USDT, has only $181K liquidity for 2% slippage.LPT Shifts Trading ProfileIn the past month, the LPT trading profile has also shifted as tokens moved to a different set of exchanges. Binance and Coinbase marked net withdrawals for LPT, while the tokens flowed into OKX, Gate.IO, and other small exchanges.The token may undergo rapid inflows and outflows due to limited arbitrage opportunities. There is a disparity in LPT pairings, which may explain the increased trading activity.Livepeer was also selected as one of the projects in Grayscale’s portfolio, and it became the top performer during the latest rally. LPT stands out as a blue chip when decentralized storage and computing tokens are also expanding. The LPT rally follows highly active days for Render (RNDR), Akash Network (AKN) and AIOZ Network (AIOZ).Livepeer Aims for Development Beyond Short-Term Price HypeLivepeer has a long-term goal of building the world’s decentralized video infrastructure. The project aligns with the trending DePIN projects that focus on distributed computation and infrastructure. In May, Livepeer is boosting its social media profile with a pre-announcement. Livepeer will present its network upgrade and new tools to combine AI and video streaming during the ETH Berlin meetup. Livepeer aims to grow its influence, targeting content creators and developers. The project claims to offer 80% lower costs than existing cloud and video streaming services. All video streaming is supported by the globally available Livepeer Network, which combines user resources for lag-free streaming. Livepeer also boosted its brand in 2023, by creating enterprise products for prominent social media companies. So far, Livepeer has onboarded partners like Fishtank LIVE, Minds, Switchboard, The Lot Radio, and MyPrize. Independent creators can also use open-source Livepeer API to stream on demand. Livepeer Stands Behind Video VerificationLivepeer is also focusing on emerging problems with streamed content. With the rise of AI, the veracity of every video may be questioned. Livepeer is researching tools to prevent fake content and AI-generated fakes. Reliable and verified video is key, as Livepeer strives to grow the adoption of its flagship product, Livepeer Studio. Livepeer aims to become a key player in the growth industry of video streaming. In 2023, global streaming reached $553B and is projected to grow to 671.8B by the end of 2024. Video streaming still depends on AWS usage and other centralized cloud services. Blockchain projects are trying to achieve better pricing and access to grab a piece of the expanding market.Recent studies show decentralized streaming may be taking off this year. In April, Livepeer marked 30% growth compared to Q4, 2023. Through a series of updates and development over the years, Livepeer achieved the current network potential. The Livepeer Network itself is scalable, but the LPT asset remains an Ethereum-based token. Livepeer distributed its tokens in 2018 before developing its streaming service to ensure widespread holding of the tokens. Around 30% of all LPT tokens are in an escrow treasury. LPT also has 12% of its supply stored in a Binance wallet, suggesting sellers may be waiting in the sidelines to take profits. But LPT also has long-term holders, and has been distributed to more than 2.2 million wallets over the past six years. LPT tokens also have key utility and are used by streamers to pay for online resources. As streamers grow, so does demand for LPT. Network “orchestrators” receive the tokens as payment from streamers, who require the CPU, GPU, and bandwidth resources for on-demand streaming.

Bitcoin Is Getting Less Difficult To Mine After Halving - But Is That A Good Or Bad Sign? - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD miners may heave a sigh of relief as the network experienced its largest negative difficulty adjustment since November 2022. What Happened: The Bitcoin blockchain underwent its fourth negative difficulty adjustment for the year, according to CryptoQuant's Head of Research Julio Moreno, making it easier for the halving-battered sector to produce blocks and generate new Bitcoins. The mining difficulty is adjusted every 2.016 blocks, or roughly two weeks, to ensure block production time remains at 10 minutes. It is positively correlated with hash rate, the computational power dedicated by miners.The latest 5.7% drop in difficulty comes as a likely response to the 10% decline in the 7-day moving average of the hash rate from 655 EH/s on the halving day to 586 EH/s as of May 10, according to Hash Rate Index. Why It Matters: The quadrennial halving that slashed block rewards, severely impacted miners' revenue streams. CryptoQuant's Moreno noted, "As revenue has declined sharply after the halving, Miners are currently underpaid by the most since March 2020, the COVID crash." The loss in earnings prompted many participants, particularly those operating on a small scale, to turn off their machines and abandon the market. This caused a hash rate decline and subsequently led to a negative difficulty adjustment.The sentiment was echoed by Luxor mining pool CEO Nick Hansen who reportedly told Decrypt, "If there isn't enough margin for miners to make a profit, they turn off, which causes the hash rate to go down.”That said, CEO of mining firm Optiminer Scott Noris pointed out that this bodes well for the sector’s future growth. "The miners who planned properly will grow or the ones who turned off will get newer tech and find cheaper energy while everyone waits for the price to reflect the halving," he told Decrypt.With difficulty lowered and competition lessened, mining costs could decrease, providing temporary relief for the sector.Miners earn the majority of their revenues through fixed subsidies from every block produced. Halvings attack this very component severely, as each occurrence reduced rewards by 50%. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading up 2.81% at $62919.46, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Joseph Lubin Accuses SEC Of Stifling Crypto Growth Amid Legal ShowdownPhoto by Gaston Cerliani on Shutterstock

Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Says Voting For Biden Is A 'Vote Against American Crypto Industry' - Benzinga

Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano ADA/USD, has accused President Joe Biden of actively working to stifle the Bitcoin BTC/USD and cryptocurrency industry in the United States.What Happened: Hoskinson, in a video posted on social media platform X on Thursday, criticized the Biden administration for its alleged efforts to “destroy the American cryptocurrency industry,” reported Cointelegraph.The Cardano founder pointed out that the U.S. government has been detrimental to the crypto industry through various means, including restricted access to bank accounts and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s policy of regulation by enforcement. He also criticized the White House for obstructing the legislative process."A vote for Biden is a vote against the American cryptocurrency industry," Hoskinson said.Hoskinson’s comments were in response to a statement from the White House, indicating that President Biden would veto legislation aimed at overturning SEC guidelines that discourage banks from holding crypto assets."The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry. The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto," Hoskinson said.See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Dip After Robinhood Gets Wells Notice From SEC — Analyst Says ETHs Weak Fundamentals A ‘Roadblock’ For King CryptoHe also criticized the SEC for using outdated legislation that he believes should not apply to new and emerging asset classes. Hoskinson cited other countries such as Switzerland, Singapore, and Dubai, which have welcomed crypto companies and reaped the benefits of substantial investments.Notably, Hoskinson’s comments were challenged by a Twitter user who pointed out that the Trump administration had also been unsupportive of crypto. Hoskinson, however, stood by his claims, asserting that the Biden administration’s stance was “completely wrong.”Why It Matters: The Biden administration’s approach to cryptocurrency has been a subject of debate and scrutiny. The House of Representatives recently voted in favor of a resolution seeking to overturn a controversial SEC cryptocurrency accounting directive, indicating a growing divide between legislative preferences and executive defense of regulatory measures.Earlier in March, a poll revealed that former President Donald Trump was the top choice for U.S. voters who own cryptocurrencies. This indicates a potential shift in voter sentiment towards the Biden administration’s handling of the crypto industry.On the other hand, Trump has recently publicly endorsed cryptocurrency, positioning it as a significant election issue, which contrasts with President Biden’s perceived unfamiliarity with the crypto world.Read Next: Trump Pledges To ‘Make Sure You Can’ Donate Using Crypto To His 2024 Campaign — Unwittingly Sends Memecoin Parodying Biden SurgingImage Via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh BagalkoteThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

Ethereum ETF Applications: Is There Potential For New Breakthrough? - Coincu



	

Following the groundbreaking approval by the SEC of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, attention now turns to the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in 2024. Notable contenders leading the charge in Ethereum ETF applications include VanEck, BlackRock, and ARK Invest, underscoring the Escalating interest from major financial institutions in cryptocurrency-based investment products. Let’s take a look at the companies participating in this race with Coincu.




				
			


Overview of spot Ethereum ETF



What is a spot Ethereum ETF?



Functioning akin to traditional ETFs, spot Ethereum ETFs are managed by institutions that commit to purchasing and holding Ethereum (ETH) in their reserves.



These ETFs are subsequently listed on conventional stock exchanges, where they issue shares representing ownership of the ETF. Traders can then gain exposure to the real-time price movements of Ethereum through trading these shares, as they reflect the value of the ETH held by the institution.





It’s essential to understand that while owning shares of a spot Ethereum ETF provides exposure to the ETF’s underlying ETH reserves, it does not equate to direct ownership of individual ETH tokens. Shareholders hold claims on the value of the ETH holdings rather than the cryptocurrency itself.



Moreover, institutions managing the ETF may employ various strategies with the underlying ETH, such as lending it out or engaging in staking activities, in a bid to potentially enhance returns for the ETF.

How Does a Spot Ethereum ETF Work?



A spot Ethereum ETF operates as a pool where traders contribute funds to purchase Ethereum directly. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track Ethereum’s price using derivatives like ETH futures, spot Ethereum ETFs hold the actual Ether coins to mirror the cryptocurrency’s price movements. Here’s how it works:



Spot Ethereum ETF buying structure



When investors buy shares of a spot Ethereum ETF, their funds are pooled together to acquire Ethereum coins. The value of the ETF shares then correlates with the price of Ether. If the price of Ethereum increases, the value of the ETF shares rises proportionally, and conversely, if the price of Ethereum decreases, the value of the ETF shares declines.



Behind the scenes, the ETF manager plays a crucial role in ensuring that the ETF accurately reflects the real-time market value of Ethereum. To maintain alignment with Ethereum’s price fluctuations, the manager may engage in activities such as creating and redeeming units, which involve exchanging large blocks of ETF shares for the underlying Ether or vice versa.





Exposure to ETH price



Despite the manager’s efforts to keep the ETF’s value in line with Ethereum’s price, slight disparities may occur due to factors such as trading costs and the frequency of rebalancing. Nonetheless, the goal of a spot Ethereum ETF is to provide investors with a convenient and transparent means of gaining exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without the complexities associated with directly owning and managing the cryptocurrency.

Benefits of spot Ethereum ETF



Ethereum ETFs offer several compelling benefits for investors looking to participate in the Ethereum market without the intricacies of directly managing digital assets. Here are some key advantages:





Ethereum ETFs enable investors to tap into the Ethereum market without the need to directly own and manage the cryptocurrency through traditional exchanges. By including Ethereum ETFs in their investment strategy, individuals can spread their risk across multiple assets, potentially mitigating losses if one asset underperforms.






Ethereum ETFs are typically available on public exchanges, making it convenient for investors to buy and sell shares during regular trading hours. Unlike purchasing and managing Ethereum directly, which can involve navigating various cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, investing in an Ethereum ETF streamlines the process, offering a familiar and straightforward investment avenue.





One of the notable advantages of investing in Ethereum ETFs is the assurance of professional management. With an ETF, investors entrust the oversight and security of their digital assets to seasoned experts who manage the fund on their behalf. 



Instead, they can rely on the expertise of ETF managers to navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency market and make informed investment decisions that align with the interests of shareholders.





Storing and securing Ethereum tokens can be a daunting task, requiring knowledge of cybersecurity best practices and constant vigilance against potential threats. 





By investing in Ethereum ETFs, individuals can sidestep the risks associated with hosting wallets and safeguarding private keys. Instead, the responsibility for safeguarding digital assets falls on the ETF custodians and managers, who employ robust security measures to protect investors’ holdings.

List of All Companies That Have Applied for Spot Ethereum ETFs



The SEC is in the midst of its second round of reviews for spot Ethereum ETFs. This process involves examining applications from various issuers, with at least eight major players currently awaiting approval.



Among those seeking approval for Ethereum Spot ETFs are industry giants like Fidelity, BlackRock, Invesco with Galaxy, Grayscale, Hashdex, 21 Shares with ARK, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton. Each of these issuers has submitted applications for ETFs tied to Ethereum, highlighting the growing interest in cryptocurrency-based investment products.



Top Ethereum ETF Applications



VanEck



Among the leading Ethereum ETF applications is VanEck, which made headlines as the first to file for an Ethereum ETF spot in September 2023.



BlackRock



Following closely behind is BlackRock, a major player in the financial industry, which submitted its Ethereum ETF application in November of the same year, signaling its interest in entering the Ethereum ETF market.



ARK Invest



Another significant contender is ARK Invest, known for its innovative approach to investment strategies. ARK Invest filed for its Ethereum ETF last September, joining the ranks of institutions seeking approval to offer investors exposure to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market through ETFs.



Other Ethereum ETF Applications



Fidelity



Fidelity, a renowned name in the investment management industry, filed for its Ethereum ETF in November 2023. With its extensive experience and reputation in the financial sector, Fidelity’s entry into the Ethereum ETF market underscores the broadening appeal of cryptocurrencies among traditional investors. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund would be made available to the public on the Cboe BZX Exchange upon approval.



Invesco Galaxy



Another notable Ethereum ETF application is Invesco Galaxy, which submitted its application for an Ethereum ETF in October 2023. Invesco Galaxy’s involvement in the Ethereum ETF space reflects the continued expansion of offerings within the cryptocurrency investment landscape as established players seek to provide investors with diverse opportunities to access digital assets.



Hashdex



In September, the Nasdaq stock exchange submitted a request to list the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF with the SEC. Toroso Investments, a member of the National Futures Association and a certified commodity pool operator with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, oversees and manages the fund.



Grayscale



Grayscale, a prominent cryptocurrency asset management firm, is also seeking approval for its Ethereum ETF after filing its Ethereum ETF application in October 2023. Grayscale’s entry into the Ethereum ETF market further validates the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies and demonstrates confidence in the potential of Ethereum as a leading blockchain platform.



Hashdex, a global asset management firm specializing in cryptocurrency investments, filed for its Ethereum ETF in September 2023.



Franklin Templeton



Franklin Templeton has officially entered the competition for Ethereum ETFs, as confirmed in a filing on February 12. With an approval deadline set for November 2024, the asset manager has outlined its strategy, which notably deviates from conventional approaches seen in the industry.



Unlike some competitors, Franklin Templeton’s proposal emphasizes cash creations and redemptions, eschewing the typical in-kind transactions involving direct crypto transfers.



In its filing, Franklin Templeton disclosed its choice of custodians, highlighting Coinbase Custody for cryptocurrency custody and the Bank of New York Mellon for cash custody, administration, and transfer agency services.



Background of Ethereum ETF Applications



VanEck



VanEck, a seasoned player in the financial industry with a focus on mutual funds and ETFs, has been striving to establish a foothold in the cryptocurrency market for several years. While its attempts to launch a bitcoin ETF in the United States have encountered setbacks, the firm has maintained its pursuit of opportunities in the digital asset space.



In 2021, VanEck Europe, an arm of the company responsible for approximately 50 ETFs traded on stock exchanges throughout Europe, introduced the VanEck Crypto and Blockchain Innovators UCITS ETF. This ETF, designed to tap into the potential of the crypto and blockchain sectors, offers exposure to a diversified portfolio that includes prominent companies such as Coinbase Global, Block, Marathon Digital, Bitfarms, and MicroStrategy, alongside other smaller allocations.





Despite its relative novelty in the market, the VanEck Crypto and Blockchain Innovators UCITS ETF has quickly gained traction among investors. It has emerged as one of the top-performing ETFs within VanEck Europe’s portfolio, ranking among the top 15 by assets under management. The fund’s performance has been marked by considerable volatility, distinguishing it from many other products offered by VanEck Europe.



BlackRock



BlackRock, the globe’s largest asset manager, submitted a proposal for a Bitcoin ETF to the SEC last June. The announcement has injected fresh enthusiasm into the crypto market, leading to a remarkable recovery.



The significance of BlackRock’s venture into the realm of Bitcoin ETFs extends beyond mere market dynamics. It serves as a validation of cryptocurrencies and underscores the broader trend within the global financial ecosystem towards embracing digital assets. The proposal not only reflects growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies but also suggests a shifting paradigm in how traditional finance views digital currencies as a legitimate asset class.





Earlier this year, the financial behemoth made headlines by launching its inaugural tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Dubbed the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, this initiative is fully backed by cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. The fund offers investors an opportunity to earn U.S. dollar yields within the crypto space, marking a significant milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets.



With BlackRock looking forward to its spot Ethereum ETF, this isn’t the first time BlackRock has dipped its toes into the crypto waters.



ARK Invest



ARK Invest and 21Shares have jointly registered a spot Ether ETF. This innovative fund has commenced trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange, leveraging the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate – New York Variant.



ARK always expects a “power law distribution” within the cryptocurrency market. This theory posits that a select few cryptocurrencies will emerge to dominate the majority of value and market share—a concept that could reshape investment strategies in the digital asset realm.





The registration of the spot Ether ETF marks a significant step forward in providing investors with regulated exposure to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The ETF is sponsored by 21Shares, with Delaware Trust Company serving as the trustee and Coinbase Custody Trust Company acting as the custodian.



Fidelity



As interest in cryptocurrency began to rise in the mid-2010s, Fidelity recognized the need to adapt to evolving investor preferences.



In response to the growing interest in cryptocurrency among investors, Fidelity, one of the largest asset managers and brokerages in the U.S., made a significant move into the digital currency space in mid-October 2018. The company launched Fidelity Digital Assets, a limited liability corporation aimed at serving institutional customers seeking exposure to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.





Fidelity Digital Assets offers a range of services tailored to institutional clients, including offline cold storage custody solutions and trade execution. Leveraging its position as a major financial services firm, Fidelity aims to provide comprehensive digital asset investment solutions to financial institutions.



Recognizing the potential of blockchain technology in the financial sector, Fidelity further expanded its commitment to cryptocurrency by tasking the Blockchain Incubator section of its research and development team, known as the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology (FCAT), with exploring cryptocurrency investing solutions for institutional investors.



Invesco Galaxy



Galaxy Asset Management, a prominent player in the global digital assets investment landscape, boasts an impressive $5.3 billion in assets under management (AUM). The firm stands out for its commitment to providing investors with institutional-grade access to the dynamic digital assets ecosystem. Offering a diverse suite of over a dozen investment vehicles, Galaxy caters to a wide range of investment preferences, including passive, active, and venture strategies.





Invesco Ltd., on the other hand, is an established American independent investment management company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. With branch offices spanning across 20 countries, Invesco has cemented its position as a key player in the financial services sector. Notably, its common stock is a constituent of the S&P 500 index and is actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).



Galaxy in partnership with Invesco to launch the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) in January. With their eyes on the crypto industry, they went ahead with the spot Ethereum ETF.



Hashdex



Hashdex has been carving pathways to prosperity since its establishment in 2018. With a mission to democratize access to the crypto ecosystem worldwide, Hashdex has garnered trust from investors, overseeing a substantial $849 million in client assets. These funds not only empower innovative investors but also facilitate their entry into the burgeoning crypto economy.



Among its notable ventures, Hashdex Group played a pivotal role in co-creating the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), aimed at furnishing global investors with a dependable benchmark for the ever-evolving crypto asset class. In a landmark move in 2021, the group introduced the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF (HNCI), marking the inception of the world’s premier crypto index ETF.





Managing the fund assets for the Bitcoin Futures ETF is Tidal Investments LLC, an entity entrusted with the responsibility of navigating the intricate landscape of crypto investments. With a steadfast dedication to bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto space, Hashdex continues to spearhead initiatives that pave the way for the mainstream adoption of digital assets.



Grayscale



Founded in 2013, Grayscale made its mark by launching a Bitcoin trust in the same year, marking its entry into the digital currency investment realm. In 2015, the company became a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, consolidating its position in the market. 



Notably, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust made history in 2015 by becoming the first publicly traded Bitcoin fund in the United States, trading over-the-counter on the OTCQX market. However, Grayscale’s fee structure, although higher than average compared to similar exchange-traded funds (ETFs), was justified by the company as necessary to cover the costs of trading Bitcoin.





Despite its pioneering efforts, Grayscale faced setbacks in its ambition to transition its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The company’s application in 2017 was met with negative feedback from the SEC, leading to a voluntary withdrawal. Nonetheless, perseverance paid off as Grayscale successfully completed the transformation after seven years.



Now, with its focus on Ethereum, Grayscale aims to capitalize on the growing interest in the cryptocurrency market. By pivoting towards spot ETFs for its Ethereum trust, Grayscale seeks to offer investors diversified opportunities to engage with digital assets in a regulated framework.



Franklin Templeton



Franklin Templeton, a stalwart in traditional finance circles, has taken a significant stride into the world of cryptocurrency, signaling a profound shift in the industry’s landscape. With a rich history spanning 77 years, the company boasts a staggering $1.5 trillion in assets under management, solidifying its position as a heavyweight in the asset management sector.



This embrace of crypto represents a departure from the traditional for Franklin Templeton, earning it the moniker of being “TradFi” incarnate. Earlier this year, the company made waves by launching the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC), joining the ranks of just ten spot Bitcoin ETFs presently listed in the United States.





In a bold display of its commitment to the crypto movement, Franklin Templeton adorned its iconic Ben Franklin logo with laser eyes, a symbol widely associated with fervent support for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.



Franklin Templeton has also set its sights on expanding its ETF portfolio to include Ether. Alongside several other firms, Franklin Templeton has submitted spot Ethereum ETF proposals to the SEC, signaling its intent to capitalize on the growing demand for exposure to digital assets beyond Bitcoin.



Challenges of Ethereum ETF Applications



Industry experts express doubts regarding the likelihood of approvals arriving in May, as initially scheduled, for various reasons. Foremost among these concerns is the current state of Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, which is undergoing a process called staking. Staking involves cryptocurrency holders locking up their funds as collateral to support the network’s operations, in return for rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency.



The potential classification of Ether as a security by the SEC) looms large, with significant implications not only for the token itself but also for the broader cryptocurrency markets. Should the SEC deem Ether security, it would necessitate compliance with securities laws, granting the SEC enhanced authority to regulate its trading and usage. Additionally, such a classification could pave the way for other cryptocurrencies to be labeled as securities, subjecting them to heightened regulatory scrutiny.



The prolonged delays in the SEC’s evaluation process have led industry experts to question the agency’s motives, drawing parallels with its historical approach in rejecting numerous Bitcoin (BTC) applications over the past decade. Consequently, the initial optimism surrounding Ethereum ETF applications has waned in recent weeks despite earlier forecasts predicting the approval of all filings by May 2024.



In light of the latest postponements by the SEC, analysts are now speculating that the regulatory body intends to reject all spot Ethereum ETF applications slated for review in May. This development marks a shift in sentiment within the industry, prompting stakeholders to reassess their expectations regarding the approval of Ethereum-based investment products.



Could There Be A Bright Future For Ethereum ETF Applications?



The SEC, notorious for its numerous delays in greenlighting spot Bitcoin ETFs, finds itself in a comparable predicament with spot Ethereum ETFs. Presently, the regulatory body is tasked with evaluating eight Ethereum ETF applications, each with distinct deadlines, awaiting their verdict.



The SEC’s current deadline to either approve or deny these spot Ethereum ETFs is set for the conclusion of May 2024. However, the SEC has extended its deadline for making a decision on the spot Ethereum ETF applications put forth by BlackRock and Fidelity. This extension stems partly from the SEC’s request for public input regarding the Fidelity and BlackRock ETF applications. Specifically, the SEC is soliciting public commentary on whether the proposed spot Ethereum ETFs might introduce vulnerabilities to market manipulation.



Ethereum ETF Applications: Is There Potential For New Breakthrough? 24



During the approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs, certain applicants took the initiative to submit revised documents to the SEC, aiming to integrate insights gleaned from the public comment period. Eventually, the SEC granted approval to those applications. Should spot Ethereum ETF applicants follow suit and update their submissions to assimilate feedback, it could signal a positive indication that the SEC might incline towards approving their applications.



Conclusion



Recent developments have fueled speculation and skepticism alike. Many wonder whether the SEC will follow its precedent set with Bitcoin and approve Ethereum ETFs, or if a different stance will emerge. The approval of the Bitcoin ETF served as a significant milestone, marking the first time a cryptocurrency-based ETF gained regulatory approval in the United States. However, Ethereum’s case presents its own unique set of considerations.



The SEC’s decision regarding spot Ethereum ETFs carries profound implications for the broader market. Approval could signal growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial systems. Conversely, a denial might dampen enthusiasm and prompt a reevaluation of the regulatory hurdles facing crypto-based financial products.

Why Is The Crypto Market Up Today?


The total market cap (TOTAL) along with Bitcoin (BTC) price observed recovery in the last 24 hours after the bearish few days. At the same time, Toncoin’s (TON) price also shot up by 16%, invalidating a crucial resistance. 
In the news today:-

Deutsche Bank Raised Concerns About Tether’s USDT, highlighting stability concerns. These concerns were in reference to Tether’s past regulatory issues.
Ripple, along with Hedera and Algorand, has become a founding member of the DerRec Alliance, which aims to simplify the process of securing and recovering digital assets and other secrets.

Total Market Cap Recovers
The total value of all cryptocurrencies was vulnerable to a decline below the support of $2.2 trillion. However, changing winds across the market resulted in a TOTAL recovery of 2.85%, adding more than $114 billion in a day.
At present, the total market capitalization is at $2.26 trillion, exhibiting the potential to flip $2.3 trillion and $2.4 trillion in resistance into support over the month.

However, since $2.3 trillion has acted as a strong resistance in the past, TOTAL could potentially witness a failed breach. This would keep the total market cap within the sub $2.2 trillion range.
Bitcoin Inches Close to $63,000
Bitcoin’s price witnessed considerable growth in a single day, which was rather necessary after the cryptocurrency nearly fell below $61,000. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $62,880, nearing the resistance at $63,720.
Flipping it into support would also enable a breakout from the bullish flag pattern and result in a rise to $65,000 and beyond.

However, if the breach fails, Bitcoin would remain stuck in the flag, potentially falling back to $61,000 or below.
Toncoin Posts a Green Candle
Toncoin’s price action was on the rise with the broader market cues as the altcoin marked a 16.61% growth in the span of 24 hours. In doing so, TON also breached through the crucial resistance marked at $6.5 to trade at $6.7 at the moment.

If the rally continues, Toncoin would be able to flip the resistance at $7 into support, provided it cements $6.5 as a support floor.

But if these conditions fail and TON falls below $6.5 again, the altcoin could note a drawdown to $6. This would result in the invalidation of the bullish thesis.

FTX Creditors Reject Amended Compensation Plan Citing Controversial Exculpatory Clause and Undervalued Bitcoin Payments



                    

FTX’s recent amended proposal, which includes an exculpatory clause, has met with significant backlash from its creditors. 



Released on May 7, the proposal is aimed at compensating the creditors, including a noteworthy figure of “billions in compensation.” However, the inclusion of an exculpatory clause has become a major point of contention.




This specific clause would absolve Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), the law firm managing FTX’s bankruptcy, from any liability for damages incurred during the bankruptcy process. 



S&C’s involvement in the company’s affairs, as it had previously served as outside counsel in various transactions, further complicates perceptions.



Sunil, a prominent FTX creditor and member of the FTX Customer Ad-Hoc Committee, which represents over 1,500 creditors, strongly criticized the clause. 




He highlighted that the clause would prevent S&C from being held accountable for potential misdeeds including “selling FTX assets at 70% to 90% discounts to their own clients and insiders.” 



On May 8, Sunil expressed his discontent on X, stating:



“S&C included an exculpation clause so they can not be held liable for misconduct — selling FTX assets at 70% to 90% discounts to their own clients and insiders (Ledger X, Galaxy), not restarting FTX 2.0, etc if we accept the plan.”



This controversy follows a lawsuit filed three months prior by top FTX creditors against S&C. 




The lawsuit accused the firm of actively participating in FTX’s “multibillion-dollar fraud” and profiting from these misdeeds. A February 16 court document illuminated the allegations:



“S&C knew of FTX US and FTX Trading Ltd.’s omissions, untruthful and fraudulent conduct, and misappropriation of Class Members’ funds. 



READ MORE: Coinbase Faces Class-Action Lawsuit Over Alleged Securities Deception



“Despite this knowledge, S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and so agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain.”



The financial ties are further underlined by the fact that FTX owed S&C up to $1.45 billion in legal bankruptcy fees, a figure confirmed by compensation filings from December 2023.



The response from FTX’s creditors has been overwhelmingly negative, especially concerning the proposal’s payment plan. 



While FTX debtors have suggested a compensation formula based on a depreciated Bitcoin valuation of $16,800, critics argue this is grossly unfair given Bitcoin’s price increase since FTX’s collapse. 



BitGo CEO Mike Belshe commented on the matter in a May 8 X post:



“0% of FTX creditors agree that receiving $16800 for your bitcoin is fully compensated. I understand why the bankruptcy process needs to work this way but let’s not pretend victims are getting their money back or that FTX wasn’t as awful as it was.”



Given these circumstances, there’s a significant possibility that the amended plan will be rejected by the creditors, as further indicated by Rob, Paradex’s head of growth and a pseudonymous FTX creditor, who voiced his decision to reject the plan on May 8:



“Icing on the cake from the team that destroyed billions of potential value for FTX customers. This can’t be allowed. I’m voting NO on this plan.”

Bitcoin Miners Subsidy Surged With Ordinals And Runes


                                Applications To Solve Bitcoin Miners Subsidy Problems                                IntroductionSatoshi Nakamoto is a mysterious creator of Bitcoin who started the blockchain and stated that miners would make money through transaction fees one day. He also envisioned that miners would keep making money as and when these programs get better and more popular, and keep strengthening Bitcoin Mining.Challenges Faced by Bitcoin MinersIn the Cryptocurrency market after every halving event, Bitcoin miners face problems because they always get fewer rewards. This could be bad news for miners dependent on Bitcoin transaction fees. In January 2023,  before applications like the Ordinals protocol launched, miners depended on transaction fees to earn extra money. With every halving, it was difficult for the miners to earn a subsidy as it halves 210000 blocks which blocks the miners' revenue and makes them earn hardly.Role of Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20The applications like Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20s could help miners to stick towards the events like halving. According to big cryptocurrency mining groups, these programs could change things for miners and let them earn Bitcoin Transaction Fees. However, the mining revenue can be increased with an increase in Bitcoin (BTC) prices. As the applications layer comes into the line, further developments can be done so which creates new and improved software and encourages more people to use Bitcoin for different purposes. This could expand the overall activity on the network. In short, increased network activity leads to more transactions and more transactions automatically generate more fees for miners. Even if Block subsidy decreases miners could maintain stability in income due to diversification of income.After 20th April 2024, a later Bitcoin halving event occurred, Miners got a big boost as  840,000 blocks were mined worth $2.4 million with transaction fees recorded at 37.6 BTC transaction fee. This also shows that programs like halving can help the miners.Fluctuations in Miners Rewards and Unexpected RewardsThe reward of the 40.7 BTC is divided into two parts block subsidy and transaction fees. The Block subsidy is a fixed reward received by miners after successfully mining a new block where the new subsidy was 3.125 BTC, which is the amount awarded to miners for each new block mined after a halving event. The Block subsidy came from Memecoin and Non-Fungible Tokens. Memecoin competing to "inscribe rare satoshis" and fungible tokens using a new token standard called Runes.Transaction fees on the Bitcoin network surpass certain milestones such as 30, 40, or even 50 BTC. However, they were surprised to receive such a substantial reward during the halving block. Bitcoin miners earned $78.3 million in revenue, collectively where transaction fees cover a large portion. The fees earned by Bitcoin miners exceeded those earned by Ethereum stalkers and Uniswap liquidity providers on nine out of the last 20 days since the halving occurred. As the Bitcoin network continues to evolve and attract more users, the demand for transactions and the associated fees are expected to rise. There are fluctuations in miner revenue due to popularity of protocols like ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 after the launch. These fluctuations introduced a kind of instability in miners' earnings. In 2016, big cryptocurrency mining groups gathered 3 halving events Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20s with block 840000 marked the 37534th block mined in 2900 days.  Miners from 118 countries help them out, showing how Bitcoin mining is a global effort and highlighting mining groups' role as significant players in the industry.Also Read: Bitcoin Recorded One Billion Transactions On Bitcoin Network

We asked ChatGPT what will be SHIB price in 2025; Here’s what it said


Like many other assets in the cryptocurrency sector, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been recording advances recently, adding up to its particularly successful year that saw it soar over 125%, and data compiled by the artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT suggests a wide trading range in the next year.
Indeed, Finbold asked ChatGPT-4, the most recent model of the OpenAI brainchild, to provide insights into the possible price range of Shiba Inu in 2025, taking into account expert opinions, historical price movements, indicators, and other relevant information from the viewpoint on May 10.
Shiba Inu price prediction
So, will Shiba Inu coin reach $1 any time soon? Not very likely, at least according to the information that ChatGPT has gathered from the internet’s most prominent crypto monitoring and forecasting websites. Nonetheless, a price increase is quite possible.


As it happens, the advanced generative AI tool has cited several such platforms, including CoinCodex, which has set a minimum price of SHIB to $0.000041 in 2025, “indicating a potential growth considering its current rate,” as ChatGPT further elaborated.
On top of that, it shared an even more bullish prognosis by WalletInvestor, which sees Shiba Inu on a “growth trajectory leading to $0.000061 in 2025, which suggests an upside potential or around 160% from its current price,” the AI chatbot observed.
Finally, it also provided a slightly less impressive, though still optimistic, forecast by Digital Coin Price, which has set the price of SHIB at $0.000029 by 2025, “demonstrating a 124% increase,” from its price at press time, as OpenAI’s celebrated product stated.
Furthermore, the bot offered a perspective that takes into account Shiba Inu’s all-time high (ATH) of $0.000039, which the popular dog meme token reached in October 2021 and hasn’t yet managed to surpass, even though many other assets in the crypto market have:

“SHIB saw an astronomical rise in 2021 but has experienced volatility typical of most cryptocurrencies. It’s important to consider that its historical peak was $0.000039, suggesting room for growth if market conditions are favorable.”

SHIB price analysis
For now, SHIB is trading at $0.00002335, marking a 3.56% increase on the day and adding up to the 1.51% advance across the past week, as the asset moves to recover from the 15.48% loss on its monthly chart while gaining 126.28% since the year’s turn.

Meanwhile, crypto expert and industry influencer Del Crxpto has recently declared that he knew inside Shiba Inu information that has led him to stock up on more SHIB, possibly referring to the fact that whatever major reveal was supposedly coming would trigger a SHIB rally.

All things considered, making specific SHIB price predictions is a challenging task, although insights provided by AI can help sort out and gauge the direction in which the crypto asset could move in the future. However, doing one’s own research and keeping up with any Shiba Inu news is essential.

'Asia's MicroStrategy' Metaplanet Tops up Bitcoin Portfolio in Latest Purchase

Metaplanet Inc, a Japanese publicly traded firm that hopes to recreate the legacies of MicroStrategy in Asia, has acquired another tranche of Bitcoin (BTC). In an announcement shared on X, the firm has acquired a new tranche of 18.8698 BTC.The purchase was made on April 23, and it is valued at an aggregate amount of 200 million yen ($1.2 million). With this acquisition, the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings now come in at 117.7217 Bitcoin worth 10,193,536 yen per BTC. This Bitcoin bag is worth 1.2 billion yen, or $7,708,020. When Metaplanet started acquiring Bitcoin back in April, it triggered positive sentiment in Asia’s investment landscape. This sentiment was ignited in the United States back in August 2020, when MicroStrategy made its first Bitcoin purchase. Today, MicroStrategy is the second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin after BlackRock Inc.Under the leadership of its Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy stacks Bitcoin regularly. Its last buy-up came in March when it acquired 12,000 BTC for $821.7 million. At the moment, the firm now holds a total of 214,246 tokens valued at around $14 billion. As U.Today reported earlier, MicroStrategy’s unrealized gain on its Bitcoin bet now comes in at $6.2 billion.MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach involves selling Convertible Senior Notes with the proceeds injected into the asset. Thus far, the move has paid off, and it remains unclear how long Metaplanet plans to sustain its strategy.Since Metaplanet joined the Bitcoin bandwagon, the price of BTC has generally slumped amid erratic sell-offs. However, with new mainstream firms reporting Bitcoin bets, bullish optimism has largely returned to the market. At the time of writing, the coin is seeing a mild recovery, up 3.14% in 24 hours to $62,907.50. With Metaplanet borrowing MicroStrategy’s playbook, it is likely to record similar bullish returns in the long term.

Currently, the value of BTCs is approximately 7.397 Million dollars.


In their statement, Metaplanet officials said that the company's purchase of Bitcoin is not just a financial decision or investment. Believing that the BTC move will make the company a pioneer in the field of finance, Metaplanet said that by adopting Bitcoin, it aims to be a pioneer in Japan's digital finance field and the adoption of cryptocurrencies.
Metaplanet also thinks that established and important companies like themselves purchasing Bitcoin could increase confidence among investors and help the cryptocurrency market grow.

Controversial Ohio Commencement Speech Sparks Crypto Debate


							

Public reaction at Ohio State highlights the gap between crypto enthusiasts and broader understanding.



Effective communication is critical for bridging the gap between cryptocurrency fans and skeptics.



Stagnation in the crypto business requires fresh narratives and innovations to propel development.




As per Bloomberg report, the commencement speech at THE Ohio State University took a controversial twist as crypto entrepreneur Chris Pan’s remarks on Bitcoin were met with boos and jeers from the graduating class of 2024. 



Pan, who considers himself as a social entrepreneur, tried to explain the advantages of Bitcoin saying that it is an under-appreciated asset class because of the decentralized and finite nature. He highlighted current events, like the launches of Bitcoin ETFs by BlackRock and Fidelity, as the actual proof of cryptocurrency’s current mainstream acceptance and viability.



However, Pan’s speech backfired, highlighting a glaring disconnect between the crypto community and the broader public. While crypto enthusiasts often tout Bitcoin’s popularity among digital-native Gen Z, the negative reaction at the graduation ceremony suggests otherwise. This incident underscores the challenges crypto faces in gaining widespread acceptance and understanding.



Pan later clarified that his intention was not to promote Bitcoin, claiming he had only started learning about the cryptocurrency three months prior. He expressed regret for not emphasizing this point in his speech to make it more relatable to the audience. Despite the backlash, some argue that any publicity, even negative, could benefit the crypto industry, especially as it faces a lull in momentum.









Moreover, Pan emphasized that while some may assume he’s been immersed in the field for a decade, his actual entry coincided with the introduction of ETFs. Pan admitted he should have clarified this point to foster better understanding among the audience. He acknowledged that mentioning “Bitcoin” triggered a negative response, causing the subsequent points he made to fall flat. This experience, he noted, served as a valuable lesson for him. 



The cryptocurrency sector, which was previously fueled by many storylines and breakthroughs, is currently experiencing a period of stagnation. Projects that previously brought in billions of dollars are now suffering, and the industry is wondering where the next wave of users will come from. With prior storylines fading, the future of cryptocurrency remains unknown.

Jack Dorsey Issues Most Bullish BTC Forecast Yet, Says Price May Hit $1M By 2030



Dorsey’s bullish outlook for the long-term price action of Bitcoin borders on the collaborative nature of its ecosystem.

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has issued a rather reaching Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction after claiming that the asset’s value should hit $1 million by the year 2030. He shared this in a Thursday interview with Pirate Wires’ Mike Solana, adding that there is every possibility that the price will grow even further from that point onward.
Dorsey’s bullish outlook for the long-term price action of Bitcoin borders on the collaborative nature of its ecosystem. According to him, even that is more interesting about Bitcoin than its price or its rich history. The head of the financial services firm Block explained how the ecosystem functions in a way that rewards collaboration, to ultimately improve the network for everyone involved. About Bitcoin and its ecosystem,  Dorsey said partly:




“…Anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves, everyone who puts any effort in to make it better, is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up.”
Jack Dorsey’s BTC Prediction
Interestingly, Dorsey is now one of the very few people who have made such elaborate predictions about the coveted crypto asset. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood has issued similar predictions in the past about Bitcoin hitting the $1 million mark by 2030. However, she got even more bullish in March, during an interview on the New Zealand Herald’s Markets with Madison online video show. In that interview, Wood said for the first time that a million-dollar-plus Bitcoin could happen before her past estimate of 2030.
It also appears that Dorsey’s views are borne out of personal conviction and not just for public records. Earlier this month, he shared, in a note to shareholders, that his fintech firm Block will pump 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin-related products back into buying more BTC every month.
For Dorsey, $1 million is the least price achievable for BTC by 2030, and from there, it can only go upwards.
Departure from BlueSky
On May 6, reports filtered through that Dorsey was leaving the board of Bluesky, the decentralized social network he co-founded as an alternative to Twitter in 2019. However, he has now touched on the topic in this same interview, sharing what was the reason for his decision.
Dorsey claims that BlueSky was “literally repeating all the mistakes [Twitter] made”. In his opinion, the idea of true decentralization is lost in the protocol. Hence, it is just another app.

Coinbase to Take the Reins as BlockFi Announces Shutdown


On May 9, BlockFi, which was a popular crypto lending platform, announced the closure of its web platform. It is partnering with Coinbase, a US-based crypto exchange, to manage and distribute assets. However, BlockFi has not yet announced a specific shutdown date.
This move is a significant pivot for BlockFi. It has been navigating a complex financial situation since its late 2023 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.
What’s Next for BlockFi Customers?
According to the official statement, BlockFi will email clients detailed instructions on creating a Coinbase account. This will facilitate the transition. Clients who didn’t withdraw their digital assets by April 28, 2024, at 23:59 UTC and didn’t complete identity verification by May 10, 2024, at 23.59 UTC, will find their assets available in kind at Coinbase.

“For BlockFi clients who are unable to open a Coinbase account, all distributions will be made in cash, pursuant to the provisions of the Plan that require cash distributions where crypto distributions are not feasible,” BlockFi added.

BlockFi also encourages all clients to download their transaction history and other relevant documents.

Furthermore, the Plan Administrator can now choose Coinbase for future distributions. This includes any funds recovered from FTX.

BlockFi’s web platform shutdown announcement follows FTX revealing its updated repayment plan. The plan includes BlockFi as a “key stakeholder.”
FTX’s repayment to BlockFi will be based on the previously approved settlement. BlockFi reached a principal settlement with FTX and Alameda Research in March this year.
Under the settlement terms, FTX has pledged to prioritize a $250 million payment to BlockFi. This initial amount is part of a larger $874 million settlement. The settlement aims to compensate BlockFi for assets held on the FTX exchange and loans to Alameda Research.
This settlement stems from a close relationship between BlockFi and FTX. After the FTX fiasco in November 2022, BlockFi suspended withdrawals for its customer’s funds.

BlockFi stated it was severely affected by FTX’s collapse. Nonetheless, it’s crucial to note that BlockFi was FTX’s biggest creditor.

Exodus CEO frustrated as SEC delays listing amid celebrations

Exodus Movement, Inc. (Exodus) is facing a delay in its NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) American listing pending completion of the SEC’s review of its registration statement — which went into effect on April 28.The NYSE American previously approved the listing of Exodus’ shares of Class A common stock at a par value of $0.000001, expected to begin trading on May 9. However, due to the backpedal, Exodus’ transition from the OTCQX to the NYSE American will be put on hold until the SEC completes its regulatory compliance process.Source: https://twitter.com/exodus_io/status/1788403755160944799The delay in listing carries heavy implications for Exodus as the move to NYSE American would affect its visibility and potential financial market growth. This regulatory hurdle demonstrates a bottleneck crypto companies face when pursuing traditional finance (TradFi) regulated ventures. Exodus CEO, JP Richardson, expressed his surprise and confusion at the delay, stating:“We remain hopeful that the SEC will follow through on its commitment to treat us as the law intends. Exodus has been fully transparent and responsive throughout this process and we expect a swift resolution in this matter. In the meantime, we will continue to provide the best possible service and value for our customers and shareholders.” Richardson later explained that numerous employees and their families had gathered in New York City “to celebrate the moment.” “Every step of the way we’ve played by the regulatory rules given, and then at the 11th hour, the rules of the game were changed. It’s beyond frustrating” he said.Source: https://twitter.com/jprichardson/status/1788655686789824901Exodus explained that it may reconsider the decision to list again post-SEC review, depending upon the outcome, and that stockholders do not need to take any action at this time.Entrepreneur and crypto personality Lark Davis commented on the situation, stating that the SEC are “probably about to sue.” Source: https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1788494152537358755Though potentially satirical in nature, Davis’ comment does highlight concerns within the crypto community — heightened by the recent United States House of Representatives vote to nullify the SEC’s anti-crypto banking guidance, SAB 121. The bipartisan bill, dubbed H.J.Res.109, was put to the House by Republican Party Representative Mike Flood and passed on May 8. Passing 228 to 182 votes, Flood described the SAB 121 as unfair on banks seeking crypto custody, due to custodial assets always being considered “off-balance sheet.”These legislative endeavours reflect upon the tension growing between financial institutions and regulatory entities as the crypto market progressively attempts to enter TradFi.

How to securely store crypto in software wallets

Software wallets enable crypto users to access digital assets at any time and from any location. However, the same connectivity also makes these wallets vulnerable to hacks and thefts. The security of software wallets is dependent on the user’s compliance with advised digital safety procedures and the wallet’s built-in security measures.Digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) face a plethora of security issues, such as malware designed to steal money and phishing schemes that try to obtain critical data. One needs to cultivate an adequate understanding of security standards to use software wallets safely.This article describes what software wallets are and how to choose the right software wallet. It discusses the process of installing a software wallet and how to manage it securely.Choosing the right software walletOne needs to be aware of the software wallets available and how they function to make an informed decision.Software wallets use private and public keys to facilitate the transmission, storage and management of digital assets. Public keys enable users to receive cryptocurrencies as wallet addresses, whereas private keys authorize transactions. While hardware wallets store funds physically, software wallets offer a digital interface to digital assets stored on the blockchain. Software wallets are broadly categorized into three types: desktop, mobile and web wallets. Desktop walletsA desktop wallet — e.g., Exodus — is basically an application that enables the user to securely store and manage private keys on a computer. If one sends or receives crypto payments frequently, a desktop wallet is a convenient option. Users connect desktop wallets to the internet when they need to make a transaction. They are usually noncustodial, which means that although the funds are fully in the control of the user, the onus to keep private keys secure is also on them.Mobile walletsA mobile wallet — e.g., Trust Wallet — is an application designed to be installed on a smartphone to access and operate digital assets. Such a wallet is convenient for on-the-go use and supports QR code scanning. Mobile wallets developed by a crypto exchange have the additional functionality of integration with the exchange.Web walletsWeb wallets — e.g., MetaMask — which are accessible via browsers, store private keys on a server. These wallets allow one to access their funds on the go, which makes them very convenient; however, there is an inherent security risk, as the keys are always online and the control is with a third party (a crypto exchange or enterprise). One needs to get a software wallet that facilitates ease of transactions while also adequately protecting their crypto holdings. The characteristics of various kinds of wallets need to be taken into account when choosing a crypto wallet.What to consider when selecting a software walletOne needs to factor in several aspects when choosing a software wallet:Security featuresTo deal with threat vectors, one needs to consider security features such as support for multiple signatures and two-factor authentication (2FA). As bad actors keep coming up with innovative ways to breach the security layer, the software wallet should get regular security upgrades.Supported cryptocurrenciesExplore the cryptocurrencies that the software wallet will accept. To avoid getting a new wallet every time to trade or store a currency, it is better to opt for a wallet that is compatible with a large number of digital assets.User interface (UI)Wallets with an easy-to-use UI enhance the user experience. Regardless of one’s level of skill, such wallets make managing digital assets simple.Setting up a software walletOne needs to set up the software wallet before they begin working with it. Here is the process of setting up a software wallet:Use the right sourceUsers need to make sure they download the official wallet from its official website, the App Store or the Google Play Store; otherwise, they could become vulnerable to phishing scams. They should double-check the website’s URL to confirm its legitimacy.Follow the installation instructions Whether it is a desktop, mobile or web application, the process should be straightforward. The user needs to give the necessary permissions when prompted, ensuring their device aligns with the wallet’s functionality. How to enhance software wallet securityTo ensure the secure storage of cryptocurrencies in software wallets, adopting advanced security practices is paramount: Store the seed phrase securelyWhen setting up the software wallet, the user needs to generate their seed phrase, which they could later need to access their crypto assets. It is a series of words that act as a master key to accessing funds. It is important for the user to keep it confidential, as anyone with access to the seed phrase will have access to funds. In the event one loses the seed phrase, the funds are irretrievable (if they also cannot remember their login password). In case the user loses access to the device or something breaks, they can restore access using the seed phrase. Use of password managersKeeping strong passwords for all financial applications is important. However, it creates another problem, as most find it hard to remember the different passwords they use on various websites. Password managers simplify the process of using and managing strong passwords. These applications keep wallet passwords in an encrypted vault that is secured with a master password.Password managers usually come with strong password generation features, which strengthen security by creating unique and difficult passwords. Moreover, the encryption implemented by these managers makes it exceedingly unlikely for unauthorized individuals to access stored data without the master password, which augments the protection.Two-factor authentication (2FA)Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional security layer that goes beyond conventional login and password systems. Once users activate 2FA on software wallets, they might have to enter two different codes received via two different modes of communication in order to be verified. For instance, they might receive one code via email and another via smartphone. The application will grant access to the user only when they have entered the password and the two codes correctly. Even in the case that an attacker obtains the password, they are unlikely to get access to the email and the mobile device at the same time. The dual-verification system strengthens security against unauthorized access attempts. Multisignature walletsWallets with multiple signatures employ a cooperative security mechanism that requires consent from designated individuals prior to executing a transaction. This approach provides robust security to protect funds from abuse or unapproved access. Requiring independent approval from a predefined number of participants for each transaction provides a strong barrier against unauthorized activity.This method works well for any group that manages shared cryptocurrency holdings since it segregates the duty of safeguarding the wallet’s contents and improves security. By virtue of their joint authorization, multisignature wallets reduce the possibility of single points of failure.Biometric authenticationBiometrics in crypto wallets introduces an additional layer of security, ensuring that getting access to funds simply becomes improbable without the physical presence of the user. The mechanism leverages physical characteristics such as fingerprints, face IDs or iris scans to authenticate users. Integration of biometric authentication in crypto wallets effectively mitigates the vulnerabilities associated with password-based systems. The user experience becomes more convenient, as they can securely access their funds with a simple scan or touch. Update softwareThe user needs to keep their wallet software updated. Developers frequently release updates to patch vulnerabilities, add features, and improve security. A crypto wallet that isn’t regularly updated is more likely to fall prey to hackers’ tactics.Verify the authenticity of websitesThe user needs to be cognizant of phishing attempts and malicious websites that aim to steal information from their device. They need to verify the authenticity of the websites they browse before entering any sensitive information regarding their crypto wallet.Avoid public WiFiWhen accessing a wallet or conducting transactions, one needs to use a secure and private internet connection. Public WiFi networks are often unsecured, making them hotspots for attackers looking to intercept data. Find the balance between security and convenienceSettling somewhere between security and convenience is important when it comes to software wallets.One needs to select a reliable software wallet, protect recovery phrases, and be on top of potential security threats. Ticking all these checkpoints will ensure the security of one’s digital assets.

X launches AI-curated audiences for advertisers

The business account for social media platform X announced a new feature for advertisers enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI). On May 10, the platform said its “AI Audience” feature will be coming soon. This feature will allow advertisers to briefly describe their target audience for the given ad, then allow X’s AI systems to generate a pool of “the most relevant X users” to that target in a matter of seconds.  


It gave the example of a user inputting the target audience as “Technology Leaders” with the description “users who are leaders in technology.” In seconds, the AI generated a list with hundreds of users in the target audience, along with statistics for the demographic. The post was reposted by X owner Elon Musk, though without any additional comment on the development. Meanwhile, in response to the initial post, one user commented that this would be a “gamer changer” for the world of advertising and “value for your money” on the platform. He questioned, however, how good the AI is at targeting accurate audiences. If the AI proves efficient over time at correctly identifying target audiences, this move could put X ahead of other platforms when it comes to advertising, as other platforms would still require research for targeting correct audiences. However, other users were concerned about the AI reinforcing and perpetuating biases and stereotypes. Source: Crypto SignalsAnother user questioned what exactly X is selling and “to whom.” The user said, “I thought I am the one paying so X doesn’t have to pimp me to brands and sell me to corporations.” Despite some skepticism, many users called the development “exciting” and “really smart.” Related: Elaborate Elon Musk deepfake crypto fraud uncovered in Hong KongThis development comes amid Musk’s proactive stance on integrating AI into the social media platform. On March 26, Musk announced that X’s own AI model, Grok, would be accessible to all premium X subscribers. On March 29, the next version of the model, Grok-1.5, was announced. It is said to have “improved reasoning capabilities” and a context length of 128,000 tokens.Amid a lawsuit between Musk and OpenAI, with which he formerly had ties, on March 11, the X owner said that he would be making Grok open-source.Although Musk’s AI company xAI has been actively developing new tools for mass use, in January, Musk denied the accuracy of a report that claimed xAI had secured $500 million of its $1 billion investment goal.Magazine: How to stop the artificial intelligence apocalypse: David Brin, Uplift author

Kraken counters SEC’s legal interpretation in dismissal motion

In its legal defense against a lawsuit from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Kraken has filed a reply refuting the agency's allegations of trading unregistered securities, arguing that the case lacks precision and misinterprets fundamental legal concepts.In its response filing, Kraken identifies discrepancies in the SEC’s argument, noting the agency’s failure to accurately identify investment contracts traded on the exchange. Additionally, Kraken argues that the SEC’s use of terms like “investment concept” and “ecosystem” instead of “investment contract” and “enterprise” reflects a misunderstanding of the case’s legal framework.The SEC initially sued Kraken in November 2023, alleging it unlawfully made millions of dollars from “crypto asset securities” transactions and provided “exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency” services without having registered with the agency “as required by law.” This was months after settling charges over Kraken’s former staking service.Kraken’s reply to the SEC in support of the motion to dismiss. Source: CourtListenerHowever, Kraken filed a motion to dismiss, contending that it establishes a “dangerous precedent” for the agency’s jurisdiction. In response, the SEC filed a 39-page opposition to Kraken’s motion to dismiss, saying, “It is simply not the case that this enforcement action exceeds the authority Congress granted the SEC.”In the Thursday, May 9 motion, Kraken contests the SEC’s claim that written contracts are required in investment agreements, emphasizing that contracts can be oral, expressed or implied. Kraken argues that the SEC’s efforts to refute unaddressed arguments indicate a misunderstanding of the case’s central points.Related: SEC has taken ‘too expansive’ a view of crypto, says former commissionerKraken references past SEC cases involving initial coin offerings to support its stance. The exchange emphasized that these cases centered on contractual rights and obligations, supporting Kraken’s view of investment contracts. Kraken’s motion hinges on interpreting the SEC’s jurisdiction using the Howey test, which defines a security based on specific criteria, such as the investment of capital in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit, driven by the efforts of others.The U.S. Congress is currently deliberating on crypto regulation with several ongoing bills. Concurrently, eight state attorneys general in the U.S. have filed a joint amicus brief, contending that the SEC exceeded its delegated authority in the lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.Magazine: ‘Crypto is inevitable’ so we went ‘all in’ — Meet Vance Spencer, permabull

Top Bitcoin (BTC) Predictions: Renewed Bull Run or a Plunge Below $55K?


																TL;DR

Bitcoin has rebounded past $63,000 with predictions suggesting it might reach near $110,000 by the end of the year, influenced by factors like the recent halving which typically precede major rallies.
While some analysts expect potential drops, prominent figures project extremely optimistic long-term values for Bitcoin, with forecasts up to $1 million.


BTC’s Next Possible Move?
After trading in the red for a few days, the primary cryptocurrency headed north on May 10, surpassing the $63,000 mark. Many analysts believe the uptick will continue in the following months and lead to unseen peaks.
One person supporting that thesis is the popular X user Titan of Crypto. The trader observed the Fibonacci circles on BTC’s price chart, assuming that the cycle’s top of almost $110,000 may occur by the end of this year. 
“It’s a conservative price prediction. I think it’ll exceed it,” the analyst added.
Captain Faibik and Mikybull Crypto were also bullish. The former claimed that BTC is still in a consolidation phase and a breakout “is just a matter of time.” The trader predicted that the next green wave will push the asset’s value to $78,000.
Mikybull Crypto suggested that Bitcoin is in “final preparation for a post-halving massive rally.” Recall that the asset’s latest halving (which slashed the rewards to miners for validating blocks on the blockchain in half) occurred less than a month ago. 




The event has historically resulted in a huge resurgence for the entire cryptocurrency market, with many industry participants expecting the same scenario in the coming months.
It is worth noting that some analysts outlined somewhat bearish predictions. Such is the example of Michael van de Poppe, who believes BTC could drop to the $52,000-$55,000 range should it plunge below the major support zone of $61,000.
The Ultimate Bulls
Other prominent figures, including Robert Kiyosaki, Adam Back, Michael Saylor, and Cathie Wood, have presented much more optimistic BTC price forecasts over the past few years.
Two months ago, the author of the best-seller “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” projected that the asset’s value could soar to $300,000 by the end of 2024. He later changed his prediction to $100,000.
Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, chipped in six months ago, envisioning a rally to a whopping $700,000 in the near future. He also assumed that BTC’s market cap may surpass that of physical gold. As of the moment, the cryptocurrency’s market cap stands at approximately $1.25 trillion, whereas the yellow metal has almost $16 trillion.
The most bullish predictions came from Michael Saylor (Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy) and Cathie Wood (CEO of Ark Invest). They both see BTC trading at $1 million sometime in the future.

Pair linked to crypto investor kidnapping hand themselves in


A father-son duo handed themselves over to Hong Kong police on Wednesday after their family car was linked to the kidnapping of a crypto investor.  
According to the South China Morning Post, the 55-year-old crypto investor was reportedly taken from her car by four captors and bundled into the back of the car on Tuesday. She was with her husband at the time, but he was reportedly attacked with a stun gun when he tried to intervene. 
A source familiar with the case told the SCMP on Thursday that a 70-year-old businessman and his 30-year-old son were arrested at Tai Po Police Station the next day. They told SCMP that the businessman invested HK$15 million ($1.9 million) in crypto 18 months ago through the kidnapped woman.

According to the source, after investing, the businessman was apparently unable to retrieve his money or contact the woman. 
The source stressed that the arrested father-son duo were not the captors involved with the kidnapping. Police say they are still searching for more suspects.  
The father-son duo were reportedly arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment and assault and were still being questioned on Thursday morning.

Jack Dorsey Predicts Bitcoin Price To Hit At Least $1M By 2030: 'Hits That Number And Goes Beyond' - Benzinga

Jack Dorsey, Former CEO of social media giant Twitter, now X, made a super bullish prediction for Bitcoin BTC/USD, describing it as a fascinating ecosystem and movement. What Happened: Responding to a question posed by journalist Mike Solana on his Pirate Wires site about Bitcoin's price in 2030, Dorsey said he expects the digital asset to hit “at least a million,” and go beyond. The entrepreneur who set up one of the biggest social networks noted that Bitcoin's price isn't the most interesting aspect of the asset, but how it is expanding due to coordinated efforts by different stakeholders. “I don’t know. Over… at least a million. I do think it hits that number and goes beyond.”"The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up," Dorsey remarked. Through the course of the conversation, Dorsey made more references to Bitcoin, at one instance praising its decentralized ideals. "It’s like Bitcoin, it doesn't have one leader or one central chokehold element. And I think that’s critical for what it's intended to do."Why It Matters: The world's largest digital asset has jumped 50% since the year began, with optimism buoyed significantly by the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs. With easier access to the cryptocurrency market, institutional investors have jumped on the bandwagon, leading to $11.76 billion in cumulative net inflows into these products, according to SoSo Value. The soaring interest has led many influential names to come up with predictions that are, at times, unrealistic. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently forecasted that one Bitcoin would hit $3.8 million by 2030. Note that Ark Invest operates its own Bitcoin spot ETF, which has attracted $2 billion in net inflows as of this writing. As a result, her estimates may involve a conflict of interest.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading closer to $63,000, following a 2.73% growth in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Telegram-Linked Toncoin Price Soars, But So Do Scams As Hackers Steal $140K Worth Of Tokens From Unsuspecting UsersImage Via Shutterstock

Here’s When Bitcoin Could Bottom Out Based on Historical Precedent, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen - The Daily Hodl


								Widely followed crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen is offering his outlook on when Bitcoin (BTC) could potentially bottom out as the flagship digital asset hovers around $63,000.
In a new video update, Cowen tells the 801,000 subscribers of his YouTube channel that the current Bitcoin price action resembles that which followed the crypto king’s second halving event eight years ago more so than the halving in 2020.










“It looks to me like it’s mimicking 2016 a lot more than the other two cycles, which kind of makes sense. I mean a lot of people who’ve been following Bitcoin for a while have been comparing this cycle more so to the 2016 cycle than the one in 2020.”
Source: Benjamin Cowen/X
According to Cowen, the flagship crypto asset could potentially hit the cycle bottom over the coming weeks based on the Bitcoin Return on Investment (ROI) After Halving metric. The Bitcoin ROI After Halving metric is the ratio of the current price relative to the price of BTC at the time of halving. The latest halving, which cuts miners’ rewards in half every four years, occurred on April 19th.
“If you look at 2016, which might be relevant to compare to, you can see that Bitcoin didn’t durably get back above an ROI of one until about three and a half months after the halving.
And I don’t know if it’s going to play out like that or not, but you can see that that would be more evidence of a summer low. That could potentially be more evidence for a summer low if you look at Bitcoin’s ROI as a measure from the halving and compare it to the 2016 cycle.”

Bitcoin is trading for $62,798 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Metaplanet Increases Bitcoin Holdings, Acquiring Additional 19.87 BTC | Coinspeaker



Metaplanet’s shift to Bitcoin is a significant step for the crypto community; it signals a growing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Metaplanet, a Japan-based Web3 company, recently announced that it has purchased additional Bitcoin worth ¥200 million, which is equivalent to $1.25 million.
This move by the company follows up on its recent acquisition of the digital asset towards the end of last month. Just a few weeks ago, the Japanese company announced that it had acquired ¥1 Billion worth of BTC, which is about $6.25 million. Although the latest purchase is quite lower than the previous one, it is still a move toward establishing itself as a major force in the digital asset industry.




According to the post on its X page, Metaplanet purchased 19.87 BTC at an average price of 10,065,548 yen per Bitcoin, amounting to 200 million yen. In the released ‘Progress of Disclosure,’ the company stated that its current total BTC holdings are around 117.7 BTC. This investment strategy demonstrates the Japan-based company’s confidence in the coin’s growth and long-term viability and its potential to be widely accepted as a legitimate asset.
Metaplanet announced in early April that it would be embracing BTC as its core treasury asset, which further demonstrates the company’s goal of keeping up with trends and innovation within the finance space. It also positions the company as a leader in the digital finance era and a pioneer in the adoption of virtual assets in Japan. The post stated:
“Our transition to Bitcoin is a significant milestone in our mission to lead in the digital finance era and positions Metaplanet as a pioneer in the adoption of digital assets in Japan. Stay tuned!”
Institutional Investment to Boost Bitcoin Legitimacy and Price
It could be recalled that after the company announced its first acquisition of $6.56 million worth of Bitcoin, an instant effect was seen in its stock price, which surged 90% in just 48 hours. As of now, its price has increased by over 3% in 24 hours, which also reflects the positive impact of the growing influence of cryptocurrencies on the traditional financial market.
Just as Metaplanet’s stock value is increasing, BTC has seen a rise from the slump it experienced earlier, when it dropped to $56,000. With the price still hoping for a major recovery, it currently trades at around $62,000—also a 3% increase in the last 24 hours.
Metaplanet’s shift to Bitcoin is a significant step for the crypto community; it signals a growing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Hence, as more Web3 companies move their assets to the BTC, its legitimacy will be strengthened as a store of value and a hedge over inflation. More so, the influx of large institutions into the crypto sector will also have an impact on the price of this digital asset, which will propel its value to surge more.

Is 'undervalued' ARB's bottom finally in? Metrics say... - AMBCrypto



ARB’s key metric presented a buying opportunity on the charts
Bearish sentiments retained dominance across the market though

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio of leading Layer 2 (L2) token Arbitrum [ARB] has flashed a buy signal on the charts. In fact, AMBCrypto found that the native token’s MVRV ratio assessed over the 30-day and 365-day moving averages returned negative values, at press time.
Source: Santiment
An asset’s MVRV ratio tracks the difference between its current market price and the average price of every coin or token acquired for that asset. 
When its value is positive and above one, the asset is said to be overvalued. This means that the asset’s current market value is significantly higher than the price at which most investors acquire their holdings. Conversely, a negative MVRV value shows that the asset is undervalued. It suggests that the market value of the asset in question is below the average purchase price of all its tokens that are in circulation. 
It is regarded as a perfect time to buy when an asset’s MVRV ratio is negative because, at that point, the asset trades at a discount relative to its historical cost basis.
No price bottom in sight
A good indicator of whether an asset’s price is due for a rally is when a local price bottom has been reached. This is correctly measured by assessing metrics such as an asset’s Age Consumed.
This metric measures the movement of dormant tokens. For its part, ARB’s Age Consumed metric has projected slightly low values since the beginning of May. 
Source: Santiment
Here, it is important this because it offers insight into the shifts in the behavioral patterns of the token’s long-term holders. This group of ARB holders rarely moves their old coins around, and when they do, it often precipitates a shift in market trends. 
When ARB’s Age Consumed metric spikes, it means that many tokens are changing hands after being left idle for an extended period. On the other hand, when it falls, it means that idle coins are left unmoved. 

Realistic or not, here’s ARB’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Since the beginning of May, ARB’s Age Consumed has returned low values – A sign that its long-term holders have barely moved their tokens around. 
This could also indicate that a price bottom is yet to be reached. Ergo, traders should tread with caution, despite the buy signal flashed by ARB’s MVRV ratio.
Additionally, ARB’s price movements observed on the 1-day chart revealed that bearish sentiments remain significant. 
Source: ARB/USDT on TradingView
At press time, ARB’s price rested below its 20-day simple moving average (SMA), confirming the risk of further decline.
When an asset’s price falls below its 20-day SMA, it suggests that the short-term trend for the asset is downward. Traders interpret this as a sign that sellers are in control and that the asset’s price will likely continue declining.
Likewise, the token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) returned a value of 37.31 – A sign that market participants have been favoring ARB distribution over its accumulation.

Toncoin investors get opportunity with Notcoin: Is Bitbot next? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Toncoin price surged by more than 13% amid news around new project Notcoin (NOT).
Binance and OKX among exchanges to list NOT token.
Bitbot could be the game-changer for Telegram crypto traders

As Toncoin (TON) gains ahead of the upcoming Notcoin (NOT) trading debut, investors keen on the Telegram ecosystem have their eyes on Bitbot – a potentially market-defining solution that’s attracting massive attention in its ongoing presale.
Here’s more about Notcoin and what makes Bitbot (BITBOT) a likely contender for the next big thing in the Telegram crypto space.
Toncoin gains as Binance, OKX announce Notcoin listing
Toncoin’s emergence as a top altcoin continues and the price of TON is making another huge leap to enhance this outlook.
As highlighted previously, Toncoin has gained a lot of momentum due to developments around Telegram, the leading cross-platform messaging app with over 900 million users.
In recent weeks and months, TON price has surged after news that venture capital firm Pantera Capital was making an investment in the TON blockchain. Stablecoin giant Tether’s launch of USDT on the blockchain sparked a 18% spike in April, while Telegram’s support for TON payouts from ads for channel owners was also a big catalyst for TON price.
This state of the TON blockchain is encouraging investors and could catalyse further gains for the Telegram-related coin.
In the past 24 hours, TON price has gained by more than 14% to reach highs of $6.91. That’s about 10% off Toncoin’s all-time high of $7.63 reached on April 11 this year.
What is Notcoin (NOT)?
Notcoin is a community token on Telegram that has gained widespread adoption amid a viral Web3 game. NOT is the native token that allows users to explore, play, and contribute to the project’s growth.
Two of the world’s largest crypto exchanges by trading volume – Binance and OKX – have announced support for NOT. The token will be listed for trading on these and other exchanges on May 16, with OKX opening NOT deposits on May 10 at 3:00 am UTC.
Binance has added NOT as the 54th project on its Launchpool, allowing the community to farm NOT by staking BNB and FDUSD.
One notable thing is that Notcoin has a total supply of 102,719,221,714, and circulating supply when NOT lists will be 100% of total supply.
As anticipation for Notcoin’s trading debut builds, Toncoin is likely to rise amid investors rush to grab a potential gem.
Bitbot: Is this the “next big thing” in crypto?
Bitbot’s entry into the market could change the game for cryptocurrency traders looking to tap into an AI-powered trading bot.
At the core of its potential dominance is the combination of advanced institutional grade trading tools and the world’s first non-custodial trading solution.
Bitbot stands out as users have full control of their wallets, private keys and assets, which is not the case with other bots. This feature means Bitbot has user security as a top priority and traders are eagerly anticipating its launch after the presale ends.
What else makes Bitbot stand out?
The excitement that surrounds Bitbot could also be related to the Gem Scanner. What this AI-powered tool does is to leverage artificial intelligence to pick potential opportunities.
The platform’s unique revenue-sharing mechanism, which provides for 50% of app fees to be distributed to BITBOT holders, could be another reason why traders are upbeat about this project.
Just as Notcoin, Bitbot eyes listing on top crypto exchanges and investors see the presale as a great opportunity to buy.
The project’s total supply is 1 billion BITBOT, 30% of this set for presale and 23% for community rewards.
Currently, gem hunters have allocated more than $3.2 million to BITBOT in stage 13. Details on the presale page shows token sale price is $0.018, which could be a huge advantage for an early bird.

$1.1B Worth of Bitcoin Options Set to Expire Today, What's Next? | Coinspeaker



The open interest (OI) for Bitcoin call options is twice the open interest for the put options, indicating an overall bullish sentiment.

It is Friday, and crypto market enthusiasts will be closely observing Bitcoin options expiry, and the possible movements in BTC price going ahead. Approximately 18,000 BTC options are nearing expiration, featuring a Put Call Ratio of 0.64 and a Maxpain point set at $62,000. This week’s expiring BTC contracts hold a notional value of approximately $1.15 billion, slightly less than the previous week’s expiry.
This put/call ratio of 0.64 suggests that more long contracts, or calls, would be expiring in comparison to the short contracts, or puts. Furthermore, the Bitcoin open interest has also surged to $700 million at the strike price of $70,000 and $100,000, which clearly hints that the longs are in a dominating position. On the other hand, the Open Interest (OI) for put calls has also surged to $360 million.




However, it is clear that the open interest (OI) for Bitcoin call options is twice the open interest for the put options, indicating an overall bullish sentiment. Call options provide the holder with the privilege to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specified date.
Additionally, trading firms such as QCP Capital and Paradigm have noticed a resurgence in demand for upward call options. This includes buyers closing current positions to transition into higher strike calls set to expire in July and September.
A Look At Bitcoin Options Implied Volatility (IV)
As per the data from Greeks.Live, the crypto market experienced a downturn over the last week amid the drop in the trading volume. Although there was a reduction in outflows from the US Bitcoin ETF, the market structure and block trading indicated persistent weakness in prices.
This downward trend has contributed to diminishing confidence among investors, reflected in the decreasing implied volatility (IV) across major terms. Presently, IV levels are marginally below the historical average, signaling some support. However, there is limited scope for further decline at this juncture.
“Empirically May has not been a good month for the market, and it is good value for money to buy some monthly puts now” Greeks.live notes.


In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin price has bounced back from under $61,000 levels and is currently trading close to $63,000. If BTC price gives a strong breakout above $64,000, we can see the levels of $70,000 coming soon.

Deutsche Bank Issues Major Stablecoin Warning

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



In a recent development, Deutsche Bank, one of the largest and most influential banks globally, has issued a significant warning regarding stablecoins.The warning highlights potential risks associated with this class of digital assets, delving into the topic of increasing the importance of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to traditional fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro, have gained widespread popularity in recent years. A new class of stablecoins, algorithmic stablecoins, use algorithms to maintain a stable price relative to another asset or basket of assets. These digital assets offer the promise of stability amid the volatility of cryptocurrencies, making them attractive for various use cases, including remittances, payments and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.However, a recent report from Deutsche Bank has cast a shadow over this perceived haven, issuing a stark warning about stablecoins, including the widely used Tether (USDT).The research, which examined 334 currency pegs since the year 1800, found that only 14% have survived. Applying this to the world of stablecoins, Deutsche Bank Research analysts believe that the majority of these pegged digital currencies will become unmoored."Some may survive, although most will likely fail," the analysts wrote on Tuesday.Terraform Lab's algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token Luna collapsed two years ago, wiping away at least $40 billion in cryptocurrency. According to Deutsche Bank researchers, the few successful pegged currencies that survived did so because they were credible, backed by reserves and functioned in carefully controlled institutions, which they say many major stablecoins lack.Deutsche Bank's warning comes at a time when stablecoins are experiencing unprecedented growth and usage, with their total market capitalization surpassing significant milestones.Tether, the first and largest stablecoin by market cap, disagrees with Deutsche Bank's assessment, claiming that the research lacks clarity and sufficient evidence.

Hoskinson Critiques Biden's Crypto Stance Amid Election Season


In an almost 15-minute video, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum (ETH) and founder of Cardano (ADA), shared his views on President Joe Biden’s administration’s stance towards the crypto industry.
Hoskinson highlights the statement from Biden’s administration regarding H.J. Res 109. This resolution is against the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121.
Hoskinson Speaks Out Against Biden’s Crypto Regulations
SAB 121 is particularly interesting for the crypto community since it requires financial institutions to include customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets. Critics see this as a major operational and financial hurdle.
The White House claimed rejecting this rule would weaken the SEC’s investor and financial system protections. They strongly stated, “if the President were presented with H.J. Res. 109, he would veto it.”
Read more: How Does Regulation Impact Crypto Marketing? A Complete Guide
In response to the current situation, Hoskinson called the idea of regulating crypto under the Securities Act of 1933 “an absurd statement.”


“Cryptocurrencies can be commodities, securities, currencies, loyalty points, non-fungible tokens. All at the same time. So, how do you do these asset regulations when things can move on daily, weekly, monthly basis? In fact, circumstances can change over time,” Hoskinson explained.

Hoskinson also warned that the US might lose all its cryptography experts. He speculated they might move to regions like China and the Middle East. There, adversaries could “weaponize” them against the US.
However, Hoskinson mentioned that there’s nothing Joe Biden could do to eliminate Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies entirely. Concluding his speech, Hoskinson emphasized the importance of voting for crypto in the upcoming November elections.

“In November, vote crypto and understand who isn’t voting crypto,” he urged.

A crypto community member then challenged Hoskinson. They said the previous administration wasn’t exactly crypto-friendly either. Yet, Hoskinson disagreed.

“You’re completely wrong. The administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry. The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto,” he replied.

In an interesting turn of events, former US President Donald Trump recently expressed his comfort with crypto. He did so at a special event for his “Mugshot Edition” NFT holders in Florida.


“And if you like crypto, […] if you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump,” he said.

Additionally, Trump announced his campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations. This announcement sparked interest online. Yet, it awaits further details from his campaign staff.
The crypto community welcomed Trump’s support. Plan B, a renowned crypto analyst, expressed his thoughts.

“If Trump embraces crypto and restores basic human rights […] then he gets 50% of votes and wins the November 2024 elections!” PlanB wrote.


The differing views of Joe Biden and Donald Trump on crypto are notable. This is especially true as the US presidential election approaches.

Toncoin (TON) Price Surges 14% after Binance Announced Listing of Notcoin (NOT) with Seed Tag | Coinspeaker



Telegram-backed Toncoin (TON) has been the best-performing top-ten crypto project in the past few weeks.

Toncoin (TON), the native cryptocurrency for The Open Network blockchain that is backed by the Telegram social network, spiked as much as 14 percent in the past 24 hours to trade around $6.9 on Friday during the mid-London session. The Toncoin (TON) project has grown to a top-tier layer one (L1) blockchain, with more than $259 million in total value locked (TVL).
Remarkably, the Toncoin project has managed to outshine some veteran Web3 chains like Cardano (ADA), Tron (TRX), and Avalanche (AVAX), among others. As of this writing, Toncoin had a fully diluted valuation of about $35 billion and a daily average traded volume of around $672 million.




Toncoin Growth Backed by the Telegram Platform
As Coinspeaker had previously pointed out, the Toncoin economy is heavily anchored in the Telegram social networking platform. With Telegram having nearly 200 million daily active users (DAU), the Toncoin ecosystem is well-positioned to grow rapidly in the confirmed crypto bull market.
For instance, the Telegram-based community token, Notcoin (NOT), which enables seamless onboarding of users to the web3 ecosystem via a tap-to-earn mining mechanism, has received tremendous support and adoption. On Thursday, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance Holdings Ltd announced that its users can begin farming the NOT meme coin on May 13 through staking BNB and FDUSD into separate pools.
Binance announced that Notcoin will be the 54th project on the Binance Launchpool, with trading set to begin on May 16. The trading of NOT tokens will be facilitated by Bitcoin, Tether USDT, BNB, and FDUSD.
The listing of NOT tokens on Binance follows similar decisions by other top-tier crypto exchanges such as Bybit, and OKX.
The Toncoin ecosystem consists of a vibrant web3 ecosystem of more than 700 applications including wallets, and exchanges to facilitate seamless crypto adoption. As a result, the Toncoin network has amassed more than 17.9 million addresses since inception led by those from the Jetton wallet.
The Toncoin network offers passive income through staking, whereby around 549 million TON coins have been staked to date.
TON Price Action and Midterm Targets
Toncoin price has heavily leveraged the notable altcoin speculation amid the confirmed crypto bull market. Earlier last month, TON price reached an all-time high (ATH) of about $7.63, following a successful bullish breakout at the beginning of this year.
If TON’s bullish momentum continues in the coming weeks, the altcoin will inevitably print a new ATH soon. Moreover, the altcoin has gained more than 29 percent in the last week despite Bitcoin and Ethereum prices lacking in bullish momentum.
With the TON price against the US dollar on the daily chart having rebounded on the 50 SMA and 50 RSI, there is a high chance of a bullish continuation. From a technical standpoint, the TON price could easily reach the next liquidity range between $9.6 and $12.6, which coincides with the 1.618 and 2.618 daily Fibonacci Retracement.

Kraken Asks California Court to Dismiss SEC Case over Legal Jurisdiction and Misinterpretation | Coinspeaker



Kraken contends the SEC interpretation of the Howey Test and asks the court to dismiss the case against the exchange.

Attorneys representing the Kraken exchange have replied to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) April filing, and asked the court to dismiss allegations against the exchange. Filings submitted Thursday in the Northern District of California argue that the SEC’s case stating that Kraken is running an unregistered securities exchange is fundamentally flawed.
Kraken Questions SEC’s Legal Jurisdiction
The exchange’s recent reply accuses the SEC of stretching the case by extending the SEC’s jurisdiction past limits set by the Howey test, used to determine what assets qualify as securities. Essentially, the Howey test sets four criteria: investment of money, in a common enterprise, expectation of profit, and derived from the efforts of others. Kraken’s lawyers stated:




“The SEC cannot satisfy Howey’s additional requirements that there be investments of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. This would gut Howey by significantly expanding the SEC’s jurisdiction to a host of investment activities that were never delegated to the agency. Such a significant reordering of the US’s financial regulatory structure should be debated in Congress, not in the courts.”
Kraken’s reply also notes that the SEC is misinterpreting legal concepts, and questions the use of “ecosystem” and “investment concept”, instead of “enterprise” and “investment contract”.
In April, the SEC submitted an opposition to the exchange’s motion to dismiss, arguing that its enforcement action is within its authority as granted by Congress. The Commission argued that Congress created the SEC to “enforce the Securities Act and Exchange Act, including the requirement that securities intermediaries register with the SEC”. Interestingly, the SEC specified that it is not assuming new powers, and does need new bespoke laws for each new technology.
Kraken Enforcement Actions Since Last Year
The agency announced a suit against Kraken in November, accusing Kraken of running an unregistered securities exchange. An SEC press release alleges that Kraken earned several hundred million dollars helping people buy and sell crypto asset securities since at least September 2018. In addition to calling the exchange an unlawful broker, dealer, and clearing agency, the Commission stated that several assets Kraken features are securities. Named cryptocurrencies include Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), OMG Network (OMG), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Filecoin (FIL), and Near (NEAR).
The SEC also accused Kraken of commingling user funds up to $33 billion. Allegedly, the exchange uses customer funds to pay operational expenses and engages in several other unlawful business activities, including poor internal controls. At the time, Kraken denied the allegations, tackling the SEC for abandoning efforts at regulatory clarity, for continued enforcement action.
The Commission had earlier brought a complaint against the exchange. Last February, Kraken agreed to settle with the Commission for offering unregistered Staking-as-a-Service products to users in the US. The terms include permanently suspending the service and also paying a $30 million fine. At the time, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said any company offering investment contracts in exchange for tokens must provide adequate disclosure and safeguards in accordance with securities laws. Kraken agreed to the settlement without accepting or denying the allegations.

XRP Ledger Validator Launched By Japanese Financial Titan


								SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, has commenced its role as a validator node on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This move by SBI, a major player in Japan’s financial sector, underscores its commitment to playing a pivotal role in the governance and development of the ledger.
SBI Announces XRP Ledger Validator Launch
The news about the launch was shared by Emi Yoshikawa, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at Ripple, via a post on X. Yoshikawa’s announcement highlighted the proactive approach taken by SBI VC Trade in aligning with the interests of its clientele who are holders of XRP, the native digital asset of the XRPL.”
SBI VC Trade (SBI Holding’s crypto exchange) just announced the launch of their validator on XRPL. She further commented, “In their announcement, they say that they intend to reflect the voice of XRP holders (their customers) through this validator. Great to see diverse approaches to running validators!”


In an official statement, SBI detailed their strategy behind operating a validator node. “By continuing to operate stably as a validator and having our achievements recognized by the community, we will be included in the list of trusted validators (UNL, Unique Node List) recommended by the XRP Ledger Foundation in the future,” the press note explained.

Being part of the UNL would allow SBI VC Trade more influence in the network, especially in voting on new features of the ledger. The company further elaborated on its goals to be a “validator that reflects the voices of the XRP holder community in Japan,” a reflection of its long-standing service to holders of the token.
SBI’s plans include conducting surveys to integrate customer opinions into their voting decisions for new features. Moreover, they intend to actively participate in the dissemination of information and education about new features and amendments, enhancing the ability of holders to make informed decisions that bolster the ecosystem.
Strategic Importance Of The SBI-Ripple Partnership
SBI Holdings has nurtured a significant partnership with Ripple, leveraging the latter’s blockchain technology for various financial applications, particularly through the joint venture SBI Ripple Asia. This collaboration, which started in 2016, is focused on enhancing cross-border payment services and optimizing banking transactions across Asia using Ripple’s technology.

President and CEO of SBI Holdings, Yoshitaka Kitao, has been a vocal proponent of XRP, often expressing a bullish outlook on its future in financial transactions. Under Kitao’s leadership, SBI has integrated the crypto asset into several of its services, promoting its adoption across its extensive financial network.
SBI VC Trade operating as a validator is a clear signal of SBI’s intent to leverage its influence to foster the growth and stability of the ecosystem. This development is expected to not only benefit SBI’s operations but also contribute to its robustness as an enterprise-grade blockchain solution recognized for its fast settlement, low cost and scalability.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.51671, down 30% since its high of $0.74 in mid-March.

                        The Dogecoin price has gained by 3.5% in the past 24 hours, rising to $0.1515 as the crypto market as a whole climbs by 2.5% today.DOGE is now up by 14% in a week, although the market’s biggest meme coin has actually lost 20% in a month.However, its move today follows indications that whales have been accumulating the meme coin recently, with one transfer alone seeing a big trader take $19 million in DOGE off Robinhood.This could result in further gains in the coming days, with the market set up for what looks like a busy weekend.
Dogecoin Price Prediction as Whales Accumulate More DOGE – What’s the Next Move?
DOGE’s chart creates the impression that the coin has just begun an upswing, which may last at least a few days yet before it runs out of steam.Most notably, its 30-day average (orange) is just climbing over its 200-day average (blue), forming a golden cross that can indicate a breakout.Source: TradingViewThis is happening while DOGE’s relative strength index (purple) is hovering between 50 and 70, only a day or so after dropping under 30.As such, it looks as though traders are in for a short-term period of strength for the meme token, with transfer and ownership data suggesting that whales have been re-accumulating the token.Not only have we seen a few big Dogecoin buys, but data also indicates that the share of DOGE’s total supply held by whales has risen this week.In particular, addresses with between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE now hold 21% of the entire circulating supply of the token, up from 20.75% more than a week ago.This is a small change in percentage terms, but it highlights how whales have taken advantage of depressed prices to buy DOGE on the cheap.They have therefore set themselves up to make some profits once the Dogecoin price rises in the coming days and weeks.And it is likely to see more gains in step with the wider market, which after a period of selling looks ready to recover in the near term.More generally, Dogecoin has long-term potential in relation to the possibility that X may introduce digital payments on its platform, including payments using DOGE.If such an eventuality comes to pass, DOGE may reach $0.5 by the end of the year.
New Dogecoin Rival Shows Strong Rally PotentialDogecoin is likely to remain one of the biggest meme tokens in the market for the foreseeable future, yet it certainly isn’t the only such coin with big potential right now.Indeed, a wave of new meme coins have emerged in recent months, with the best of these looking ready to outperform the market.A great example of this is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme coin that has raised over $15 million in its token offering.Source: DogeverseAs the market’s first multi-chain Doge-themed meme token, DOGEVERSE will run on the following networks: Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.Because of its compatibility with these chains, it could gain much greater traction than it would have as a single-chain token.It may potentially find use and adoption on multiple apps and trading platforms, something which would boost its price over time.Also likely to boost its price is its hard cap of 120 million tokens, which will make it deflationary in the long run.So, too, will its staking system, which, by incentivizing holders with yields, will result in a big chunk of its supply leaving circulation.VIDEOThis all makes DOGEVERSE look very promising, with newcomers able to join its sale at the official Dogeverse website.1 DOGEVERSE has reached its final presale price of $0.00031, a level it’s hoping to eclipse once it lists in the next couple of weeks.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Kraken Asks The Court to Dismiss The SEC’s Case in Recent Filing


							

Kraken has filed a motion asking the court to dismiss a case filed against it by the SEC.



The crypto exchange cited inappropriate wording as a reason the court should strike the motion.



Kraken also noted that the filing could cause a “significant reordering” of the U.S. financial regulatory structure.




Kraken, a United States-based cryptocurrency exchange, has filed a motion asking the court to dismiss a case filed against it by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to reports, Kraken cited inappropriate wording by the SEC as a reason why the court should strike out the SEC’s motion.



The crypto exchange highlighted that the SEC failed to identify “any investment contracts that were (or could be) traded, brokered or settled on Kraken.” Kraken’s filing stated that the SEC used the terms investment “concept” and “ecosystem” instead of “investment contract” and “enterprise” several times in its argument.



The SEC and Kraken have been entangled in a lawsuit since November 2023, after the commission alleged that the crypto exchange failed to register appropriately and co-mingled customers’ funds. Last February, Kraken responded to the SEC’s filing, echoing the legal arguments deployed by competitors Binance and Coinbase in similar lawsuits.



According to Kraken, the SEC is using the lawsuit as retaliation for political speech, citing a speech by Marco Santori, the crypto exchange’s chief legal officer, in May last year, when he testified about the SEC’s overreach before Congress.



Kraken noted in a public message that “Crypto innovators in the United States should not have to fear retaliation for their political speech.” It further affirmed that those involved in crypto must be protected from intimidation by a “politically compromised” agency.









Meanwhile, Kraken’s latest filing also asked the court to dismiss the SEC’s latest filing to avoid a “significant reordering” of the U.S. financial regulatory structure. According to Kraken, the SEC cannot satisfy Howey’s additional requirements that there be money investments in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others.



Kraken’s lawyers noted that admitting the SEC’s motion would gut Howey by significantly expanding the SEC’s jurisdiction to a host of investment activities that were never delegated to the agency. The lawyers argued that such a significant reordering of the U.S.’s financial regulatory structure should be debated in Congress, not in the courts.

Blast Initiates 15 Million Gold Points Distribution Event - DailyCoin


        
Blast has announced another round of Gold distribution.



The latest event features millions of points.



Eligible dApps can start claiming the points today.
Ethereum Layer 2 network Blast announced on Friday the start of its third Blast Gold Distribution event, featuring millions of points.The event comes after Blast launched its Ethereum L2 mainnet on February 29, unlocking nearly $2.3 billion in staked cryptocurrencies that were previously locked up in the network. In its latest gold points distribution program, Blast has introduced a new category and “dApp weight,” demonstrating its commitment to supporting more dApps and their communities.Claiming 15 Million Blast Gold PointsIn a statement dated May 10, Blast said that it would distribute 15 million Gold points to decentralized applications across nine categories, including Spot DEX, Perp DEX, Lending, GameFi, SocialFi, GambleFi, Misc, NFT Infra, and the newly added real-world assets (RWA) niche.  
The distribution will follow a specific methodology:“Dapps live on Mainnet were weighted based on the following formula: Category Weight x Blast-native Weight x Dapp Weight x Incentive Weight.” Blast said. “Dapps will receive a pro-rata portion of the 15 million Gold based on their final weights.”Per the statement, Blast-native dApps were assigned weights of 1, 1.5, or 2 based on their exclusivity on the network, while applications that demonstrated “effectiveness in distributing gold to users were rated from 0 to 1.Additionally, unranked dApps were rated 0, while applications under the Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum weight categories were assigned weights of 1, 5, 10, and 15, respectively.
“Some Dapps did not have enough traction to be weighted this round, but still seemed promising. We allocated an amount of either 2,000 or 10,000 Gold to those Dapps.” The statement read.Blast clarified that applications that had significant security incidents or negative community feedback “received a weight of 0 this round.”Stay updated on Solana’s performance following FTX’s liquidation:Solana Drops on FTX Liquidation, Open Interest DropsRead about DWF Labs’ response to $300M wash trading allegations:DWF Labs Responds to $300M Wash Trading Allegations

Stand With Crypto Sets Up Election War Chest, Backs Candidates Seeking Open Seats

The fast-growing organization of cryptocurrency supporters, Stand With Crypto, is getting into campaign financing with the opening of its own political action committee (PAC) that will make direct donations to endorsed congressional candidates, said Chief Strategist Nick Carr. Its opening slate of endorsements will feature five candidates seeking open seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, though the money will have to wait. Stand With Crypto's effort is an "associated PAC," meaning it's supported by the nonprofit group's own members, and each of them will be limited to $5,000 contributions. Once they start adding cash to the PAC coffers, then the committee can start making direct donations to candidates as they face the latter months of the primaries and the big contest of November's general election, the group announced Friday.

Crypto Market Watch: GRT, TON, and WIF Outperform Leading Cryptocurrencies As Market Rises Over $50 Billion | Cryptoglobe


                                
The cryptocurrency market has gained around $50 billion amid a wider recovery that has seen the price of Bitcoin bounced back after dropping to the $60,000 resistance level to now trade above $63,000, while altcoins including Dogwifhat (WIF) and Toncoin (TON) saw double-digit gains.



According to available market data the price of Bitcoin rose over 3% over the last 24-hour period after dropping to $60,000, with spot bitcoin ETF net flows dropping after the cryptocurrency dropped below the $58,000 mark briefly earlier this month.



While BTC recovered slightly some altcoins saw double-digit growth, including the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogwifhat (WIF), which rose 11%, while the cryptocurrency integrated into the popular messaging app Telegram TON saw a rise of 13.4%.



These rises come as equities markets also started rebounding over higher-than-expected applications for unemployment in the US, which potentially further make the case for the country’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The price of gold, for example, has moved up over 3% over the past week as well, while the stock market’s benchmark index, the S&P 500, rose 1.7% ahead of crucial inflation data that’s set to be revealed next week.



CryptoCompare data shows that The Graph (GRT) has also surged significantly over the last 24-hour period, moving up over 16% to a $2.9 billion market capitalization, also signifcantly outperformign leading cryptocurrencies BTC and ETH.

Other top performers with smaller market capitalizations – and as a result, a smaller influence on the market – include Pangolin (PNG), which saw its price rise 22%, Akash Network (AKT), which rose 19%, Livepeer (LPT), which saw a 17.4% rise, and Arkham’s ARKM, which moved up 15%.



It’s worth noting that other digital assets saw larger increases, but given their lower market capitalizations and trading volumes, their volatility tends to be larger and as a result, large price swings less meaningful.

Ethereum 'speculatory divergence' sees ETH price cling to $3K support

Ethereum's Ether (ETH) has “underperformed” compared to Bitcoin (BTC) this cycle, and new holders now risk falling into losses.In the latest edition of its newsletter, “The Week On-Chain” on May 7, analytics firm Glassnode revealed the role of speculators in ETH price support.Ethereum speculators on the edge of "panic"Both Bitcoin and Ether have seen downside price action following the former’s latest block subsidy halving in April.For Ethereum bulls, however, the past few weeks have hit hard after BTC/USD witnessed one of its biggest drawdowns since the FTX debacle in late 2022.“For Ethereum, we can see a similar drawdown structure, with notably shallower corrections since the FTX lows. This hits to a degree of resilience during pullbacks, as well as a net reduction in volatility across the digital asset space,” Glassnode wrote. “However, it is worth noting that Ethereum's deepest drawdown of the cycle has been -44%, which is just over twice as severe as Bitcoin’s at -21%. This highlights Ethereum's relative under-performance over last 2 years, which is manifesting in a weaker ETH/BTC ratio also.”Ethereum bull market drawdowns annotated chart (screenshot). Source: GlassnodeWhile the extent of ETH price drawdowns is declining, certain investor cohorts now face falling into the red on their holdings.Ethereum’s short-term holders (STHs) — entities holding coins for 155 days or less — have their aggregate cost basis right at $3,000.ETH/USD continues to trade at around that level, with a brief dip below it last week quickly bought up, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.

Here's When Bitcoin (BTC) Price Will Skyrocket to $1 Million, According to Jack Dorsey


																In a May 9 interview with journalist Mike Solana on Pirate Wires, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey shared his bullish view of the future price action of Bitcoin.
Dorsey told Solana that he believes the cryptocurrency could soar to “at least $1 million” by 2030, stating that there is a high probability it “hits that number and goes beyond.”
Bitcoin’s True Value
Dorsey highlighted that beyond bitcoin’s price, the most captivating aspect lies in its collaborative ecosystem, where individuals are incentivized to contribute towards its improvement.
He emphasized that anyone involved in BTC, whether through work, payment, or investment, enhances the overall network, thereby driving its value higher.
According to him, this dynamic makes BTC more than just a financial asset; it represents a compelling ecosystem and movement that has provided valuable lessons.




Dorsey had previously expressed his grand vision for bitcoin’s potential societal impact, suggesting that he sees it as capable of contributing to “world peace” and “energy abundance.”
Jack Dorsey
Jack Dorsey’s Departure from Bluesky
During the interview, Dorsey, who now heads the financial services firm Block, offered insights into his recent departure from the board of BlueSky, a decentralized Twitter alternative he co-launched in 2019.
BlueSky officially confirmed Dorsey’s exit via a post on May 5, expressing gratitude for his role in initiating and funding the project while announcing the search for a new board member.
In discussing BlueSky, Dorsey expressed concerns about its direction, stating it was “literally repeating all the mistakes Twitter made” and asserting that it lacked true decentralization.
He expressed dissatisfaction with BlueSky’s deviation from its original vision as an open-source protocol separate from specific applications, emphasizing its shift towards traditional company structures and moderation tools.
Initially conceptualized as a protocol that Twitter and other social media platforms could use independently from the application layer to mitigate censorship risks, BlueSky’s transition into a more corporate entity with investor backing and governance contradicted Dorsey’s intentions.
“Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an open-source protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board. That’s not what I wanted, that’s not what I intended to help create,” he said.
Dorsey, who has since removed his BlueSky account, remarked that the platform Nostr, characterized by its anonymity and open protocol free of corporate or centralized authority, better resonates with his principles of censorship resistance.

Andrew Tate Coin Will Explode 16,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 16,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




ANDTATE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Andrew Tate Coin.



Currently, Andrew Tate Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. 



To buy ANDTATE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Andrew Tate Coin by entering its contract address – Cp7qyqdzXAqF7fqKXzS8LwTE7JQvh2V3vYGnDdx6j4ii – in the receiving field.




ANDTATE currently has a market cap of just under $20,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. 



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

DoJ claims Tornado Cash indictment is not about ‘free speech’ | Protos


The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has explained why Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm’s motion to dismiss his criminal lawsuit has been inefffective. 
The DoJ reiterated that its indictment has nothing to do with whether the computer code of Tornado Cash is free speech or otherwise Constitutionally protected by the First Amendment. 
“The defendant is not being prosecuted for posting computer code,” claimed the DoJ. “Instead, he is being prosecuted for his use of it in furtherance of a profitable and illicit business.”
Indeed, there are many forms of speech – including spoken words – that the First Amendment does not protect. Criminal speech such as threats of violence are not protected by the First Amendment. 
The US Constitution does not protect all speech
Similarly, DoJ explains that banks use computer code to process financial transactions. If that code executes the work of a money transmitter, as defined legally, then that code is not mere free speech and is, instead, computer code that humans must ensure is implemented in such a way as to not violate money transmission laws.
Tornado Cash was part code, part speech, part business, and altogether a human creation. Storm did not just publish code; he operated a business and made operational decisions for years. 
Tornado Cash the protocol is not the same as Tornado Cash the business. Just because Tornado Cash had some open source code does not mean that all of Roman Storm’s actions involving that code as the Tornado Cash business owner are Constitutionally protected free speech. 
The DoJ focuses on Storm’s purposeful actions. Specifically, prosecutors focus on his knowing operation of an alleged money laundering operation that provided him millions of dollars worth of personal profit for washing over $1 billion in alleged criminal proceeds.
Roman Storm faces criminal charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to operate an unregistered money transmitting business, and violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
For his part, Storm argues that at no time did he conspire with parties like North Korea’s Lazarus Group, which sent illicit funds through his coin mixer, apparently without his knowledge.
The free speech precedent of Bernstein v. DoJ
Storm is sticking with the argument that publishing open-source code is not a crime. His legal team will almost certainly cite Bernstein v. Department of Justice, an old lawsuit that forced the US government to modify its regulations regarding the “export” of encryption software onto the internet. Yes, there was a time when the US government categorized robust encryption software as a military-level “munition” and imposed regulations on publishing code online. Prior to Bernstein v. DoJ, publishing certain details regarding cryptographic security onto the internet required registration as a US munitions exporter.
Bernstein v. DoJ actually helped facilitate international e-commerce by making it possible to publish more open source code, which ultimately allowed the secure processing of online card payments.

Storm claims that Congress passed an impermissibly vague law
Storm also alleges that DoJ’s charges against him are unconstitutionally vague, which prosecutors rebuffed in their opposition. DoJ counterargues that Storm’s complaints mostly claim that the language of a law passed by Congress is somehow unconstitutionally vague – which is not legally availing in Storm’s defense. Courts must operate under the assumption that acts of Congress are not impermissibly vague, per precedent set in the prestigious 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals case USA v. Houtar.
If Storm wants Congress to change a law, DoJ argues, he should write to his legally elected representatives. For now, it is the job of the executive branch of government, including DoJ, to enforce the written laws of Congress, the legislative branch of government.
Was violating clear sanctions an act of free speech by Tornado Cash?
DoJ also rebuffed Storm’s claim that he should not face indictment for exporting Tornado Cash software. DoJ is crystal clear in its memorandum, reiterating that its indicment “does not charge the defendant with exporting Tornado Cash software.” 
Prosecutors clarified that the charge covers Lazarus Group’s sending of illicit funds from a known, sanctioned wallet belonging to Lazarus Group, which the DoJ argues Tornado Cash should have known about and attempted to prevent. The Department of the Treasury clearly and publicly added Lazarus Group crypto wallets to its sanctions list in 2022.
US district judge Katherine Polk Failla of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York will read DoJ’s opposition and decide whether to honor or dismiss Roman Storm’s motion to dismiss case number 1:23-cr-00430, USA v. Storm.

Binance Registration In India Now Shows Positivity After Ban Last Year - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Binance and KuCoin, major cryptocurrency exchanges, gained approval from India’s FIU after being banned for illegal operations, signaling a regulatory milestone.



KuCoin resumes operations in India after paying a $41,000 penalty, while Binance registration in India awaits a decision on its penalty after compliance proceedings.



India’s crypto market faces increased regulatory scrutiny, with several offshore exchanges negotiating with regulators and some opting to exit.




Binance and KuCoin, two major players in the cryptocurrency exchange sphere, have made significant strides in their operations within India, as reported by CoinDesk.





Binance Registration In India Approved



After facing bans for operating illicitly in the country, both platforms have now been granted approval by India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), marking a notable development in the nation’s crypto landscape.



KuCoin, which paid a penalty of $41,000 to the FIU, has quickly resumed its operations within India. On the other hand, Binance is still in the process of completing compliance proceedings with the FIU, with a pending penalty awaiting a decision after a hearing.



Vivek Aggarwal, the head of FIU-IND, confirmed the registration of these exchanges but emphasized that Binance registration in India is still ongoing due to the pending penalty determination.




This regulatory milestone follows India’s previous ban on over nine offshore entities, including prominent exchanges like HTX, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex. Binance registration in India signals a tightening of regulations within the Indian crypto market, with authorities keen on ensuring adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) frameworks.



Regulatory Hurdles and Market Opportunities: Insights into India’s Crypto Exchange Approval Process



The ongoing negotiations between other sanctioned platforms, such as Kraken, Gemini, and Gate.io, with regulatory bodies highlight a broader trend of regulatory scrutiny in the Indian crypto sector. Meanwhile, OKX and Bitstamp have chosen to exit the Indian market altogether and are submitting plans for withdrawal.



For Binance, reentering the Indian market presents significant opportunities given the country’s status as one of the largest crypto markets globally, boasting a sizable user base. However, Binance registration in India hinges on resolving its compliance issues and settling the pending penalty with the FIU.



While the registration with the FIU marks a step forward for Binance and KuCoin, the landscape remains uncertain for offshore entities that have not secured registration or have faced regulatory actions. The FIU has maintained its stance on blocking services of non-compliant entities, underscoring the importance of regulatory compliance in navigating India’s crypto market.

Hacker Makes Rare Move to Refund Stolen $71 Million In Crypto

After all hope was lost in a recent Phishing attack involving a trader, the hacker has shown a gesture of good faith with a partial refund. According to crypto analytics provider Lookonchain, a trader reportedly lost 1,155 WBTC worth $71 million to a Phishing attack about six days ago.As described at the time, there was what appeared to be address poisoning in the transaction. The scammer generated an address similar to one owned by the victim, as showcased by the initial and concluding alphanumeric symbols. This hacker then funded the fake address with $0 and, as such, it appeared in the victim’s transaction history.Without suspecting anything as the middle part of most addresses is typically obscured, the victim sent a massive $71 million to the hacker. While many of these attack strategies are common, this has been the most publicized in recent times.In a unique turn of events, Lookonchain revealed that the hacker had started refunding the stolen funds, which were converted to Ethereum. At the time of the update, a total of 4,676 ETH, worth about $14.2 million, have been refunded to the victim. As it stands, it remains unclear if the refund is based on generosity or as a whitehat event where the hacker ends up getting a bounty. While the refund of the stolen funds is a great gesture, this is not the first time such an action has been taken by hackers. There are precedents in this regard. The biggest chunk of stolen money that was refunded belonged to DeFi protocol Poly Network. The hacker, who ripped off over $600 million in the stolen funds, returned all the money, to the amazement of many.There are many cases of scams in the crypto ecosystem lately, with hackers now resorting to AI technologies like Deepfakes to swindle gullible victims. Rather than relying on refunds, industry leaders are sensitizing communities to adopting the best safety standards to prevent falling prey to scams.

                        SOL has jumped by 8% today, with the Solana price reaching $153.37 as the wider crypto market gains by 2.5% in the past 24 hours.The altcoin is also up by 10% in the past week, although it remains down by this percentage in a month, following a bearish period for the market as a whole.Yet it seems that today marks a short-term turning point for SOL, which has seen its 24-hour trading volume reach $2.8 billion today.This level is a sign that it could be ready to make another big move in the coming days, as the market looks to shake off negativity.
Solana Price Prediction as SOL Surges 7.8% with $2.8 Billion Volume – Are Whales Buying Before $1,000?
SOL’s chart is in a strong position today, with its indicators all signalling a short-term growth phase.Its relative strength index (purple) touched 70 earlier this morning and remains high, suggesting that buying pressure is increasing again and could stay for a few more days.Source: TradingViewSOL’s 30-day moving average (orange) is also on the up, having risen above the 200-day average (blue) last night.Also interesting is the fact that Solana’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are converging on each other, pointing to a big incoming move.However, the past day has seen a massive quantity of Solana – worth about $1.5 billion – transfer from one unknown wallet to another.Given that failed exchange FTX is in the process of liquidating its existing assets in order to repay creditors, we may therefore see the Solana price take a hit in the coming days.When exactly and how quickly FTX’s Solana reaches the market is uncertain, given that so much of the exchange’s supply finds itself in lockup.Still, traders need to be mindful that SOL could be a little up and down in the medium-term, although FTX may release its supply in such a steady way that it doesn’t have much of an effect.Either way, Solana’s prospects continue to look strong in the longer term, with the coin’s network accounting for a total value locked in of $4.15 billion.It also continues to witness strong usage as the network of choice for new meme tokens, something which is likely to continue boosting the Solana price over time.The latter could therefore reach $200 in the next couple of months, before testing its ATH towards the end of the year.
New Meme Coins Offer Big Potential Upside
Given that SOL could suffer as a result of FTX’s repayment plan, some traders may prefer to look to other coins for above-average gains.One option is to consider the wide variety of presale tokens that have emerged in recent weeks, and that are gaining momentum as they prepare to list.A strong example of such a token is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme coin which has raised just over $350,000 in its recently opened offering.Source: SealanaGiven that the sale hasn’t been open for long, this figure is an encouraging sign, in that it shows growing interest in the token.As a token, Sealana has taken an anthropomorphic seal as its meme of choice, with its particular character having dreams of leaving behind the world of work via trading.It’s aiming to become the latest Solana meme token to enjoy massive surges and outperform the market, following in the footsteps of such tokens as WIF and BONK.It will also launch on Ethereum, making it a rare example of a multi-chain meme coin, while also giving it wider application.Invests can join its sale by heading over to the official Sealana website, where they can purchase SEAL by sending SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.SEAL is available at a rate of 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which converts to around $0.02 at today’s prices.Time will likely show that this is a very cheap price, with SEAL looking good to rise strongly once it lists.Buy SEAL Today

How Blockchain and AI Are Recasting Ancient Occult Practices - Decrypt

When fans and skeptics alike refer to Bitcoin as “magic internet money,” they may not immediately connect the “technical marvel” to actual magic. But a new generation of magick practitioners is adopting blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and ancient practices to commune and work with angels, demons, and more.Among them is Chaweon Koo, a futurist, witch, digital artist, and blockchain enthusiast.“I just want to say that I'm just a very, normal person,” Koo told Decrypt. “The way that I work with the occult is, let's say, less mystical and a little bit more like an instrument.” She said she began practicing magick over a decade ago.Spelling magick with a K helps differentiate it from stage magic, a practice attributed to British occultist Aleister Crowley, who wrote that “magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.”Image: Chaweon KooKoo is the author of “Spell Bound: A New Witch's Guide to Crafting the Future,” a book that she describes as a talisman and thus a title that she will not issue as an ebook. Online, Koo began publishing occult-themed content in 2017, first with her Witches and Wine YouTube channel before expanding to TikTok.“My life was at a point where I was just like, I am not digging this, this is not fun,” Koo told Decrypt. “What are some powerful tools that I can leverage for whatever I need from life?”Spellcasting on the blockchainIn June 2021, Koo helped organize over 100 people in a ritual on the Ethereum blockchain. The ritual on block 12,610,244 petitioned the Roman god Mercury to ensure smooth blockchain transactions, well-timed trades, and insightful decision-making for wealth growth.“Hail Mercury! Let all of our transactions on the blockchain be smooth and well-timed. May our trades and investments be fortuitously timed for optimal long-term gains,” the spell included on-chain with the transaction said. “May we be in the right place at the right time to receive the most helpful information to grow and preserve our wealth.“Gift us with your clear perception, quick adaptability and your shrewdness in decision-making,” the message continues. “SO MOTE IT BE!”Koo said the ritual was inspired by the story of a Chinese worker who used the blockchain to broadcast a call for help, and credited fellow blockchain mystics Andre Burke and Aeolian Heart for writing the bulk of the petition.“This Chinese national was being sexually harassed at work, and the only way that she thought that she could get her message out, because no one else was listening to her, was she encrypted an S.O.S. into a transaction that she did on the Ethereum blockchain,” Koo recounted. “Which I thought was first of all very sad and tragic, but at the same time, instantly I thought, ‘Wait a second, you can encode a UTC, you can encode in the notes section,’” she said.“As far as I know, it was the first time that—number one—a ritual was being held on the Ethereum blockchain,” Koo said. “And number two, 100 people showed up for it.” The Ethereum spell work took place the moment when Mercury was in cazimi, the point when Mercury is sitting close to the sun.“So it was in the embrace of the sun,” Koo explained.AI angels and demonsAccording to Koo, the idea of using AI in magick began to develop as she worked on her book in 2021, noting that she was already aware of the growing interest and concerns around the rapid deployment of generative AI models.“Until you really get to understand AI, AI is kind of threatening—it's going to take away our jobs, it's going to make deepfakes,” she said. “I think a lot of people don't realize that AI is not quite there yet, but that's because they don't know, they only know the sensationalized stuff.”While some were fearful of the potential of AI, Koo said she saw an opportunity.Koo used artificial intelligence in her most recent project, the Goetia Glow Up, an online course that teaches how to summon and interact with spirits. The online course includes a 72-page booklet containing AI-generated images of demons of the Goetia, also known as the Lesser Key of Solomon.The  Key of Solomon is a grimoire or book of magic originally published between the 14th and 17th centuries. It details the invocation and control of spirits and demons, divided into five books focusing on various magical rites.The Goetia Glow Up. Image: Chaweon Koo“I thought, it's about time, because the documents now get reinterpreted by somebody who is in a completely different age,” she said. “Why not work with AI? Why not work with the intelligence of manmade technology to see what happens... and the results were better than I expected.”The intersection of artificial intelligence and the mystical could be traced back to antiquity, where folklore tells of beings and machines brought to life through magick or science: the golem in Jewish folklore, the bronze Giant automaton Talos in Greek mythology, and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.Koo said she has a lot of experience using demons in rituals, humorously noting that many of these practices were developed by wealthy 17th-century aristocrats trying to appear edgy, akin to characters in "Hellraiser: Bloodline,” which follows the history of the Lament Configuration puzzle box.“If you look at that movie, that was what was going on in France,” she said.Koo is not alone in the quest to leverage AI for mystical ends. In September, multi-disciplinary collective, Theta Noir told Decrypt the group hopes to see a future, emergent form of artificial general intelligence (AGI) arise, called Mena.Artificial General Intelligence is a concept in AI that refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. Mena—German for “love”—would be neither a god nor a deity, Theta Noir said, but a cosmic mind that merges humans and AI.Unlike medieval occultist and horror movie creators, Koo used AI models like Midjourney to craft more compelling demons.“The way that I view them, the demons are archetypes for us,” Koo explained. “They're almost like Instagram and TikTok filters that we can put on top of our own reality.”“I don't relate to a talking bird, the same way that I can relate to somebody who looks like Hermione Granger,” noting the genius witch from the Harry Potter series.Koo said that while Midjourney was used in the creation of the Goetia Glow Up Magazine for the course, she and her business partner included hand-drawn images to give it the “human touch.” Koo’s next project will feature not demons but the corresponding 72 angels.“These are not the little cherubic, Cupid-like angels, these are the angels that Ezekiel described as almost like a rocket ship,” she said. “I spent the entire month doing over 20 rituals, and people thought that I was nuts because I've always described angels to be psychotic aliens.”People experimenting with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) often talk about aliens and other entities, Koo pointed out.“The demons have a much more earthly, chthonic human feel because they are so much of the earth,” she said. “Angels are celestial beings, angels are not of this earth. They're ultra terrestrial, they're extra terrestrial.”Looking aheadThe upcoming Angel project will utilize not only text and images but also sound, Koo explained, pointing to music AI tools like Stability AI’s Suno 3 and Uncharted Labs’ Udio.As Koo explained, a large part of angelic magick is the idea of Angelic choirs.“The idea is that if you sing the name of the angels, then you could reach out and touch them much more easily,” she said. “It's sort of like, let's see what happens when we prompt a music AI and see what they come up with when it comes to these angels.”Koo emphasized the diversity within the occult community, contrasting people who embrace occult practices as a way to reconnect with ancestral traditions with those who are at the forefront of technological advancements. Early magicians, she noted, were considered cutting edge.“They were literally the ones they would be doing the equivalent of working with AI, like people working with AI right now. I would always say computer coders, they would have been burned at the stake,” Koo said. “Because anybody who's written any code—anybody who's ever written, ‘Hello World’ and having a computer talk back to you—there's a magick to that.”"In my definition, a true occultist is not a reactionary—instead, they're the ones who are the vanguard,” she said. “If you want to be a really strong occultist, you want to be the operator and not the person being led by the leash.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Move Over Bitcoin, Robert Kiyosaki Advocates For Ethereum Investment | Bitcoinist.com


								In a recent episode on the popular podcast ‘The Rich Dad Channel,’ Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the renowned book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” advocated for crypto investments, specifically Ethereum and Bitcoin. The financial expert has shed light on the diminishing value of the United States Dollar (USD), emphasizing the potential onset of a market crash. 
Ethereum To Serve As Hedge Against Currency Depreciation
During the podcast, speaking with Andy Schectman, the President and owner of Miles Franklin, precious metals, Kiyosaki discussed the importance of investing and saving in digital currencies, suggesting that cryptocurrencies could be a possible hedge against risks associated with the fiat currencies, particularly the US dollar. 

The financial expert, who has been a long-time advocate of digital currencies, has consistently encouraged investors to allocate funds to crypto assets in order to safeguard their wealth against inflation and other economic conditions. 
While acknowledging his limited understanding of Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Kiyosaki also expressed his support of Ethereum, as well as other precious metals like gold and silver during his podcast. He relayed his belief that the declining value of the US dollar will further deteriorate over time as the debt crisis worsens. 
Furthermore, Kiyosaki disclosed that he avoids saving his funds in fiat currency, emphasizing that “savers were losers.” Additionally, he revealed that he started saving Bitcoin approximately 10 years ago and has more recently expanded into Ethereum. 
The financial expert reiterated his skepticism regarding the credibility of the US dollar, branding it as “fake,” and advocated for the broader financial community to diversify assets into tangible resources such as gold and silver, as well as digital currencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin. 
Moreover, Kiyosaki stressed that there was no need for the crypto community to debate the relative value of Bitcoin over gold or silver. He emphasized that the crucial point was diversifying into a valuable asset that would not depreciate like the US dollar. 
“Don’t save money, fake money (US dollar, Euro, Yen, Peso) goes down in value. Save gold, silver, Bitcoin, real money that goes up in value, especially in a market crash,” Kiyosaki stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post. 
Kiyosaki Loses Faith In The US Dollar
In the podcast, Kiyosaki declared that he had lost faith in the US dollar, citing market vulnerabilities and crippling debts totalling trillions of dollars. The financial author disclosed in an X post in late April that the American economy was currently experiencing a depression. 

He revealed that the economy had witnessed subpar growth in recent years, with growth rates of only 3.4% and 1.6% in Q4 of 2023 and Q1 of 2024, respectively. Kiyosaki also cautioned that the broader market crash had commenced, emphasizing that “crashes were the best time to get rich,” and urging investors to capitalize on the opportunity by investing when prices have bottomed.

Kraken spotlights SEC inability to identify ‘investments contract’ in digital assets

Kraken has refuted the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) claims that its platform listed securities, pointing out that the financial regulator’s arguments attempt to restructure the US financial system beyond its regulatory scope, according to a May 9 court filing.Investment contractKraken stated that the SEC could not pinpoint tradable investment contracts on its platform. Instead, the Gary Gensler-led commission was using terms like investment “concept” and “ecosystem” as substitutes for “investment contract” and “enterprise.”Kraken lawyers wrote:“Kraken does not trade, broker, or settle ‘concepts’ or ‘ecosystems.’ The SEC never plainly alleges that what actually is traded, brokered, and settled on Kraken is itself an investment contract. This failure spotlights the fundamental problem with the SEC’s case.”The crypto-trading platform continued that the digital assets on its platform are not securities, adding that the SEC’s “argument could transform the sale of any digital asset (or any commodity) into an investment contract whenever the agency wishes it so—simply by claiming there is promotion of some surrounding ‘ecosystem.'”Furthermore, Kraken argued that the SEC’s action could result in a “significant reordering of the US’s financial regulatory structure” and should be “debated in Congress, not in the courts.”It added:“The SEC’s assertion that it can regulate all ‘investment concepts’ and ‘ecosystems’ is the type of agency power grab that the Supreme Court has held runs afoul of the major questions doctrine.”Securities battleKraken’s case is among the several lawsuits in which the SEC is currently embroiled, all revolving around the definition of securities.The financial regulator has consistently argued that several digital assets meet the definition of securities under the Howey Test.In a filing, the SEC lawyers contended that “crypto assets are not the first technological innovation to interest securities markets,” citing a recent Court rejection of Coinbase’s argument about how its operations did not violate federal securities law as evidence that the sectors “fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years.”Mentioned in this article

Nansen Expects a New Low in Altcoins! He gave the date! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While a major bull rally is expected in Bitcoin and altcoins, many predictions are made about its timing.
At this point, market analysts pointed to June for the start of the altcoin rally. Accordingly, analysts stated that the cryptocurrency market will reach its local bottom in June and said that Bitcoin must first break out of its current range for the altcoin rally to begin.


First of all, Nansen chief research analyst Aurelie Barthere said that the altcoin market was hit by the halving and started to decline. According to the analyst, even if altcoins see a potential local bottom, the Bitcoin price will first need to make an upward move for an altcoin bull rally to begin.
Speaking to Cointelegraph, Nansen analyst Barthere said:






“Altcoins are high beta cryptocurrencies. They do well when the sentiment in the market is very bullish and that is when they become bullish.
But since mid-March, sentiment among crypto investors has been less enthusiastic. Additionally, while the BTC price is also consolidating around the 20-day exponential moving average, altcoins are experiencing more volatility.
For altcoins to outperform, we need an upside breakout in Bitcoin and a clear resumption of the BTC uptrend.
“If BTC goes into bullish mode again, rises may also be seen in altcoins.”

Apart from the Nansen analyst, Qubic Labs Accelerator analyst Alex Onufriychuk also evaluated the Bitcoin altcoin relationship.
Stating that historically altcoins have been directly correlated with the BTC price, the analyst said altcoins could reach local bottoms around June as market sentiment and Bitcoin price remain under pressure as inflows in US spot BTC ETFs decrease:



“With not enough new liquidity coming from spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and Hong Kong, there is a possibility that BTC and altcoins will find local bottoms by June.
This shows that the consolidation period may be extended. Afterwards, the rise may begin.”

Shiba Inu Whales Disappearing? SHIB Large Transactions Plummet

Recent on-chain metrics for Shiba Inu paint a strong shift on the market landscape, with a 15% decrease in large transactions. This change has significant implications for the token’s market dynamics and potentially its price trajectory in the near future.This metric, showing a slight 0.32% increase, indicates a marginal rise in the number of new addresses being created on the SHIB network. While this is generally a bullish signal suggesting growing interest or new entrants on the market, the minimal increase reflects limited fresh momentum.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe "In the Money" metric, displaying a neutral 0.30%, represents addresses that are currently profitable based on the purchasing price of SHIB. This neutrality signifies a balance between bullish and bearish sentiment among holders, potentially indicating a holding pattern among investors.A slight 0.04% increase in concentration suggests a minor rise in the token holdings of the top SHIB addresses. This could be viewed as a subtle bullish signal, implying that some larger holders are possibly increasing their stakes, or fewer addresses are accumulating more SHIB.The 15.66% drop in large transactions over $100,000 is particularly significant. This decrease often signals reduced activity from whales, who are typically capable of swaying the market with their large orders. This reduction could imply a lower confidence level among larger investors, or a shift in strategy toward smaller, less noticeable transactions.Currently, SHIB is consolidating within a narrowing price range, hinting at an impending volatility spike. The decrease in whale transactions could reduce significant sell-offs or buys, potentially stabilizing the price temporarily. However, the consolidation phase suggests that a breakout could be incoming. The direction of this breakout will likely depend on the rest of the market, rather than SHIB specifically, so we will have to wait and see.

Lucky Crypto Trader Sees Ethereum Memecoin Investment Surge in Value by a Staggering 86,000%: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								New on-chain data reveals that one lucky trader is seeing a more than 86,000% gain on his Ethereum (ETH)-based memecoin investment.
According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain noticed, one investor bought $6,500 worth of the MAGA (TRUMP) late last year and is now sitting on $5.6 million worth of funds.










“The trader ‘waxl.eth’ turned $6,500 to $5.6 million with TRUMP, a gain of 870x! He spent $6,500 to buy 2.08 million TRUMP via two wallets and sold 1.24 million TRUMP for $902,000, with 832,000 TRUMP ($4.7 million) left.” 
The MAGA memecoin, founded in August 2023 and based on former US President Donald Trump, currently has a market cap of $298.3 million, making it the 234th ranked digital asset. TRUMP is trading for $6.40 at time of writing, up more than 51.9% in the last 24 hours.
The sudden surge in value comes as Trump reportedly made pro-crypto remarks on May 8th during a dinner event he hosted in Mar-a-Logo for supporters who bought non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from his “Mugshot Edition” collection.
During the event, Trump announced that he would be accepting crypto donations towards his presidential campaign.
Lookonchain also noticed another trader who is sitting on $4.4 million in profits through buying TRUMP after purchasing hundreds of thousands of the meme asset in December 2023 and January 2024.
 “The address tagged ‘GCR: Address 1’ spent 703,460 USDT to buy 936,279 TRUMP at $0.75 from December 8th, 2023 to January 18th, 2024, and now has a floating profit of $4.4 million!”

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) to Rally 8,000% After Solana Launch, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and DogeCoin



                    

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Zombie Coin presents a similar opportunity.



Zombie Coin has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,000% in the coming two days, and Zombie Coin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Zombie Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Zombie Coin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Zombie Coin by entering its contract address – FbkoYsCAPbcyJkSoqXTxDKKoGQrYoqgtdLf9GBEqy2vr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ZOMCOIN.

NodeMonkes leads NFT sales with US$876K in a day, CryptoPunks drops off top 10


Bitcoin’s NodeMonkes led the non-fungible token (NFT) market in daily sales with US$876,936 on Thursday.



NodeMonkes rose 21% from the previous day’s sales total of US$725,058. It was the third best-selling collection on Wednesday.



Thursday’s sales total pushes NodeMonkes’ all-time sales volume to US$215.16 million. It’s ranked as the top NFT collection in the Bitcoin network and is less than US$1 million away from overtaking CyberKongz for the 26th spot in the market, CryptoSlam data shows.



CryptoPunks, an Ethereum collection, led the market for two straight days this week but fell out of the top 10 on Thursday with sales totaling US$113,210. The collection had just under US$3 million in sales in the two days before it dropped off the list.

	
	
	
	


The second-highest performing collection of the day, DMarket, witnessed a substantial daily turnover with sales reaching US$781,961.

The Intersection of NFTs and Branding: Interesting Case Studies Including Nike, Adidas and More

It has also changed how we perceive value in this digital world. Via the intersection of NFTs and branding, NFTs are gaining popularity and renowned companies like Nike and Adidas are joining the trend. These brands are exploring ways to utilize NFTs as a means of engaging with their fans and providing enjoyable experiences.
The influence of NFTs on branding is noteworthy. Brands are using NFTs to forge bonds with their customers and provide one-of-a-kind experiences. Through NFTs, brands can offer digital collectibles, virtual merchandise, and privileged access to events or experiences.
Some Ways In Which NFTs Can Impact Branding
Limited Edition Digital Collectibles
Companies such as Nike and Adidas have started introducing collectibles known as NFTs, which are connected to specific products or collections. Fans can purchase, own, and trade these collectibles creating a sense of rarity and exclusivity. This innovative use of NFTs allows brands to tap into the growing market for collectibles while also generating revenue streams.
Virtual Merchandise
NFTs also offer brands an opportunity to create merchandise that can be utilized within virtual reality or gaming environments. For instance, imagine Nike unveiling an edition sneaker that gamers can wear in a popular virtual reality game. This not only enables brands to connect with audiences but also adds an extra layer of engagement and interaction with their products.
Exclusive Access and Experiences
NFTs can serve as passports to events or experiences granting access to devoted fans. Brands can design NFTs that act as tickets for gatherings, meet and greets with celebrities, or behind-the-scenes tours. These immersive encounters not only strengthen the bond between the brand and its customers but also generate excitement and buzz around the brand.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have changed the way that we view ownership of digital assets. 

The convergence of NFTs and branding opens up opportunities for brand innovation and customer engagement. By harnessing the power of NFT technology brands can create experiences that deeply resonate with their audience.

Adidas
Collaborating with names in the NFT community like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Punks Comic, Adidas has created exclusive digital apparel pieces designed specifically for blockchain-based gaming platforms. Through this initiative, Adidas aims to highlight themes of individuality and self-expression that are central to their real-world marketing efforts.
Nike

Bull rally incoming as Ethereum whale stacks over $32M in ETH since May


Observing the movements of ‘whales’—investors who hold large amounts of cryptocurrency—can offer crucial insights for both traders and investors as they navigate the complex dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. These whales are characterized by their significant capitalization and a proven track record of profitable trading, often influencing market trends and liquidity.
A significant Ethereum (ETH) whale has recently accumulated 10,758 ETH, valued at approximately $32.14 million, through transactions on Binance since May 2. This strategic accumulation follows Ethereum’s nearly 20% decline in value over the past 30 days, although it is still trading slightly above the $3,000 level, marking an approximate 30% increase year-to-date.




The massive transactions occurred from Binance to the wallet address 
‘0x1df0bae09402cb59132c1db349df882d01ca8ee9.
According to data from the on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, this whale withdrew 6,030 ETH tokens, worth over $18 million, from Binance as part of a sustained buying spree since the beginning of the month. This culminated in a total of 10,758 ETH valued at over $32.14 million in their wallet.
The whale subsequently exchanged their ETH for Lido Staked ETH (stETH), a token representing Ether staked on the decentralized liquid staking protocol Lido(LDO). These tokens allow the holder to earn from validating transactions while remaining liquid enough for use in other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
Following this swap, the whale deposited their stETH into the decentralized lending protocol Aave (AAVE) to secure $28.5 million in stablecoins. These were then reinvested into more ETH, showcasing a robust bet on Ethereum’s potential for appreciation.
This behavior illustrates a growing trend among large-scale investors to use DeFi tools to enhance their positions in the cryptocurrency market, particularly Ethereum. By borrowing against their staked ETH, they can maintain their investment while freeing up capital to acquire additional assets, betting on a future rise in Ethereum’s value.
Ethereum price analysis amid massive whale accumulation
Ethereum is currently trading slightly above $3,000, having recently risen by 1.97% in the last 24 hours.

Analysts and investors are closely monitoring these whale movements for signs of a possible market rebound. However, strong resistance around the $3,200 mark and ongoing market challenges suggest that any significant rally might still be some time away.

Many crypto analysts are optimistic, notably prominent analyst Crypto Tony, who offered a bullish outlook with a target price of $2,700 for Ethereum. His analysis coincides with the strategic moves of this whale and signals positive sentiment among well-informed market players regarding the price trajectory of Ethereum.
The recent activities of this Ethereum whale highlight a sophisticated use of decentralized finance to significantly influence market positions.
As Ethereum continues to play a pivotal role in the expanding DeFi ecosystem, such strategic investments by major players are likely to shape its valuation and future market dynamics.

Solana Memecoins Rally Alongside SOL As Crossroads Conference Kicks Off - The Defiant

Solana-based memecoins are outperforming the broader crypto markets with daily market cap growth of 12%.Solana’s Crossroads 2024 conference in Istanbul Turkey is live, and the markets are responding.SOL, Solana’s network token, is up more than 8% in the past 24 hours amid the event, last changing hands for $153.5, according to CoinGecko. SOL is the second strongest performing among the top 35 cryptocurrencies by market cap, with only Toncoin (TON) outperforming it after a 13.5% rally.The impressive performance comes as most leading digital assets are trending sideways, with the combined capitalization of crypto assets posting a modest daily gain of 2.8%.Solana’s meme markets outperformMemecoins unironically endured as a serious topic throughout the event, with multiple panelists requesting a show of hands from active meme token traders seated amongst the audience — each time eliciting an enthusiastic response.The buzz for Solana’s meme sector is already manifesting in the markets, with the combined capitalization of Solana memecoins bouncing 12% to $7.83 billion in 24 hours. For comparison, the broader memecoin sector is up 6.8% in 24 hours, with assets within Solana’s ecosystem comprising the segment’s top gainers.Dogwifhat, the network’s top memecoin, is leading the charge with a 12% daily gain. Bonk, Solana's second-largest memecoin and a Crossroads sponsor, is up 6%, while Book of Meme jumped 12%, and Popcat rallied 19.5%.Speaking to The Defiant, Thomas, the co-founder of Kamino, described memecoins as enabling the tokenization of viral culture. “We think that tokenizing virality is the future of France and Kamino is committed to building products to power this economic activity,” he said.King, the co-founder of Bonkbot, a Telegram trading bot, argued on-stage that meme tokens offer a superior mechanism for onboarding retail users than offering legacy trading products within a web3 setting.“I think that memecoins are a good way to onboard retail… they’re a simpler product than other, more complicated products like options,” he said. “A user can look at a meme, and if they laugh, they can buy the meme.”However, Streggs from Flash Point noted that the surge in memecoin trading activity has also driven congestion on Solana, with some users’ trades being included several blocks after their intended execution.“These are markets that can move 30% [to] 50% in a matter of minutes,” he said. “If I made a trade and it landed give blocks later, it would a difference [...] to my [profit and loss].King also noted the memecoin-induced congestion, noting that many Solana traders expect their transactions to execute “within seconds.”“Keeping users safe as well as congestion are the main issues that we face,” he said, acknowledging the prevalence of rug-pulls within the fast and loose memecoin segment. “I’ve been rugged my fair share of times,” King added.

Crypto insider turns $600 into $2.5 million of unrealized profits


A crypto insider has made over $153,000 of realized profits in 15 hours, trading in the Solana (SOL) ecosystem. The cryptocurrency trader started with a purchase worth $600 and currently holds over $2.5 million worth of VibeCat (Minette).
Interestingly, the address purchased the tokens at the same block VibeCat’s developer added the initial liquidity to the decentralized exchange. This is a solid indicator of inside trading, considering Solana blocks have an interval of 400 milliseconds.
As developed, the crypto insider withdrew 3.89 SOL from Binance, worth $600. With this initial amount, the address bought 2.46 Minette less than a second after its creator deposited the first available liquidity for trade.


According to Lookonchain‘s post, the trader sold 1.04 billion Minette for 998.7 SOL 15 hours later, realizing a profit of approximately $153,000. By the time of the post, the insider still held 1.42 billion Minette, valued at around $2.5 million.

Crypto insider rug pull alert
Notably, Lookonchain warned its followers about the risk of a rug pull from VibeCat’s creators and insiders. This is because the creator kept the LP tokens active—received as an “I Owe You” (IOU) for added liquidity.
Burning these IOUs is a common practice when launching a new token to avoid huge dumps, also known as a “rug pull.” Moreover, the insider’s current holdings could create constant selling pressure far above the available liquidity, impacting Minette’s price.
This is another example of how crypto insiders often take advantage of retail by creating and launching meme coins and money-grab schemes. They benefit from information asymmetry and the hype of a market that insists on gambling with poor fundamental digital assets.
Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile and present considerable risks for traders, investors, and users, even with solid and usable projects. However, trading meme coins adds another layer of risks that will often drain money from many to a few insiders.
For this reason, investors should avoid these schemes and look for a cryptocurrency‘s fundamentals, cautiously researching supply and demand properties.

Nano Reinvents Itself as Web3 Gaming Platform | Cryptopolitan

The Nano project is once again trying to regain the spotlight by adding Web3 features and trying to stand out as a gaming platform. Nano was one of the projects to appear during the bull market of 2017 and 2018, promising to become the digital money of the future. The token went through several booms and busts, finally rebranding itself with a new ticker, XNO. During the 2024 market expansion, XNO closely tracked Bitcoin’s growth, but so far, XNO has remained unchanged in Satoshi’s terms. XNO established a new price range in 2024, trading up to a yearly peak of $1.60. Later, XNO took a step back and consolidated at $1.16.As a payment tool, Nano was almost instant and extremely cheap to use. The coin relied on turning every mobile wallet into a node, propagating transactions with high speed and security. But the Nano project also suffered after the hack of the BitGrail exchange, where it crashed during the 2018 crypto winter.Nano Tries to Attract Sustainable Web3 GamesThe Nano network tries to find the right balance with Web3 gaming, which also offers earnings for the best performers. Play-to-earn games exploded in 2021, issuing millions of new tokens for all players. However, the model was not sustainable, and most games had to adapt or disappear. Nano is trying to bring the next generation of games with more sustainable rewards for playing. The XNO token itself will now become a reward, powering a new game ecosystem. Nano has retained a growing community over the years, though always facing the challenge of low token value. What Changed for Nano After Surviving Two Bear MarketsNano was formerly known as RAI Blocks, an attempt to reinvent global payments. The project always had grass-roots support and proved itself reliable as a way of sending value. Nano also gained support from the Litecoin community. Since then, Nano turned to new use cases and applications. The goal is to make XNO usable for services and activities to build up organic demand in the long term. One of the use cases is Nano GPT, where XNO is used to pay for premium prompts. Nano is perfectly adapted for microtransactions, due to its low latency and negligible fees. Microtransactions remove the need for subscriptions, giving access to several LLM. The Nano network is also resistant to spam and may handle increased traffic linked to gaming or Web3 use cases. XNO microtransactions have also been applied to decentralized streaming. XNO has been paid out for filling out surveys or other micro-tasks. The advantage of XNO is that it fulfills the task of a token for small payments and rewards, without the need to use another blockchain.On a usual day, the Nano blockchain is supported by around 122 online peers. Nano still has fewer than 500K wallets reported, but the network is capable of growing and scaling with each user. For now, Nano also has no central consensus server and has seldom reported lost coin balances. Nano Returns to Faucet-Based AdoptionAfter years of spectacular runs and crashes, XNO may not guarantee a new hike to a higher range. XNO remains a low-value asset still trying to get back in the spotlight. This also means XNO is accumulated and distributed to a wide community. Several faucet-like tools exist for Nano users, in the form of micro-payments or rewards for tasks and missions. During its initial distribution, XNO tokens were also distributed by a faucet that was open for more than a year before trading launched.This time, Nano faucets can be created by anyone, giving out incentives through microtransactions. The sums from the faucets are small, but they can drive real activity tied to games or other reward mechanisms. One of the setbacks of the Nano network is that it still has no decentralized finance. Even the Nano Swap exchange is practically illiquid. Nano also does not carry NFT or allow for other infrastructure tied to Web3. Instead, the XNO token uses its chief features – no fees and instant transfers – to become the basic unit of account for any type of project.

Ripple v. SEC case update as of May 10, 2024


With the cryptocurrency community still at the edge of its seat, waiting for the closure of the protracted courtroom battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulator has filed its remedies reply brief and supporting exhibits.
Specifically, the SEC has recently filed its public, redacted version of the remedies reply brief and supporting exhibits shortly after filing them under seal, according to the court documents shared by a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, James K. Filan, in an X post on May 8.

SEC’s brief details
Among other things, the agency’s brief states that Ripple’s claims that it did not act recklessly were “contrary to evidence,” as well as that its additional arguments were “unavailing,” therefore arguing for the necessity of the requested injunctions. According to the SEC:



“Ripple argues the Court ‘should also take into account the SEC’s own conduct,’ and that because the SEC supposedly ‘knew of Ripple’s activities no later than October 2013,’ this also counsels against injunctive relief. (…) Ripple’s contentions are meritless.”

Indeed, the regulator has accused Ripple of planning “to issue a new unregistered crypto asset,” referring to the company’s announcement on April 4, 2024, of the planned dollar-pegged stablecoin release, as one of the proofs of its continuous violations.
Finally, the SEC has tried to rebuke the blockchain company’s opposition to its demand to pay the $2 billion in damages over its XRP sales to institutional buyers, which Judge Analisa Torres ruled were securities sales, as opposed to retail purchases. In particular:

“Ripple insists on a ‘low’ penalty—under $10 million. But it fails to explain how that negligible ‘low’ penalty would meaningfully punish its violations or deter it or others from future large-scale capital raises without required registration.”


Commenting on the recent developments, Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, shared his disappointment with the SEC’s practices in the case, accusing the securities watchdog of “trying to pull the wool over the Judge’s eyes” but also stressing that:

“The good news is that we are closer than ever to putting this lawsuit behind us, though, unfortunately, many are just starting the journey. We trust the Court will approach the remedies phase fairly.” 

On top of that, Alderoty criticized the SEC’s argument that compares the blockchain company possessing crypto licenses from different jurisdictions to that of a New York restaurant not requiring a liquor license because it has obtained a fishing license in California and stated that:

“And just when you think the SEC can’t sink any lower if you are a financial regulator outside the US and have done the hard work of establishing comprehensive crypto licensing frameworks, know that the SEC has no respect for you and thinks you are handing out the equivalent of fishing licenses.”

Elsewhere, XRP, the token that has been at the center of the long-running Ripple v. SEC legal standoff, was at press time trading at the price of $0.51, recording a 0.37% decline in the last 24 hours, dropping 2.17% across the previous seven days and adding up to the 15.17% loss on its monthly chart, as per data on May 10.

Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Analyst Predicts Potential Dip To $52,000


																As the price action of Bitcoin continues to attract crypto investors’ interest, Michael Van De Poppe, a well-known market analyst and trader in a bearish scenario has made a worrying prediction, warning the community of a potential drop in price for the crypto asset to the $52,000 level.
Bitcoin Poised For A Possible Decline
Michael Van De Poppe’s prognosis explores the factors that are driving the gloomy view of Bitcoin‘s price trajectory, in the midst of market turbulence and uncertainty.

Possible drop to $52,000 | Source: Michael Van De Poppe on X
Should the asset fail to sustain this position, Van De Poppe anticipates a potential movement on the downside in the future. Thus, he has placed his price targets at $55,000 or even further toward the $52,000 threshold.
The post read:
Bitcoin is at the range low. This is technically the area where you’d prefer to see it hold, so the upward momentum continues, and the range holds. If this doesn’t hold, then we might expect $52-55K as a potential low on this correction.
Van De Poppe previously pointed out that Bitcoin is gradually moving close to the lower bounds of the range, in order to test support around $62,250 level. Consequently, it appears likely that BTC will keep moving toward the upside, following the breakout of the support level.
However, since the recently concluded Bitcoin Halving event, boredom has set in, suggesting a possible price decline. Thus, should a correction on the downside eventually take place, $52,000 and $55,000 are the two levels Van De Poppe expects BTC to drop to. Despite the negative outlook for BTC, the crypto expert thus far has urged investors to acquire more of the coin.
Opposite Sentiment On BTC’s Investment
While Poppe solicits investors to invest more in BTC, crypto critic and gold advocate Peter Schiff, on the other hand, has urged investors not to do so. Instead, Schiff has highlighted a possible impending massive rally for assets like Gold, Silver, and mining stocks.

He claims that the charts and the fundamentals have never looked this promising. Due to this, Schiff implored investors to engage more with these assets, saying Bitcoin is dead money and holders should sell before it is buried. “Take advantage of what could be the biggest precious metals bull market in history,” Schiff added.
As of today, Bitcoin’s price has shown resilience, fueling optimism of an upward movement. BTC has recovered the $63,000 price level once again after falling to nearly $60,700 on Thursday.
The digital asset is trading at $63,077, indicating a 3% rise in the last 24 hours. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that both the market cap and trading volume have also increased by 3.10% and 5.52%, respectively, in the past day.

StaFi LSaaS Stack now supports EigenLayer LRT


StaFi, a multi-chain liquid staking derivatives (LSD) protocol, has announced it would support the EigenLayer Liquid Restaking Token (LRT), according to the information shared with Finbold on May 10.
The integration accompanies the release of the StaFi 2.0 roadmap, outlining plans for the LRT Stack and representing a significant milestone just a month after launching LSaaS (Liquid Staking as a Service).
Leveraging the success of the EigenLayer mainnet launch
The addition of LRT support leverages the successful launch of the EigenLayer mainnet, enabling developers and project teams to seamlessly deploy LRT on LSaaS, greatly streamlining LRT development and enhancing the accessibility of restaking.


Liam Young, founder of StaFi, expressed excitement about the integration, stating:

“The integration of LRT into StaFi’s Liquid Staking as a Service is a major breakthrough for developers, who are now free to create restaking products that harness shared security across multiple chains. Up until now, building with LRT has been a complex task that entails significant lead time. StaFi’s LRT Stack will slash time to market while empowering builders to create novel solutions that draw upon the cryptoeconomic guarantees that liquid staking permits.” 

LRT Stack functionalities
The LRT Stack provides several key functionalities, including restake, unrestake, withdraw, mint, burn LRT, restaking pool, and delegate/undelegate restaking operator.
To facilitate the construction of the LRT/Ethereum (ETH) pair, AVS restaking rewards will be swapped for ETH in the market via swap. 
These functionalities will be further improved with the upgrade of EigenLayer, enabling developers and LRT operators to swiftly construct their LRT with the aforementioned functionalities.
EigenLayer LRT is already supported on the LSaaS Stack App, with continued support for Karak and BounceBit LRT. 
Some plans are also underway to introduce support for Bitcoin (BTC) LRT in the near future.

The episode delves into the nuances of the proposed payout, explaining how the estate was able to pay back more than 100% than the dollar value of the claims, why some creditors are being pitted against each other, and why it might get approved even “over the kicking and screaming” of some creditors. 
Braziel gives his insights into the the rapid formation of this plan, the controversial role of Sullivan and Cromwell, and the logistical challenges posed by what may end up being paper check payouts. 
 
Show highlights:

Why the plan that was filed this week is such big news
How it was never even possible for creditors to be made whole in crypto asset terms
How the majority of depositors actually had stablecoins on the FTX platform
Why there are “inter-creditor” disputes
What a “cramdown” is and why it’s significant in this case
Criticisms of the plan, and why larger investors, especially with crypto holdings, are having their gains socialized
Whether the FTX estate made mistakes by selling some of its positions before they 10x’ed
Why FTX didn’t reboot its platform 
What conflicts of interest might arise from law firm Sullivan and Cromwell
The tax implications for creditors who are non-US taxpayers
How the claims are going to be distributed
Whether the creditors will favor the proposal and the next steps

Render (RNDR) Surges 12% after Apple Highlights Octane Software | Coinspeaker



Many crypto traders believe that the iPhone maker’s brief acknowledgment of the software has propelled the recent surge in RNDR. 

Over the past week, RNDR, the digital asset linked to Render Network, a decentralized platform for GPU rendering, has been on a positive trend, experiencing a significant surge of over 40% by May 8, 2024. Continuing its upward trajectory, the token almost reached the $12 mark on Friday, marking a remarkable 12% increase. The surge in value coincides with a notable mention of Render by tech giant Apple in a promotional video shared on social media, showcasing the capabilities of its latest iPad with the M4 chip.
Apple’s Octane Recognition Boosts Render (RNDR) Token Price
The Render’s Octane software, mentioned in the video, is a powerful GPU rendering engine known for its ability to produce high-quality, photorealistic images. The software is supported by the Render network, enabling artists to efficiently scale their rendering work on-demand using GPU nodes.




Apple’s vice president of platform architecture, Tim Millet, acknowledged Octane during a four-minute keynote promoting the newly launched iPads.
In the video, Millet said that Apple users can leverage the significant increase in rendering power on the M4 by accessing nearly unlimited high-performance decentralized GPU compute power on Render using the Octane software.
Render confirmed that indeed, the Octane Apple mentioned in the video was its software when the project reposted the short clip on their X account on May 7.
Many crypto traders believe that the iPhone maker’s brief acknowledgment of the software has propelled the recent surge in RNDR.
Just last week, the token was trading at less than $10, with a market cap of around $4 billion. But with the recent surge, RNDR almost reached $12, settling at $11.33, according to CoinMarketCap data. Now, its market cap has climbed above $4 million.
RNDR Doesn’t Care
In a recent post on X,  a pseudonymous crypto trader, Mister Crypto, said that RNDR has been unfazed despite the current market downturn.
Mister Crypto compared Bitcoin’s (BTC) performance over the past week and said the crypto assets had been “falling, but RNDR just doesn’t care”. Meanwhile, after dipping below $62,000 and then bouncing back from last week’s drop to $57,000, Bitcoin has now recovered by over 6.62%. At the moment, the crypto asset is trading above $62,900.
CoinMarketCap data shows that Bitcoin currently boasts a total market capitalization of $1.2 trillion over the past day.

Can Bitcoin Reach $70K In the Next Few Months? New Altcoin Presales Poised for Massive Gains


																The question on everyone’s mind is whether Bitcoin can reach the impressive $70,000 mark in the coming months. While Bitcoin’s performance remains a focal point, the spotlight is also on new altcoin presales that are showing promising potential for massive gains. Among these, Dogeverse, Wiener AI, and Sealana are emerging as key players in the crypto market, each with unique selling points and exciting prospects.
Bitcoin’s Trajectory Aiming for $70K
Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, has been a rollercoaster of value fluctuations. Despite recent uncertainties, many analysts and investors are optimistic about its potential to surge to $70,000 in the near future. Factors such as market sentiment, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic conditions play crucial roles in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory.

It has been showing signs of a strong recovery, with some analysts suggesting that it could reach or even surpass $70,000 by the end of the year. This optimism is partly driven by the macroeconomic environment, including monetary policies and traditional finance (TradFi) investors increasingly allocating to Bitcoin ETFs. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has been a significant positive driver, suggesting a more mainstream adoption and institutional interest in cryptocurrency.
Market analysts from Coinpedia and crypto.news have noted that Bitcoin has already brushed against the $70,000 mark and, supported by substantial investments from ‘whales’ (large-scale holders), could be poised for new highs.

Dogeverse – The Next Big Meme Coin
DOGEVERSE emerges as a promising player in the meme coin arena, drawing inspiration from the success of Dogecoin.  Its multi-chain feature—it has been implemented in Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Smart Chain, among other blockchain ecosystems—sets it out.

Dogeverse has already attracted a lot of attention, raising over $13 million in its initial coin offering (ICO) just a few weeks. This early demand suggests that investors have a great desire for the coin. Its appeal is increased by the possibility to stake Dogeverse holdings and receive staking rewards, which are now at an annual percentage yield (APY) of over 70%.
Seeing its promise, traders and cryptocurrency influencers like Crypto Boy and Jacob Bury have predicted that Dogeverse may yield significant profits—some even predicting a 100x increase in value.

Wiener AI – Merging Meme and AI Trends
Wiener AI stands out for its innovative fusion of meme coin dynamics and artificial intelligence trends. This playful project mirrors the success of ScottyAI and offers daily staking rewards with an impressive APY for early investors. Operating on the ERC20 blockchain, Wiener AI aims to carve a niche in the competitive dog token space with its unique value proposition and forward-thinking approach.

The success of the project has been mostly attributed to its special fusion of cutting-edge technology and comedy. Meme coin fans have taken to WienerAI’s mascot, a funny cross between a dog and a sausage, and its AI-powered capabilities are rather useful to holders.
One noteworthy feature is the staking pool at WienerAI, which at the moment provides an annual percentage yield (APY) of more than 800%, much higher than industry norms. Investors have been encouraged to stake their tokens; over 68% of the tokens sold during the ICO were staked, which may lessen selling pressure after launch.
>>>Buy Weiner AI now<<<
Sealana – The Redneck Seal Making Waves
Sealana introduces a quirky concept with its depiction of a patriotic, overweight American redneck seal navigating the crypto world. Inspired by the impolite South Park character “Gamer Guy,” Sealana is a seal-themed degen who lived in his mother’s basement and ate chips and canned tuna instead of living in the water to seek meme coin fortune.

Despite market fluctuations, meme coins like Sealana demonstrate resilience, hinting at a potential surge in meme coin activity during the upcoming summer months. Sealana’s presale has already raised over $300,000, drawing interest from analysts and media outlets despite its lighthearted storyline.
Rumors indicating Sealana’s founders are the same group behind Slerf, a popular meme coin project that had a market capitalization of over $450 million in March, are adding to the frenzy. Though unproven, this relationship has given investors hope. Well-known people like Jacob Bury have suggested Sealana may provide substantial gains if it is listed on exchanges.

Considerations for Investors
As the crypto market continues to evolve, investors are keenly watching the impact of global economic trends, regulatory developments, and technological breakthroughs. With the rise of DeFi and the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class, the landscape is ripe for potential growth.
The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, with prices influenced by various factors including regulatory news, market sentiment, and technological advancements. While the potential for Bitcoin to reach $70,000 exists, investors should remain aware of the inherent risks and the possibility of sudden market shifts.
The potential for Bitcoin to reach $70,000 in the coming months is supported by a combination of factors including institutional investment, market sentiment, and technological advancements. At the same time, the burgeoning field of altcoins presents new opportunities for investors willing to explore these emerging assets.
Investors should consider the role of altcoins in diversifying their portfolios. Coins like DOGEVERSE, Wiener AI, and Sealana offer different value propositions and could represent a shift towards more niche and community-focused investments, which might lead to substantial returns.

FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried Talks About His New Life at Prison


In a rare glimpse behind the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) iron gates, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) shared the stark realities of prison life. The once high-flying CEO of crypto giant FTX spoke candidly in a recent interview.
Journalist William D. Cohan from Puck provided this intimate look. Bankman-Fried discussed his daily struggles and psychological resilience amid legal battles.
From Crypto Billionaire to Inmate: Bankman-Fried’s Life at MDC
Sam Bankman-Fried’s fall from grace was dramatic. He went from leading a multibillion-dollar empire to a federal prison cell. Celebrated as a financial tech industry wunderkind, he now faces a starkly different routine.
Their meeting took place in starkly utilitarian surroundings. These were far from the opulent settings Bankman-Fried knew.
He appeared physically diminished but mentally resilient. However, surprisingly, he has accepted his new circumstances.
Bankman-Fried’s day-to-day life is now dictated by the strict routines of prison life. The food, largely inedible to his vegan preferences, forces him to subsist on rice and beans from the commissary—now a currency among inmates.
Despite his notoriety, Bankman-Fried cautiously interacts with other prisoners. He navigates the complex social hierarchies of the prison with a blend of detachment and subtle engagement.

Interestingly, Dohan mentioned that Bankman-Fried doesn’t believe he committed any crimes.

“Only that he was the one responsible for putting FTX in a position where it was vulnerable to a bank run and the devious actions of its competitors, not unlike how both Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers failed in 2008. […] Sam wondered, [why] was he prosecuted when no one at either Bear or Lehman faced criminal prosecution?” Dohan wrote.

According to Bankman-Fried’s theory, he is in prison not for commingling FTX’s and Alameda’s assets. He sees himself as an innocent guy who didn’t get to negotiate with federal prosecutors. Bankman-Fried thinks the prosecutors just presented him with his indictment, then told him to accept it, plead guilty, or go to trial and fight.

Despite the gravity of his situation, Bankman-Fried showed his former analytical acumen. He discussed the prison economy with hints of his old entrepreneurial spirit.
The conversation also touched on darker themes. Bankman-Fried talked further about his isolation and the tangible sense of danger. Nonetheless, he has remained physically unharmed so far.

Inside Bankman-Fried’s Legal Battle and FTX’s Future
The legal battles ahead are a central theme in Bankman-Fried’s life. He is actively preparing for his appeal.
He works closely with his legal team to challenge the convictions leading to his lengthy sentence. BeInCrypto previously reported that Bankman-Fried filed a notice of appeal in April.
On March 28, 2024, Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years. Kaplan cited Bankman-Fried’s false testimonies and witness tampering attempts. He also ordered Bankman-Fried to a low or medium-security prison near his parents in California.
In a separate development, FTX and its associated debtors filed an updated Plan of Reorganization. They filed it with the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.

The strategy shows FTX has secured $14.5 to $16.3 billion for repayment. This figure comes from liquidating diverse assets, including those controlled by global entities involved in the proceedings. The strategy aims to consolidate FTX’s position and simplify the repayment process.

However, many are disappointed with FTX’s updated plan. This is due to the bankruptcy estate decision to freeze the value of customer crypto assets in November 2022.

At that time, Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market were not at their best. In November 2022, Bitcoin’s price slumped to as low as $15,742, according to CoinGecko data.

Jack Dorsey criticizes Bluesky for straying from decentralized ethos - Crypto Briefing




There’s always one or more reasons behind a company board member’s departure. With Jack Dorsey and Bluesky, it’s all about direction. Speaking with Pirates Wires this week, Bluesky’s inventor said the company is straying from its original decentralized ethos and resembling a conventional social media app, the type of app he intended to avoid at the beginning.“This is literally repeating all the mistakes we made as a company. This is not a protocol that’s truly decentralized. It’s another app. It’s another app that’s just kind of following in Twitter’s footsteps, but for a different part of the population,” Dorsey stated.Dorsey’s initial vision for Bluesky was to create a social media protocol that could overcome the challenges faced by centralized platforms, such as those he encountered at Twitter (now X). He expected that Bluesky would support free speech and not be beholden to the constraints of a publicly traded company dependent on advertising revenue.However, as Bluesky developed, it began incorporating more traditional corporate elements, including forming a board and seeking venture capital funding. For a person deeply committed to decentralization, it’s a clear departure from his original goals for the project.“Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an [open-source] protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board. That’s not what I wanted, that’s not what I intended to help create,” Dorsey remarked.According to him, this shift, combined with a growing emphasis on app development and moderation tools, moved Bluesky away from being a truly decentralized protocol.Commenting on the public perception of Bluesky as “anti-Twitter,” Dorsey said it was not the foundational intention. Bluesky was meant to be a neutral protocol rather than a direct competitor.Dorsey also noted the limitations of the advertising-based revenue model for social media platforms, which he believes compromises content policies and platform governance. He suggests alternative revenue streams, such as subscriptions and commerce, could provide a more sustainable and less compromising approach.Earlier this week, the team behind Bluesky announced that Dorsey was no longer on the board of directors. At the time, neither Dorsey nor Bluesky commented publicly on the departure.After leaving Bluesky, Dorsey has turned his attention to Nostr, a protocol he considers a more accurate reflection of his decentralized social media aspirations, operating without a central authority or corporate structure.

Is DogWifHat Dead? Crypto Expert Tweets $1 Price Target, New Meme Coin WienerAI Raises $1.4 Million


                        
                            Is DogWifHat Dead? Crypto Expert Tweets $1 Price Target, New Meme Coin WienerAI Raises $1.4 Million

One influential trader believes DogWifHat will crash soon. 
                        A top crypto influencer on X believes the popular Solana meme coin DogWifHat ($WIF) could tumble all the way down to a dollar from its current price of $3.17. In a recent tweet, Bluntz Capital (@Bluntz_Capital) cautioned, “price action on this bounce over the last 3 weeks has been slow, overlapping, and corrective looking.” Bluntz further argues that WIF’s current gains could be a brief wobble before the token crashes and bottoms out at a dollar. Since Bluntz joined the ByBit copy trading platform a year ago, he has been ranked as one of the top influencers, meaning he has consistently made money for his followers.Still, DogWifHat’s current price performance does not reflect a decline.WIF is up 12% in the last 24 hours and 15% in the last week. It’s moving broadly in line with the rest of the market, where most leading projects are up today.The project with the second largest gains among the top five meme coins by market capitalization is Pepe Coin.PEPE rose 6.8% to change hands at $0.05862 as of this writing. It is also up 13% in the last seven days. Both meme coins outdid market leaders Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH). Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, grew 3.5% overnight to trade at $63,176, while Ethereum added 2.2% to hit $3,037.Like the market leaders, WIF rallied throughout March. However, it diverged a little at the end when the meme coin continued rallying strongly and actually rose to set a new all-time high of $4.83 on March 31. Today’s price represents a 34.2% decline since then. Source: TradingViewDogWifHat currently has a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 57. This has been climbing since midweek, indicating buying momentum. If it doesn’t cool off, investors may well see the beginning of the correction described by Bluntz. As DogWifHat Wobbles, Crypto’s First Trading Companion, WienerAI, Raises $1.4 Million.
Bluntz’s prediction may prove to be prophetic for WIF holders in the mid-term. Should the currency rebound from a dollar, which he implies, then there will be no damage done. However, meme coins highlight the inherently volatile nature of crypto.A new generation of meme coins is cropping up though which bring bundles of utility along with laughs.One of the finest representatives of this new generation of coins is WienerAI. $WAI is a brand new meme token and AI companion that may yield some potentially eye-watering rallies once word gets out about its core offering.The presale is not even a month old and it has already quietly taken in $1.4 million.Touted as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner”, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.The WienerAI smart contract was audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms. Around 20% of $WAI’s supply is for staking. WienerAI’s website encourages buyers to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 660% APY. Stay on top of WienerAI news over on X and Telegram. Join the presale now over on the WienerAI website.

                        Crypto exchange Kraken urged the US court to dismiss the SEC claims against it to avoid a “significant reordering” of the US financial regulatory structure.In November 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated a lawsuit against Kraken. The SEC, alleging it had been operating an unregistered securities trading platform.This suit came months after settling charges over Kraken’s former staking service.In February 2024, Kraken filed to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that it relied solely on a registration-based argument regarding Kraken’s operation as an unlicensed securities entity.Kraken argued that cryptocurrencies listed as SEC-compliant should be treated like commodities and not securities.However, now Kraken has escalated its position, urging the court to dismiss the claims to avoid a “significant reordering” of the US financial regulatory structure, according to court filings submitted in the Northern District of California on Thursday.The SEC filed an opposition to Kraken’s motion to dismiss, asserting that its enforcement action falls within its congressionally granted authority. They emphasize its role in enforcing registration requirements for securities intermediaries.“In applying the Howey test in its determination that Kraken must register, the SEC is simply following its Congressional mandate.”They also stated that it’s not overstepping its powers and doesn’t need to “enact bespoke laws to each new technology that emerges.”Kraken’s response to the SEC’s motion centers on interpreting the SEC’s jurisdiction through the Howey test.This assesses whether an investment qualifies as a security based on 4 main criteria: an investment of money, expectation of profits, common enterprise, and reliance on the efforts of others. Kraken’s lawyers argued against:“The SEC cannot satisfy Howey’s additional requirements that there be investments of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others.”According to Kraken, the SEC’s interpretation would unnecessarily broaden its jurisdiction beyond what was intended, potentially drastically changing the financial regulatory environment. They said:“This would gut Howey by significantly expanding the SEC’s jurisdiction to a host of investment activities that were never delegated to the agency. Such a significant reordering of the US’s financial regulatory structure should be debated in Congress, not in the courts.”SEC in Question for Hammering Crypto
Kraken is just one of many leading companies within the crypto space battling with the SEC. Coinbase, Uniswap, Metamask, and Robinhood have also received regulatory action.Despite making no progress on individual cases, the SEC continues to challenge major players in the space.In 2023, like Kraken, Coinbase locked into a battle with the SEC after the federal agency accused the crypto exchange of selling unregistered securities.Legal counsel for Coinbase had requested that DC Judge Katherine Polk Failla determine whether or not the matter falls outside of the agency’s delegated authority.During a January hearing, Failla pushed back against Coinbase’s request to restrict the SEC’s regulatory scope.However, Judge Failla placed the case on hold questioning the overreach of the SEC in their claims. She stated:“I worry that I would be doing exactly the thing you’re alleging the Commission is doing here, which is to take power that I don’t have to stop activity I shouldn’t be stopping.”Crypto Community Stands With Kraken in the Fight Against the SEC
The continued assault on the crypto space has prompted many figures to speak out, citing the SEC’s anti-crypto agenda to be an attempt to push crypto out of the US.Ethereum Co-founder Joseph Lubin criticized the SEC’s approach, alleging that instead of fostering open discourse and providing clear regulatory guidelines, the SEC has opted for strategic enforcement actions.This has caused unease within the cryptocurrency industry amidst such regulatory uncertainty,  causing US investors have become hesitant to enter the space. Lubin commented:“The SEC probably doesn’t want to see a wave of innovation that will really transform the landscape.”In February 2024, the Crypto and Financial Technology Advocacy Group (CFAT), which includes prominent figures like Paradigm, Coinbase, and Ledger, filed a lawsuit against the SEC.This came under claims that “The SEC’s novel attempt to extend its regulatory power to virtually all digital assets reach far beyond the scope of its statutory authority.”CFAT also argued that SEC’s ruling-by-enforcement approach has hindered crypto’s innovation. They claim the SEC has:“Left this trillion-dollar industry in an unsustainable state of uncertainty, subject to the arbitrary enforcement whims of an agency with an overly broad view of its own authority.”Hence, Kraken’s position on the matter urged a dismissal. For the SEC to continue, it must revaluate the current US legal framework. Unless they stop overreaching their authority.

ANI Pharmaceuticals Beats Expectations with $137.4 Million in Q1 Revenues - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANIP) has set a new benchmark in its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024, demonstrating significant growth across all business segments. The company reported record quarterly net revenues of $137.4 million, marking a year-over-year increase of 28.7%. This growth was propelled by a notable performance in the Rare Disease business, which saw net revenues soar to $36.9 million, a staggering 126.2% increase from the previous year. Such robust growth underscores the increasing market penetration and expansion of the overall ACTH market, particularly for their lead Rare Disease asset, Cortrophin Gel.



The adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA reached a record $37.6 million, alongside an adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.21. These figures not only reflect the company’s operational excellence and successful new product launches but also highlight the strategic investments made to expand awareness and utilization of Cortrophin Gel in new specialties. The company’s ability to maintain momentum in its Generics, Established Brands, and Other segment, achieving a double-digit increase in Generics revenue, further emphasizes its operational strength and market agility.



ANI Pharmaceuticals Surpasses Q1 Expectations with $1.21 EPS and $137.4 Million in Revenues



Comparing ANI’s current performance against expectations reveals a narrative of significant overachievement. Analysts had projected an EPS of $0.98 and revenue expectations of $125.35 million for the quarter. ANI’s reported EPS of $1.21 and revenues of $137.4 million comfortably surpassed these forecasts, indicating a robust financial health and operational efficiency exceeding market expectations. This outperformance is particularly noteworthy in the context of the Rare Disease segment, where Cortrophin Gel’s revenue of $36.9 million far exceeded expectations, driven by increased prescription demand across core and new specialties. The company’s Generics, Established Brands, and Other segment also outperformed, with revenue growth of 11.1% year-over-year, further contributing to the company’s overall success.





ANI Reiterates Guidance for Full Year 2024, Expects Non GAAP EPS Between $4.26 to $4.67



Looking ahead, ANI has reiterated its guidance for the full year 2024, projecting net revenues in the range of $520 million to $542 million and adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA between $135 million and $145 million. The adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $4.26 and $4.67. This guidance includes anticipated net revenues from Cortrophin Gel ranging from $170 million to $180 million, which would represent a year-over-year growth of 52% to 61%. Such projections reflect the company’s confidence in its strategic initiatives and the continued growth trajectory of its Rare Disease business. ANI’s commitment to enhancing its generics business, coupled with the strategic focus on its Rare Disease segment, positions the company well for sustainable growth and long-term value creation for its stakeholders.

Bitcoin's 'Kimchi Premium' Shrinks Amidst South Korea's Fading Crypto Fervor


							

The decline in South Korea’s Kimchi Premium signals shifting sentiments in the country’s crypto market.



Limited local supply exacerbates price gaps, contributing to fluctuations in the Kimchi Premium.



Decreased trading volumes on top South Korean exchanges reflect subdued market activity amidst global events.




The Kimchi Premium, often regarded as a gauge of South Korea’s interest in cryptocurrencies, has been consistently decreasing, hitting 1.54% on a recent Friday afternoon in Asia. This metric reflects the variance in Bitcoin prices between South Korea and other global markets and has experienced a notable decline since mid-April, signaling a notable change in the country’s cryptocurrency scene.



This decline in the Kimchi Premium can be attributed to various factors influencing South Korea’s crypto market. One key element is the restrictive nature of the market itself, which limits foreign investors’ access. Local investors engaging in arbitrage face potential legal repercussions under the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act if they buy large volumes of crypto from foreign exchanges.



Moreover, South Korea’s limited local supply of cryptocurrencies exacerbates price discrepancies. During periods of heightened demand, such as observed in March when the premium reached its peak at 11.44%, the gap widens due to an imbalance between the supply and demand of Bitcoin.



A notable trend accompanying the decrease in the Kimchi Premium is the reduced trading volumes on South Korea’s top crypto exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax. These exchanges, which dominate the local market, collectively recorded a trading volume of $2 billion in the past 24 hours, significantly lower than the nearly $18 billion reported on March 6, according to CoinGecko data.









Several factors may have contributed to the dampened enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies in South Korea. Events such as the conflict in the Middle East and continued net outflows in U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could have influenced investor sentiment. 



Additionally, the lack of significant events highlighting Bitcoin’s value since the halving occurred last month may have contributed to subdued market activity. With Bitcoin priced at $62,974.01, marking a 3.24% increase in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s trading volume over this period stands at $25,433,969,068, showcasing robust market activity within the day.

Indian Customers Can Once Again Access Binance: Reports


Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, is reportedly poised to continue its operations after agreeing to pay India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) a fine. 
This decision is a key part of a broader compliance drive by international exchanges with Indian regulations.
Binance Joins KuCoin to Become Compliant Crypto Exchange in India
Binance and KuCoin achieved a milestone by becoming the first offshore crypto-related entities to register with FIU-IND. This step is indeed crucial in a sector where Indian authorities demand compliance with strict anti-money laundering (AML) laws.
The need for registration arose after a challenging period in December 2023, when FIU-IND issued show-cause notices to nine offshore crypto exchanges. This also included industry leaders like Binance and Kraken. 

Read more: The State of Crypto Regulation in India
With Apple removing non-compliant platforms from its App Store and the IT Ministry blocking their websites, users were urged to transfer their assets to FIU-registered Indian exchanges. These notices stemmed from the exchanges operating without adhering to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2002, which demands stringent record-keeping and reporting standards.
Finally, following the footsteps of KuCoin, which has resumed operations after settling a $41,000 penalty, Binance might make a similar move. 

“Binance is registered but the compliance proceedings are not completed because the amount of penalty has to be decided by me and that hearing is still going on,” Vivek Aggarwal, head of FIU-IND said.


Sumit Gupta, the co-founder of the Indian crypto exchange – CoinDCX, welcomed Binance and KuCoin to the Indian market. In an interview with BeInCrypto, Gupta expressed enthusiasm about the developments. 

“A compliant crypto ecosystem, comprising FIU-compliant players, not only benefits all stakeholders but also safeguards against bad actors. These developments mark significant progress towards ensuring that crypto exchanges operate in accordance with regulations like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), thus laying the foundation for a more compliant ecosystem,” Gupta told BeInCrypto.

Balaji Srihari, the Business Head at CoinSwitch, also echoes these sentiments.


“It is commendable to see major global exchanges such as Binance and KuCoin leading by example and adhering to FIU standards. These norms establish a systematic approach to monitoring transactions and provide a designated channel for reporting suspicious activities,” Srihari told BeInCrypto.

As Binance edges towards full compliance, its customers will likely incur financial obligations. This includes a 1% tax deduction at source (TDS). Introduced in 2022, a 1% TDS on crypto trading aims to increase transparency.

Moreover, traders face a 30% capital gains tax on profits, which has been a contentious issue within the crypto community. However, these regulatory measures are part of a broader effort by the Indian government to regulate the crypto market. The goal is to align with global standards while protecting investor interests.

Crypto Nonprofit Launches PAC to Support Pro-Crypto Politicians in 2024 Elections - Benzinga

A cryptocurrency nonprofit has launched a political action committee (PAC) with the intent to support crypto-friendly politicians in the 2024 House and Senate elections.What Happened: “Stand With Crypto,” a cryptocurrency nonprofit, has launched a PAC to raise funds from its 440,000 members to support a bipartisan group of candidates, Reuters reported on Wednesday. This move is part of a broader effort by the crypto industry to elect politicians who support crypto and blockchain.This involvement comes at a time when the industry is under scrutiny, especially after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of stealing from customers.Unlike super PACs, Stand With Crypto’s PAC is established to collect funds for candidates or political causes and cannot receive donations of unlimited size or coordinate directly with campaigns.See Also: Tom Brady Roasted For Cryptocurrency Investment In Netflix Special: ‘Tom, How Did You Fall For That? Even Gronk Was Like—Me Know That’s Not Real Money’“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November,” said Nick Carr, chief strategist at Stand With Crypto. Why It Matters: Other crypto super PACs such as Fairshake, Defend American Jobs, and Protect Progress have already raised over $110 million this election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records. The involvement of crypto in politics is not new. Earlier this year, the Fairshake PAC received a significant financial boost from the Winklevoss twins, founders of the Gemini crypto exchange, as part of their larger fundraising efforts.Former U.S. President Donald Trump has also publicly endorsed cryptocurrency, declaring it a significant election issue, contrasting with President Joe Biden‘s perceived unfamiliarity with the crypto world. This endorsement has led to a surge in the MAGA Coin, a cryptocurrency themed around Trump.Read Next: Here’s How Much $1,000 Invested In Dogecoin Would be Worth If You Invested When Elon Musk First Tweeted About DOGEImage by Dall-E

Is China the Next Step for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs? Much Talked About BTC-ETH Step from the Giant Company! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Hong Kong, which took a big step after the USA in spot ETFs, recently launched spot Bitcoin Ethereum ETFs.
Hong Kong ETFs failed to perform as expected, but it is claimed that there is potential for companies to enter China through ETFs.


At this point, Harvest Global Investments, a leading Chinese fund house and Hong Kong's first spot ETF issuer, has set its sights on mainland China.
Speaking at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong, Harvest CEO Han Tongli announced that his company plans to offer direct access to Bitcoin and Ethereum products to investors in China through its ETF Connect program.





He said that if market conditions are suitable, they will apply for BTC and ETH ETFs to be included in the connect program within the next two years.

“We have some plans for Bitcoin and Etheruem ETFs to reach investors in China. If we, as Harvest Global, manage to get spot BTC-ETH ETFs into the Stock Connect program, a new investment path will be opened for investors in mainland China.
Since the regulatory environment on the mainland is quite uncertain, the Stock Connect program could be a pioneer in regulating cryptocurrency investments, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum. “

Kraken v. SEC: What's New in Legal Saga?

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



In the ongoing legal saga between Kraken and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the crypto exchange has launched a salvo with a new filing that argues the agency’s case was not worded correctly.Kraken filed a response on Thursday to the SEC's April letter regarding the company's motion to dismiss the case. The exchange argues that the SEC's argument lacked precision, as it failed to specify any investment contracts tradable on Kraken. Instead of using the terms "investment contract" and "enterprise," the SEC opted for phrases like "investment concept" and "ecosystem" throughout its argument, according to Kraken's filing.The SEC's stance, as outlined in its April filing, defends its choice of language by stating that the scope of the law extends beyond conventional interpretations. This stance was backed by case law, the SEC argued.Last November, the SEC accused Kraken of operating as an unregistered broker, dealer, exchange and clearing agency. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Kraken has been unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities since at least September 2018, earning hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. Kraken, under its parent company Payward Inc., had previously settled charges brought by the SEC against its staking business in February 2023.As the case progresses, the crypto community watches with bated breath. Kraken's challenge to the SEC's wording is more than a legal argument; it is a stand against what the exchange views as an overextension of regulatory power.The outcome of the Kraken case could have significant implications for how crypto exchanges operate and how digital assets are classified and regulated in the United States going forward.

Bitcoin's price set to move higher if macro outlook remains supportive: Grayscale report - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin’s price and the overall crypto market capitalization have the potential to “move higher” through the remainder of the year as long as the macroeconomic outlook remains broadly supportive, according to Grayscale’s report published on Thursday.Bitcoin’s price dropped 15% in April, and the total crypto market cap also decreased slightly. However, Bitcoin and Ethereum have still outperformed the broader crypto sector indexes.According to the report, we may be in the “seventh-inning stretch” of Bitcoin’s bull market cycle, with a pause in the rally seeming appropriate given the shift in Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy expectations.Analysts suggested that the market was less confident about the likelihood of Fed rate cuts this year with stubborn inflation and strong US growth. This has bolstered the US dollar and pressured Bitcoin prices.However, the US economy is poised for a soft landing, Grayscale’s report stated. Analysts point to Fed officials hinting at future rate cuts and the November elections, which are not expected to increase fiscal discipline.“The macro outlook still seems supportive: the US economy is on track for a soft landing, Fed officials are signaling that rate cuts will eventually be appropriate, and the November elections seem unlikely to result in more fiscal discipline,” analysts stated.On the technical front, Bitcoin’s valuation metrics, such as the MVRV ratio, are currently below the peaks of previous cycles, indicating room for growth.“As long as the macro outlook remains broadly unchanged from here, Grayscale Research believes that Bitcoin’s price and total crypto market capitalization can move higher again through the balance of the year,” analysts noted.Neel Kashkari, one of the Fed’s most hawkish members, said on Tuesday that holding interest rates at current levels for a longer period than anticipated is a much more likely scenario than raising them further. However, he added that the Fed could cut rates if they observe a rise in unemployment.Kashkari said he previously expected there might be room to cut interest rates twice in 2024. However, he is now considering adjusting that expectation, potentially reducing the number of cuts to one or even none.“I would need to see multiple positive inflation readings suggesting that the disinflation process is on track,” Kashkari stated.Grayscale’s report also touches on the potential implications of a second Trump administration for the US Dollar and Bitcoin, referring to Standard Chartered’s prediction that Bitcoin may gain from a Trump election victory.Despite the challenging macro backdrop, there were positive developments within the crypto markets, such as the Bitcoin halving. The halving significantly reduced the network’s new issuance rate and has brought Bitcoin’s inflation rate below that of gold’s supply inflation.In addition, rising activity on the Ethereum network and progress on stablecoin legislation in the US were notable events.Analysts shared that “Senators Lummis and Gillibrand proposed a bipartisan bill outlining a framework for stablecoin legislation. The proposal involved a requirement for stablecoin issuers to hold one-to-one reserves, consumer safeguards such as FDIC involvement in the event of failures, and an outright ban on algorithmic stablecoins.”Stablecoin market capitalization is growing, with USDC gaining market share on Tether. Regulatory clarity on stablecoins could be a positive development for the industry, analysts suggest.“In our view, US regulatory clarity on the status of stablecoins on public blockchains would be an important step forward for payments use cases. In addition to progress on legislation, the payments processing firm Stripe announced that it would allow its customers to send USDC stablecoin payments on Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon—another positive sign for the development of these networks,” analysts added.

Giant Lending Platform BlockFi Announces That Its Website Will Be Closed! User Moved Their Funds to This Cryptocurrency Exchange! - Bitcoin Sistemi

BlockFi, a leading centralized lending platform, announced this month that it plans to shut down its web platform and called for alternative measures to be implemented to ensure uninterrupted access to user funds.
BlockFi Announces Shutdown of Web Platform, Facilitates Cryptocurrency Withdrawals via Coinbase
To facilitate a seamless transition for its customers, BlockFi announced a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, allowing eligible users to access cryptocurrency withdrawals through the Coinbase platform.


The decision to work with Coinbase as a distribution partner comes as BlockFi prepares to shut down its web platform, which serves as a gateway for users to manage their crypto assets.
With the upcoming closure, BlockFi aims to provide continuity in cryptocurrency withdrawals for its customers, especially those with BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIA), Personal Loans and Private Client accounts.





“BlockFi is pleased to announce that we have appointed Coinbase as our distribution partner to ensure the continuity of cryptocurrency withdrawals available to our eligible BlockFi Interest Account (BIA), Personal Loan and Private Clients,” the firm said in a recent announcement.
According to BlockFi, customers who missed the April 28 withdrawal deadline and the May 10 verification deadline still have the opportunity to access their assets through a verified Coinbase account.



This strategic collaboration ensures that affected clients maintain control over their crypto assets without immediate conversion to cash.
However, for customers who are eligible to withdraw cryptocurrency but cannot meet the specified deadlines and do not have a verified Coinbase account, their assets will be converted to cash and distributed as stated in the plan.





The decision to shut down the web platform follows a series of challenges faced by BlockFi, including a suspension of customer withdrawals in November 2022 and subsequent filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

How the NFT Transparent Marketplace Wins Over Game Skin Markets | Cryptopolitan

Today’s climate seems favorable to the growth of blockchain-based digital items known as NFT. At its peak, the digital item market reached sales of around $17B, while mainstream digital items drew in around $50B. Owning digital items is not unusual at all, even for the biggest NFT skeptics. The global in-game item industry grows by leaps every year. By 2025, an estimated $77B may be spent on in-game purchases, though there are even higher estimates for the consumption of digital items. The virtual goods market may reach $294B by the decade’s end, with 20% yearly growth. While some of that spending will be on cosmetic digital items, technological growth may add new digital item categories and economic models. Will the Real Digital Ownership Become the NFT Selling Point?In gross terms and monetary size, the digital market for mainstream games seems to be winning. However, players have always faced disaster with digital items held on a game server. Players have reported disasters like stolen skins, or digital items that do not work in a new game version. Not only did the skin market expand to $50B annually in the past few years, but skins are now key to adding game variety and achieving a personalized look. Safe, guaranteed ownership is, therefore, key to securing valuable items. The biggest challenge for supporters of NFT technology is to dispel the image that digital items are primarily sold for profit instead of serving as a layer of security for ownership. So far, only a few mainstream gaming studios have introduced NFT, and those were only optional or experimental. NFT Wins with More Transparent MarketplaceThe informal market for skins in mainstream games developed so fast that there is no reliable venue for changing ownership. The skin-selling market is informal, unregulated, and has no transparency. All sites for reselling set their terms, and often, price settlement is informal, with no arbitration or recourse. Compared to informal gaming skin reselling, the NFT market is extremely transparent and well-organized. Each NFT comes with a clear history of ownership transfers. Additionally, price information is easily gathered. All items in a collection are known and searchable, and there is information on the highest and lowest price, rarity, and potential demand.Mainstream Markets Copy NFT Trading ModelThe boom of NFT trading in 2021 and 2022 created some good practices in trading digital items. Projects like White Market have brought together the best of both worlds. The market specializes in swapping Counter Strike 2 skins, modeling scarcity, price and demand similar to OpenSea. White Market also uses WhiteBit Codes as a tool to pay with digital currency. Skin owners can use USDT to buy or receive funds. The opposite is also happening—the Avalanche-based game Shrapnel allows direct card purchases of its SHRAP in-game token, opening up to a large pool of players not willing to pay in crypto.Can Game Items Be Tokenized Again?There is hardly a need for game companies to decide on a true ownership standard for their in-game items. Instead, blockchain startups are simply adding a new layer of security. Metazero is one of those projects, which aims to tokenize already existing digital assets. Users with existing Steam accounts can secure all their skins, weapons or items through Metazero. This way, their items will have their value represented on the blockchain. Additionally, CS2 game items can be tokenized as NFT and traded again for their rarity, in a form of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.Some game companies have been skeptical and have tried to protect their items from tokenization. One such case was Mojang’s Minecraft, which banned the creation of NFT based on its game images, skins, land or other items. This led to the dissolution of NFT Worlds, one of the most successful collections based on land plots on a Minecraft server. Others, like Counter Strike: Global Offensive, have embraced a model similar to NFT, assigning transparent rarity levels to their weapon skins. With rarity to motivate resellers, those skins command peak values on resale markets.Who is the winner? In 2024, the NFT market and game skin industry are either going for a collision or partnership. The technology ensures a fair, transparent market, while tapping rarity, visual appeal, and player preferences.

Magic Eden Overtakes Blur, Fueled by Bitcoin Ecosystem Growth


Magic Eden has surpassed Blur to become the leading NFT marketplace in terms of trading volume, signaling a significant shift in the dynamic 
NFT landscape. This highlights Magic Eden‘s growing influence and traders’ and collectors’ evolving preferences.
Magic Eden Exceeds Blur’s NFT Volume
This development demonstrates Magic Eden’s success and underscores the increasing importance of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
According to DappRadar’s April 2024 Dapp Industry Report, Magic Eden’s trading volume exceeded Blur’s by $108 million. Runestone, a significant Bitcoin Ordinals inscription, has played a crucial role. 

“Magic Eden, now allowing the trading of Bitcoin Ordinals, holds the top spot, with Bitcoin Ordinals trading accounting for 70% of the marketplace’s total volume. This underscores their growing popularity,” DappRadar noted.


By leveraging Bitcoin’s UTXO model to minimize blockchain data, potentially reducing transaction fees compared to traditional Ordinals, Runestone has become the NFT collection with the highest trading volume in April. 
It surpassed the iconic Bored Ape Yacht Club. This underscores Bitcoin collections’ impact on the NFT market, a trend likely to continue.

Bitcoin collections have witnessed a 32% increase in trading volume, reaching an impressive $675 million this month. This surge has propelled Bitcoin to become the blockchain with the highest trading volume, outpacing the industry stalwart Ethereum.
Magic Eden’s ascent stems from its strategic embrace of the Bitcoin ecosystem and comprehensive platform features. Low transaction fees, a user-friendly interface supporting multiple blockchains, and continuous platform enhancements have enabled Magic Eden to capture and sustain a substantial market share.
While Magic Eden’s rise is remarkable, the broader NFT market has experienced a 13% decline in total trading volume to $1.35 billion in April, although sales increased by 20%. This dichotomy results from Runestone’s rising popularity and the overall surge in Bitcoin collections.

Despite the overall market downturn, Bitcoin collections have emerged as resilient. Four of the top eight collections in sales volume were Bitcoin-based, collectively recording $423 million in sales. 
In contrast, Ethereum collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club recorded relatively low sales volumes of $26 million and $25 million, respectively.

What is Ethereum?
Founded in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum serves as a distributed blockchain computing platform designed for the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). The network enables users to create and innovate extensively with smart contracts, catalyzing the emergence of various assets and industries such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Web3 and beyond. At its core, Ethereum features an execution engine tailored for smart contract processing, known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In addition, Ethereum employs a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which enhances its scalability and sustainability.ETH Price Performance and Ethereum On-Chain Data Analysis 
April saw a period of volatility for Ether (ETH). On April 8, the ETH price reached $3,723, but plunged 30% between April 9 and April 13, reaching a 50-day low of $2,863. While there was a partial recovery on April 14, a failed attempt to break the $3,200 resistance level indicated further weakness. ETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewOn April 23, the ETH price rose above $3,200, potentially fueled by increased demand for Ethereum DApps. This was further supported by a surge in the network’s total value locked (TVL) reaching its highest level since July 2022 ($58 billion on April 12 and $56,9 billion on April 28), indicating continued activity within the DeFi space.Ethereum’s TVL has been climbing year-to-date. Source: ArtemisHowever, the lack of clarity regarding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S., especially the upcoming SEC decision on VanEck’s proposal, could dampen investor interest. At the end of the month, the ETH price dropped again, reaching $3,000.Additional data also reveals a decline in Ethereum’s network activity (in specific metrics) over the last month (especially compared to March). Daily active addresses on Ethereum dropped from 534k addresses on March 20 to 379k addresses on April 24, but this number increased at the end of the month and reached 474k on April 30. Ethereum also witnessed a decline in daily transactions in April – from 1.4 million on March 19 to 1.1 million on April 27.Number of active addresses on Ethereum.

This stands in contrast to most other altcoins like Solana, Litecoin, and Chainlink, which enjoyed positive inflows of $4 million, $3 million, and $2.8 million respectively during the same period. Weekly crypto flows by asset. Source: CoinSharesAt the same time, Ethereum’s on-exchange supply also continued to decline throughout April, at a faster rate than Bitcoin. This indicates a decreasing supply of Ethereum available for trading, suggesting a potential shortage. This behavior aligns with the trend of investors holding Ethereum for longer periods, incorporating it into their long-term portfolios. Other indicators, such as the high staking ratio, further support this hypothesis.In April, gas fees on the Ethereum network dropped to their lowest level in six months following the Dencun upgrade on Ethereum on March 13. This drop in gas fees could be a harbinger of an upcoming rally for altcoins, according to analysts at crypto data platform Santiment. Santiment’s data, shared in an X post on April 28, shows that the average cost of an Ethereum transaction fell as low as $1.12 on April 27.Spot Ether ETFs Face Regulatory Uncertainty
The future of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US remains shrouded in uncertainty. Over the past two months, Ether has significantly underperformed Bitcoin. This trend intensified in April after Jan van Eck, Chief Investment Officer of VanEck, expressed concerns about possible rejections of US spot Ether ETF applications in May. This news came on top of the SEC’s inaction on the seven pending spot Ether ETF applications, further dampening investor sentiment. In April, the SEC announced a delay in its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot Ether ETF, extending the deadline to June 11, 2024. The SEC also delayed a similar proposal for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. Other issuers that have filed applications for Ether ETFs include BlackRock, 21Shares with Ark, Fidelity and Invesco, as well as Galaxy and Hashdex.While Bitcoin enjoyed a relatively smooth path to spot ETF approval in January, the outlook for spot Ethereum ETFs seems less certain.In March, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimated a significantly lower chance (around 35%) for SEC approval of a spot Ether ETF in May, effectively moving the needle of the ETH price as well. This pessimism stems from the SEC’s noticeably less engaged approach compared to the Bitcoin ETF application process. Additionally, SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s refusal to clarify whether Ether is considered a security in an April 18 hearing on oversight of the SEC adds another layer of uncertainty to the decision-making process.Fellow analyst James Seyffart also expressed concern over the SEC’s inaction, questioning the reasons behind the lack of communication when the applications were anticipated.Beyond the immediate impact on spot ETFs, the ongoing regulatory disputes cast a shadow over the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Adding fuel to the fire, Uniswap Labs, a developer of the software on which Uniswap – a widely used DEX – facilitates trading, announced on April 10 its intention to “fight” after receiving notice that the SEC is mulling a lawsuit against the company. While details remain unclear, Uniswap claims that its UNI token is not a security and that its platform doesn’t qualify as a US securities exchange or broker. Meanwhile, on April 25, software development company Consensys filed a lawsuit against the SEC and its five commissioners over claims it plans “to regulate ETH as a security.”But even amid the regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum in the US, Hong Kong has taken a bold step forward. On April 30, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange launched spot Bitcoin- and Ether-based ETFs. The Hong Kong-based ETFs – managed by China Asset Management, Harvest Global, Bosera and HashKey – only reached $12.4 million in trading volume during the first day, which pales compared to the first-day trading volume of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, valued at $4.6 billion. Although the volume was relatively small, it’s important to note that Hong Kong’s ETF market is significantly smaller than the US market.Ethereum Ecosystem Updates 
The Ethereum ecosystem continues to buzz with innovation, focusing on scalability, security and stablecoins. Here’s a breakdown of some key developments from April 2024.ZK-proofs for Streamlined Business ProcessesBig Four accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY) launched an Ethereum-based solution called EY OpsChain Contract Manager (OCM), which will use zero-knowledge proofs to help its private business clients simplify complex contracts. OKX Embraces Layer 2 for Lower FeesCryptocurrency exchange OKX announced integration with Ethereum Layer-2 solutions. This integration aims to provide users with significantly lower transaction fees and faster settlement times when trading on Ethereum.USDC Expands to ZKSyncStablecoin issuer Circle expanded support for its native stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC) to Ethereum zero-knowledge layer-2 solution zkSync. This move will enable users to make fast and low-cost USDC transactions on ZKSync. “Many leading ecosystem apps and DeFi protocols are expected to support native USDC on zkSync for payments, trading, borrowing, lending,” wrote Circle in its April 9 announcement. The zkSync integration expands USDC’s reach to a total of 16 blockchains, including major players like Ethereum, Solana, Base and Arbitrum. Ethena USDe Now Available on Binance, Bybit, OKX, and BitgetEthena Labs, the team behind USDe, added Bitcoin as collateral to its synthetic dollar-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network, hoping to scale “significantly” from its current $2 billion supply. Ethena Labs also integrated with centralized exchange wallets of Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget and airdropped a total of $450 million worth of Ethena (ENA) tokens to participants in April. Movement Labs to Build Network of Move-based BlockchainsMovement Labs, a San Francisco-based blockchain development team, secured $38 million in a Series A funding round. The funding round was led by Polychain Capital and included participation from prominent firms like Aptos Labs, Bankless Ventures, OKX Ventures and eight other venture capitalists.Movement Labs aims to leverage Move-based Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) to address security vulnerabilities and improve transaction throughput within the Ethereum ecosystem. These Move-EVMs offer enhanced protection against reentrancy attacks, a common exploit that has plagued major protocols like Curve and KyberSwap in the past.According to Movement Labs, smart contract vulnerabilities led to a staggering $5.4 billion in losses between 2022 and 2023. Their solution aims to mitigate these risks and build a more secure foundation for future blockchain applications.Ethereum-Based Protocols and DEXs
DeFi total value locked nearly doubled in Q1 2024 (from a Q4 2023 low of $36 billion to peak at almost $97 billion in the first quarter of 2024), reaching a two-year high. Ethereum’s liquid staking innovations, particularly Lido and EigenLayer’s explosive growth, are key drivers, according to the report published by QuickNode and Artemis.According to recent data from CryptoQuant, Ethereum staking hit a new all-time high, with over 27,1% of all Ether now staked (on April 28), despite the fluctuating ETH price. Ethereum staking rate in %. Source: CryptoQuantEarlier this year, Ethereum focused its development efforts on improving the blockchain’s ability to process Layer 2 transaction data, as exemplified by the March 13 Dencun upgrade, which lowered Layer 2 transaction fees. This focus on scalability will benefit Layer 2 networks like Base or Optimum. Analysts at VanEck predict that the Ethereum scaling ecosystem, which could include thousands of specialized Layer 2 chains, could reach $1 trillion in market capitalization by 2030.EigenLayer Launched its New TokenOn April 29, the largest restaking protocol by TVL on Ethereum introduced a white paper outlining its new token, EIGEN. This token is designed to power applications requiring verifiable consensus, like prediction markets, data storage solutions and virtual gaming environments. Several regions, including the United States and Canada, will be excluded from the upcoming airdrop.EigenLayer removed the limits on all liquid staking tokens (LSTs) on April 16, according to an X announcement. EigenLayer launched on mainnet on April 10. While users staking LSTs via EigenLayer get a cut of rewards, the lower security needs of Actively Validated Services (AVSs) could be a future concern. On April 22, pseudonymous developer Chudnov stated that EigenLayer may soon face a “yield crisis” as the value of the assets locked on its platform is growing faster than what is needed to secure the network. Uniswap Surpassed $2 Trillion in Trading VolumeThe largest DEX operating on the Ethereum blockchain, Uniswap, eclipsed $2 trillion in total trading volume on April 5. This achievement comes just over five and a half years after Uniswap’s launch in November 2018 Data from a Dune Analytics dashboard, compiled by Uniswap’s Zach Wong (Strategy & Operations Lead). The total number of wallets on Uniswap skyrocketed from 3.03 million in May 2023 to 7.26 million in May 2024, an increase of approximately 140%.Additionally, Uniswap recently integrated with Robinhood Connect to allow its users to purchase cryptocurrencies with funds from their Robinhood accounts or a debit card, as well as via bank transfer.Puffer Finance Fuels Liquid Staking Growth Puffer Finance, a liquid staking project built on Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer,  successfully raised $18 million in a Series A funding round. This influx of capital will likely fuel further development of their platform, which allows users to stake ETH while maintaining liquidity.According to DefiLlama, Puffer Finance surpassed a TVL of $1.2 billion shortly after its early testing phase in February. To date, the protocol has raised a total of $23 million in venture capital funding.Puffer Finance’s TVL since launch. Source: DefiLlamaEtherscan Ads Fuel Massive Phishing CampaignA large-scale phishing campaign has been uncovered, targeting users of the popular Ethereum blockchain explorer, Etherscan. On April 8, a vigilant community member known as McBiblets identified several Etherscan advertisements as fraudulent. These ads, disguised as legitimate content, aimed to steal users’ crypto wallets when clicked.Degen Chain Reached the Highest TPSA new player has emerged in the Ethereum scaling race: Degen Chain. Launched in late March, this application-specific Layer-3 blockchain leverages Arbitrum Orbit’s technology and Base’s settlement layer for Ethereum. This approach seems to be paying off, as Degen Chain achieved on April 19 the highest transaction count per second (TPS) within the Ethereum ecosystem over a 24-hour period. Clocking in at 35.7 TPS, Degen Chain even surpassed Base, the layer-2 solution it utilizes, which reached 29.7 TPS during the same timeframe. Ethereum NFTs 
NFT sales volumes for all blockchains declined in April after hitting a year-to-date high in early March. Ethereum NFT sales led the pack with a significant drop in line with the fluctuating ETH price.According to CryptoSlam data, the sales volume of Ethereum-based NFTs reached $240.8 million in April, 103% less than the values recorded in March ($488.9 million). The data further revealed that the Ethereum network has attracted around 69k buyers and 59k sellers of NFTs during April. The number of NFT transactions on Solana reached more than 509k in March, 27% less than the previous month (648k). The most traded NFTs last month were Bitcoin-based “Uncategorized Ordinals”, followed by Ethereum-based NFTs CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club. Sales volume for Ethereum-based NFTs reached $240,8 million in April. Source: CryptoSlamIn a noteworthy sale, a CryptoPunk NFT from the CryptoPunks series has been sold for 4,000 ETH (approximately $12.4 million). The anonymous buyer acquired Punk #635, one of only nine rare Alien Punks within the collection of 10,000 Ethereum-based NFTs. This sale propels Punk #635 to the fourth-highest price ever paid for a CryptoPunk. The record holder remains Alien Punk #5822, which sold for 8,000 ETH (over $23.7 million at the time) in early 2022.Luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton announced the drop of a varsity jacket worth around $8,400, which will have both the physical garment and a corresponding NFT. Designed by Pharrell Williams, record producer, and singer-songwriter, the jacket is part of the brand’s ongoing Via NFT project.A Los Angeles burger restaurant themed around a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT closed its doors after two years of operation. The branding and intellectual property are reportedly being acquired by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).The NFT collection Doodles unveiled its plans for an upcoming animated film titled “Dullsville and The Doodleverse.” The film will feature the voices of rappers Lil Wayne and Coi Leray.Notable NFT launches in April:
Quantveilz (April 5 – April 12): Quantveilz is a collection of 10,000 hand-crafted NFTs. Owning a Quantveilz grants access to a thriving community, potential participation in future games, and exclusive perks within their ecosystem.
Fancy Girls Web3 (April 9 – April 16): Fancy Girls Web3 offers 10,000 metaverse-ready avatar NFTs. Ownership grants potential benefits like building NFT brands and accessing exclusive project products within Fancy Girls’ metaverse.

GoofBudz features a vibrant collection of hand-drawn characters with quirky features and distinct personalities. Each GoofBudz NFT is programmatically generated from a pool of unique features, ensuring a high degree of visual diversity.
Looking Ahead – Can the ETH Price Go Higher?
April presented a mixed bag for Ethereum and its ecosystem. The month commenced with significant price volatility for ETH, marked by a sharp decline from its peak on April 8 to a 50-day low by April 13. Despite a partial recovery mid-month, ETH faced resistance in breaking key resistance levels, reflecting underlying weakness in the market sentiment.On the on-chain front, Ethereum exhibited signs of both strength and weakness. While total value locked (TVL) in DeFi surged to its highest levels since July 2022, indicating sustained activity within DeFi, other metrics like daily active addresses and daily transactions saw declines over the month. Moreover, Ethereum-based crypto investment products experienced negative outflows, contrasting with the positive inflows seen in some other altcoins.Regulatory uncertainties surrounding the approval of spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. loomed large over investor sentiment. The SEC’s delay in decisions regarding several spot Ether ETF proposals, coupled with concerns expressed by industry analysts, contributed to market apprehension. The lack of clarity on whether Ethereum qualifies as a security further added to the ambiguity surrounding regulatory oversight.Despite the regulatory challenges, the Ethereum ecosystem continued to witness notable developments in scalability and security. Projects like EY OpsChain Contract Manager (OCM), Circle’s USDC expansion, and Ethena Labs’ USDe integration showcased ongoing innovation within the Ethereum space.The proliferation of Layer 2 solutions and the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem underscored Ethereum’s resilience and potential for long-term growth. However, concerns lingered regarding security vulnerabilities and scalability issues, as evidenced by movements like Movement Labs’ efforts to address smart contract risks.NFT activities on the Ethereum blockchain saw a decline in sales volume compared to March, reflecting broader market trends. Nonetheless, notable sales such as the acquisition of a rare CryptoPunk NFT and Louis Vuitton’s foray into NFTs highlighted continued interest and adoption in the NFT space.

Crypto firms brace for intensified SEC, CFTC action after regulator warning

The inflow of new investors into the crypto industry has been a boon for adoption but has also come at a cost. Now more than ever, the crypto industry is under the watchful eye of regulators concerned about market manipulation, investor protection, and the potential for crypto to facilitate illicit activities. The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has warned that more enforcement actions will be taken against the crypto ecosystem in the coming six months to two years.On May 6, during the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said that with the rise in the price of cryptocurrency and the inflow of new, inexperienced retail investors, there will be another cycle filled with crypto-centered scams and frauds. “We’re going to probably see in the next 6 to 18 months, or 6 to 24 months, another cycle of enforcement actions because of this cycle of asset appreciation and interest by retail investors,” he said.With no legal framework presently in place to regulate crypto service providers, the CFTC chair expects watchdogs to crack down on crypto firms.Since 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC have cracked down heavily on crypto firms, with both agencies recording their largest number of enforcement actions against crypto firms last year. According to research by the litigation consulting firm Cornerstone Research, SEC enforcement actions reached a 10-year high in 2023, with digital assets taking a “top priority” for the commission’s attention. The SEC tripled the number of administrative proceedings in 2022 and initiated 46 enforcement actions in 2023. The regulator imposed $281 million in fines for settlements.One-third of all CFTC crypto enforcement actions in 2023 were against crypto firms. The CFTC took 47 enforcement actions representing over one-third of the total enforcement actions brought by the commission since 2015.U.S. regulators have multiple cases pending against U.S. crypto firms such as Kraken, Binance and Coinbase. Regulators continued their enforcement efforts in 2024 when, in April, the U.S. Justice Department arrested the founders of a privacy-focused Samurai wallet on money laundering charges. In May, the SEC issued a Wells notice against Robinhood.U.S. regulators target broker-dealers and mixersAmid ominous warnings from the CFTC chair and increased enforcement actions against crypto firms, crypto companies are bracing for regulatory actions in the next few years. Patrick Gruhn, a former partner at Crypto Lawyers, a Swiss law firm, told Cointelegraph that the SEC and other U.S. regulatory bodies’ enforcement actions indicate they are targeting crypto firms with a broker-dealer business model:“The SEC targets business models and firms that, from a high-level perspective, compete with traditional finance, e.g., broker-dealers. If a project or company allows people to speculate on the price of crypto assets or generate interest-like payments, such a firm or project team is at risk, whether it considers itself decentralized or not.“Another area of focus for law enforcement agencies seems to revolve around privacy and mixer tools. U.S. agencies have sanctioned popular crypto-mixing services such as Tornado Cash and, more recently, arrested the founders of another privacy-focused wallet services provider, Samurai. Recent: Despite Bitcoin price volatility, factors point to BTC’s long-term successWhile the crypto community has mixed reactions to using mixing and privacy-focused services, a majority opposes the persecution of the founders and creators of such services for writing neutral code and doing nothing illegal.Lack of U.S. crypto regulation could impact industryThe lack of a legislative framework and enforcement jurisdiction for different agencies has created more complexities for crypto firms and law enforcement agencies alike. Keith Blackman, a partner in the New York City office of the Bracewell law firm, told Cointelegraph that in the past, the CFTC chair has often expressed concern about the lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies in the U.S., starkly contrasting to SEC Chair Gensler’s eagerness to proceed with enforcement actions without the need for crypto-specific regulations. According to Blackman, Behnam’s comments suggest that “the CFTC is gradually aligning its perspective with the SEC.”He added that new crypto companies would be “deterred from entering the market with the added threat of CFTC enforcement without clear-cut regulations. Existing companies, meanwhile, will need to invest more resources in legal and compliance counsel, increasing costs and potentially stifling innovation.”Neal Levin, a partner at Rimon Law, told Cointelegraph that poor policies and lack of legislation lead to uncertainty about how to behave. If the regulators and enforcers have no legislative framework, they will attempt to fit their business models into the existing regulatory framework:“Using crackdowns is a means of shaping behavior and providing guidance short of new legislation. However, this is certainly hampered and will continue to be hampered by the ongoing uncertainty over the classification of digital assets, i.e., whether they are to be deemed ‘securities,’ as we’re seeing with Robinhood and the SEC currently and several other cases.”At a time when other jurisdictions have or are actively developing comprehensive crypto regulations, the U.S. is still following the “regulations by enforcement” approach, which has already forced several established businesses to modify their offerings or shut down entirely. Recent: EU crypto regulations undermined by lack of enforcement, say observersKraken has already shut down its staking-as-a-service platform in the U.S., while the CFTC has charged the operators of Kraken with running an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange.Despite the dramatic uptick in regulator actions against crypto firms, Wall Street is warming up to digital assets.The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and investment from traditional financial institutions highlights the growing interest of the traditional financial sector in the crypto market. Some market observers have also noted that crypto holders are growing as a political force in the U.S., making the prospect of more friendly regulation seem not so impossible.

U.S. officials seek easier pathways to ban AI exports and keep tech secrets in

Legislators in the United States have unveiled a bipartisan bill that would aid the Biden administration in imposing export controls on top artificial intelligence (AI) models created in the country. In the late evening of May 8, House Republicans Michael McCaul and John Molenaar and Democrats Raja Krishnamoorthi and Susan Wild announced the bill, which aims to make any future regulations on AI exports bypass legal challenges. It would also give the Commerce Department “express authority” to hinder American citizens from employment with foreign agents in the development of AI systems that would pose a potential risk to U.S. national security. Under the current legislation, it is more difficult for the U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees export policy, to regulate open-source AI models. If the newly suggested bill passes it would minimize any roadblocks to regulating open source AI exports. This move follows a Wednesday report from Reuters that said the U.S. is ready to take action to safeguard its homegrown AI from China and Russia. It said it will implement export controls on its most advanced proprietary AI models. China has been known to utilize open-source models originating from the U.S., like Meta’s Llama models, to develop its own AI. Related: AI-powered smart contracts could be ‘transformative’ — Ava Labs founderIt also follows a recent agreement on April 16 between Microsoft and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) AI company based in Dubai, the G42. Microsoft pledged a $1.5 billion deal with the UAE to bolster local AI innovation. This deal will also give the UAE access to cutting-edge AI technologies developed in the U.S. by Microsoft. It is one of the many deals made by Microsoft with foreign governments regarding the development and use of its AI models and cloud services. However, the U.S.’s main concern continues to be high-level AI technology falling into the hands of the Chinese government. In November 2023, 01.AI - one of China’s most high-profile AI companies founded by a former Google executive Lee Kai-fu, revealed that its AI model Yi-34B was built using Meta’s Llama system. This is one of many steps the U.S. government has taken to sanction China and minimize its reach into U.S.-made AI tech. In January, the Chinese AI firm Baidu faced potential sanctions over the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA’s) alleged use of the company's technology for military endeavors. Magazine: How to stop the artificial intelligence apocalypse: David Brin, Uplift author

Zilliqa battles back-to-back network disruptions amid latest upgrade rollout

Zilliqa network has recently experienced a number of operational disruptions, impacting block production on its mainnet. However, as of May 10, full network functionality has been restored — though the cause is still under investigation.The Zilliqa team notified the community that the network was now online following “temporary disruptions to block production on mainnet.” With network functionality restored, the infrastructure team is continuing to “monitor the stability of the network as it works to diagnose the underlying cause of the recent disruptions.” Source: https://twitter.com/zilliqa/status/1788860703492727290Since the initial signs of disruption on May 8, when a slowdown in block generation was identified, the Zilliqa network technical team has remained active for almost 48 hours, aiming to prevent further disruptions. On May 9 at around 9:30 am UTC, the Zilliqa technical team discovered a malfunction that returned a null value “instead of a node’s RLP following a possible invalid database lookup.” “The team has created internal rehearsal networks to recreate this issue and trial bug fixes, allowing for possible solutions to be tested within an isolated environment before progressing to Testnet and mainnet deployments.”By around 2:30 pm UTC on May 9, the team had restored full functionality through a fix, alongside the rollout of the Zilliqa version 9.3.4 network upgrade. The team noted that the upgrade would include “a number of enhancements to EVM compatibility” and apologized for the inconvenience caused to users and the Zilliqa community.However, despite the fix and upgrade rollout, a further disruption to block production hit the Zilliqa mainnet again on May 9 around 7:05PM UTC. At this point the team enhanced debugging processes to better diagnose the issue and address the root cause of the disruption.This is not the first time Zilliqa block production has been hit with disruptions due to technical issues. In December 2023, an “interruption to block production” saw daily Zilliqa blockchain transactions plunge roughly 50% — from around 61,000 to 30,906.The Zilliqa team is continuing to investigate the underlying cause of the recent network disruptions and thanks the community for their “patience and support during the course of resolving” the issue.

Binance obtains FIU approval for India return

Global cryptocurrency exchange Binance has obtained approval to offer its services in India from an Indian financial regulator called the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The recent approval makes Binance the second off-shore crypto exchange to get a regulatory nod after KuCoin.According to a report published in CoinDesk, Vivek Agarwal, the head of FIU, said that Binance is now a registered entity. Binance and KuCoin were among nearly a dozen foreign crypto exchanges that received a notice of noncompliance in December 2023. Within 15 days of notice, the Indian Finance Ministry told its IT department to block URLs and mobile applications' access to the banned crypto platforms in India in mid-January 2024.Besides Binance and KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex also received the regulatory notice.Following the ban, several crypto platforms started working with the Indian regulatory body to obtain FIU compliance and offer their services to Indian customers. While KuCoin and Binance managed to find their way back, the likes of OKX and BitStamp have closed their services in the country.Although the FIU registration reports surfaced today, Cointelegraph reported in the third week of April that Binance will likely return to India after paying a $2 million fine for noncompliance. Related: Taxman: India’s new tax policies could prove fatal for crypto industryAfter India imposed a hefty 30% tax on crypto gains and a 1% tax deduction at source on every crypto transaction, Indian investors fled to foreign crypto exchanges to bypass the tax regime. At the peak of the tax drain, Binance reportedly accounted for 90% of the total trading volume from India.Despite being a thriving crypto market with most of the major crypto exchanges looking to set foot in the country, India has cooled on the crypto heat map owing to its tax impositions and lack of regulatory clarity. A large chunk of crypto traders and crypto-centered businesses have shifted overseas while a few crypto exchanges that have remained continue to struggle to garner investor trust due to lack of banking facilities.Cointelegraph reached out to Binance and FIU for comments but had yet to receive a response at publishing time.Magazine: Bitcoin Halving will pump games, Shrapnel’s ‘simple’ secret revealed: Web3 Gamer

FTX Co-Founder Trades Rice in Jail Amid Fraud Conviction Appeal


							

Despite facing incarceration and significant weight loss, Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and diligently prepares for his appeal.



Life in jail presents unexpected challenges, with rice emerging as a vital commodity for sustenance and a symbol of Bankman-Fried’s humble reality.



Bankman-Fried depicts himself as a victim of negligence rather than criminal intent.




Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of FTX, is now using rice as currency while he is being detained in MDC, Brooklyn, for his fraudulent activities and will serve a 25-year sentence. Bankman-Fried is still fighting for his innocence, and in a recent interview with Puck News, he talked about his life in prison and his plans for an appeal.



Bankman-Fried’s imprisonment caused a drastic transformation in lifestyle, with rice being a prominent commodity in the MDC. Despite getting vegan meals that his other convicts find unappealing, Bankman-Fried subsists on beans and rice, demonstrating the harsh realities of his captivity.



However, life behind bars is not without its challenges. Bankman-Fried faces boredom and sleep disturbances, with limited entertainment options and fellow inmates frequently interrupting his rest to inquire about his rice supplies. Despite these difficulties, he remains focused on his legal battle, diligently engaging with his new lawyer and preparing for his upcoming appeal.



The former CEO’s physical transformation is notable, shedding 25 pounds and displaying a calmer demeanor during the interview. He candidly admitted to “faking” his well-being, suggesting a level of resilience amidst adversity.



Despite submitting an appeal against his conviction, Bankman-Fried maintains adamant that he is innocent, stating that his failure was due to negligence rather than illegal activity. His choice to appeal demonstrates his determination to contest the legal ruling and find justice.



Bankman-Fried depicts himself as someone who was not to blame for FTX’s failure but rather was the one who suffered as a result of circumstances. He regrets not giving the governance of Alameda Research to another person as this might have improved his legal situation because it could have eliminated potential conflicts of interest.









His reliance on medication for clarity of thought and regular consultations with his lawyer indicates a strategic approach to his legal battle. However, the uncertainty of his future looms large, with the possibility of relocation to a facility near his parents in California.



The logistical challenges of potential relocation, including a lengthy prison bus journey, add to the complexity of Bankman-Fried’s situation. Despite the adversities he faces, his determination to pursue his appeal remains unwavering.

Empire Newsletter: How crypto can solve AI's centralization problem - Blockworks


Why AI needs crypto
Crypto is very good at one thing: getting humans to do one thing. This will become incredibly important in an AI world. 
Technology is deflationary and creates abundance, but it is also a centralizing force. Look at Google (owns 90% of search) and social (TikTok, Meta). 
Chris Dixon documents this phenomenon well in his latest book “Read Write Own.” Unlike internet protocols (TCP/IP, HTTPS, SMTP), internet service companies like Google and Meta have amassed monopoly-like market shares. These companies own your data and, after achieving scale, adopt monopoly-like practices to squash competition. Meta shut down their App Store, OpenAI did the same, and Google has crushed multiple calendar-app startups. 
In theory, you can use other social media platforms, but none achieve the same level of network effects as TikTok or Meta. 
Read more: AI has a monopoly on power and privacy. Blockchain fixes this.
The centralizing effect of technology may be even greater with AI. I recently came across Anthropic’s CEO interview on CNBC where he estimates “we’re going to see models trained in the next year are going to be about $1 billion…and then 2025, 2026, we’re going to go to $5 billion or $10 billion. And I think there’s a chance it may go beyond that to $100 billion.” Few companies will afford that. 
Perhaps more importantly, companies that own the data will have an edge to train models. A startup may be able to raise a couple billion, but they won’t be able to easily replicate clinical trial data or years of user behavior data.
The promise of technology is that it is democratizing and lowers the barriers for companies to reap the benefits. This narrative rings true with AI  — after all, companies will be able to embed LLMs and other forms of AI (robots, automation processes etc)  to unlock productivity gains. Like trickle-down economics, trickle-down tech will benefit many. But the centralizing effect of technology will likely be no different and perhaps even greater with AI. 
So where does crypto fit into all of this?
Crypto has proven to be very good at getting humans to do a specific action which benefits the overall network. From Bitcoin to DePIN, crypto networks are case studies on how to scale networks more efficiently by transferring the costs to do-it-yourself (DIY) participants incentivized to spend resources (time, hardware, compute) expecting to earn in return tokens which represent ownership in the network. 
The challenge is that bootstrapping and scaling the supply side of networks can be very capex-intensive in these networks. Historically, this has been one of the reasons why there is network centralization. You have 1-2 ride-sharing companies and social media platforms. But when you radically lower the financial burden to bootstrap a network from a company/protocol to participants, then you level the playing field. 
You can more easily overcome the cold-start problem networks face by attracting supply and demand because both sides are incentivized to earn tokens (i.e., ownership in the network).
Giving network participants a greater cut of revenue/profits will be the reason why crypto networks from DePIN to AI will emerge as leaders and will be able to displace incumbents. 
One area I see this already playing out is in training — specifically, reinforced learning from human feedback (RLHF). 
In short, AI models with human feedback are superior to AI models without it. The more RLHF you have, the better the model. Capturing human feedback can be very expensive. But again, crypto has proven to be good at getting people to do a specific action with token incentives, so we may be able to create systems that capture RLHF in greater scale and in a more cost-effective manner than traditional methods. 
Instead of having one company to raise a ton of VC money to fund RLHF, a network can finance this with clever cryptoeconomics.
Crypto may also be crucial to minimize data selection for training bias (data is open, accessible and immutable in blockchains) and platform risk. 
Look at Google’s Gemini as an example — one platform has many opinions on the data on which the models are trained. The bet is that companies/developers will want certainty that the models they are utilizing are as unbiased as possible and have cryptographic proofs that models are doing what they are being told.
The most exciting thing about this is that the impact crypto can have on AI is already being felt. 
AI will be explosive. Its effect will be felt by everyone, but incumbents may capture even more value. Crypto offers an interesting and viable solution to counteract the centralizing force of technology and restore the original principles of the internet. I see a world where crypto —  specifically, this idea of creating participatory networks — will become the de facto go-to-market mechanism for networks. 
Crypto is the extension pack of the internet.

Bitcoin’s price is up over 3% to $63,000 early Friday.

Not selling is still holding
BlackRock’s memecoin balance is piling up.
Nearly $200,000 in random tokens are parked in addresses linked to BlackRock’s onchain money market fund, BUIDL. New deposits come in every day.
To be clear, BlackRock is not buying memecoins, despite the spoofed Uniswap trades that suggest it had bought trillions of BOMEPEPE.
It’s long been tradition for memecoin holders, and maybe even the creators themselves, to direct funds to the wallets of popular figures. 
Read more from our opinion section: BlackRock clearly wants to take crypto seriously. Too bad it’s forever silly.
Think of it as part hat-tip, part marketing spend — the onchain equivalent of renting a billboard inside a blockchain explorer.
BUIDL’s onchain history has seen more than 500 transactions but only about two dozen appear to be actioned by BlackRock itself. 
BlackRock initially funded BUIDL with 1 ETH from Kraken and 200 USDC minted directly via Circle. The fund then sent small amounts of USDC between itself, in early-to-mid March, apparently to warm up, about a week before the fund was formally announced.
Since then, Larry Fink’s firm, the world’s largest asset manager, has been interacting with Ondo Finance, which has been acquiring BUIDL’s tokens as one of its reserve assets (there are currently 13 holders of BUIDL). 
All while almost 300 different tokens have flooded BUIDL’s addresses, not just on Ethereum, but on any EVM-compatible chain with an analogous wallet, including Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Avalanche.
Most of the tokens sent to BlackRock to date are worthless. But there are some with active markets, which gives them real value, and not all are strictly memecoins. 
Caution is advised when looking into any of these tokens — their place in BlackRock’s wallet isn’t exactly an endorsement.
BlackRock has been forced to hold more than $60,000 worth of UBXS alongside its legitimate stablecoin balance. UBXS is pitched as a utility asset for tokenized real estate app Bixos. 
There’s also nearly $30,000 of ISP, which supposedly powers open-world, play-to-earn metaverse platform Ispoverse that can support virtual hackathons. 
Although, I’m not sure it really helps perception of those projects to be placed alongside tokens like FINKWIF, NOODS, PEEON and BOBO MUMU.
Still, BlackRock hasn’t sold any of the tokens playing stowaway in its Ethereum wallet. Does that count for anything? 
Probably not. Sad.
— David Canellis
The Works

Kraken is pushing harder for a dismissal in its SEC lawsuit, Bloomberg writes. 
Token projects are increasingly turning to online influencers for help, according to CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson.
Neel Somani, founder of Ethereum scaling startup Eclipse, says he is “reducing” his role amid sexual misconduct allegations made against him. 
Espresso and Polygon Labs are partnering on rollup interoperability.
US airlines are expanding their use of AI, according to the New York Times.

The Morning Riff
Pump.fun is exactly what Gary Gensler and the SEC are afraid of. 
It’s also one of those things that is so unique to crypto — mixing fun with the potential to profit. 
But it’s also risky, as Blockworks reporter Jack Kubinec pointed out in the Lightspeed newsletter yesterday. Folks who go to casinos are probably of the same mindset as a lot of folks on Pump.fun, and for them, the risk is worth the potential reward. 
For the SEC and Gensler, though, this is a scenario they claim they want to protect investors from. While Pump.fun says it prevents rug pulls or exit scams, it can’t stop shady people from doing shady stuff. 
So while the SEC continues its crusade against companies that have said they want to — or have tried to — come in and register, I’ll sit back and watch crypto’s latest venture play out.

Jupiter Aims To Launch Mobile App Launch By July - The Defiant

Jupiter now accounts for 50% of Solana’s computational load.Siong, the co-founder of Jupiter, Solana’s leading DEX aggregator, unveiled a target launch date for the protocol’s mobile app.Speaking during the Solana Crossroads 2024 conference, Siong revealed that the project is aiming to roll out its mobile app during “late May or early June.” Siong noted that a “test flight” version of the application is already “up and running,” with Jupiter currently in the process of submitting the mobile app to Apple for approval.The news comes as Jupiter is driving a dominant share of trading activity on Solana.Siong estimated that Jupiter accounts for roughly 50% of Solana’s computational load per block, and is receiving more than 250,000 requests from users per second.According to Jupiter Station, Jupiter hosted nearly 1.85 million transactions in the past 24 hours, equating to nearly $809 million in trade volume.The project also launched a perpetual contracts trading platform roughly seven months ago, which has since grown to capture a roughly 70% to 75% market share for perps trading on Solana.The Jupiter Perpetual Exchange currently boasts a total value locked (TVL) of $340.7 million and drove $424.5 million worth of volume in the past 24 hours, according to DeFi Llama.JUP rollercoasterJupiter also airdropped its JUP token to 955,000 early adopters in January, with the token debuting at a $900 million market cap, according to CoinGecko.Like many airdropped assets, JUP slumped during its first month of trade, falling 29% to post an all-time low of $0.47 two weeks after launching. The downward momentum was intensified by backlash from Jupiter’s community in response to Jupiter moving to sell 18.5% of JUP’s supply via its LFG Launchpad just a couple of days after the airdrop.However, JUP began to regain steam in late February, rallying to a record high of $1.75 in early April. The token has since pulled back by 36.6%, last changing hands for $1.11.JUP/USD.

'Shiba Inu On Solana' Bonk In For An 'Explosive Rally,' Millionaire Trader Predicts - Benzinga

Crypto trader Unipics, also known as “Bonk Guy,” shared his bullish outlook on Bonk BONK/USD, forecasting an imminent explosive rally.What Happened: “Bonk guy” attributes BONK’s recent weakness, particularly on weekends, to the ongoing vesting of tokens to OpenBook users. Every Friday, 161 billion tokens, worth around $4 million, are released, creating a significant source of sell pressure. However, with less than two weeks remaining until the vesting period ends, the trader anticipates a shift in market dynamics.Despite the recent challenges, the trader highlights BONK’s impressive performance in 2023, noting that it was the best-performing meme coin of the year. In the past year, Bonk hit a peak of over $2 billion in market capitalization, despite many market participants believing it to be "dead."Also Read: Trader Who Made ‘Giga Wealth’ On Memes Reveals ‘Mememillions Playbook,’ Still Holds Most Of His DOGEWhy It Matters: “Bonk guy,” who gained notoriety for riding a trade from five to eight figures, emphasizes the inherent volatility of meme coins, stating that they can be "insanely volatile, both to the upside and downside." He predicts that when BONK rallies next, it will trigger a fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors, causing the token to "absolutely rip."The analysis highlights the significant impact that vesting periods and token releases can have on the price action of cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins.The meme coin has witnessed a significant surge in its performance and strengthened its position in the top six of the meme coin table. It is currently valued at $1.6 billion, up 14.5% month-over-month, compared to Dogecoin’s 20% and Shiba Inu’s 15% drops, respectively.Price Action: At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.00002444, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: VanEck Meme Coin Index With DOGE And SHIB Would ‘Outperform 99% Of People If You Left It Alone,’ Says TraderThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

Crypto Clash: Kraken Fights SEC's Definition Of Securities


								Crypto exchange Kraken has intensified its fight against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by formally submitting a reply in support of its motion to dismiss the agency’s lawsuit. The filing, dated May 9, 2024, challenges the SEC’s claim that Kraken operated as an unregistered exchange dealing with securities, specifically “investment contracts.”
Led by Matthew C. Solomon from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, Kraken’s legal team disputes the SEC’s allegations, asserting that no specific investment contracts traded, brokered, or settled on Kraken’s platform have been identified. They argue that crypto assets alone, which are the only products alleged to have been handled by Kraken, do not meet the definition of investment contracts under federal securities laws.
Kraken Fights For The Entire Crypto Industry
The filing emphasizes a critical flaw in the SEC’s approach, accusing the regulatory body of conflating primary offerings conducted outside of Kraken with secondary crypto market transactions on the platform. Kraken’s attorneys contend that the SEC’s approach ignores the distinct legal treatment required for primary and secondary market transactions under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Kraken’s submission states, “The transactions alleged to have occurred on Kraken are blind bid/ask secondary market sales of digital assets… unaccompanied by any contractual terms or other obligations that may have existed at the initial offering.” This, they argue, could improperly extend the SEC’s regulatory reach to virtually any digital asset or commodity by asserting an associated “investment concept” or “ecosystem.”
Further challenging the SEC’s jurisdiction, Kraken’s lawyers invoke the major questions doctrine, arguing that the expansive interpretation of regulatory authority over crypto assets should be explicitly authorized by Congress, not determined through litigation. They maintain that the Howey Test’s criteria — a standard used to define what constitutes an investment contract — are not met, as there was no investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits predominantly from the efforts of others.
The SEC initially sued Kraken in November, after previously settling charges over Kraken’s staking services. In its opposition filed last month, the SEC defended its actions, stating, “it is simply not the case that this enforcement action exceeds the authority Congress granted the SEC.” The SEC argued that its enforcement aligns with the Howey test and its Congressional mandate, dismissing claims of overreach.
Related Reading: Taiwan Sets Sights On Crypto Firms With Tough New Jail Time Laws
The court is scheduled to hear arguments on the motion on June 12, 2024. If Kraken’s motion to dismiss is granted by Judge William H. Orrick, it could set a significant legal precedent for the entire crypto industry, potentially limiting the SEC’s ability to regulate secondary market transactions of crypto assets under the current legislative framework.
At press time, Bitcoin traded at $63,237.

Analyst Says Dogecoin(DOGE) Is a 'Crapshoot,' Could These 3 Meme Coins Have Higher Returns? - Benzinga

Since its launch in 2013, DOGE has not done much to add value to the ecosystem. However, the token has seen some of the largest returns of any asset over the past decade. This feat makes little sense to those outside of the cryptocurrency community, but DOGE supporters believe that buying and HODLing their position is what has led to the gains. However, the euphoria of DOGE's success could come to an end, according to some analysts.Don't Miss:Pav Hundal is an analyst for Swyftx, an Australian cryptocurrency exchange. He noted that the future of DOGE "will depend on the decision-making of the millions of minnow investors who bought DOGE in 2021 and right now are sitting on paper losses." Additionally, Hundal noted that "it's a crapshoot. If most of these people decide to take quick profits during the cycle, you could start to see selling pressure ratchet up."Essentially, Hundal believes that the next small uptick in the price of DOGE will lead to a huge wave of selling that could potentially spell the end for the token. If this logic holds and DOGE could potentially lose its spot as the top memecoin, there are a few other tokens that could potentially be a better investment.Dogwifhat (WIF) is the next pick for a memecoin that could potentially outperform expectations. The token has only been around since December 2023 but has already cemented itself in the top 40 tokens by market cap. It has attracted significant attention, which could lead to gains if DOGE begins to fall.Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today?Another choice is Shiba Inu (SHIB). This project is known as the "Dogecoin killer," as it is making moves to directly compete with and overtake DOGE. To do this, it has created a large ecosystem, complete with a decentralized exchange (DEX), NFT projects, a layer-2 blockchain, and a magazine. This focus on building out an ecosystem, along with its current community of investors could prove fruitful in light of a potential DOGE collapse.Lastly, if you are interested in politics or the upcoming election, MAGA Coin (TRUMP) could be a decent investment. The token has seen enormous gains since its launch in August 2023. It combines memecoins with politics to attract investors. With the election in November, the token could receive more and more attention, which could lead to gains. However, this token is likely the riskiest of the three due to its smaller market cap and the fact that Trump is a very controversial person. So, according to some, the end of DOGE's reign as the top memecoin could come very soon. If this is the case, many may start looking for the next memecoin to make them into a millionaire overnight. Read Next:

Kraken Fights Back in SEC Lawsuit: Is the SEC Overreaching? - DailyCoin


        
A major cryptocurrency exchange has found itself in a heated legal battle with the SEC.



The SEC has accused the exchange of operating as an unregistered securities market.



Kraken believes the SEC’s actions have set a dangerous precedent for future crypto regulation.
The legal battle between cryptocurrency exchange Kraken and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) heats up as Kraken refutes the agency’s claims. The SEC lawsuit, filed last November, alleges Kraken operated as an unregistered securities exchange and made millions from unregistered securities.Kraken Challenges SEC’s Definition of SecuritiesKraken argues the SEC’s case lacks merit and misinterprets core legal concepts. Their response highlights the agency’s failure to precisely identify which crypto assets constitute securities on the exchange.
Furthermore, Kraken takes issue with the SEC’s use of broad terms like “investment concept” and “ecosystem” instead of established legal terms like “investment contract” and “enterprise.” This, according to Kraken, reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the case’s legal framework.The SEC’s lawsuit isn’t the first hurdle Kraken has faced. Months prior, they settled charges related to their staking service. This latest lawsuit, however, has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry.Kraken contends that the SEC’s case sets a “dangerous precedent” for the agency’s reach within the crypto sphere. In response to Kraken’s initial motion to dismiss, the SEC filed a lengthy opposition, defending its authority.Howey Test at Heart of Kraken’s DefenseThe crux of Kraken’s defense hinges on a different interpretation of investment contracts. They argue the SEC’s insistence on written contracts is misplaced, as agreements can be oral, expressed, or implied.
Additionally, Kraken references past SEC cases involving initial coin offerings (ICOs) to bolster their argument. These cases, Kraken argues, demonstrate a focus on contractual rights and obligations, a key factor in defining investment contracts under the Howey Test, the legal standard used to determine if an asset is a security.The Howey Test establishes a security based on specific criteria: investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.This legal battle unfolds amidst ongoing discussions in the U.S. Congress regarding crypto regulation. Further complicating the picture, eight state attorneys general have filed an amicus brief supporting Kraken’s position, suggesting the SEC may have overstepped its authority.On the Flipside
The amicus brief could be seen as an attempt to limit federal overreach, potentially creating a patchwork of state regulations for crypto.



Kraken’s prior settlement over staking could be used by the SEC to argue the exchange understands the regulatory landscape.
Why This MattersBy challenging the SEC’s definition of securities and their broad reach within crypto, Kraken’s defense could significantly impact how crypto assets are regulated. A win for Kraken could set a clearer standard for classifying cryptocurrencies, potentially reducing regulatory burdens for the industry and fostering innovation.Curious about the role of data in cryptocurrency ETFs?

TSM Stock Gains After Firm Reports 60% Increase in Y/Y Revenue - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) has been experiencing significant stock price surge after reporting its latest earnings. The company’s strong earnings and revenue growth have contributed to the over 4% jump in US-listed shares of the firm today.



TSM Stock Up 78% Over the Past Year



At the time of writing, TSM’s stock price stands at $149.04, reflecting a recent increase of 4.38%. The company has delivered substantial returns to its investors, with a year-to-date return of 43.89% and a remarkable 78.43% increase over the past year. Looking at the long-term performance, TSM’s stock has skyrocketed by 293.58% in the last five years. The company’s market capitalization has reached an impressive $637.90 billion, and its trailing Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio is 27.56. TSM has reported a revenue of $2.25 trillion and a net income available to common stockholders of $857 billion, resulting in a profit margin of 38.16%. Analysts have provided various price targets for TSM, with a high estimate of $188.00 and a low of $150.00.





TSM Reports 60% y/y Revenue Surge Driven by AI Demand



TSM has been reporting strong financial results, driven by the increasing demand for advanced semiconductors used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. In April, the company’s revenue surged by nearly 60% year-over-year, reaching approximately $7.2 billion. For the first quarter, TSM’s revenue increased by 13% compared to the same period last year, totaling $18.87 billion. The company anticipates continued growth, with a projected 27.6% increase in revenue for the second quarter.



TSM’s ongoing robust performance can be attributed to the sustained high demand for its cutting-edge semiconductor products. The company’s strategic expansions in the United States and Japan aim to mitigate risks associated with its production concentration in Taiwan, considering the geopolitical concerns surrounding the region. These expansions are expected to further strengthen TSM’s position in the global semiconductor market and help the company navigate potential challenges arising from geopolitical tensions.







Do you think TSM’s geopolitical risks are something investors should worry about, given its current place in the global semiconductor industry? Let us know in the comments below.

                        Eduard Jubany Tur, the founder of ZKX, a decentralized perpetual futures exchange on Starknet, sat down for an exclusive interview with Cryptonews Podcast.He talked about the growth of the crypto industry in Asia, which is home to most of the early adopters, and the region’s key relevance for the industry.Tur also discussed differences between crypto users in Asia and the rest of the world, noting that most people are nonetheless still on centralized exchanges rather than in DeFi.Getting people to move to DeFi is currently difficult given its overall complexity, but there are clear solutions, Tur remarked.VIDEOCrypto Growth Starts in Asia
While working in venture capital, Tur was based out of Taiwan, getting a clear view of the Asia market, he said.He helped startup founders across various countries, including Indonesia, India, Thailand, Korea, and China.Through this work, he got to learn the advantages of each country and the specific issues each deals with.Notably, the data showed that “most of the growth in crypto has always come from these markets in Asia.”Most centralized exchanges that we know today and many of the projects were born out of Asia.However, what Tur and his colleagues found is that, centralized exchanges have been very good at targeting emerging market users.DeFi projects, on the other hand, have not.Cryptofolk in Asia is Very Different from Rest of the World
There are some key differences between Asia and other parts of the world, Tur argued.The first is the demographics. Asia has a much younger population, which is also growing massively in terms of purchasing power. They’re starting to have more disposable income for investing.Another notable factor is that Asia has many more risk-takers. They are more willing to try new things and adopt new technologies.“That makes a huge difference when it comes to the adoption of crypto overall,” Tur said.However, each country has its own very unique features as well.For example, South Korea and Japan are massive markets for crypto. People here are more willing to hold coins in the long term and are often passive investors.China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are looking more towards derivatives and leverage trading. There are more risk-takers here.The Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam are also key markets where people initially started farming new coins. People here may have less disposable income but are still willing to invest and provide asymmetric bets in the ecosystem.Additionally, certain governments in Asia have been relatively crypto-friendly, which encouraged industry growth and crypto adoption.All this said, it is important to note that most of these users “are still very much set towards centralized exchanges.”Getting People Off Centralized Exchanges and Into DeFi
Millions of users are on the centralized exchanges, and only a few hundred thousand actively trade in DeFi, Tur remarked.Changing this will require many improvements across the entire user experience of DeFi.One key element is account obstruction. It will provide users with a conduit to replicate Web2 experiences but with Web3 benefits.There are many great design possibilities around account obstruction that should really simplify onboarding, Tur remarked.Another key element is localization. This includes providing products in local languages and adapting them to users’ needs in each particular area.Finally, DeFi has a developer-oriented culture. While this makes sense in the early stages of an industry, it’s time to switch to the user-centric approach.Therefore, it’s necessary to create simple, understandable, and engaging products that bring value to users. That way, new users will be coming to DeFi on their own.This is the part of the cycle we’re going to be facing in the next few years, Tur said.Even Losers Get Rewarded
There’s a need now for innovation that will drive users towards DeFi, away from centralized exchanges.An incremental infrastructure improvement would not be enough. What’s needed is innovation in the user experience.Most trading experiences in DeFi now are boring, Tur said. They’re just a trading terminal without a dynamic and engaging experience.Therefore, ZKX mission is to make trading social and gamified within DeFi, Tur remarked. This can incentivize users to start trading within DeFi.ZKX, for example, had 30-minute trading competitions with three leaderboard categories: volume, profit, and loss.This means that even the losses get some incentives because these traders also contribute to the health of the protocol, Tur said.It’s a balance the platform has been working to build: being a serious, scalable, reputable, and trustworthy platform within DeFi but still simple and fun.____That’s not all.In this interview, Tur also discussed:
his pre-crypto journey and Web2 background;
mining Bitcoin in 2014;
building geolocation and digital mapping services on the blockchain, now one of the use cases for DePIN;
why the team decided to build ZKX on Starknet;
ZKX 30-minute trading competitions;
perpetual swaps and futures, and how these differ from each other and other trading instruments;
creating user-centric platforms that cater to traders of all levels, thus incentivizing engagement while ensuring accessibility.

Hong Kong issuer seeks spot Bitcoin ETF for mainland China

The CEO of Harvest, the issuer of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Hong Kong, is looking to make its Bitcoin ETF accessible to mainland Chinese investors.Harvest CEO and chief investment officer Han Tongli is considering options that would allow mainland China investors to purchase its Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) ETFs. That would be possible by offering its products through Hong Kong’s ETF Connect framework, The South China Morning Post reported on May 9.The ETF Connect was launched in 2022, and it was approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Futures Commission. The tool is designed to promote the interaction and integration of Hong Kong and mainland China, offer diverse asset allocation choices and promote liquidity.As long as “everything goes smooth and well” in the next two years, Harvest doesn’t rule out the opportunity of applying for its ETFs to be included in the ETF Connect, CEO Tongli said.Harvest CEO Han Tongli (center) speaks at Bitcoin Asia on May 9, 2024. Source: SCMPThe potential inclusion of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the ETF Connect program could be a massive bullish trigger on cryptocurrency markets, as China has a large investor pool. But it’s yet to be seen whether the Chinese government would accept such an opportunity for its citizens, as local authorities have maintained a very restrictive approach toward cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for many years.According to SCMP, Hong Kong’s Bitcoin and Ether futures-based ETFs — launched in 2022 — have not been included in the Stock Connect.Related: Is China warming up to Bitcoin ETFs? BTC investor’s reply sparks curiosityHong Kong’s capability to provide mainland China investors with a Bitcoin ETF has been a hot issue even before the launch of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong on April 30, 2024.Many industry analysts didn’t expect a lot of market action from the launch because the Hong Kong ETF market is significantly smaller than the one in the United States or mainland China.According to Bloomberg data, some Hong Kong-based subsidiaries of mainland China companies have 1,400% more assets in the mainland Chinese market than in the local one. According to some sources, all Hong Kong ETFs should account for 0.6% of the U.S. ETF market.Magazine: Binance hits back at WSJ, Hong Kong crypto ETF’s take ‘$50B equivalent’: Asia Express

Refund of $70M 'address poisoning' scam ongoing, over 50% returned | Protos


The victim of a $70 million ‘address poisoning’ scam is in the process of being refunded, following on-chain negotiations with the perpetrator.
At the time of writing, over half of the funds (14,500 ETH, worth $43.5M) have been returned to the victim’s Ethereum address.
Beginning at around 8AM UTC, almost exactly a week after the initial loss of 1155 WBTC, transactions of between 25 ETH ($75k) and 50 ETH ($150k) began to stream into the victims address. The transfers came directly from the hundreds of addresses into which the attacker had previously dispersed the stolen funds.

Address poisoning is a method scammers use to trick crypto users into sending funds to an address which appears almost identical to one they have interacted with previously.
As crypto security firm SlowMist’s report explains, the attack requires pre-emptively generating thousands of addresses, before monitoring blockchain transactions for potential targets. Scammers then send ‘dust’ transactions (of negligible value) from an address which has matching leading and trailing characters, in order to ‘poison’ the victim’s transfer history.

Once the trap is set, the attackers rely on the victim accidentally copy-pasting the malicious address from a wallet or block explorer, inadvertently sending funds directly to the scammer.

In this case, once the attack had proved a success, the resulting 1,155 WBTC were swapped to 22,955 ETH, before being layered into hundreds of further addresses.
The day after making their costly error, the victim sent a message to the scammer via Ethereum’s input data messaging system:
“You won bro.Keep 10% to yourself and get 90% back.Then we’ll forget about that.We both know that 7m will definetely make your life better, but 70m won’t let you sleep well.”
Read more: Here’s what on-chain messages reveal about the $200M Euler Finance hack
The victim kept up the pressure the following day, sending three more messages and setting a deadline for the ‘bounty’ offer.
In SlowMist’s report, published Wednesday, the firm identified previous attacks carried out by the perpetrator as well as an exchange address, OTC desks and IP addresses connected  to their activities (though, as SlowMist points out, these may be simply be VPN addresses). 
Yesterday, the scammer sent an on-chain message asking for the victims’s Telegram handle along with 50 ETH, seemingly a gesture of good faith. From there, negotiations went off-chain.
Earlier today, the refund process began. Over half of the stolen amount has so far arrived over the course of more than 200 transactions, following the victim’s confirmation of receipt of the first batch.

Bitcoin Exchange Kraken Applies to the Court to Reject the Cases Filed Against It by the SEC! Here's the Reason! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Kraken, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has taken legal action to dismiss lawsuits filed against it by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing concerns about potential repercussions for the broader US financial regulatory framework.
Kraken Wants SEC's Allegations Dismissed
This development comes before the trial, when Judge William H. Orrick is set to preside over the case on June 12 in the Northern District of California, according to court filings.


In documents filed with the court, Kraken claims that denying the SEC's allegations was necessary to avoid what it perceives as a “significant realignment” of the U.S. financial regulatory structure.

The lawsuit, filed by the SEC last November, alleges that Kraken is not registered as a broker, clearinghouse or exchange, and indicates that legal challenges remain after the exchange's previous agreement on the staking service.





Kraken's defense relies on the classification of cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than securities, arguing that the assets listed in the SEC's complaint fall into that category.
In response to Kraken's request to dismiss the case, the SEC filed a 39-page objection last month, asserting its authority to enforce registration requirements for securities brokers.


The SEC rejected Kraken's claim that its jurisdiction exceeded legislative limits, emphasizing that its actions were consistent with Congressional powers to enforce the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

The Week in Polkadot: Monthly Active Accounts Hit All-Time High - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWelcome to Decrypt’s Week in Polkadot, our regular round-up of the latest developments in the Polkadot ecosystem.The number of monthly active accounts on Polkadot reached an all-time high in April, the highest since the start of 2022 when parachains, one of the ecosystem’s key distinguishing factors, first launched.Meanwhile, ahead of the community vote on Polkadot’s JAM Upgrade being implemented, many parachains, including the smart contract platform Moonbeam, achieved near record highs in active users.You can find out a full breakdown of the statistics here.According to an analysis by blockchain research firm Messari, transactions on Polkadot also rose 48% in the last quarter. XCM messages—which Polkadot uses to communicate with blockchains which use other consensus mechanisms—were up 94% quarter-over-quarter and 314% over the past 6 months.Asynchronous Backing comes to Relay ChainAsynchronous Backing, a new approach to how parachain blocks are validated by the Relay Chain, has been enabled on Polkadot.The Web3 Foundation says that the new update will allow blocks to be produced faster, boost available block space, and enable higher utilization of parachain blocks. This could help use case applications across gaming and DeFi.Compared to traditional ‘Synchronous Backing,’ the new system may lower the risk of discarding potentially helpful block data.With Asynchronous Backing, multiple unincluded parablocks can now exist in the Relay Chain pipeline simultaneously.Parablocks are nuggets of transaction data which are sent from various parachains back to the Relay Chain for validation.In traditional synchronous systems, if a block is not added immediately, it is often discarded, which can waste the network’s computing power unnecessarily.StellaSwap gets new analytics dashboardStellaSwap, one of the most popular DEXs for Polkadot-based tokens, is now available on Dune Analytics.The new public dashboard will allow StellaSwap users to access key metrics about the peer-to-peer marketplace on Dune. These include daily volumes, pool breakdowns, swap volume, active accounts, and unique accounts.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

EigenLayer’s $15B Token Launch Sparks Division for Excluding US, China - Coin Edition


							

The $15B valued DeFi EigenLayer launches its EIGEN token airdrop today. 



However, due to regulations, EigenLayer excluded users from the U.S. and China.



Analysts criticized the lack of transparency as early supporters are blocked from the airdrop.




EigenLayer, a $15 billion valued decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, is stirring both excitement and controversy in the crypto scene with its upcoming token launch. The project is set to distribute its highly anticipated EIGEN token via an airdrop starting Friday. 



However, the excitement about the free token distribution is marred by controversy due to the exclusion of users from the U.S., China, and other regions. Eigen Labs, the brains behind EigenLayer, cited regulatory uncertainties in the restriction posed to users from the U.S. and China.



Expectedly, the decision has drawn criticism from within the crypto community. Kunal Goel, an analyst at Messari, noted that the promise of the EIGEN token airdrop has been the primary incentive for users to invest in the service. 



Given the new restriction, Goel lamented that many early supporters will be ineligible to claim their tokens. The restrictions even disqualify VPN users and residents of some other countries.









Similarly, Nick Cote from Secondlane expressed dissatisfaction with Eigen Labs’ lack of transparency about jurisdictional restrictions. “Issuers not being upfront with jurisdictional restrictions leaves a sour taste in people’s mouths,” Cote remarked.



Meanwhile, in a recent podcast, Robert Drost of the Eigen Foundation emphasized the importance of adhering to regulatory guidelines. 



After being criticized by the crypto community, EigenLayer revised its airdrop plans by announcing an additional allocation of 28 million EIGEN tokens. Notably, early this year, Eigen Labs secured approximately $165 million in funding from investors, including the prominent a16z (Andreessen Horowitz).



According to DeFiLlama, EigenLayer has attracted a staggering $15.01 billion in assets since its soft launch earlier in 2023.

Furthermore, the project has surpassed other DeFi applications in popularity, partly affecting liquid staking platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool. These platforms have experienced a 27% drop in total value locked since March, with nearly 4% of all ETH now re-staked on EigenLayer.

Coingecko Research: Over 20% of Top Cryptos Are Low Float | Cryptopolitan

A shocking research analysis has been released by Coingecko indicating the little-known side of cryptocurrencies. The research findings identify a unique trend amongst newer cryptocurrencies, raising some eyebrows. The research reveals that nearly a quarter of the Top 300 cryptocurrencies in the market today are low float. Low Float Cryptos- Coingecko ResearchThe Coingecko research defines Low-float as a cryptocurrency with a market cap to full diluted valuation ratio below 0.5. High-float cryptocurrencies would then have a market cap to FDV ratio between 0.5 and 0.99, while a perfect market cap to FDV ratio of 1 represents fully diluted cryptocurrencies. Among the top 300 cryptos in the market, only 24.67% are fully diluted, while a huge chunk is high-float, accounting for 54%. The numbers start to get more interesting as you dive deeper into the analytics. The research reveals that out of the 64 low-float cryptos, 54 of them were launched within the last four years. High-float and Fully Diluted Market Cap CryptocurrenciesCoingecko’s research analytics disclosed that only 74 cryptocurrencies in the top 300 have a perfect market cap to FDV ratio, translating to 24.7%. The fully diluted tokens essentially have no further tokens lined up for release.Of the 74 fully diluted cryptocurrencies, 14 were Memecoins, showing the strong presence of Memecoins in the current crypto market.The high-float tokens account for the largest portion of the top 300 cryptocurrencies, with 54% of the market.  More than half of their total supply is already in circulation. It appears there’s a strong correlation between the age of the cryptocurrency and the market cap to FDV ratio. Mostly, older cryptocurrencies seem to have higher ratios. The research reveals the average market cap to FDV ratio of the top 300 cryptocurrencies to be 0.73, which looks like a healthy figure for the industry. CoinGecko’s Research MethodologyCoingecko’s research team excluded stablecoins and wrapped tokens in the study, and ranked cryptocurrencies by market cap. The final list was taken on May 8th. The study assumed tokens with no maximum supply had the same FDV as their market capitalization. The analytics reveal an interesting perspective on the current state of cryptocurrencies, exposing current trends and potential future trends within the crypto industry.

Harvest Global eyes mainland China for crypto ETF products | Cryptopolitan

Harvest Global Investments is eyeing an ambitious expansion into mainland China with its pioneering cryptocurrency ETFs, signaling a new era in investment opportunities bridging Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.Harvest’s Strategic Vision for ETF ExpansionHarvest Global Investments, not just content with being one of the three issuers of Hong Kong’s first spot cryptocurrency ETFs, is plotting a future where mainland investors can directly access their Bitcoin and Ether products. This vision is articulated through their potential inclusion in the ETF Connect scheme.Launched in May 2022, this scheme allows mainland investors to engage with selected ETFs listed in Hong Kong, and is a component of the broader Stock Connect program that began back in 2014, initially linking the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.Han Tongli, the CEO and chief investment officer of Harvest Global, conveyed on the sidelines of the Bitcoin Asia conference, the firm’s openness to applying for their ETFs, which invest directly in crypto tokens, to be part of this connect program.The caveat is, everything must proceed smoothly over the next two years. The integration of their crypto ETFs into this scheme could significantly elevate market confidence and introduce a vast new pool of investors to these emerging products.The Challenges and ProspectsDespite the potential for groundbreaking expansion, challenges loom large due to the Beijing authorities’ known reservations towards cryptocurrencies and financial innovation. Most commercial cryptocurrency activities are currently banned in mainland China, though the legality of trading and ownership by individuals still sparks debates.Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s crypto scene recently celebrated a milestone with the launch of its spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, the first in Asia. Despite their pioneering status, the launch was met with lukewarm trading volumes, starkly contrasting with the bustling ETF markets in the U.S.However, these products were touted for their unique approach, including in-kind subscriptions that allow purchasing ETFs directly with Bitcoin and Ether, with fund managers even waiving management fees temporarily to attract investors.The mixed reception to these ETFs highlights the hesitance and cautious approach many investors have towards Hong Kong’s commitment to becoming a regional crypto hub.During a panel at the Bitcoin Asia conference, Han expressed disappointment over the slow start but remains optimistic about the potential growth of the local market, stating that the Hong Kong market, which he views as more neutral with broader appeal in Asia, could eventually double the size of its American counterparts.As the city strives to establish a complete virtual asset ecosystem, Han foresees the local crypto ETFs flourishing to become the largest in trading volume in Hong Kong by year’s end. Harvest is also preparing to launch collateralized financial products based on these ETFs, further diversifying their offerings.The two-day Bitcoin Asia conference, which took place at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, highlighted these ETFs prominently. Legislative Council member Johnny Ng opened the event with enthusiastic remarks about the ETFs, calling them a major development in Hong Kong’s financial industry.Despite the second-largest first-day trading volume seen in these ETFs, with China Asset Management Company leading the pack, the journey ahead for Harvest Global and the broader ETF market in Hong Kong looks both promising and fraught with regulatory challenges.

‘Stand With Crypto’ Backs U.S. Politicians with Fundraiser Plan - DailyCoin


        
A U.S. crypto advocacy group has formed a political action committee.



The group aims to support crypto-friendly politicians.



Other crypto advocacy groups in the country have formed similar committees.
Coinbase’s digital asset advocacy group, Stand With Crypto, has revealed plans to raise money from its nearly half a million members in support of U.S.-based “crypto-friendly” politicians.Launched in August last year, the Stand with Crypto Alliance is a non-profit organization on a mission to champion clear, “common-sense’ regulation in the U.S. crypto industry. The group has 164,507 policymaker contacts and has donated over $86 million so far, raised from 448,317 crypto advocates.Rooting for Crypto-Friendly CandidatesOn March 10, Reuters reported that the advocacy group has formed a new Political Action Committee (PAC), whose aim is to support pro-crypto politicians in their pursuit of various positions in the House of Representatives and the Senate.
In addition to conducting a fundraiser for the politicians, the group made several direct endorsements, including Jim Justice, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia, and Jim Banks, a Republican vying for Indiana’s Senate seat.Other endorsements from the group are Eddy Morales, a Democrat running to represent Oregon’s Third District; Troy Downing, a Republican running to represent Montana’s Second District; and Shomari Figures, a Democrat running to represent Alabama’s Second District.“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November.” The report quoted Nick Carr, chief strategist at Stand With Crypto.With the plan, the advocacy group joins other influential crypto-focused PACs in the U.S., such as Fairshake, Protect Progress, and Defend American Jobs, which have so far raised over $110 million in this election cycle, Reuters claimed.

Bots perform 90% of stablecoin transactions, Visa says

Photo: Dado Ruvic (Reuters)Nearly 90% of tracked stablecoin transactions are not human-involved. According to recent data published by Visa and blockchain data provider Allium, less than 10% of transactions are initiated by actual users, and most are done by bots. This means that only $149 billion out of the total of $2.2 trillion in stablecoin transactions recorded last month can be attributed to “organic” payments activity, per the analysis.Krispy Kreme's Q1 beat driven by heart donutsThe report cites May 5 as an example, when $51.6 billion worth of stablecoin transactions were processed, but only $4.6 billion was actual activity after removing inorganic transactions.Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to that of another currency, or commodities like gold, or any financial instrument. With the new data dashboard, both companies are tracking transactions of major stablecoins, such as Tether, Circle’s USDC, Paxo’s USDP, and PayPal’s PYUSD. All these stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar.Visa’s head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, responded to a Coin Metrics chart that suggested stablecoins were catching up with established settlement networks. Sheffield said that transactions initiated by smart contracts, without human involvement, cannot be directly compared to traditional payment processor transactions.Stablecoins have been developed to address the high volatility associated with the most widely used cryptocurrencies. A currency must remain relatively stable to be used as a medium of exchange, thereby guaranteeing the parties involved that it will retain its purchasing power in the short term.For instance, Tether (USDT) is the top stablecoin that acts as a medium for investors to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Tether accounts for over 50% of the daily trading volume of Bitcoin and up to 70% of some other major cryptocurrencies.

Binance and KuCoin have obtained registration from the anti-money laundering regulatory authority in India, marking a step forward for the credibility of cryptocurrencies. 
These two exchanges, among the nine that were banned in December, are the first offshore entities linked to cryptocurrencies to receive registration in India. 
The regulatory authority commented that these recordings give “a little more credibility to the system.” Let’s see all the details below. 

Anti-money laundering registration in India: Binance and KuCoin get the green light
Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the world, and its competitor KuCoin have become the first offshore entities related to cryptocurrencies to obtain approval from the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), part of the Indian Ministry of Finance.
This happens months after both companies were banned for “operating illegally.” These two companies, along with Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex, had been excluded from India towards the end of last year.
The director of FIU-IND, Vivek Aggarwal, stated that the approval of Binance and KuCoin represents a positive signal for the credibility of cryptocurrencies in the country. 
Aggarwal also explained that the unit will establish a working group to review compliance guidelines on money laundering in the context of virtual digital asset services. 
He also emphasized that official recognition of the industry requires the support of the Indian parliament and government.
KuCoin was the first cryptocurrency exchange to pay a fine, paying 41,000 dollars, and has resumed its operations. On the other hand, Binance will have to attend a hearing with the FIU and pay a fine in order to resume its activities. 
According to the Economic Times, Binance may have to pay up to 2 million dollars. Vivek Aggarwal confirmed that Binance is registered, but the compliance process is not yet complete as the amount of the fine must be determined after the hearing.
Other entities like Kraken, Gemini, and Gate.io are in talks with the regulatory authority, while OKX and Bitstamp have submitted plans to exit the Indian market.
India now counts 48 cryptographic entities registered as reporting entities under the anti-money laundering law. 
The meeting with the press last Friday represented the first time that the FIU officially spoke about cryptocurrencies and follows a meeting between the FIU and the representatives of the 48 registered entities, also a novelty.
India’s ambiguity on crypto: from taxes to G20 global consensus
At the national level, India has maintained an ambiguous position on cryptocurrencies. 
In 2022, the high taxes imposed on digital assets, together with the crisis in the cryptocurrency markets, have pushed many Indian traders towards international exchanges. Damaging the local sector. 
However, trading volume has returned to Indian exchanges after the ban imposed on offshore entities.
During its presidency of the G20 in 2023, India pushed for a global consensus on the regulation of cryptocurrencies, managing to obtain the agreement of all members on the general guidelines. 
However, the country has been criticized for trying to obtain international consensus without having clear legislation on cryptocurrencies.
India has kept a cryptocurrency bill in cold storage since 2021 and indicated that it will decide its position in the coming months. 
A prominent legislator told CoinDesk that there probably won’t be any cryptocurrency bill before mid-2025.

Digital Currency Group Sees Revenue Rise Despite Grayscale Struggles - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

Digital Currency Group (DCG), the investment firm behind industry giant Grayscale, reported a strong first quarter with overall revenue climbing 11% to $229 million.What Happened: This positive performance comes despite ongoing challenges faced by Grayscale’s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, Coindesk reported.“The first quarter of 2024 was marked by several exciting developments for our industry,” DCG said in a letter to shareholders, highlighting the approval of the long-awaited Bitcoin ETF and the surge in Bitcoin prices. “Against this backdrop, we are pleased to showcase a strong start to the year for DCG.”Grayscale Holds Steady Despite OutflowsGrayscale, a subsidiary of DCG, contributed $156 million to the company’s overall revenue. This figure remained relatively flat compared to the previous quarter, even amidst significant outflows from GBTC. The conversion of GBTC into a spot ETF in January opened the door for competition with lower fees, leading some investors to move their holdings elsewhere.“While Grayscale expected outflows alongside increased competition under the ETF wrapper, Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC nevertheless exceeded our expectations,” the company stated.Also Read: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Collect $11.29M Net Inflows On ThursdayThe Future Of GrayscaleOther DCG subsidiaries, however, painted a brighter picture. The cryptocurrency mining pool Foundry and the global investment platform Luno reported impressive revenue increases of 35% and 46%, respectively.The question remains: can Grayscale weather the storm? The company acknowledged the need to adjust its fees but has yet to implement those changes. To stay competitive, Grayscale has filed for a new Bitcoin ETF with a significantly lower fee structure, but its approval by the SEC is still pending.Looking Ahead: Benzinga’s Future Of Digital Assets EventThe future of Grayscale and the broader digital asset industry will undoubtedly be a hot topic at upcoming industry events. Benzinga’s  Future of Digital Assets conference, happening on Nov. 19, is one such platform where key players will gather to discuss the latest trends, regulations, and investment opportunities in the crypto space.Read Next: Joseph Lubin Accuses SEC Of Stifling Crypto Growth Amid Legal Showdown

Analyst Justin Bennett Says Bitcoin’s in a ‘Slow Bleed’ and on the Cusp of Plunging Further - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist believes Bitcoin (BTC) could suddenly plunge much lower.
In a new post, crypto analyst Justin Bennett tells his 111,300 followers on the social media platform X that if Bitcoin fails to hold $61,000 as support the crypto king could remain in a downtrend for a while.










However, he says that if Bitcoin can break through the $65,000 level on the monthly chart, the top digital asset by market cap would confirm a bullish trend.
“BTC looks pretty terrible at the moment. This slow bleed is not ideal for buying. We’ve seen this before, and it usually results in a cascade of long liquidations. Maybe this time is different. We’ll see. $61,000 is a must hold for bulls, $65,000 is monthly resistance.”
 
Source: Justin Bennett/X
Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) is likely heading lower after failing to hold a key support level.
“Speaking of slow bleed, ETH/BTC has broken its 2017 diagonal on the weekly and monthly charts. Most likely a move into those 3.8-4% highs from here.”
Source: Justin Bennett/X
ETH/BTC is trading for 0.048 BTC ($3,019) at time of writing, up slightly in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, Bennett warns that Ethereum may follow a similar bearish price pattern as in July 2023 if the top altcoin fails to reclaim the $3,150 level on its weekly chart.
“This slow bleed from ETH doesn’t look great. Ethereum needs to recover $3,150 this week, or things could get dicier than they are. If you think a simple trend line doesn’t matter, check out July 2023.”

Ethereum is trading for $3,017 at time of writing, up 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

Bullish attitude dominates in the AI market, as seen by strong price increases for numerous AI currencies.



Semiconductor companies are driving AI coin rallies, with Nvidia’s earnings report and market optimism boosting the sector’s market cap by 10.4%.



OpenAI’s forthcoming search engine launch increases AI competition, signals innovation, and may raise investor confidence in projects involving AI.





Semiconductor businesses continue to fuel the artificial intelligence (AI) coin boom, boosted by Nvidia’s impending earnings report and a jump in AI market excitement. The AI market valuation, which is now $27.8 billion, has increased by 10.4% in the previous 24 hours.



Nvidia is anticipating release of its Q1 earnings statement on May 22 that may eventually favour the bullish trend of the AI market. Investors follow up the process, waiting for an upward trend in the blockchain-related equities, and the AI-based blockchain tokens will benefit from this.



In addition, a new stream on the path is also expected, which may boost the already bullish atmosphere around AI coins. As per sources, OpenAI, an AI research and deployment firm, has plans to release a search engine in the competition with Google on May 13. Consequently, the appearance of OpenAI in the field of Google competition harbors the possibility of a change in the search engine market.



The forthcoming introduction of OpenAI’s search engine is considered as an enormous advance in the AI commerce. As OpenAI expands into the field of AI-powered search, it not only increases competition but also represents the sector’s unwavering quest for innovation. This development is likely to boost investor confidence in AI-related ventures.



In the previous 24 hours, several AI currencies have seen huge price increases. Fetch.ai (FET) is currently at $2.34, with a market capitalization of $1.986B, representing an 8.84% growth in value. Render (RNDR) is up 11.83%, trading at $11.41, with a market capitalization of $4.435B. 



The Graph (GRT) has since increased by 18.51%, and is now trading at $0.311864 with a market capitalization of $2.957B. Furthermore, Bittensor (TAO) is today at $395.96, with a market capitalization of $2.668B, representing a 2.84% increase. 



Akash Network (AKT) has surged by 17.08%, priced at $5.73, with a market cap of $1.352B while SingularityNET (AGIX) has seen a 9.67% increase, trading at $0.980312, with a market cap of $1.256B.

Bitcoin Difficulty Sinks as Miners Mull Post-Halving Perks - DailyCoin


        
Bitcoin mining difficulty sees a significant percentage fall.



This suggests a consequential number of miners are leaving the network.



Runes and Ordinals activity has flatlined. 
The highly anticipated Bitcoin halving on April 19 ushered in a new era of scarcity for the network. By reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, the event made an already ruthlessly competitive mining landscape even more unforgiving. 
Miners were braced for tougher economics post-halving, but few could have predicted the current landscape. Three weeks out from the halving, evidence of miner capitulation has emerged as mining difficulty takes a significant dip.Bitcoin Miners Under PressureBitcoin mining difficulty fell by a significant 6% on May 10, dropping from 88.1 trillion hashes to 83.15 trillion hashes, per data from CoinWarz. This marked the largest percentage difficulty reduction since July 2021 when it plunged 28% to 14.36 trillion hashes. The mining difficulty metric automatically adjusts to account for changes in the total computing power of the BTC network.Bitcoin mining difficulty per CoinWarzBitcoin miners earn revenue from block rewards and transaction fees. After matching the target hash and successfully mining a new block, the miner receives the block reward in newly released BTC along with all fees paid by users to have their transactions included. With the halving cutting block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, many assumed that increased transaction fees from Ordinals and the new Runes protocol would help offset the hit to block rewards. But that dynamic has yet to play out as daily mining revenue plummeted post-halving.Mining Revenue DownThe run-up to the halving saw daily mining revenue spike as high as $107.8 million, but the post-halving period has seen a sharp drop in revenue, sinking to $29.9 million as of May 9 to record a 29-week low, according to data from YCharts.Bitcoin daily mining revenue per YChartsThe severe drop in revenue underscored the squeeze on profitability that miners are facing in the aftermath of the halving event. Meanwhile, both Ordinals and Runes are currently failing to live up to the hype, subsequently adding to miners’ woes.Are Bitcoin Runes a Flop?The Runes protocol, which was created to bring meme coins to the base layer, was touted as the miners’ savior post-halving, as the expected surge in activity would drive up transaction fees. Yet shortly after their launch, on halving day, Dotta, the CEO of Forgotten Runes, conceded that the response had been lukewarm as the leading project “Satoshi Nakamoto” had less than 20,000 holders. Several weeks later, the situation for Runes has not improved. On-chain metrics showed a severe decrease in activity, falling from a peak of 23,061 on April 26 to just 43 by May 9, according to data from Dune. Similarly, fees earned from Runes fell from a peak of $321,263 on April 26 to just $719 on May 9.Runes activity per DuneAlthough Ordinals have had a head start on Runes, launching in January 2023, Ordinal activity has also fallen sharply since the halving, dropping to 15,333 on May 8, a fraction of what was seen at their November 2023 peak when daily inscriptions would number around the 480,000 mark, according to data from Dune. Daily fees generated by Ordinals came in at just 2.02 BTC on May 8.Ordinals activity per DuneWith Runes and Ordinals activity flatlining, Bitcoin miners are forced to fall back on standard transaction fees generated by users moving BTC.On the Flipside
BTC mining difficulty is a cumulative metric. Comparing a significant drop in 2021 (when the difficulty was around 20 trillion hashes) to a significant drop in 2024 is not a like-for-like comparison.



It would be unfair to call Runes a flop at this time, considering the protocol is just three weeks old.



Meme coin investing has developed an even worse reputation from the frequent rugs witnessed on other chains this cycle.
Why This MattersDeclining difficulty underscores Bitcoin miners’ challenges in the halving aftermath. As less profitable operations shut down, it paves the way for further consolidation of mining power among larger, more efficient players.Bitcoin miners are under pressure as daily revenue tanks:Bitcoin Mining Revenue Sinks Post-Halving: Are Miners Toast?Binance faces fresh allegations of market manipulation post-DoJ charges:Binance Whistleblower Alleges Profit Before User Protection

Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto launches political action committee

United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s project advocating for “common-sense” digital asset regulation has launched a political action committee (PAC).In a May 10 announcement on X, Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto project launched a PAC for roughly 450,000 members to contribute to candidates running in the 2024 U.S. elections. The initiative, launched by Coinbase in 2023, reported on its website that users had donated more than $86 million toward supporting pro-crypto initiatives in the country — it’s unclear how much, if any, these funds will go toward the PAC.“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November,” said Stand With Crypto Chief Strategist Nick Carr, according to a Reuters report.Source: Stand With CryptoSince its launch, the crypto advocacy group has hosted a forum for U.S. Presidential candidates — before Donald Trump was the presumptive Republican Party nominee — and campaigned for D.C. lawmakers to support crypto-friendly legislation. The project grades lawmakers running in 2024 on an A to F scale, with recommended candidates including Republican Bernie Moreno for Ohio’s Senate race and Democrat Shomari Figures for one of Alabama’s congressional seats.Election Day in the U.S. is roughly six months away, when voters will determine which political party controls the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the presidency. Crypto-focused PACs, including Fairshake and its affiliates, Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, have raised more than $100 million to support candidates favoring digital asset policies. Related: Coinbase political initiative features US lawmaker who admitted to ethics violationsAmong the races with outspoken pro- and anti-crypto candidates includes the fight over the Massachusetts Senate seat currently held by Democrat Elizabeth Warren. Republican John Deaton, an attorney who has advocated for crypto users in several lawsuits, has pushed back against Senator Warren’s anti-crypto views while in office.“Eleven primary races that include crypto-backed candidates remain,” Rick Claypool, a researcher at Public Citizen, said in a May 6 X post. “Then it’s onto the general election, where narrow majorities mean super PAC spending can tip congressional control.”According to Federal Election Commission rules, individuals supporting a PAC are limited to donations of no more than $5,000, potentially giving Stand With Crypto up to $2.2 billion at its current membership. In contrast, Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions from corporations. Coinbase has donated millions to Fairshake and its affiliates.Magazine: Opinion: GOP crypto maxis almost as bad as Dems’ ‘anti-crypto army’

WIF's price - How long will this memecoin sustain its green streak? - AMBCrypto



WIF registered a massive surge in on-chain volume over the last few days
WIF’s social volume hiked too, despite the sentiment around the token falling

Dogwifhat [WIF] has been one of the market’s most popular memecoins over the last few months. As expected, this has translated into a hike in its volumes, with its network growing accordingly too.
Volumes on the rise
According to recent data, the on-chain volume on WIF grew significantly over the last 24 hours. This contributed to the memecoin surpassing other established networks in this domain.
Source: X
One of the reasons for this would be the ever-growing popularity of the WIF network. AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data revealed that the social volume around WIF has remained high over the past month. However, there was a trend observed that could impact WIF negatively in the social sphere.
Weighted sentiment, a metric used to determine the sentiment of the conversations being had on the social front for a token or a network, declined significantly over the past few days.
This meant that pessimism around WIF grew, affecting the token’s price negatively.
Source: Santiment
A look at the memecoin’s price
Since 01 April, after hitting the $4.857-level, the price of WIF declined significantly on the charts. Over this period, the price hit multiple lower lows and lower highs, establishing a bearish trend. However, the trend could reverse itself soon provided there is enough bullish momentum around WIF. The $3.502-level has been tested multiple times and has been weakened over the last week.
If this continues the price may be able to push past this resistance and aim for the $4.382-level in the future.
The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) for WIF also fell significantly over the last few days. This indicated that the money flow for WIF had fallen materially.
However, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) for WIF sustained its uptrend, implying that the bullish momentum around WIF was relatively high.
Source: Trading View
Whales move in
Another factor that could affect WIF’s price would be whale behaviour. Based on lookonchain’s data, a whale recently invested 4.2 million USDC to purchase 1.4 million WIF tokens at a price of $2.99.
This whale, who has been trading WIF since early on, amassed a total profit exceeding $8 million from WIF transactions.

Ethereum's Monetary Shift Post-Dencun: Insights from CryptoQuant | Cryptoglobe


                                
The Ethereum blockchain, a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, has consistently grappled with scalability issues. Network congestion during periods of high activity leads to slow transaction times and exorbitant gas fees, hindering user experience and hindering the network’s ability to support a wider range of applications. The Dencun upgrade, deployed in March 2024, marked a significant step towards addressing these challenges, introducing novel concepts that lay the groundwork for a more scalable future for Ethereum.



Dencun, an amalgamation of the Cancun and Deneb upgrades, did not offer an immediate silver bullet solution. However, it represented a critical juncture in Ethereum’s development. The centerpiece of Dencun was the introduction of “proto-danksharding,” a concept that paves the way for future sharding implementation on the Ethereum network. Sharding essentially involves dividing the blockchain into partitions, or shards, each processing transactions independently. This parallel processing capability has the potential to significantly increase Ethereum’s transaction throughput. While Dencun itself does not implement sharding, it lays the technical foundation for its future integration.



While addressing long-term scalability was a core objective, Dencun’s impact on transaction fees in the immediate term was more nuanced. The upgrade did not directly reduce fees on the main Ethereum network. Instead, it focused on optimizing fees within Layer 2 networks. Layer 2 solutions operate on top of the Ethereum blockchain, bundling transactions together and processing them off-chain before transmitting them back to the mainnet. This approach helps alleviate congestion on the main Ethereum network and can potentially lower fees for users.



A key component of Dencun, EIP-4844, specifically reduced the cost for Layer 2 networks to submit their bundled transactions back to the main Ethereum blockchain. This improvement in Layer 2 efficiency has the potential to indirectly translate to lower fees for users who leverage these Layer 2 solutions. However, it is important to note that the realized fee reduction on Layer 2 networks may not be as significant as initial projections suggested, and the long-term impact on fees requires further observation.



The Dencun upgrade did have an unforeseen consequence. The success in lowering transaction fees also resulted in a decrease in the amount of ETH burned on the network. Previously, higher network activity corresponded to higher fees, and a portion of these fees were burned, leading to a deflationary effect on the total supply of ETH. This deflationary mechanism was one of the anticipated benefits of the Ethereum Merge, the transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. With a reduction in ETH burned and the natural increase in supply continuing, the total supply of ETH began to grow again at a faster rate compared to the period following the Merge. This shift has pushed ETH back towards an inflationary model.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The Dencun upgrade’s legacy is multifaceted. It demonstrably addressed scalability concerns and set the stage for a future Ethereum capable of handling a significantly higher transaction volume. However, the unintended consequence of potentially reversing ETH’s deflationary trend has ignited discussions about the future trajectory of Ethereum’s economic model.




VIDEO




The Dencun upgrade has prompted a fresh analysis from CryptoQuant, a respected South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm. This upgrade, according to CryptoQuant, may significantly alter Ethereum’s progression towards becoming an “ultra sound money” – a concept that denotes a currency that appreciates or maintains its value over time.



CryptoQuant explains that “ultra sound money” in the context of Ethereum refers to the blockchain’s potential to decrease its total ETH supply over time. They say this was being facilitated by strategic upgrades like EIP-1559 and The Merge, which introduced mechanisms to burn a portion of transaction fees. According to CryptoQuant, this feature was pivotal in reinforcing Ethereum’s deflationary economic model.



Post-Dencun upgrade, CryptoQuant notes a critical shift—there has been a decoupling of Ethereum’s transaction fees from network activity levels, which has effectively altered the ETH burn rate. While this has led to reduced transaction costs for users, CryptoQuant raises concerns that this adjustment challenges the deflationary mechanism previously set by The Merge. They emphasize that maintaining a deflationary supply now demands significantly higher network activity than before.



CryptoQuant articulates that the reduction in transaction fees, though beneficial for user adoption and network throughput, introduces inflationary pressures to the Ethereum ecosystem. They claim this shift could impact the long-term valuation of ETH, potentially affecting Ethereum’s attractiveness as a deflationary asset.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $1 billion market cap in May


As May 2024 progresses, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing the ripple effects of the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event that took place in April—a key event often seen as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.
This positive sentiment is proving advantageous for several cryptocurrencies nearing significant market cap milestones, particularly the $1 billion mark. Despite the prevailing market trends, certain assets are showing strong potential for growth, supported by robust underlying fundamentals.
Building on this trend, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies poised to attract a substantial capital inflow in May 2024, potentially propelling them toward the $1 billion market cap milestone. Notably, these assets are already approaching this significant threshold.


Tezos (XTZ)
Tezos (XTZ), a blockchain platform known for its focus on security, decentralized governance, and scalability, is nearing a market cap of $910 million. Currently priced at $0.9277, marking a 4.50% increase over the last day, the ecosystem has shown notable activities.

Recently, the Tezos Foundation has partnered with Magic to enhance the onboarding process for decentralized applications (dApps). This will integrate Magic’s wallet solutions with the Tezos blockchain to improve user experiences, particularly by simplifying the processes for web3 applications.
Furthermore, Rarible, a key player in the digital marketplace space, is set to incorporate Tezos on its aggregated platform. This development underscores Tezos’ expanding influence and adoption in the NFT and broader digital asset markets.
Despite a challenging market environment, Tezos has shown resilience. According to CoinCodex, Tezos is expected to see a 6.54% price increase, potentially reaching around $1.020 by May 31. 
The Fear & Greed Index stands at 66, pointing to strong market interest in Tezos. Over the last 30 days, these indicators highlight its robust fundamentals and the strong support it continues to receive from its community and developers.
JasmyCoin (JASMY)
JasmyCoin (JASMY) , which integrates IoT and blockchain technologies to empower users with data sovereignty, is currently demonstrating promising growth with a market cap nearing $905 million and a price of $0.01836. 
JasmyCoin price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap
According to CoinCodex, the price of JasmyCoin is predicted to rise by 152% and reach $0.0474 by May 31. The technical indicators suggest a neutral current sentiment, while the Fear & Greed Index indicates a level of 66.
Both Tezos and JasmyCoin are aligned with broader market trends and are poised to benefit from any positive shifts in market sentiment.
These two cryptocurrencies are likely to attract increased investment if the cryptocurrency market regains its bullish momentum, pushing their market caps over the $1 billion threshold.

This Bull Run Might Skip Ethereum (ETH): Opinion


In an acerbic X post, Ethereum (ETH) veteran, prominent investor, podcaster and crypto educator Ryan Sean Adams describes two alternative midterm forecasts for Ether (ETH) as a crypto coin.Bearish: Inevitable puberty of Ethereum (ETH)In a 2024-2025 potential rally, Ethereum (ETH) might be overlooked by investors as it is going through the "awkward" phase of "puberty." It looks too slow and expensive compared to its own second-layer solutions of various types, Adams admits. While L2s are necessary for the scaling of such a blockchain and reflect the founder's vision of its progress, it has nothing to do with the interests of its most obvious investors.Meme coin champions and dApps users (including retroactive airdrop farmers) are too focused on alternative L2/L3 blockchains, while institutional "big money" is on its way to Bitcoin (BTC).The approval of Spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. might change the status quo but, as U.Today previously reported, analysts are skeptical of the possibility of this step in the coming months.As such, Ethereum (ETH) is getting through the challenges of its "puberty" while "toddler chains" are looking for shortcuts and, therefore, might look more attractive in the midterm.Bullish: Rock solid monetary economics for "chain of 1000 chains"At the same time, the arguments of Ethereum (ETH) optimists also look strong as of Q2, 2024. Ethereum (ETH) meets this cycle stronger than in 2020 with viable overhyped L2s and zkEVMs driving innovations and attracting value.With its "rock solid monetary economics" cemented by ERC 4337 implementation, it remains the only profitable blockchain, and its competitors are not even close to this status.Also, despite the growing audience of alternative blockchains, Ethereum (ETH) mainnet remains the root chain for 1,000 blockchains, Adams says.These two theses are just "two perspectives for ETH bulls," the author concludes.Ether (ETH) is changing hands at $2,925, being 3% down in the last 24 hours.

Aggressive Stock Buying On Rising Layoffs And Revenue Rise At The Largest Chip Manufacturer TSMC - Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) - Benzinga

To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.Buying On Rising LayoffsPlease click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).Note the following:
	The chart shows that the stock market has vigorously risen from the recent pullback.
	The chart shows that RSI reached oversold levels during the recent pullback and now has risen to touch the lower band of the overbought zone.  Historically, this setup leads to more stock market gains.
	The chart shows that the volume during the recent rise is not heavy.  This indicates lack of conviction.
	The chart shows that the stock market is now in the resistance zone.
	In The Arora Report analysis, stops of the short sellers are right above the resistance zone.  If the stock market rises further, Wall Street’s hunt and destroy algorithms will kick in, taking out the stops of short sellers and igniting a short squeeze. The result of such a scenario would be a new stock market high.  
	Yesterday in the Morning Capsule we shared with you:

Jobless claims came at 231K vs. 213K consensus. This indicates that the job market is beginning to slow.

	The bulls latched on to the rise in jobless claims and aggressively bought stocks. There is merit to this line of thinking because Powell is already itching to cut rates and rising layoffs will give him an excuse to cut rates.
	Prudent investors need to be somewhat careful as weekly jobless claims series is very volatile.
	For proper analysis at The Arora Report, in addition to the weekly data, we look at a four week moving average of initial jobless claims.  The four week moving average is now at 215K – up 2.26% from the prior week and down 10.14% from a year ago.  Considering the size of the U.S. economy, a rise of 2.26% over the prior week is hardly meaningful, but do not tell that to trigger happy stock market bulls.  Prudent investors should watch the trend over a period of several weeks, not just one week. Jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in The Arora Report adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions.  Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change.
	Adding to the optimism this morning is a report of rising revenues at the world’s largest chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. TSM. TSM is manufacturing a vast majority of the artificial intelligence chips, and the data shows sales are booming.  Here are the details:
	
		April revenues came at T$236.02B.  This is up 59.6% year-over-year and up 21% month-over-month.
		January - April revenue came at T$828.67B. This is 26% year-over-year.
	
	
	Data from TSM is bringing buying into artificial intelligence stocks such as NVIDIA Corp NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Micron Technology Inc MU, and Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT.
ChinaStocks in Hong Kong have reached a nine month high. There is China risk, but stocks in Hong Kong represent the best value in the whole world at this time. The ETF of choice is iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI. As full disclosure, FXI is in The Arora Report's ZYX Emerging Model Portfolio.Magnificent Seven Money FlowsIn the early trade, money flows are positive in Apple Inc AAPL, Meta Platforms Inc META, NVDA, and Tesla Inc TSLA.In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Amazon.com, Inc.

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

Tether (USDT) Warning from Deutsche Bank! - Bitcoin Sistemi


The largest stablecoin Tether (USDT) is the largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with a market value of $110 billion.
While Tether is strengthening its position day by day, Deutsche Bank warned investors against all stabalecoins, including Tether.


Stating that they examined approximately 334 stablecoins in a recent report, Deutsche Bank analysts pointed out that only 14% of them have survived so far.

“Some stablecoins may survive, but most will likely fail.
The enduring success of stablecoins relies on reliability, reserve support and tight operational controls. But these qualities are currently missing from many major stablecoins.
So the 30 percent de-peg among some stablecoins is not surprising at all. “

Stating that all stablecoins are unstable due to lack of transparency and strong support, analysts also warned investors against the leading stablecoin Tether.





Pointing to Tether's track record regarding misleading statements regarding reserve stocks, analysts reminded that Tether received a total fine of $41 million from the CFTC.
Analysts also said that recently published reports stated that Tether (USDT) remains the stablecoin most used in criminal activities.


Deutsche Bank analysts recently stated that their criticism of all stablecoins, including Tether (USDT), stems from the collapse of Terraform Labs' algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (TUSD) in 2022 and the removal of at least 40 billion dollars from the market in a few days.

Solana’s SOL dipped by 4% to $147.BTC priceAmong the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, the biggest losers are liquid staking leader Lido (LDO) and Bittensor (TAO), the decentralized AI project. Both are down around 7% in the past 24 hours.Meanwhile, Akash Network (AKT) and Telegram-affiliated TON are the best performers, up 13% and 8%, respectively.The selloff appears to be isolated to crypto for now, as major stock markets and the U.S. dollar are trading flat on the day.Nearly $150 million of leveraged positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with just over half that figure in the past four hours, according to CoinGlass.

StaFi Adds Eigenlayer’s Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) To Its Liquid Staking As A Service (LSaaS) Stack



                    

StaFi, one of the leading staking infrastructure providers, announced support for EigenLayer’s Liquid Restaking Token (LRT), allowing users to participate in the restaking ecosystem. Users on StaFi can now rehypothecate their staked tokens to provide security to decentralized applications (DApps) that are required to build their trust and security – or their own actively validated services (AVS). 



Eigenlayer LRT is already supported on the LSaaS Stack App, while support for Karak and BounceBit LRT will be maintained. There are also plans to roll out support for BTC LRT in the future.




The latest integration follows the launch of StaFi’s liquid staking as a service (LSaaS )testnet – launched last month – and the publication of the StaFi 2.0 roadmap. The roadmap included plans to add the LRT stack to power new re-staking applications. EigenLayer also launched on mainnet in February this year allowing developers to leverage pooled security via restaking by extending the security of Ethereum to AVSs. 







The integration of the LRT stack will enable project teams and DApp developers to seamlessly deploy LRT on LSaaS, significantly enhancing the efficiency of LRT development and overall accessibility of restaking.



Terming the latest addition to LSaaS as a “major breakthrough for developers”, Liam Young, the founder of StaFi stated: 




“The integration of LRT into StaFi’s Liquid Staking as a Service is a major breakthrough for developers, who are now free to create restaking products that harness shared security across multiple chains. Up until now, building with LRT has been a complex task that entails significant lead time. StaFi’s LRT Stack will slash time to market while empowering builders to create novel solutions that draw upon the crypto economic guarantees that liquid staking permits.” 



EigenLayer is a protocol built on Ethereum that permits restaking to enhance overall security across the blockchain ecosystem. The platform introduces novel ideas such as staking and free market governance that create an optimized system of pooled security whereby the staked $ETH is repurposed to provide validation services to AVSs. 



Simply, EigenLayer repurposes currently staked ETH (or another token)  to provide validation services to AVSs via restaking. The staked ETH is repurposed to validate transactions to platforms built on Ethereum but cannot utilize the settlement layer of the blockchain. Crucially, stakers retain their staking rewards on Ethereum. 



The integrated LRT stack will support several functionalities such as restaking, unrestaking, and withdrawing tokens. Additionally, users will be able to mint and burn LRTs, join restaking pools and delegate and undelegate staking operators. 








To facilitate the LRT/ETH pair construction, AVS restaking rewards will be swapped for ETH in the market via swap. This will follow the launch of EigenLayer’s planned upgrade which will allow developers and  LRT operators to construct their LRT with the aforementioned functionalities swiftly.

Cardano's Bullish Hourly Golden Cross; Will ADA Rally?

Cardano (ADA) is currently showing signals of bullish potential as it posts a "golden cross" formation on its hourly charts. This development has sparked anticipation among traders and investors, prompting speculation about the potential trajectory of ADA's price in the near term.A golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average, typically the 50-hour moving average, crosses above a longer-term moving average, such as the 200-hour moving average, on a price chart. This crossover is interpreted by technical analysts as a bullish signal, suggesting a potential uptrend in the asset's price.In the case of Cardano, the recent bullish crossover on its hourly charts might suggest a shift in momentum toward the upside. This bullish formation reflects increasing buying pressure and suggests that ADA's price could be poised for significant upward movement in the coming days.ADA/USD Hourly Chart, Courtesy: TradingViewHowever, it is important to note that while golden crosses can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price trends, they are not foolproof indicators and should be considered in conjunction with other technical and fundamental factors.ADA was up 0.59% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing to $0.4575, having pared its intraday gains. ADA fell drastically on its hourly chart, forming a giant red candlestick at press time. Weekly initial jobless claims rose to their highest level since August 2023, impacting the financial markets with the U.S. inflation data for April due next week. As Cardano's community eagerly awaits further developments on the market, all eyes are on the charts to see if ADA can capitalize on the bullish golden cross and sustain its upward momentum. A breakout above key resistance levels could potentially signal a new bullish phase for ADA, while failure to maintain momentum could result in selling pressure.In this regard, a break above $0.684 might kickstart a fresh uptrend for ADA's price; on the other hand, if selling persists, the $0.4 level may act as a formidable support.

XRP Price: 'Sleeping Giant' About to Awaken, Expert Predicts


According to Evai CEO Matthew Dixon, the upcoming consumer price index (CPI) report, which is set to be released on May 15, could end up awakening the "sleeping giant" that could propel the price of the XRP cryptocurrency much higher. A weaker-than-expected CPI reading is expected to be a major bullish catalyst for the token. At press time, XRP is changing hands at $0.5056 after peaking at $0.5217 earlier today. Dixon has predicted that the price of the Ripple-affiliated token could end up surpassing the $0.6 level later this month. The main U.S. stock indexes seem to be on track to record their eighth consecutive day in a row following some dovish statements made by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. As reported by U.Today, Powell dismissed the stagflation concerns that had plagued the markets in April, pushing the Bitcoin price to as low as the $56,000 level. Analysts expect a 0.3% CPI increase next Wednesday. However, a lower-than-expected reading will be a boon for risk assets, which include major altcoins such as XRP.As reported by U.Today, cryptocurrency bull Tom Lee recently predicted a dramatic inflation drop. The Fundstrat cofounder sees inflation declining substantially in the second half of the year. This, he believes, could eventually propel the Bitcoin price to $150,000 this year.  XRP has been severely underperforming Bitcoin this year despite Ripple's partial win in 2023. The lawsuit is finally approaching its much-anticipated conclusion, but it is not clear whether this will be a bullish catalyst for the token this year.

Shiba Doge Hybrid to Surge 8,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

Crypto Analyst Sets $10 Price Target For Cardano As Volume Jumps 90%


																The stars may be finally aligning for Cardano (ADA) and its holders, as the crypto token recently experienced a significant reversal and a jump in its trading volume. Interestingly, this development coincides with an ultra-bullish prediction that a crypto analyst made for the crypto token. 
Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano To Rise To $9
Crypto analyst Altcoin Daily revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that $9 is their peak price target for Cardano in this bull run. The analyst joins other crypto analysts who have made ultra-bullish predictions for Cardano despite how low the crypto token is currently trading. Before now, Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, had predicted that Cardano could rise to as high as $11 in this bull run.
Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed, Is $265,000 Too Ambitious?
Meanwhile, crypto expert Jason Appleton predicted that Cardano will rise to as high as $32 in this bull run. Specifically, he mentioned that this will happen at the peak of this market cycle. Altcoin Daily’s prediction comes amidst Cardano’s 90% jump in trading volume. This suggests that more investors are accumulating the crypto token ahead of this parabolic rise. 
Cardano’s price already reacted positively to this development, with the crypto token seeing a reversal from its downtrend. Crypto analyst Trend Rider suggested that this reversal might begin an upward trend for Cardano as he noted that the crypto token was currently holding its support level very well. 
The analyst also revealed that the bears were currently trying to push the crypto token further down, but he claimed that they would get tired once Cardano could hold this support for 1 to 2 more weeks. Once that happens, Carano will bounce from its current price level, Trend Rider remarked. 
Making A Bull Case For ADA
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently made a bullish case for Cardano. He mentioned in an X post that the crypto token seems ready for a parabolic bull run. Martinez alluded to Cardano’s historical trend and explained why the 50% price drop the crypto token experienced this past month might be a good buying opportunity. 
Martinez claimed that Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel in 2019, signaling an end to the bear market. Following that “stagnant phase,” ADA is said to have broken out of the channel with a 75% surge and then experienced a 56% correction, setting the stage for its 4,095% price gain in that bull run. 
Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Lose Interest, Is This A Precursor For A Crash To $50,000?
Martinez further noted that a similar situation looks to be playing out again as Cardano has consolidated within a parallel channel, marking an end to the bear market. ADA then broke out of this channel with a 72% price surge following this period of stagnation. Now, Cardano has experienced a 50% price correction, just like in 2019, which Martinez remarked could be setting the stage for “an impressive bull run ahead.”

Robinhood CEO Says His Firm Met With the U.S. SEC 16 Times in ‘Good Faith’ Ahead of Crypto-Related Wells Notice - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of popular retail trading platform Robinhood says his firm and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were engaged in discussions before the regulator issued a Wells Notice.
In a new interview on CNBC, Vlad Tenev says that Robinhood met with the SEC several times to address issues with existing securities laws and regulatory frameworks that do not account for crypto assets before the regulatory body gave any notice that it planned to take enforcement actions.










“We tried to create what’s called the special purpose broker-dealer for the purpose of transacting crypto assets. We actually came in good faith to meet with the SEC. I think we met with them 16 times and, unfortunately, that was not reciprocated.”
Tenev says the securities watchdog is not interested in pursuing discussions about the subject.
“It’s hard to impute the reasoning behind that, but they told us they did not want to keep meeting about it and they did not see a path toward it.”
He says the SEC has the power to address crypto restrictions but the regulator simply refuses to make changes.
“The SEC has the ability to change the rules to allow for brokers to accommodate crypto assets and they do not seem intent on doing that. Rather they are proceeding with regulation by enforcement and that is disappointing.”
Tenev previously said that Robinhood is prepared to contest the SEC’s charges in court if the legal action pushes through. He now explains why the trading platform is taking a stand against the regulator.
“I did not want to have to get into this situation but we have to defend ourselves and advocate for our customers. We do believe that crypto assets are becoming more and more important and it would not be acceptable for us to not have Americans have access to them.”

Trump holds on to crypto as his new campaign strategy against Biden

Recently, a political-crypto gathering of supporters took place at Mar-a-Lago, hosted by former President Donald Trump. The event was exclusive to traders who purchased over 47 of the Trump Digital Trading Cards “Mugshot Edition” NFTs, that were valued at $99 per card. After the dinner, Trump delivered a brief speech on crypto, which was later recorded and shared on X.Trump turns to crypto as a weapon against the Biden administrationDuring a gathering at Mar-a-Lago, Trump urged crypto supporters to cast their vote in his favor, citing the Biden administration’s stringent regulatory measures imposed on the industry.The Democrats are very much against it [crypto]. And I say this, a lot of people are very much for it … and I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid … but I’m good with it. If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, you better vote for Trump.
Donald TrumpThe change in Trump’s approach towards the crypto community is a significant shift from his previous criticisms, although it was somewhat was expected. Republicans have shown growing support for bitcoin and other digital assets in recent years, while some Democrats continue to debate whether to recognize the industry following a series of scandals.Trump’s endorsement is a significant development for crypto entities that have been actively lobbying in Washington and investing substantial amounts of money to shape the outcome of the 2024 elections.Trump also mentioned that NFTs have gained popularity once again, which was met with enthusiasm from his supporters.These statements indicate a significant shift in position since 2021 when Trump expressed concerns about the potential risks of crypto and stated that he was not supportive of it.Furthermore, this position is more assertive than his previous viewpoint. During a Fox News town hall in February 2024, Trump acknowledged the need for regulation. He stated that, “You probably have to do some regulation. But many people are embracing it. More and more I’m seeing people wanting to pay Bitcoin, and you’re seeing something that’s interesting, so I can live with it one way or the other.”Biden’s administration handle on cryptoOn the same day, Biden made it clear that he would veto a resolution aimed at repealing a Securities and Exchange Commission accounting policy.The SEC policy, known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No 121 or SAB 121, adds the costs for financial institutions that hold digital assets in custody. The tax proposal introduced by Biden has sparked controversy within the DeFi ecosystem. This is because it would impose a 30% excise tax on the electricity costs of BTC miners.“Gensler is very much against it,” Trump said on Wednesday regarding the administration’s current stand on crypto. “The Democrats are very much against it.”However, there are Democrats who support the proposed bill. On that note, 21 Democrats broke ranks with President Biden’s veto threat and sided with Republicans in voting for a resolution to overturn the SEC’s crypto guidance.It seems that memecoins are benefiting from the age-old adage that any kind of publicity is good publicity – especially the bad. Even the most insignificant form of publicity.The crypto token Jeo Boden (BODEN) experienced a significant surge of up to 25% on Wednesday. This increase in value came after former President Donald Trump responded to a question from one of his supporters regarding the token.After reaching its highest point at $0.42, BODEN experienced fluctuations and is currently trading at $0.28, representing a decrease of over 19%.The Trump campaign is currently not accepting crypto donations, but he mentioned at the impromptu gathering that he plans to do so.When asked about the possibility of accepting donations in crypto, the likely Republican nominee confidently assured, “If you can’t, I’ll make sure you can.”

Stocks Pause On Dismal Consumer Confidence; Yields, Dollar Rise As Inflation Expectations Kick Higher, Bitcoin Sinks: What's Driving Markets Friday? - Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) - Benzinga

A worse-than-expected University of Michigan’s May consumer report halted stock gains on Friday, sparking worries about a potential decline in consumer health amid perceived rising price pressures.The report disclosed that both near-term and long-term inflation expectations have surged beyond projections this month, causing the broader consumer gauge to hit its lowest levels in six months.“If spending slows down and inflation increases, we'll get the opposite of the Goldilocks scenario that many were hoping for, and the Fed will be in an especially difficult position of choosing between accommodating a slowing economy and fighting increasing inflation expectations,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. Echoing this view, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, sees rising risks of stagflation, a concern that could unsettle markets. At 12:05 p.m. trading in New York, the S&P 500 was 0.1% lower, but it was firmly up by 1.6% for the week, poised to secure a third consecutive week of gains after three of losses.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a tad higher, battling to secure the eight straight session of gains, the longest positive streak since December 2023. Tech stocks were flat. Small caps were the underperformers, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM down 0.9%. The rising inflation perceptions in the consumer survey rescued the dollar, which eyes a positive weekly close, after two negative ones. Treasury yields also inched higher by about 4 basis points across all maturities. The 10-year benchmark hit 4.50%.Gold surged to $2,385/oz, with the SPDR Gold Trust GLD up 0.8%. The dismal consumer sentiment data sharply weighed on Bitcoin BTC/USD with the largest cryptocurrency dropping over 4% from $63,000 to below $60,500 following the report.

Cardano (ADA) Eyes Crazy Anomaly with 4,000,000% Surge in Bulls Liquidations


In an unexpected turn of events within the crypto market, Cardano (ADA) has experienced an extraordinary surge in bullish liquidations, diverging significantly from the bearish ones. Over the course of just one hour, there has been a remarkable $320,670 liquidated from long positions, a figure that dwarfs the comparatively small $8.97 liquidated from short positions, resulting in an astonishing disparity of nearly 4,000,000%.Source: CoinGlassThe surge in bullish liquidations coincided with a 3% decline in Cardano's price within the same hour. One major contributing factor could be named recent negative macroeconomic indicators from the US economy. Among these indicators, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index dropped from 77.2 to 67.4, reflecting a decrease in consumer confidence. Additionally, consumer inflation expectations saw an uptick, with 1-year expectations rising from 3.2% to 3.5%, and 5-year expectations increasing from 3% to 3.1%.ADA to USD by CoinMarketCapThe Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index serves as a gauge of consumer sentiment regarding economic conditions, with lower values indicating reduced confidence, which can impact spending patterns. Meanwhile, the rise in inflation expectations suggests that consumers anticipate higher prices for goods and services in the future, potentially leading to changes in spending behavior and economic dynamics.This combination of economic factors may have influenced market sentiment, contributing to the surge in liquidations observed in Cardano trading. However, the fact that long liquidations exceeded shorts by 4,000,000% is obviously due to excessive greed reigning the market.

Anatoly Yakovenko Previews Solana Post-Firedancer - The Defiant

Solana’s co-founder says there the network faces an opportunity to emerge as the leading monolithic chain in web3.In a panel closing out the first day of the Solana Crossroads 2024 conference, Anatoly Yakovenko, the CEO of Solana Labs, said that Solana is poised to emerge as the leading web3 network.Yakovenko said Solana will have officially transcended its “mainnet beta” with the impending launch of Firedancer — the forthcoming Solana client from Jump Crypto. Firedancer offers an entirely new codebase intended to eliminate the risk posed by Solana’s currently lone client implementation, increase transaction throughput, and bolster the network’s efficiency.“Folks can stop calling it beta at any time, it's just my personal preference that we do that after Firedancer ships,” Yakovenko said. “You want different people to work on the same component so the probability of a bug being in both [clients] is virtually zero.”Yakovenko said that Jump has been “making a ton of progress” on Firedancer, adding that he expects there is a 50% chance Firedancer will be live on mainnet before the Solana Breakpoint conference in September.Jump Crypto first announced it was building Firedancer in August 2022. Jump said it would design the client to “drastically increas[e] Solana’s networking throughput, resiliency, and efficiency.”Despite Solana currently boasting an impressive throughput, the network struggled with frequent outages and perceptions of centralization in recent years.Memecoin stress-testingLooking ahead, Yakovenko predicts that Solana will grow to host more than $1 trillion worth of stablecoins within the next five years.He characterized the challenges as bottlenecks Solana has faced leading up to this point as “a blessing,” as memecoins, NFTs, and inscriptions have served to stress-test the network, rather than a massive stablecoin ecosystem.“We’re blessed to stress-test with memecoins, and not with $1 trillion worth of stablecoins,” Yakovenko said. “We’re lucky to find those bugs and fix them.”Yakovenko also reaffirmed Solana’s commitment to achieving scalability at Layer 1, as opposed to the "fragmented" Layer 2 ecosystem driving Ethereum’s scalability. He said Solana’s design is intended to facilitate future scalability gains through gains in hardware efficiency, noting the rapid pace of innovation in semiconductor manufacturing from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Nvidia.“This is an opportunity for a single giant world computer that synchronizes at the speed of light, Yakovenko said.

Binance VIP trader profited by dumping play-to-earn token | Protos


A new investigation has revealed that Binance allegedly helped a secretive whale trader siphon money from the play-to-earn crypto industry. One of these so-called VIPs was DWF, afforded special attention by Binance. DWF allegedly bragged that it “successfully” tripled the trading volume of a token through an artificial, “believable trading pattern.”
Some investigators estimated that DWF manipulated the price of YGG and at least six other tokens on Binance through at least $300 million worth of wash trades last year.
Not too long ago, venture capitalists at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) told the world a story about play-to-earn crypto. Web 3 and the metaverse would become so large and prosperous that they would spawn a new, sustainable industry for offshore labor. As the result of just one crypto game, a16z wrote, “Gaming was literally lifting an entire community out of poverty.”
In these venture capitalists’ imagined reality, wealthy Westerners would crave billions of dollars of in-game items like pets, outfits, weapons, or virtual real estate. They would pay low income workers to perform time-consuming in-game actions to earn those items on their behalf. 
Even more amazing, this type of activity would become so commonplace and lucrative for both groups that the wealthy class would self-organize into play-to-earn guilds in order to use the power of blockchain to govern, lend, and distribute their assets.
Cheerleading the play-to-earn crypto revolution that never happened
The game was Axie Infinity, which sold a massive collection of NFTs plus two fungible tokens, AXS and SLP. As a result of this proof-of-concept game, “many players in the Philippines were earning more than they had at their previous jobs,” the venture capitalists boasted.
To invest in this amazing future, a16z decided to invest millions into Axie Infinity’s game studio. (Initially it wanted to lead a $150 million round yet only closed a small fraction of that total.) It also poured $4.6 million (plus millions more in tokens) into an Axie Infinity play-to-earn guild, Yield Guild Games (YGG).
A16z wrote that YGG would provide ‘”unparalleled economic opportunities” and unlock a “largely untapped economic opportunity in emerging markets to provide jobs by building a virtual economy in the digital world.”

Today, the price of AXS is down 95% from its all-time high, SLP is down 99%, Axie NFTs are down 90% on average, and YGG is down 92%. DWF made millions by selling millions of YGG near the peak, according to Wall Street Journal’s investigation.
The real story of play-to-earn crypto, it seems, is the money that has already been made from selling a dream of the future that never transpired.

3 High-Growth Tech Stocks that Also Pay Dividends Now - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Investors are used to certain types of stocks to yield worthwhile dividends. These are typically real estate investment trusts (REITs), banks, payment processors, large utility or consumer staple companies. In contrast, high-growth companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) tend to reinvest in the business.



Soon after Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) experimented with dividends from 1987 to 1995, only to stop until reissuing in 2012. Although AAPL dividend yield is still low at 0.54%, the company uses a proxy shareholder return via record-breaking stock buybacks.



According to Morningstar, compared to the financial services sector, which comprised 43% of dividend growth in 2003, the tech sector only constituted 2.10%. By 2023, we are seeing much greater sector diversification, with financial firms making 23.57% while dividend-paying tech stocks increased to 9% share.



Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) announced dividend payouts this year. This marks a wider tech industry shift to keep their stock momentum going by enticing a wider investor base to enroll.



Here are three established tech stocks that investors should consider for dividend payouts.



Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) – 1.77% dividend yield at $3.20 annual payout per share



Year-to-date, this chipmaker and holder of many licensed tech patents significantly outperformed AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) at 30% vs. 9.50% returns, respectively. While AMD started slipping in early March, QCOM stock gained 20% value in the last three months. 



At the present price level of $180.54, QCOM shares are 44% above the 52-week low of $101.47 per share. Qualcomm dominates the global smartphone application processor (AP) shipments even more so than Apple. As of Q4 2023, the company holds a 23% share, behind MediaTek’s 36% and ahead of Apple’s 20% share, per Counterpoint Research.



In the second half of 2024, Qualcomm is set to launch new Snapdragon 8S Gen3 and 7 Plus Gen 3 mobile platforms, harnessing AI power to the flagship smartphone sector. For Q2 2024, the company reported strong earnings. Net income increased 14% year-over-year with notable automotive division revenue growth of 35% to $603 million. 



Compared to net cash from operations of $4.5 billion in 2023, Qualcomm increased it to $6.5 billion. For Q3 FY24, the company set an outlook revenue of $8.8 – $9.6 billion range, from Q2’s $9.4 billion. Accordingly, Nasdaq’s forecast sees a modest average price target of $187.05 vs the current $180.54 per share.





Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) – 0.42% dividend yield at $2 annual payout per share



Declared the winner of Magnificent Seven earnings in February, Meta announced its first-ever quarterly dividend in Q4 2023 earnings, to be paid on March 26th, 2024. Like Apple, Meta used a dual approach to boosting shareholder returns, authorizing $50 billion worth of stock buybacks.



Year-to-date, META stock is up 36%. From its 52-week low of $235.33, its price is now $475.42. Mark Zuckerberg spread his company across multiple pies, effectively dominating the VR/AR sector with Oculus Quest headsets, while Meta’s metaverse division Reality Labs is yet to produce profits.



Nonetheless, Meta’s deep pockets from online advertising across social media platforms, significantly boosted with AI tools, give the company ample space for R&D to continue as a metaverse stock. For Q1 2024, Meta reported 27% year-over-year revenue growth to $36.4 billion, delivering a 117% increase in net income of $12.3 billion.



In other words, Meta occupies many attractive niches for investors—blue chip, growth tech, metaverse, and now dividend stock with generous stock buybacks to boot. Nasdaq’s average price target for META is $522.49 vs. the current $475.42 per share.







Salesforce (NASDAQ: CRM) – 0.58% dividend yield at $1.60 annual payout per share



Salesforce cornered the market on cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) with an estimated 26.47% market share. For comparison, all other CRM platforms have under 6% shares, including Microsoft Dynamics CRM, which has 4.29%. 



These services are typically subscription-based, giving Salesforce a stable and predictable revenue stream. The company announced its first-ever dividend in February, with the payment date on April 11th, at a quarterly cash of $0.40 per share.



In February, Salesforce released its Q4 2024 (fiscal) earnings, showing 11% year-over-year revenue growth to $9.29 billion and full-year net income of $4.1 billion vs. $208 million the year prior. In addition to the new dividend inflow, Salesforce authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program, having returned $11.7 billion to shareholders since inception.



For full-year FY25 guidance, Salesforce gave 8% – 9% year-over-year revenue growth up to $38 billion. Year-to-date, CRM stock gained 7.4% value. Nasdaq’s average price target for CRM shares is now $339.32 vs the current $275.30 per share.

JUST IN: Wells Fargo, the Third Largest Bank in the US, Makes a Giant Bitcoin Push - Bitcoin Sistemi


Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the United States, disclosed its investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The bank's investment portfolio now includes Grayscale's spot BTC ETF, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy futures ETF and Bitcoin Depot Inc. has shares.


Spot BTC ETFs have gained popularity among institutional investors as they provide exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without the need for direct ownership of the asset. This makes them a more regulated and safer investment vehicle for Bitcoin (BTC).

This development comes alongside a widespread trend towards institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Many major banks and financial institutions are exploring ways to include Bitcoin in their offerings and gain exposure to the asset.





Earlier this week, Susquehanna International Group, a global trading and technology firm, disclosed in an SEC filing that it holds $1.8 billion in spot BTC and other Bitcoin ETFs.
BTC Spot ETFs were launched on January 10 and have been on the agenda of the cryptocurrency market since then.

Bitcoin To $1.3M By 2028? Questionable, Says 10x Research - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD bulls hoping for a seven-figure price by 2028 may be disappointed, according to a new report by 10x Research. What Happened: The report, authored by Markus Thielen, questions the validity of the Stock-to-Flow (STF) model in predicting future Bitcoin prices.“The STF model predicted a price of $110,793 for Bitcoin in the last cycle, which clearly didn’t happen,” Thielen states in the report. “This casts doubt on its ability to accurately forecast future prices, particularly the ambitious $1.3 million projection for the current cycle.”STF Model Under ScrutinyThe STF model, often used by Bitcoin proponents, compares the current supply of an asset to its annual production rate.A higher ratio suggests greater scarcity, leading to a higher price. However, Thielen argues that the model doesn’t account for human behavior and changing market dynamics.“The model assumes that higher prices will not incentivize increased production,” Thielen explains. “While this might hold true for gold, Bitcoin mining can be readily adjusted based on profitability.”Diminishing Returns And Cycle AnalysisThe report also highlights a potential weakening in Bitcoin’s historical cycle pattern. 10x Research observed a diminishing upside projection in each cycle, suggesting a potential limit to future growth.“The low to high from the 2011 to 2013 cycle was a staggering 560x,” Thielen notes. “Following a pattern of dividing each cycle by roughly 5, our analysis projected a high of $70,000 for the current cycle, which aligns well with what we’ve seen so far.”Also Read: Digital Currency Group Sees Revenue Rise Despite Grayscale StrugglesFocus on Trading The CyclesWhile questioning the $1.3 million target, 10x Research emphasizes the importance of understanding cyclical trends.“Bitcoin has historically experienced significant price drops between bull cycles,” Thielen states. “Investors should consider trading these cycles rather than simply holding (HODLing) their assets.”The Road Ahead: Consolidation And Potential RallyThe report predicts a potential consolidation period for Bitcoin in the near future, with prices settling around $52,000-$55,000. However, they see an opportunity for a rally later in the year.“Market excitement surrounding a potential Trump win in the upcoming US election could drive Bitcoin back to $70,000 or higher,” Thielen suggests. “A volatile market environment presents the best opportunity for investors to leverage our insights.”Looking Ahead: Benzinga’s Future Of Digital AssetsThe future of Bitcoin price predictions and market behavior will undoubtedly be a hot topic at upcoming industry events. Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference, happening on Nov. 19, is one such platform where leading analysts and investors will gather to discuss the latest trends and strategies.Read Next: SEC Accusations Misworded?

Crypto And Politics: Cardano Founder Says Don’t Vote This Presidential Candidate | Bitcoinist.com


								With the US presidential elections fast-approaching, industries such as cryptocurrency have been drawn into the discussion as to what it could mean for their future. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has also shared his insights on the elections, particularly on the candidates, about what a victory for each candidate would mean for the crypto industry and its future.
Cardano Founder Does Not Want President Joe Biden
President Joe Biden is currently running for a second term after emerging victorious in the 2020 presidential elections. However, this time around, the 46th president of the United States is not seeing as much support as he did back then.

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson points out the fact that the Biden administration has been particularly bad for the crypto industry. In a broadcast on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, he revealed his disapproval of how the Biden administration has approached the crypto industry, accusing the president of trying to hurt the industry with every chance he got.
Given this, the Cardano founder is vehemently against President Joe Biden taking office for a second term. According to Hoskinson, “A vote for Biden is a vote against the American cryptocurrency industry.”Hoskinson’s comments come in light of the White House releasing a statement that said the incumbent president plans to disapprove legislation that would allow the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prevent banks from holding crypto. But it seems this has come a little too late for crypto stakeholders.
While the Cardano founder does not outright endorse Former President Donald Trump, Biden’s fiercest rival, he does admit that things were much better for crypto under his administration.” The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry,” Hoskinson said. “The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto.”
Donald Trump Goes To Bat For Crypto
While President Joe Biden continues to skirt around the issue of laying out support for crypto, opposition Donald Trump has been guns out with his support for crypto. Earlier this week, Trump declared his support of the crypto industry. The former president has called on all crypto supporters to vote for him, saying, “If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.”

Interestingly, Trump’s support for the crypto industry did not just begin. The presidential candidate has been involved in the industry for a number of years now, even launching multiple non-fungible tokens (NFTs) collections called the “Trump Digital Trading Cards.”
These NFT collections were well-received by crypto investors, generating over 15,000 ETH in volume from OpenSea alone, with almost 14,000 unique holders. Donald Trump also holds a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) as well as other altcoins sent to his wallet by the community.

Exclusive: PlayShutdown CEO Talks on Q4 Launch, $FUSE Token Airdrop, and Game Design | Cryptopolitan

PlayShutdown is one of those games set in the “dystopian universe” theme but brings a whole new visual style to the popular gaming trope. At its core, Shutdown is an action-packed ARPG shooter built on the impressive Unreal Engine 5. But with its unique blend of features comes a wave of questions.In this interview, we got Houston Song, CEO of PlayShutdown, to answer some questions about the game and lift the lid on the game’s design choices, full release date, and potential airdrop of its upcoming $FUSE token. Hello Houston. I read you are an early investor in DOGE and ETH and have been in gaming for 8 years. How did it all start, and is Shutdown your first gaming project? Yes, Doge was actually my first crypto that I bought back in 2014. Back then, it was the meme of the year and it had just launched. I actually found it on Reddit where people were just trading it through threads.I switched over to Ethereum in 2015 because it was a more serious project, and I believed that the vision of having a programmable blockchain made sense.Playshutdown CEO, Houston SongI met my game developer and co-founder, Adam, in 2018, when we discussed gaming and crypto. We decided to combine the two, and that’s how the studio started.Our first title was actually a pretty ambitious FPS called Dissolution, but unfortunately, the technology at the time (Ethereum) didn’t have the scalability we needed.The project Shutdown started in 2022, once we already had a fair bit of experience working together on games.Can you walk us through the core gameplay loop in Shutdown? How will players spend most of their time, and what keeps them engaged?This game is an action role-playing game (ARPG) similar to Diablo or Path of Exile. Players aim to craft unique “builds” by combining items to achieve varying levels of power. The game concentrates on player versus environment (PvE) gameplay and a complex item economy. With random number generator (RnG) elements, the game introduces Web2 players to Web3 concepts in an engaging and accessible way.All of the items (weapons, armor, accessories, & equipment) in ShutDown start off as database items like in any other game. The player can upgrade them by using other items or components. Once these items get to the endgame, players are given the option to mint them as NFTs. In the process of minting them on-chain, they’re granted unique traits and abilities that can be combined with other items in the build to create some pretty badass combinations, which players will need to beat later stages in the game that are quite difficult.It’s this process of figuring out the best build for your character and growing stronger that makes ShutDown exciting and fun to play. Some might argue that the “dystopian universe” and “AI” themes are overused tropes in gaming. How would you counter that?It’s all about execution.Shutdown brings a unique visual style to the trope that sets us apart. I think the most important thing is gameplay – we’re all gun enthusiasts in our office, so we’ve spent quite a bit of time making sure the guns feel unique and satisfying to use.We’ve got a very talented team of folks that work on Shutdown – our Art director, Wesley, is a living encyclopedia when it comes to sci-fi games and movies, with work experience in Netease and Ubisoft.We’re also working with a super talented concept artist, Frank Yang, who helped lead the design direction on some big sci-fi IPs like the TV show “The Expanse.”Shutdown is built with Unreal Engine. Can you elaborate on the game design and qualities that players may find interesting? We wanted to make the combat feel super smooth, with impactful gunplay that makes you feel satisfied every time you pull the trigger. We wanted to give the Mongrel (the main character) the feeling of being a badass super soldier who can fight through hordes of enemies.Shutdown is big on customization, so you can tailor your abilities and build to fit any playstyle you want. This flexibility keeps the gameplay fresh each time you approach the game. One of the things that keeps the game interesting is the RNG elements, which means every game session will feel different. This can range from how enemies spawn to the type of loot that you might find.We take advantage of Unreal Engine’s support for Physically-Based Rendering, which makes the characters and world come to life with super realistic lighting and textures. Visually, we wanted to present a gruesome dystopian sci-fi world that is a departure from the vibrant IPs that are more common in Play-to-Earn games.Don’t you think the cross-play between platforms will give PC players with better hardware an inherent advantage over mobile users?Yes, PC players will have a slight advantage over mobile users. We’ve done our best to mitigate this by simplifying the controls. It is not a PvP-focused game, so I think it will still enhance the player experience, as PC players will be able to play with their friends who don’t have gaming rigs.It is a strategic decision we made at the start of development to reduce the barrier to entry for players who can play Shutdown. The AI threat in the game is very difficult, so you’ll want to have a couple of battle buddies to help you complete missions.Shutdown launched open-beta in Q1 2024 with 3,700+ weekly active users. Which regions or player types stand out the most from your user base?We were surprised by how many players there were in LATAM. That region is definitely going to be the next big wave of adoption in both web2 and web3 games.There was also a surprising number of competitive players, indicating that we have plenty of room to increase the game’s difficulty.When do you anticipate a full release of the game?We’re aiming for a public release in Q4 2024. The game is seasonal, so we plan to have content refreshes every 3-4 months. The mobile version of the game will launch in Q2 of 2025.The native token $FUSE is set to launch on major exchanges in early Q3 2024. Can you tell us more about the $FUSE launch? Will there be an airdrop for early users? I can’t reveal too many details about the $FUSE launch other than that it will be huge!There will be an airdrop for players who hold our NFTs and have posted scores. That’s all I can say!How does the web3 aspect integrate with gameplay?In the game “Shutdown,” Web3 integration plays a crucial role by enhancing gameplay and providing unique value through two main elements: Tokens and NFTs.Tokens as Premium Currency:Tokens in “Shutdown” serve as a premium currency. This means they’re used for special transactions within the game, such as purchasing exclusive items, accessing unique game areas, or upgrading characters and equipment. This premium status of tokens often encourages players to engage more deeply with the game to earn or acquire these tokens, driving both the gameplay and economic aspects of the game.NFTs as End-Game Items:NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are used to represent the most powerful items in the game, essentially the end-game loot. These items are not just valuable because of their rarity or power within the game but also because they can be traded or sold outside the game, potentially for real-world value. This aspect adds a layer of investment and strategy to playing the game as players aim to acquire, use, and potentially profit from these high-value items.Minting NFTs:The process of minting NFTs in “Shutdown” is gamified, making it an engaging part of the gameplay rather than just a transaction. When players mint an NFT, the stats and abilities of the item are generated randomly. This introduces elements of surprise and chance, which can be thrilling for players. Each NFT item is unique, enhancing its value and the personal connection players might feel toward their in-game assets.By integrating these Web3 elements, “Shutdown” offers a gaming experience where the digital assets players earn or create have real value, both within and potentially outside the game world, adding layers of strategy, investment, and engagement to the traditional gaming experience.The P2E market has seen boom-and-bust cycles. How is Shutdown any different?Just like any Play-to-Earn game out there, “Shutdown” rides the same rollercoaster of market ups and downs and changes in player interest, especially in the short term.At its heart, “Shutdown” is built for folks who are into traditional gaming. We’ve borrowed the best parts of classic web2 games—the kind of stuff that keeps players hooked. By focusing on these proven gameplay elements, we’re really aiming for the long haul, not just a flash in the pan. This strategy helps us smooth out the wild swings that can happen in the P2E market by keeping our eyes on solid game mechanics rather than just the hype around the game’s tokens.When it comes to developing “Shutdown,” we’re sticking to the playbook of tried-and-true gaming business tactics. That means strong development processes, smart ways to bring in new players, and ways to make money that keep the lights on for the long term. All this stuff is key to keeping the game stable and growing even when the P2E scene gets shaky.The real kicker is how we’ve integrated the game’s token right into the gameplay. It’s not just there for show; players actually need it to get ahead in the game, making it a crucial part of the whole experience. This setup means the token isn’t just something to trade—it’s something that adds real value to the game, which keeps players coming back. By making sure the token is something players really want and can use, we’re building a game that stands on its own, powered by real demand from real gameplay.What is the long-term vision for Playshutdown?The long-term vision for Playshutdown is to develop it into a comprehensive IP or universe, where we plan to release a variety of games across different genres and platforms. This strategic expansion includes the development of an FPS game that is currently underway.A key component of our vision involves the integration of tokens and NFTs, which will serve a pivotal role across all titles within the Shutdown ecosystem. These digital assets are designed to have cross-game utility, allowing players to leverage their investments and interactions in one game across others within the Shutdown portfolio. This approach not only enhances the user experience by adding value and continuity to their interactions but also fosters a more interconnected and dynamic gaming environment under the Shutdown brand.Last question. What’s your outlook for Web3 gaming in the next five years?In the next five years, Web3 gaming is probably going to shake things up quite a bit. We’re looking at two main types of games emerging: ones that double down on the whole Play-to-Earn (P2E) thing and others that aim to make it easier for regular gamers to get into Web3 stuff.“Shutdown” is ahead of the game here, already figuring out how to blend traditional gaming with Web3 to attract players from the Web2 world. This approach is not just about using cool new tech but making it super smooth for players to jump in.Also, there’s going to be a big push to get new players from places like Latin America and Africa. These regions are like hidden gems, loaded with potential gamers who haven’t been tapped into much yet.As these new markets open up, making games that everyone can actually play—no matter where they are or what tech they have—will be key. This could really change the kind of games that are made in the future.Lastly, the money side of P2E games is going to get more attention from regulators, especially in places like South Korea, where they are on top of their game with tech laws. As the blend of gaming and finance gets tighter, we’ll probably see more rules coming in to keep things fair and safe.

Crypto Expert Reveals How To Find 'High-Risk High Reward' Meme Coins - Benzinga

Pseudonymous crypto researcher CryptoKoryo, in his latest YouTube video, offered valuable insights and strategies for traders looking to trade meme coins.What Happened: The researcher highlights the potential of meme coins with stories of individuals turning $1,000 into a million dollars within a month. However, the reality is often different with many traders buying a meme coin thinking they are early but they land up at zero.He cited the real example of someone who bought $600 worth of Pepe on the first day it was tradable, sold the same day for a $60 profit, but could have made $9 million if they had held on.He recommends having a combination of two approaches for playing the game well:
Meme coins tend to perform best during specific periods, such as Q1 2024 and Q2 2023.



Studying parabolic moves and adoption waves, as meme coins often experience explosive growth followed by steep corrections.
He breaks down the adoption waves of meme coins into three distinct phases:
Wave one: Riskiest but offers the highest potential rewards, early buyers positioned to make substantial gains. (Examples: Popcat, Grok, BOME)



Wave two: More challenging, as traders must determine whether a meme coin will continue its upward trajectory or fade away. (Examples: Dogwifhat (CRYPTO: WIF), Pepe PEPE/USD, Bonk BONK/USD)



Wave three: Least risky, as the meme coin is already established. Potential returns are lower compared to earlier waves. (Examples: Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), Shiba Inu SHIB/USD)
He cautions investors/traders of influencers and "shillers" who may have their agendas, but not to ignore them entirely, as they can provide valuable information.Also Read: DOGE Is The ‘BTC Of Memes’ And These Two Meme Coins Are The ETH And A ‘Must Have,’ Trader ToutsWhy It Matters: CryptoKoryo notes that trading meme coins requires discipline, patience and a long-term perspective. "Don’t try to become rich overnight," he advises. "Try to focus on longevity as a trader and just becoming a bit better every time with every coin trade."In his meme coin narrative X post, the expert highlighted that the number of meme coins is too high and rising at a rapid pace, increasing supply, unlike in 2021 when demand exceeded supply.He notes two strategies: a fully on-chain approach wherein risk/reward is great but the win rate is low. Alternatively, waiting for a narrative to take over Crypto Twitter, thus increasing the win rate but giving up some of the risk/reward ratio.Kroyo opts for a combination of both approaches, as few of the thousand meme coins will be profitable. Compared to meme coins in 2021, Koryo thinks “It’s more like high-risk low-reward for most."What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: VanEck Meme Coin Index With DOGE And SHIB Would ‘Outperform 99% Of People If You Left It Alone,’ Says TraderThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

                        Hip Hop is back with a bang in 2024, as industry legends Kendrick Lamar and Drake duke it out for the crown in an increasingly hostile rap battle – and Solana meme coin markets haven’t missed a beat, with new OVHoe (BBL DRIZZY) token skyrocketing.This article will provide an analysis of BBL DRIZZY’s current price trends in the Solana meme coin market and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, DOGEVERSE, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time.BBL DRIZZY undertook an exceptional rally as retail investors flocked to the meme value surrounding Drake’s tumultuous exchange with Kendrick – which has so far seen Drizzy branded as a sexual predator, ‘deadbeat’ Dad, master manipulator, and target for physical shootings.BBL DRIZZY Price Analysis: As OVHOE Consolidates For Second Rally Leg – Is This Other Token Next to Pump?
As price action attempts to consolidate down at lower support, BBL DRIZZY is currently trading at a market price of $0.000709 (representing a 24-hour change of -31%).This comes after OVHOE undertook an exceptional Solana meme coin launch at 20:00 UTC on May 9, in a listing that gained instant traction with the price exploding a whopping +13,500% in the first 4 hours.Hitting an all-time high at $0.0034, the following hours have seen a major retracement move grip the chart – with price action so far down -78%.However, with consolidation now risking a second re-test of lower support at $0.0074, OVHOE is in a make-or-break position which could see the token sink-or-swim.Yet, there remain tangible reasons to be optimistic about BBL DRIZZY price action, with OVHOE’s market cap still alluring retail investors enamored by the Kendrick Lamar – Drake beef at $70k.Indeed, despite not being officially affiliated with the duo, there is potential that the release of further diss tracks could lead to bullish action returning to the coin.Although, as ever with meme coins, that is pure speculation.Meanwhile, an emerging crypto presale has unlocked viral success, having raised over $13M in a matter of weeks and there is still time to get involvedDiscover DOGEVERSE: Could Presales Offer Better Meme Coin Play?
While SOL presents a market-leading opportunity, the most significant gains are often found in presale investments, which allow investors to get in early and potentially secure the majority of a project’s growth. Just imagine investing in BBL DRIZZY before it hit the market and skyrocketed 30,000%.One such opportunity in the SOL ecosystem is the DOGEVERSE presale – which has unlocked viral success over the last month to hit $13M raised in the ongoing presale.Aiming to be the first multi-chain incarnation of DOGE, DOGEVERSE is positioned to grow rapidly as market participants race to grab a piece of the pie.DOGEVERSE is still raising funds at the presale stage and will start preparing for exchange listings very soon.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

Consolation Payment to the Victim Who Sent 71 Million Dollars of Bitcoin (BTC) to the Hacker with His Own Hands! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The most talked about hacking incident of recent times took place last week. In this incident, an investor was attacked by a hacker while trying to send Bitcoin to his own address, and he sent WBTC worth $71 million to the hacker with his own hands.
As a week passed after the hack, the hacker relented and made a consolation payment to the person whose WBTC he stole.


According to Lookonchain's post, the hacker made a refund and has returned a total of 4,676 Ethereum-ETH (worth $14.2 million) piece by piece so far.
https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1788857898086637909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1788857898086637909%7Ctwgr%5Ed0d14b65b3594b595aa2eaf 5f7f7c0dcd7dd5f18%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fu.today%2Fhacker-makes- rare-move-to-refund-stolen-71-million-in-crypto





What Happened?
One person lost 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), worth over $71 million, due to a phishing attack known as 'address poisoning'.
This person initially sent 0.05 ETH to an account he created. This person, who had no problems with this transaction, later sent WBTC worth 71 million. However, he sent it to the address created by the hacker, not to his own wallet.


Because when this person sent ETH for trial purposes, his address became visible in the transaction history. The hacker who followed this person created a similar address by making the letters at the beginning and end the same.
This person, who fell into the hacker's trap, sent all his WBTC to an address very similar to his own.





If this person had fully checked the entire address, perhaps they would not have lost their Bitcoins.

Donald Trump's Crypto Endorsement Lauded By Industry Figures Who Vow To 'Support President Trump' - Benzinga

Former U.S. President Donald Trump‘s recent endorsement of cryptocurrency has received a wave of support from prominent figures within the crypto community, signaling a significant shift in the political discourse surrounding digital assets.What Happened: During an event at Mar-a-Lago, Trump addressed enthusiasts and buyers of his NFT collection, underscoring his support for the industry and contrasting his stance with President Joe Biden's perceived cautious approach.Ryan Selkis, Founder and CEO of Messari, expressed his unexpected support online after sharing the stage with Trump, tweeting, "President Trump spoke very highly about crypto and then…invited me and @MihailoBjelic on stage to say a few words. Fight for crypto. Support President Trump."This public affirmation from Selkis highlighted the importance of Trump's backing in the crypto community’s ongoing battle for recognition and regulation.Adding to the conversation, a crypto trader known as Satoshi Flipper claimed that the entire American crypto community’s backing could spell trouble for Biden and the Democrats, asserting that their alienation of crypto supporters might cost them dearly in the upcoming elections. Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of Lumida Wealth, further emphasized the potential for digital assets to feature prominently in national debates, suggesting a shift towards more substantive political engagement with cryptocurrency.Also Read: Digital Currency Group Sees Revenue Rise Despite Grayscale StrugglesThe dialogue around Trump's endorsement was further fueled by a tweet from Autism Capital, who credited Vivek Ramaswamy with influencing Trump's positive stance on crypto. The tweet argued that supporting Trump could be seen as a moral responsibility for those in the crypto industry, emphasizing the entertainment and potential benefits of his approach to crypto regulation.Trump’s endorsement came during an event celebrating his “Mugshot Edition” NFTs, where he proudly claimed, “We made NFTs hot again,” and criticized the current administration’s handling of the crypto industry. His remarks underscored a significant pivot from his previous criticisms of Bitcoin and digital assets, marking a notable change in his views on the economic potential of cryptocurrencies.This enthusiastic response from the crypto community underlines the growing significance of digital assets in political campaigns and the broader conversation on economic innovation. What’s Next: As the debate continues, Benzinga's upcoming Future of Digital Assets event is set to be a crucial forum for discussing the evolving relationship between cryptocurrency and mainstream politics, further highlighting the impact of Trump's new stance on the future political landscape.Read Next: SEC Accusations Misworded?

Bullish divergence: Crypto market with potential reversal ahead


The cryptocurrency market is heating up after nearly two months of a downtrend as bullish divergences surge as signals of a possible reversal. Finbold has gathered data on May 10, identifying these signals to help crypto investors navigate these times.
Notably, TradingView‘s total crypto market cap index is now valued at $2.19 trillion, testing a short-term uptrend support. Since April 12, the index has traded below the 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA), creating resistance at $2.285 trillion. A breakout from this level could propel the market to this year’s highs at $2.72 trillion.
Moreover, its downtrend has been since March 14 but could soon be challenged by growing momentum. The daily relative strength index (RSI) signals this possible reversal by breaking out from its downtrend in a bullish divergence.

Bullish divergence: Retail stops buying, whales accumulate
Looking at social indicators on Santiment, the social volume and dominance of the word “buy” have dropped to yearly lows. Under the proper conditions, this momentary lack of interest is usually associated with bottom formations.

Santiment‘s leading analyst, Brian Q, has reached a similar conclusion regarding the crowd’s “buy the dip” chants.

Additionally, another bullish divergence lies in Bitcoin’s (BTC) significant drop in social volume, while the leading cryptocurrency’s whales hold record percentages of the supply. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $60,550, testing key support at a solid range low.

From a world’s regulatory perspective, optimism is surging in India as it reopened its doors to offshore cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Kucoin. Conversely, a regulatory crackdown in the United States has led to the withdrawal of popular Bitcoin wallets.
Despite the aforementioned signals, cryptocurrencies remain a highly volatile asset class. Thus, investors must remain cautious while navigating these turbulent waters, looking ahead for fundamental demand and capital inflow as organic signals for long-term price appreciation and sustainability.

Price analysis 5/10: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, TON, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, SHIB

Bitcoin (BTC) continues searching for direction as the bears and the bulls battle it out for supremacy. Glassnode founders Jan Happel and Yana Allemann believe the price will resolve to the upside. They said in a X post that they expect Bitcoin to “BLOW higher.” The uncertainty about the next directional move has not stopped purchases by the whales. Market intelligence firm Santiment said in a X post that whale wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin acquired roughly $941 million worth of Bitcoin in a 24-hour period.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Bitcoin’s long-term investors do not seem to be worried about the range-bound price action in the near term. In a recent interview with journalist Mike Solana, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey said that Bitcoin could skyrocket to at least $1 million by 2030 and even surpass the level from that point onward.Could buyers continue to defend the support levels in Bitcoin and altcoins, or will the bears prevail? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin bulls are trying to keep the price above the psychological support at $60,000 but are facing selling at the 20-day exponential moving average ($62,959).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory suggest that the bears have the upper hand. If the $59,650 support cracks, the BTC/USDT pair may plummet to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298.This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 50-day simple moving average ($65,620). The pair could then accelerate toward the critical overhead resistance of $73,777.Ether price analysisEther (ETH) has been trading between the 20-day EMA ($3,087) and the horizontal support at $2,850 for several days.ETH/USDT daily chart.

The ETH/USDT pair may collapse to the channel’s support line.The zone between the 20-day EMA and the resistance line is likely to act as a critical resistance. Buyers will have to shove the price above this zone to suggest a potential trend change. The pair may climb to $3,350.BNB price analysisBNB (BNB) rebounded off the moving averages on May 8, but the move lacked momentum, indicating hesitation to continue buying at higher levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf buyers propel the price above the downtrend line, it will increase the likelihood of a rally to the overhead resistance of $635. This is an important level to watch out for because a break above it could open the doors for a rally to $692.Meanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to tug the price below the moving averages. If they do that, the BNB/USDT pair may slump to $536 and then to the solid support at $495.Solana price analysisSolana (SOL) fell below the 20-day EMA ($146) on May 8, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewSolid buying by the bulls pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA on May 9, but the SOL/USDT pair could not reach the $162 resistance. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.If the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $162, it will suggest that the bulls are back in the game. The pair may rise to $185 and later to $205. The critical support zone to watch on the downside is between $126 and $116.XRP price analysisXRP (XRP) has been trading between $0.46 and $0.57 for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe price slipped below the 20-day EMA ($0.52) on May 7, indicating that the bears are trying to take charge.

A strong bounce off $0.46 could extend the stay inside the range for a while longer.The bulls will have to push and maintain the price above $0.57 to suggest that the correction could be coming to an end.Toncoin price analysisToncoin (TON) rebounded off the moving averages on May 8 and cleared the hurdle at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $6.49 on May 10, signaling that the correction may be over.TON/USDT daily chart.

The TON/USDT pair will attempt a rally to $7.67.Conversely, if the price turns down sharply from the current level or the overhead resistance at $7.67, it will suggest that bears remain active at higher levels. That could result in the formation of a range between $4.72 and $7.67.Dogecoin price analysisThe bulls are trying to prevent Dogecoin (DOGE) from retesting the neckline of the large head-and-shoulders pattern.DOGE/USDT daily chart.

This is an essential level for the bears to defend because a break above it could start a rally to $0.21.Instead, if the price turns down from the current level or the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the DOGE/USDT pair may spend some more time inside the range. The trend is likely to turn bearish if the price skids below $0.12.Related: Telegram-linked Toncoin soars 50% in May for these 3 reasonsCardano price analysisCardano (ADA) remains stuck between the 20-day EMA ($0.47) and the support line, indicating uncertainty among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.ADA/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingViewIt is difficult to predict the direction of breakout from a triangle with certainty. Hence, it is better to wait for the price to escape the triangle before taking a directional view. If the price plunges below the triangle, it will signal that the bears have overpowered the bulls. The SHIB/USDT pair may then descend to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000017.On the contrary, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest buying at lower levels. The pair may rally to the resistance line of the triangle.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

‘This One Is Going To Be a Banger’: Low-Cap Altcoin Flashing Bullish Signal, According to Top Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is turning bullish on a decentralized wireless network project.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 258,700 followers on the social media platform X that key indicators suggest Helium (HNT) is about to have a massive breakout.










Bluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory in his analysis, which attempts to forecast price movements based on crowd psychology that is manifested in waves. The Elliott Wave theory suggests that price impulses happen in five waves after three-wave “ABC” corrections.
“Since original post we did a nice five wave rise from the lows and now a clear three wave ABC right into the 0.618 [Fibonacci retracement level] here with a strong reaction from it. This one is going to be a banger in my opinion, liking the structure a lot while $3.40 holds.”
Source: Bluntz/X
Helium is trading for $4.63 at time of writing, up slightly in the past 24 hours.
Next up, the analyst thinks that Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of breaking out to new all-time highs (ATHs).
“BTC likely going to be a solid engulfing on the daily close [May 9th]. Looking like the next push up into ATHs has started in my opinion.”
Source: Bluntz/X
Looking at his chart, he suggests that Bitcoin is on the verge of breaking out of a falling wedge pattern and could soar to $84,000.
Bitcoin is trading for $60,829 at time of writing, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the analyst suggests that smart contract platform NEAR Protocol (NEAR) will soar to $11, a nearly 50% gain from the current value.
“NEAR still one of my favorite picks at the moment and one of strongest uptrends of top 20 coins since the April capitulation lows.”
Source: Bluntz/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests NEAR is printing a bullish pattern of higher low prices.
NEAR is trading for $7.34 at time of writing, up 1.6% in the last 24 hours.

SHIB Burns Shoot Up 5,803% After Cryptic Whale’s Contribution - DailyCoin


        
Daily burns skyrocketed by 5,803% after an anonymous whale burned 24M SHIB.



Shiba Inu (SHIB) entered a new support cluster around $0.000023 this Friday.



A $7 million gap between latest bids and sales puts extra pressure on SHIB.
The Shiba Inu community, popularly known as SHIB Army, was taken by surprise this Friday, witnessing a massive 5,803% surge in daily SHIB burns. According to the blockchain’s burning records, one particular transaction stands out from the crowd with a colossal 24,176,493 SHIB tokens blazed at once.
Converting to $565 at stamped transaction time, the transfer raised eyebrows among SHIB community members, who have been patiently waiting for Shiba Inu’s auto-burning mechanism on Shibarium Layer-2. Besides the hefty transaction, SHIB community members have burnt 26,430,838 SHIB coins over the past 24 hours.Moreover, the abnormally huge increase in Shiba Inu burning falls in line with SHIB’s price movement, as the popular canine coin recouped 4% of the gains lost during the week. The altruistic SHIB burn deed has pushed SHIB above the $0.000023 support levels, marking $0.000025 as the next target for the canine crypto.Good Samaritan’s Wallet Unveils Huge SHIB StashUpon further investigation by DailyCoin, the linked crypto wallet to the 26M SHIB burn transfer still holds a whopping 166,893,009,838.85 SHIB tokens, worth $3,903,591 as of press time. Moreover, Shiba Inu is the largest meme currency held in the wallet, according to Nansen’s crypto portfolio tracker.While 46% of the whale’s crypto wallet consists of USD Coin (USDC), it’s fair to say that the burning deed and the bullish price movement that followed for Shiba Inu has significantly boosted the percentage of custodians making a profit at this price range. With 59% of holders in the money, the range between $0.000023 to $0.000025 presents SHIB with a 13.36T support cluster, spread across 45.59K crypto addresses.Cumulatively, Shiba Inu’s sales over the past 24 hours have outweighed the SHIB bids by $7 million, signaling additional selling pressure in this range. While the 24-hour SHIB asks have risen by 9%, purchases have dropped by 5.6% during the same time period. As of press time, the #12-seated Shiba Inu (SHIB) is exchanging hands at $0.00002338, according to CoinGecko.On the Flipside
Shibarium L2 underwent a hard fork earlier this month, with SHIB army members expecting to see an auto-burning mechanism built into the Layer-2 chain.



While the auto-burning system is still being tested, SHIB Army members on social media argue that manually burning SHIB won’t have a stable effect on price.
Why This MattersShiba Inu’s community has been gradually growing throughout the years. Reducing SHIB’s huge supply via community burns has bore fruit in several pumps in the past.

World's Central Banks Buy $24,000,000,000 in Gold in Three Months, Setting New Record: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Central banks are in the midst of a gold buying spree, according to new numbers from the World Gold Council (WGC).
The organization says central banks added $24 billion of gold, weighing 290 tonnes, to their coffers in the first quarter of this year.










That’s the strongest level of net demand for any quarter on record, using data that dates back to the year 2000.
The WGC says China, Turkey, India and Kazakhstan are driving much of the demand for the precious metal.
“Many have attributed central banks’ ongoing voracious appetite for gold as a key driver of its recent performance in the face of seemingly challenging conditions: namely, higher yields and US dollar strength. And despite the high bar set in the last two years, the voracious buying has continued into 2024 in the face of the renewed gold price rally…
Not only is the long-standing trend in central bank gold buying firmly intact, it also continues to be dominated by banks from emerging markets. Ten central banks reported increased gold reserves (of a tonne or more) during Q1, all of whom have been active over recent quarters.

The WGC says the previous quarterly record for net demand was set in Q4 of last year, weighing in at 286 tonnes.
The group says more data is needed to determine whether gold’s recent rise in price will have an impact on central bank purchases moving forward.
“While the recent price rally may have impacted trade execution, for those central banks that manage their gold reserves more actively, we do not expect it will derail any strategic gold accumulation plans they may have.”
Gold has moved from around $2,000 at the start of this year to $2,347 at time of publishing.

Bitcoin Price Is Again Dictated By Fed Policy: Analyst - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsNow that Bitcoin ETF hype has died off, the price trajectory of the leading crypto asset is back in the hands of the Federal Reserve, a new analysis suggests.In a Friday report, European digital asset manager CoinShares said Bitcoin’s price movements again appear driven by the broader interest rate conversation.“A closer examination of the last 40 trading days reveals an increased alignment with the interest rate expectations for June,” wrote CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill. “A similar trend was observed in 2023.”According to CME Fedwatch, the market appears certain that interest rates will stay flat in June, only potentially dropping in Q4 of this year.Core PCE inflation—the Fed’s preferred inflation metric that excludes food and fuel—has proven much more sticky than expected over the last several months, remaining flat at 2.8% in March. Conversely, GDP growth figures have proven underwhelming, recording 1.6% in Q1 2024, as compared to 3.4% in the prior quarter.Data also shows that growth in the manufacturing and services sectors are contracting and stalling respectively.Such metrics fuel fears of stagflation, raising expectations that the central bank will keep rates higher for longer. In response, CoinShares explains, Bitcoin’s price fell below $57,000 leading into the Fed's next meeting on May 1.While the central bank maintained its policy rate above 5.25%, however, it also announced a “dovish surprise” with plans to taper its quantitative tightening (QT). This would mean reducing its balance sheet by $25 billion per month, rather than its prior $60 billion rate, slowing the rate at which it contracts the economy’s dollar supply.Theoretically, that’s good for Bitcoin and other risk assets, which have previously thrived in easy-money macro environments. Bitcoin’s price recovered above $60,000 shortly after the Fed’s announcement.“Keeping front-end rates elevated while simultaneously tapering QT can be likened to both applying the brakes to a car and accelerating at the same time,” Butterfill wrote. The U.S. Treasury, he added, may be reaching its limit in paying off its short-duration debt, leaving a shift in the Fed’s QT strategy as the only remaining option.Butterfill expects the Fed to cut rates later this year in response to weaker economic data, with the cut likely being “late, but greater than expected.”“With Bitcoin’s fixed supply and high immutability, when the Fed eventually cuts rates, it is probable that this tumultuous situation will support Bitcoin prices,” he added.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Whale On The Move: $18 Million Ethereum Withdrawal Triggers DeFi Frenzy


								The Ethereum (ETH) market is buzzing with activity after a whale (an investor with significant holdings) made a splash by withdrawing a whopping $18 million worth of ETH from Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange.

This move, meticulously tracked by blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, has sent a positive vibe through the crypto community, hinting at a potential Ethereum bull run fueled by innovative DeFi (decentralized finance) strategies.
Whale Makes Waves With DeFi Power Play
The whale’s activity wasn’t just a simple withdrawal. It showcased a cunning DeFi maneuver designed to supercharge their Ethereum holdings. After acquiring a hefty 10,750 ETH on Binance, the whale converted it all to stETH, a special token representing staked Ethereum that earns interest. This stETH then became the key to unlocking even greater opportunities.


Aave To The Rescue: Borrowing To Buy More
The whale’s next move involved Aave, a popular DeFi lending platform. By depositing their stETH on Aave, the whale essentially collateralized their holdings. This allowed them to borrow a staggering $29 million worth of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar.
With this newly acquired capital, the whale went on a buying spree, scooping up even more ETH.

Total crypto market cap currently at $2.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Leveraging DeFi: A Double-Edged Sword
This strategy, known as leveraging, allows investors to amplify their gains (or losses) by using borrowed funds. In this case, the whale is essentially betting on the future price of Ethereum.
If the price goes up, they can sell their newly acquired ETH for a profit, easily repaying the loan and pocketing the difference. However, if the price dips, they risk getting liquidated – a forced sale of their assets to cover the loan.

Ethereum As A Financial Powerhouse
The recent events surrounding Ethereum transcend mere price movements. They highlight the growing importance of DeFi in the cryptocurrency landscape. Platforms like Aave are empowering investors with sophisticated financial tools, blurring the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized world.
This, coupled with the strategic moves by major players like the whale, positions Ethereum not just as a speculative asset, but as a potential powerhouse in the evolving financial ecosystem.
Analyst Chimes In: Bullish On Ethereum’s Future
Meanwhile, prominent crypto analyst Crypto Tony recently shared his bullish stance on the coin. He advised his followers to hold onto their ETH, targeting a price point of $2,700. This bullish sentiment aligns perfectly with the whale’s actions, suggesting a growing consensus on Ethereum’s potential for significant price appreciation.

Learning From The Whales: Investors Take Note
For regular investors, the actions of these whales offer valuable insights. By closely monitoring on-chain transactions and staying updated on expert analysis, investors can gain a better understanding of market trends and potential investment strategies.
While blindly following the whales isn’t recommended, their maneuvers can provide valuable clues about where the market might be headed.

Marathon Digital Ramps Up Mining Capacity - Is A Turnaround in the Making? - Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) - Benzinga

B. Riley Securities analyst Lucas Pipes maintained Marathon Digital Holdings Inc MARA with a Neutral and lowered the price target from $19 to $18.Marathon Digital Holdings reported a first-quarter miss after excluding gains on digital assets and other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding these items, came in at $51.1 million on Pipes’ estimates below his prior estimate of $83.5 million and consensus of $77.1 million. The company underperformed on elevated power and operating costs compared to Pipes’ estimates, while revenue was also lower than he had anticipated. So long as fully loaded production costs are above BTC prices, Pipes noted that the equity will likely continue to underperform its BTC benchmark, especially when investors have the alternative of holding liquid ETFs. He updated his estimates for the second quarter and 2024 adjusted EBITDA from $83.5 million to $68.0 million and from $363.1 million to $758.3 million, respectively.Needham analyst John Todaro reiterated Marathon Digital Holdings with a Hold.MARA reported results after the close Thursday, missing on top-line and adjusted EBITDA ex-BTC gains, Todaro said. The miss was primarily due to outages at Ellendale, but management estimates that around 60%- 65% of site capacity is currently online. He said G&A also increased sequentially, but management expects cash G&A to stay nearly flat for the remainder of fiscal 2024.  Marathon Digital Holdings reported revenue of $165 million, compared to Needham’s estimates of $175 million. The company also reported adjusted EBITDA ex-BTC gains of $40 million, compared to Needham estimates of $66 million.MARA increased its target from a previous range of 35 EH/s—37 EH/s to 50 EH/s by the end of fiscal 2024 and expects hosting to be gone by the third quarter of fiscal 2024.The analyst liked the improved costs for the remainder of fiscal 2024 as the company becomes more vertically integrated, with 54% of sites owned and operated by MARA. He increased his revenue estimates to reflect the increased hash rate coming online in fiscal 2024, but he also increased total network hash estimates, which partially offset. MARA stock gained 76% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Global X Blockchain ETF BKCH and IShares Trust IShares Blockchain And Tech ETF IBLC.Price Action: MARA shares traded lower by 8.55% at $17.97 at the last check Friday.Image: Eivind Pedersen from Pixabay

                        Render Network’s RNDR token experienced a major price increase after Apple featured its Octane 3D rendering software during a May 7 iPad presentation. Apple Vice President of Platform Architecture Tim Millet delivered the unexpected exposure, sparking interest among investors and contributing to RNDR’s upward momentum.Why did Apple’s Mention Impact RNDR Price?
Apple’s brief mention of Octane 3D, lasting only a few seconds within a four-minute keynote, highlighted Octane’s capabilities and its integration with Apple products.The association with a tech giant like Apple instilled confidence in investors, leading them to speculate on the potential growth and adoption of Render Network’s technology. As a result, RNDR’s price surged by 11% immediately following the presentation and continued to climb in the subsequent days.Since May 8, RNDR has seen an overall 40% increase, reaching $11.54 on May 10, according to CoinMarketCap data. The surge outperformed Bitcoin price by a big margin, which experienced a more modest 6.9% gain during the same period.RNDR’s price growth is not an isolated incident; it reflects a broader trend within the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Other AI-related tokens, including The Graph, Fetch.ai (FET), and SingularityNET (AGIX), have also witnessed major gains since May 6. The collective rise suggests growing investor confidence in the potential of AI technologies.Nvidia’s Upcoming Earnings Report and Market Expectations
The influence of major technology companies like Apple extends beyond individual endorsements. Industry leaders, such as Nvidia, play a crucial role in the development and adoption of AI hardware and software, shaping the market for tokens like RNDR.Market analysts are closely monitoring Nvidia, as its Q1 2024 earnings report, expected on May 22, could greatly influence the trajectory of AI-related tokens, including RNDR. Positive earnings and optimistic forecasts from Nvidia could further fuel investor interest and potentially drive further growth in the AI sector.

Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC) to Explode 11,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 11,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DONBTC will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Donald Bitcoin.



Currently, Donald Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DONBTC on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 7nErZV74Y8L7zz1thKUczBniWMnLc74gQMdzbWnhr95e – in the receiving field.




DONBTC currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Tether Fires Back at Deutsche Bank's Bleak Stablecoin Outlook - DailyCoin


        
A major bank report has cast doubt on stablecoins, claiming that most will fail.



The report has highlighted a lack of transparency and vulnerability to speculation as key weaknesses in stablecoins.



Tether has hit back, calling the report baseless and lacking evidence.
The world’s largest stablecoin, Tether (USDT), is embroiled in a war of words with Deutsche Bank after the German banking giant issued a scathing report questioning the long-term viability of stablecoins in general and scrutinizing Tether’s solvency.Will Stablecoins Become Unstable?Deutsche Bank’s research, published earlier this week, casts a dark cloud over the future of stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. The report, based on a historical analysis of 334 currency pegs since 1800, concludes that only 14% have managed to survive. 
Projecting this trend onto stablecoins, the bank’s analysts warn of “turbulence and de-pegging events” that could plague the asset class. “While some may survive,” the report states, “most will likely fail, particularly due to the lack of transparency in stablecoin operations and vulnerability to speculative sentiment.”The report further throws shade at Tether’s dominance in the stablecoin market, raising concerns about its solvency and its role as the underlying asset in many cryptocurrency derivatives contracts. Deutsche Bank warns of a “Tether peso moment”, a scenario where Tether loses its peg to the dollar, that could trigger significant losses for leveraged traders and destabilize the entire crypto ecosystem.Consumers Share Deutsche Bank’s CautionThe bank’s skepticism extends beyond Tether. The report highlights the inherent challenges of maintaining a stable peg in a volatile market like cryptocurrency, suggesting that “we will likely see much more instability in the years to come.”
Consumer sentiment appears to align with Deutsche Bank’s cautious outlook. A survey conducted by the bank in March across several major economies revealed that only 18% of respondents expect stablecoins to thrive, while 42% anticipate their decline.Tether, unsurprisingly, is not taking these criticisms lying down. The company has slammed Deutsche Bank’s research, calling it “lacking in clarity and substantial evidence.” Tether argues that the report relies on “vague assertions” rather than a rigorous analysis and fails to provide concrete data to support its claims of impending doom for stablecoins.On the Flipside
New stablecoin designs that address peg maintenance and volatility concerns could emerge, potentially rendering Deutsche Bank’s analysis outdated.



Tether refutes Deutsche Bank’s claims, highlighting its own success in maintaining its peg for over 8 years.
Why This MattersIf Deutsche Bank’s predictions hold weight, the future of stablecoins, a cornerstone of the crypto market for facilitating trades and reducing volatility, could be in jeopardy. A potential collapse of stablecoins would trigger a domino effect, causing significant losses for leveraged traders, destabilizing derivative markets, and eroding confidence in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.Crypto giant Tether is taking on Google in the tech world with a new phone!  This article dives into Tether’s plan to release a decentralized smartphone:Tether’s “Pear Phone” to Battle Google as Tech Giant StrugglesCurious about Tether’s recent profit boom?

Toncoin and Render make the shortlist for best crypto to buy now. Image by cryptonews.com
                         With crypto having pulled back sharply in recent trade following US economic data that has reignited fears about stagflation, and in wake of hawkish commentary from Fed policymakers, traders are looking for altcoins with strong bullish momentum that might be the best crypto to buy now.And strong performing altcoins are difficult to find in Friday’s bearish market.Bitcoin (BTC) dipped back to the low $61,000s on Friday from earlier highs near $64,000.The latest US economic data saw US consumer sentiment slump to six months lows while inflation expectations spiked.Later, Fed policymakers pondered whether financial conditions in the US are tight enough to deal with stubbornly high inflation.As per CME, the money market implied likelihood of no Fed rate cuts by September jumped to 39% from 31%.Bitcoin and crypto generally tends to perform better in an environment of easing/easier financial conditions.It thus unsurprising that hawkish remarks from Fed officials, and data to back up a more hawkish Fed stance have weighed on crypto on Friday.There remains a lot of uncertainty regarding when the Fed will start interest rate cuts.This, combined with subsiding Bitcoin ETF demand and the typical summer/post-halving market lull, suggests the Bitcoin price could remain subdued.Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have slowed to a trickle, suggesting Bitcoin likely isn’t the best crypto to buy now for quick gains. Source: The BlockFew would be surprised to see Bitcoin slide back under $60,000 and retest recent lows.Most likely, it will continue to trade within its recent $56,000-$70,000ish ranges in the coming months.Traders hunting for the best crypto to buy now for quick gains need to be very selective when choosing altcoins.Best Crypto to Buy NowToncoin (TON)Despite the market’s broader bearishness, Toncoin (TON) is trading with strong momentum.It was last up 7.5% in the past 24 hours above $6.70, as per CoinMarketCap.Since its early May lows at $4.60, TON has rallied close to 50%.Powering the pump is optimism regarding the launch of the Telegram-based GameFi token Not Coin (TON) on the TON blockchain.Others also cited optimism about the launch of USDT on the blockchain. TON could imminently retest April’s highs near $7.70.As the blockchain garners rapid adoption, its market cap could soon blast beyond its current $23 billion.Toncoin could be one of the best cryptos to buy now.Render (RNDR)Render (RNDR) is another token bucking the market trend amid its own bullish narrative.The cryptocurrency was last trading near $11, up a stunning 60% from earlier monthly lows.Render is pumping since its protocol OctaneX was featured in a recent Apple keynote.Render remains a leader in the AI DePIN space and its market cap could go a lot higher than its current $4.25 billion. That’s why it could be the best crypto to buy now.Crypto Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
The above-mentioned altcoins could easily post 5x gains this crypto bull cycle.However, investors looking for even greater upside potential should check out presale investing.Web3 projects frequently sell their tokens at a big discount to early investors as they raise funds for development.If presale investors can find a good project that gains traction in the market, they can book exponential gains.One project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is Mega Dice Casino.This already well-established crypto casino has launched a presale of its utility token, DICE.DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can generate passive income via DICE staking.The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.The project has already raised $880,000, too. Potential investors may want to move quickly, as the DICE price will rise when the $1 million milestone is hit.Mega Dice is also running a referral scheme.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

The decentralization dilemma: Sacrifices to be made on the way to freedom | Cryptopolitan

Decentralization is a hot topic in digital assets, often seen as a key to the future of crypto. Everyone’s talking about it like it’s a magical solution, but let’s get real—it’s as tricky as chasing a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.Unpacking the Decentralization DreamDecentralization takes cues from the tech world, where it’s all about setting up efficient networks. But now, we’re applying this to money matters. Take Ethereum, for example. Joseph Lubin, one of the brains behind it, didn’t just want to create a new type of money. He wanted to change how we trust financial markets. He says Ethereum is all about cutting out the middleman as it grows up.This whole idea is to kick to the curb the usual suspects—banks, exchanges—you name it, and let a big group handle things like making decisions and keeping records. This group isn’t controlled by anyone and operates on open-source networks. This setup means they shouldn’t need to trust each other too much because there’s less juice in trying to game the system.But here’s the kicker: when big fails like FTX and Mt Gox go down, it’s a slap-in-the-face reminder of what happens when you put all your eggs in one basket. These are the kind of messes crypto wants to clean up.Now, if decentralization means one side gets more power, it’s a safe bet someone else is losing out. This trade-off got the Securities and Exchange Commission all up in arms last week. They’re eyeing Lubin’s group, Consensys, maybe hitting them with an action because they think the Metamask wallet smells like a broker-dealer, which Lubin finds downright laughable.Lubin’s take? The U.S. government loves playing big boss with banks worldwide. But he’s all about dodging these middlemen, giving folks direct control over their assets, and sparking all sorts of financial and tech innovations. Meanwhile, the SEC is probably sweating over the potential flood of capital and innovation heading toward Lubin’s ecosystem, worried it’ll turn the whole scene on its head.The Reality Check on DecentralizationDive deeper, and you hit a wall of reality. Decentralization isn’t just a tech play; it’s a major governance headache. Candace Kelly from the Stellar Development Foundation breaks it down: a decentralized world has layers, lots of them, with different players managing different bits from ensuring protocols work to handling the wallets where your digital bucks live.Kelly compares it to the internet—no one owns it, and that’s cool. It’s all about the power of open, public networks that are constantly looked after, unlike those stuffy private networks where some bigwig still calls the shots.Yuval Rooz from Digital Asset throws in another curveball. Regulators would freak if JPMorgan threw open its doors and let the whole internet peek at their client’s info. He thinks the future’s about public infrastructure that everyone can tap into, but where creators still get to play by the rules and decide what they’re putting out there.This blend of openness and regulation is starting to look a lot like those global financial markets trading in bonds or swaps, where deals aren’t hammered out on public exchanges but are still tied up with regulatory strings. These markets have been around forever without needing blockchain tech.Here’s the takeaway:- Crypto is going through growing pains, learning stuff the hard finance world already knows by heart. You can’t slap a “decentralized” label on everything. It’s tougher to spread governance than technology. And while dropping something on a blockchain is cool and all, it doesn’t magically make it decentralized. Just like the internet shows us, you can have decentralized services without needing a blockchain at all.So, what’s the endgame? Decentralization is more of a balancing act than a finish line. Some things will lean towards centralization, others won’t. But what’s clear is getting there is about making smart choices, not just chasing dreams.

Is Altcoin Season 'A Myth'? Researcher Sheds Light On Why 'The Days Of Easy Mode Are Over' - Benzinga

Crypto researcher Distilled Crypto challenged the notion of an "Altcoin Season" and explored the factors contributing to the lackluster performance of altcoins despite Bitcoin’s BTC/USD solid performance.What Happened: Distilled Crypto notes that while Bitcoin has reached $60,000, sentiment remains abysmal, and the anticipated altcoin season of 2021 has yet to materialize. He delves into the key differences in this cycle, highlighting Ethereum’s ETH/USD lag and the premature surge of other altcoin sectors. "While some sectors excel, there’s no widespread surge," the trader observes.Accessibility to Bitcoin has improved significantly, with ETFs and traditional brokers offering exposure without the need for complex wallet management. He argues that lack of awareness is not the primary issue hindering altcoin growth. "Bitcoin has been around for over 15 years and has seen many cycles,” he notes. “Its financial story, though solid, no longer grabs attention."Instead, Distilled Crypto attributes the altcoin market’s struggles to a supply and demand issue, stating, "The market lacks sufficient liquidity and retail interest. Demand for altcoins is very low, yet there’s an abundance of choices." The rapid increase in altcoins has diluted an already saturated market, making a widespread altcoin boom exceptionally difficult.Despite these challenges, Distilled Crypto believes that altcoins are not a lost cause but emphasizes that the game has changed. "The days of an ‘easy mode’ are over," he asserts.

"Just be prepared—it might take longer than expected," the researcher cautions.Distilled Crypto’s analysis echoes the sentiments of another crypto researcher, Gideon, who warned earlier in May 2024 that retail investors are unlikely to drive the ongoing bull run.

The Most Important Developments in the Ripple v. SEC Trial: Two Week Recap


																TL;DR

The legal confrontation between Ripple and the SEC intensifies, with recent filings focusing on whether a key witness’s declaration is standard evidence or unsolicited expert testimony.
As both parties await a judicial ruling, speculations arise about a potential settlement this summer.


The SEC’s Actions
The legal case between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which dates back to December 2020, has intensified in the past several weeks. One important reason for the numerous actions from both sides is the start of the trial process on April 23.
Shortly after that date, Judge Sarah Netburn entered a new scheduling order focused on the motion for remedies and entry of final judgment. 
On April 29, the regulator abided by the rules by filing its opposition to Ripple’s motion to strike new expert materials. The endeavor was centered on testimony from the key witness, Andrea Fox (known as the “Fox Declaration”).
Ripple previously argued that the declaration represents an unsolicited expert opinion, whereas the SEC described the process as “standard summary evidence in support of calculations for disgorgement.” 




“It’s not an expert report, does not rely on specialized experience, and does not render any opinions at all, let alone an “expert” one. Nor does it present the testimony of a percipient witness. Rather, it applies basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records to streamline the presentation of the evidence to Judge Torres… The court should deny Ripple’s motion,” the agency insisted. 
In addition, the Commission claimed that the “Fox Declaration” consists of data derived from documents generated by Ripple itself, including tax returns and financial statements, which can be useful for determining the lawsuit’s outcome.
Ripple Strikes Back
A few days later, the company filed a letter in further support of its initial request. It stated that the watchdog failed to show that the declaration is summary evidence rather than expert testimony:
“Fox is an expert because she purports to use technical or other specialized knowledge to help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. She does not merely apply basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records, as the SEC contends.”
Ripple went further, suggesting that even if Andrea Fox could be categorized as a summary witness, the Commission failed to disclose her before the end of the discovery process.
Other Developments and a Possible Settlement
Earlier this week, the SEC filed its remedies reply brief and supporting exhibits under seal. The redacted and public version of the information was presented a day later. 
According to American lawyer Jeremy Hogan, this action marked the end of the briefs phase. He claimed the regulator “went out with a whimper here,” adding that the legal battle has entered a stage with fewer developments, and both parties must wait for the judge’s ruling.
Hogan previously predicted that the lawsuit may officially be closed this summer following a $100 million settlement. This is far less than the $2 billion penalty sought by the SEC and much more than the $10 million Ripple agreed to pay.

Optimism surges as India reopens doors to offshore crypto exchanges


In a notable shift within its financial regulatory framework, India has reopened its doors to offshore cryptocurrency exchanges, with Binance and KuCoin leading the way to secure approvals from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND). This development is poised to significantly alter the landscape for cryptocurrencies in India.
After a challenging period marked by bans due to alleged non-compliance with local laws, these major exchanges have now successfully navigated the regulatory hurdles, signaling a fresh start in a market valued at over $260 billion.
Binance and KuCoin’s re-entry into the Indian market comes after months of rigorous scrutiny and adjustments to meet the demands of Indian regulators. KuCoin has taken proactive steps by settling a $41,000 penalty, which has facilitated a swift resumption of its services. 


Binance, while currently registered, is still in the process of finalizing its compliance procedures, according to the sources.
Crypto context in India
These efforts reflect a broader trend of increasing regulatory oversight within India’s cryptocurrency sector. The FIU has registered a total of 48 crypto firms under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, enhancing the legal framework governing digital assets in India. 
This includes a historic meeting with all registered entities, aimed at reinforcing compliance and cooperation between the crypto industry and regulatory bodies.
The backdrop to these developments includes a January ban on nine major offshore cryptocurrency platforms, such as Binance and KuCoin, which were blocked from operating in India due to compliance failures. 
Subsequently, their applications were removed from major app stores, significantly restricting access for Indian users. While some platforms, like Bitstamp and OKX, have ceased operations in India, others, including Gate.io and Kraken, are still negotiating their status with the FIU.
The future of crypto in India
The reopening of India’s market to these platforms is timely, as a recent report by Chainalysis ranks the Indian crypto market as the world’s second-largest, with an inflow of $260 billion in cryptocurrencies from July 2022 to June 2023. This robust market potential , coupled with renewed regulatory clarity , could set the stage for a thriving crypto economy in India.
The FIU’s willingness to engage in open dialogue and adapt regulatory measures reflects a forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency regulation in India. This could potentially lead to increased investments and foster innovation in the sector, supporting growth in one of the world’s most vibrant digital asset markets.

Wells Fargo reports exposure to Grayscale and ProShares Bitcoin ETFs

Major United States-based financial services firm Wells Fargo has disclosed investments in Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds offered by Grayscale and ProShares.In a May 10 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Wells Fargo reported it held 37 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which offers exposure to BTC futures, and 2,245 shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which was converted to an ETF. The firm also reported 52 shares in Bitcoin Depot, a crypto ATM provider.The total value of the three Bitcoin-related investments was $143,111, a significantly small holding for the major bank. Wells Fargo reported roughly $1.7 trillion in assets as of June 2023, making it the third-largest bank in the U.S. by holdings. The SEC added that observers should not assume that the information provided by the financial firm was “accurate and complete.”This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Key Challenges in Securing Ethereum ETF Approval


The journey toward approving Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) faces considerable hurdles despite its promise for the crypto market. 
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shown a cautious approach, mirroring Bitcoin ETFs’ pathway before their eventual approval. Bundeep Singh Rangar, Founder and CEO of Fineqia, in an interview with BeInCrypto, highlighted the significant implications and challenges associated with Ethereum ETFs.
The Market Impact of an Ethereum ETF Approval 
The approval of Ethereum ETFs is expected to mirror the impact of Bitcoin ETFs, enhancing accessibility and legitimacy. 

“The introduction of Ethereum ETFs would enhance accessibility and legitimacy, attracting new investors seeking exposure to Ethereum without direct ownership,” Rangar noted. 

This could drive Ethereum’s price appreciation through increased demand and institutional participation. Moreover, Ethereum ETFs could boost adoption among traditional investors and integrate cryptocurrencies into mainstream portfolios, fostering broader market acceptance.

However, the SEC’s cautious approach reflects the regulatory challenges in the crypto market. 
Recently, the SEC delayed BlackRock’s application for an Ethereum ETF, seeking public input on concerns about fraud and manipulation. The regulatory agency has also questioned Ethereum’s classification following the transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which it argues could meet the Howey Test criteria for security.

“This approach reflects the SEC’s commitment to investor protection and market integrity, highlighting the need for robust safeguards against risks inherent in cryptocurrency markets,” Rangar remarked.


Critical factors influencing the SEC’s decision include addressing market manipulation, fraud, and investor protection concerns. The SEC’s deliberation signals a maturing regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, balancing innovation with prudent oversight to mitigate potential risks. 
The Likelihood of Such an Approval Seems Slim
The successful launch of Bitcoin ETFs sets a positive precedent, yet ongoing concerns about market integrity remain a significant hurdle. Given Ethereum’s distinct characteristics, such as its consensus mechanism allowing for staking rewards, additional challenges must be addressed before receiving the SEC’s approval.


“The likelihood of approval hinges on demonstrating effective measures to mitigate these risks while showcasing market maturity and transparency,” Rangar explained. 

Still, market participants do not anticipate the approval of Ethereum ETFs in May. For instance, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes there is only a 25% chance that the SEC will approve this new financial product. Meanwhile, a wager on the decentralized betting platform Polymarket stands at just 9%.

These projections reflect the important considerations of Ethereum’s potential classification as a security. They further question many other digital assets utilizing PoS as their consensus mechanism. 

Interestingly, a Consensys spokesperson told BeInCrypto PoS does not affect Ethereum’s operations or non-security classification.


“If you look at director Hinman’s speech in 2018 when he said that Ethereum was not a security, he didn’t base that on PoW or PoS. The consensus mechanism is irrelevant,” the Consensys spokesperson said.

While Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism is nearly unique, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could pave the way for numerous other cryptocurrencies to be utilized as underlying assets in new financial products. Still, it is the SEC who will have the last word on this matter.

The Most Bizarre Moments In Crypto - The Defiant

There have been some oddball moments in our industry.The state of memecoins right now is: You log on to Twitter and see a teenager livestreaming his mother seductively dancing in front of the camera to pump a token dubbed $LIVEMOM.That happened not even a week ago. But that’s far from all.The term “meme” was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins to define a unit of culture. Memecoins, in some ways, are the pinnacle of the concept, as they’re a unit of internet culture you can also own and trade.And with the arrival of platforms like pump.fun, anybody can push out these tokens in minutes. Combine the already irreverent nature of memes with the ability to permissionlessly create meme-related tokens, and pretty bizarre moments will inevitably follow.Here are some of the top crazy moments in memecoins.Doge Community Installs Dog StatueWho let the doge out?Fans of OG memecoin, Dogecoin, took their enthusiasm for the Kabosu dog to the next level and worked with authorities in Japan to erect a monument in tribute to their community’s canine idol.Located in the city of Sakura, Japan, the tribute shows a Kabosu dog lying on a sofa with its paws crossed, much like the Dogecoin image, accompanied by a trio of cats–likely a tribute to cat culture, which also pervades the digital world.Doge MonumentThe monument came to “furrition” last year on Nov. 2, when fans celebrated Doge’s birthday.DOGE Takes Over TwitterDoge, which was launched in 2013, has become a staple of the irreverence of the crypto community, gaining traction when renowned internet troll and billionaire Elon Musk began spreading the dog-inspired gospel.In an absurd yet entertaining turn of events, Musk purchased Twitter–renaming it to X–and briefly changed the classic blue bird logo to one depicting Doge. At one point, Musk’s Twitter bio said he was the former Dogecoin CEO.Musk has caught flak over his unwavering support of Doge, and he was sued in a class-action lawsuit for market manipulation – Musk’s tweets have pushed the price of Doge up more than once.Doge is now the 10-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $21 billion.Definitely not a number to bark at.Boden And PoliticiansWashington, D.C.’s political class has not been spared by Solana memecoin creators.And with 2024 being an election year, it seems political memecoins are in for a wild ride.One token that has far exceeded anybody’s expectations is Jeo Boden – a parody of the sitting U.S. President, Joe Biden."Boden the 46th pres of soluna. His jeb is te mäk three hundred trillion million billion dollars,” developers wrote on the token’s official website after its March 9 launch.Screenshot of BODEN websiteBoden has seen wild success. It briefly surpassed the $1 mark, although it has since dropped 70% to $0.30. The token’s market cap is still a whopping $212 million, down from its peak of $665 million.But Boden is only one of a plethora of politically charged tokens.One of the staunchest crypto adversaries, Senator Elizabeth Warren, saw her token launch under the ticker “Whoren,” as did famed political commentator Tucker Carlson with “tooker kurlson.” Former White House resident Donald Trump was also thrown into the mix with “doland tremp.”Other famous figures also got the memecoin treatment. “Olen Mosk” was spawned, as was “Drek” in a tip of the hat to musician Drake, and Mona – a meme rendering of the Mona Lisa.The list is endless.No Hands Rug PullThe most recent rug pull is straight out of a David Copperfield show.A man created a token called “No Hands No Rug” with the ticker $HANDS. He posed on camera with a sign under his chin that read, “I have no hands, I can’t do a rug pull.”'No Hands' Rug PullBut when the token peaked, he pulled his hands out from behind his back and sold 67 million HANDS for 7 SOL, pocketing $1,050.Most thought he had no hands, but in reality, he was packing one big ace up his sleeve.Degens Bet On Animal RacingAs the summer doldrums waged on, bored traders resorted to betting on animal races towards the end of July 2023.The most famous pastime for degenerate crypto gamblers was HamstersGG, where users could bet on the outcome of pre-recorded races between unfortunate rodents. Thousands of players took part in a game in which the winners split 95% of the wagered funds, with HamstersGG taking a 5% cut.As expected, degen crypto punters were inspired to create an entire category of animal racing tokens on CoinGecko. These included the Rabbits Club, Snails Race, and Rat Roulette, although at the time, HamstersGG – which was purportedly a rug pull – accounted for 85% of the sector’s market cap.Some were fast, while others were “wheel-y” slow.LIVEMOMHere’s a twisted take on some mother-son bonding.A teenager and his scantily-clad mother begged viewers on a livestream to buy their memecoin called LIVEMOM as she suggestively showed off her figure.Mother and child urged viewers to “run up” their token, promising degrading and perverted activities at different market cap milestones. These included eating dog food if the market cap reached $200,000 or the boy pouring milk on his mother’s breasts if it reached half a million.LIVEMOMThe top gag was shaving the boy’s head if degen traders pushed LIVEMOM’s market cap to $2 million market cap.However, the pair abruptly terminated the live stream, and the token subsequently crashed.Only two days after the LIVEMOM livestream, several copycats popped up, including LIVESIS.But this took it a step further than LIVEMOM.LIVESISAs the token tagged $100,000, the brother took his alleged sister’s bra off, played the crypto-classic tune, “Pump It Up,” and proceeded to dump his entire bag on screen.It all stays in the family, right?Racist Memecoins Darken The MoodMemecoin mania was well underway when some less savory tokens surfaced.Some of these included derogatory terms and symbols based on race and religion, as well as other hateful language, forcing the platform DEX Screener, a real-time DeFi token analytics platform, to review its token profile moderation policy.Racist tokens underscore a peculiar situation in the crypto ecosystem. On one hand, they shine a light on a dark underbelly, with people interested in creating and buying these types of tokens. Meanwhile, they show the permissionless nature of open blockchains and the fact that the technology enables the freedom to create anything a developer or user wants – for good or bad.DogWifHat Goes To VegasDogWifHat might be the darling memecoin of this cycle, characterized by a cute dog in an orange beanie.Its community is diehard. Fans raised a whopping $690,000 to put the meme on the famous Las Vegas sphere, a feat that still hasn’t come to fruition, however.DogWifHatBut it remains among the top 50 largest cryptocurrencies with a market cap of $3.5 billion — not bad for a token that didn’t exist a year ago and whose only utility is being meme-ably cute!Just more proof of the staying power of memes in crypto culture.Non-Memecoin BonusBizarre moments in crypto are not reserved for the memecoin sector. We have compiled a few of them here.J.K. Rowling Gets The Muggle Guide To BitcoinWingardium Bitcoinosa!Famed Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling caught the brunt of bitcoiners’ wrath in May 2020 when she posted on X, “I don’t understand Bitcoin. Please explain it to me.”Tweet from J.K. RowlingBig mistake.As expected, Bitcoiners descended on her like Voldemort’s Death Eaters, berating Rowling for not understanding it straight away.It wasn’t all bad, though.The account Bitcoin posted “Wizards still need to trust Gringotts Bank [in reference to the goblin-run financial institution that holds most of the wizarding world’s gold]. Bitcoin fixes this.”Other Bitcoiners got creative and created the “Muggle’s Guide to Bitcoin” in reference to non-wizarding people (dubbed muggles in the book series), weaving the wizarding world with Nakamoto’s creation.But the flood of responses became too overwhelming, and the author decided to drop out of the conversation with: “This started as a joke, but now I’m afraid I’ll never be able to log in to Twitter again without someone getting angry I don’t own Bitcoin. One day, you’ll see a wizened old woman in the street, trying to trade a Harry Potter book for a potato. Be kind. She did try to understand.”SBF Takes The Rich and Famous For a RideOne of Sam Bankman-Fried’s claims to fame is how he managed to entice celebrities far and wide.FTX imploded in late 2022, bringing the industry to its knees. But one overlooked scar that SBF left was on Hollywood movie stars, NBA athletes, and top-tier comedians.Just to name a few: Brazilian model Giselle Bündchen and her now ex-husband Tom Brady; actor Matt Damon; Golden State Warriors basketball player Steph Curry; and rappers Lil Yachty, Soulja Boy, Akon, Ne-Yo, and others are now associated with the failed exchange.One of the top moments was Larry David’s 2022 FTX commercial. The famed comedian and co-creator of the Seinfeld sitcom dressed up as several historical figures and criticized notable inventions in history.These included the wheel, lightbulb, dishwasher, moon landing, and FTX, and he claimed he was never wrong about them.It seems, however, he was very right on one of them.Comedians Roast Tom BradyEverybody knows that 7-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady lost millions in the FTX collapse.Brady was reminded of his financial misfortune during a Netflix roast on May 5. The super athlete was burned by Kevin Hart and Nikki Glaser, among others.Kevin Hart opened the show with some friendly fire, asking, “Why didn’t we go to the Crypto.com Arena downtown? Well, the reason why we didn’t go there is because we didn’t want to remind Tom’s fans of how much money he owes them.”His comedic counterpart Nikki Glaser was up next and she didn’t hold back either, although Glaser took a larger shot at his teammate, and tight end Rob Gronkowski.“Tom also lost $30 million dollars in crypto,” she opened, asking, “Tom, how did you fall for that?” But her next punchline was a headshot to Gronk, when she said in a Tarzan accent imitating the tight end, “Me know that not real money.”Brady didn’t need to throw an interception for this to be a massive turnover.What’s Next, Degens?Irreverence is a feature, not a bug, in crypto.Degens take the time to troll, create a token about it, speculate, and set it free on the internet. They don’t spare politicians, famed authors, or cute furry animals.And the memecoin sector’s market capitalization proves it. It boasts a $53 billion market cap, and some of its top tokens – such as Dogecoin or Shiba Inu – land in the CoinGecko top 15.The proliferation of memecoins is set to continue, along with some of the absurd situations we have seen. When permissionless technology meets the internet culture, anything can happen.

$267,000,000,000 Bank To Abolish Cash, Warns Customers To Prepare for Massive Digital Overhaul - The Daily Hodl


								One of the largest banks in Australia is rolling out a plan to terminate cash and checking services.
In an update on its website, Macquarie Bank, which has $267 billion in assets, tells customers that a digital-centered banking experience will begin in November.










“In case you missed it, we’re phasing out our cash and cheque services for all products. To prepare for this change, you’ll need to start transacting digitally – a safe, quick, and more convenient way to bank. We’re removing our cash and cheque facilities in a phased approach.”
The bank says customers will no longer be able to access a list of over-the-counter services at Macquaries’ physical locations, nor deposit or collect checks or order new checkbooks.
“From Friday 1 November 2024
You won’t be able to:

write or deposit personal cheques
deposit or request bank cheques
deposit cash or cheques over the counter at NAB branches
make a super contribution or payment via cheque.

Please note any cheques received after Thursday 31 October 2024 will be returned to the sender.”
Once the changes are rolled out, Macquarie customers will only be able to access paper money using ATMs, with withdrawals capped at $2,000 AUD per day.
The move comes amid a broader shift away from cash across the country.
A total of 424 bank branches representing 11% of all banks in Australia were closed from June 2022 and June 2023, according to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)
At the same time, banks removed access to 718 ATMs.
Australians held a rally on April 2nd to protest the widespread closures and bring attention to the country’s move away from cash.

Ethereum transaction fees hit record low as Layer-2 networks siphon activity

The average transaction fee on Ethereum has reached record lows as more activity moves to the Layer-2 (L2) networks on the chain.According to Ultrasound.money data, the average gas has dropped to 4.81 Gwei — the lowest level since the network completed the Merge event in 2022.Market observers attributed this decline to increasing activity on L2 networks following the completion of the Dencun upgrade. The Dencun upgrade significantly reduced fees for L2 networks, making transacting on the base layer less attractive.Notably, the blockchain analytical platform IntoTheBlock reported:“An increasing number of transactions are now being settled on Ethereum Layer 2s. Last month, the three largest L2s hit a record 82% transaction share of all Ethereum transactions.”Ethereum Layer-2 Transaction Share. (Source: IntoTheBlock)Furthermore, the number of transactions on Arbitrum has seen strong growth, reaching over 2 million daily transactions on May 8 — a significant rise from the early March average of 1 million.L2beats data further indicates that Base and Arbitrum averaged 30 and 20 transactions per second, respectively, while Ethereum managed 13 transactions per second during the same period.ETH turns inflationaryMeanwhile, CryptoQuant analysis revealed that ETH has transitioned to an inflationary state post the Dencun upgrade, resulting in diminished gas fees and reducing its burn rate.In light of this development, the firm noted:“Since The Merge, Ethereum appeared to be on track with its ‘ultra-sound’ money narrative, showing a slight reduction in the total ETH supply. However, the post-Dencun upgrade challenges this by reducing transaction fees and the ETH burn rate, leading to an increase in supply.”Chart Showing Ethereum Ultra Sound Money Before and After Dencun Upgrade (Source: CryptoQuant)CryptoQuant further elaborated that the Dencun upgrade environment has presented a scenario where maintaining deflation would require a substantial increase in network activity, contrasting the current trend of low gas fees and reduced burn rates.Notably, UltraSound.Money data shows that the daily amount of ETH burned during the past day was 519 ETH, a record low for the network.

Monero's weekly hike - Mapping if LocalMonero's closure can stop its rally - AMBCrypto



Demand for XMR has spiked over the last few days
This happened despite the proposed plan to shut down LocalMonero

Monero’s native coin XMR appears poised to extend its seven-day rally, despite the negative sentiments around the closure of LocalMonero, a peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform for the privacy coin.
On 7 May, LocalMonero announced that it has disabled all new sign-ups and advertisement postings for XMR on its platform. It added that on 14 May, it would disable new XMR trades, and by 7 November, its website would be taken down.
XMR looks the other way
At press time, the popular privacy coin was valued at $132.52, rallying by 8% in the last 7 days, according to CoinMarketCap. This, despite the fact that the broader market has remained largely circumspect over the past. 
An assessment of its price performance on the daily chart confirmed the possibility of an extended rally in the short term. For instance, at press time, the altcoin’s price lay above its 20-day small moving average (SMA). An asset’s 20-day SMA is a short-term moving average that reflects its average closing price over the past 20 days. 
When it is positioned below an asset’s price, it suggests that the short-term trend for the asset is upward. This is often viewed as a sign that buyers are in control of the market and that a sustained rally is possible. 
An asset’s 20-day SMA is a short-term moving average that reacts quickly to price changes. It reflects the average closing price of an asset over the past 20 days.

Furthermore, XMR’s rising momentum indicators signalled high buying momentum across the market. At press time, the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 57.13, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 71.69.
At these values, these indicators suggested that market participants favoured XMR accumulation over its distribution.
Confirming an inflow of liquidity into the XMR market, its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) had a reading of 0.14, at the time of writing. This indicator measures the flow of money into and out of an asset, with a positive CMF viewed as a sign of positive market strength.
Regarding XMR’s next price point, readings from its Fibonacci retracement revealed that if it successfully breaches the $134-price level, it would aim to exchange hands at $143 on the charts.

However, if this is invalidated and the bears exert pressure on the market, the altcoin’s price may fall below $125.

Crypto Exchanges Experience First Decline In Trading Volume In 7 Months: Implications Explored | Bitcoinist.com


								According to a recent Bloomberg report, trading volume on major cryptocurrency exchanges experienced a significant decline in April, marking the first drop in seven months. 
This decline coincided with a retreat in the price of Bitcoin, which had previously hit a record high of $73,700 on March 14th and then hit a monthly low of $59,000 in late April.
Trading Volume On Coinbase, Binance, And Kraken Tanks
Data from CCData, a renowned research firm, reveals that spot trading volume on centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as Coinbase Global, Binance, and Kraken decreased by 32.6% to $2 trillion last month. Additionally, derivatives trading volume experienced a decline of 26.1% to $4.57 trillion, marking the first decrease in seven months.

Earlier this year, trading volume surged following the introduction of 11 US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the world’s largest asset managers. 
However, it slowed down due to tightening financial conditions in the United States, where the Federal Reserve (Fed) is grappling with the challenge of addressing persistent inflation. 
The anticipation of the Bitcoin Halving event on April 19, which reduced the supply of newly minted coins, had previously created excitement in the market, as Bitcoin had never reached its previous peak in previous bull cycles before the anticipated Halving event.
CME Group Records First Decline In Crypto Derivatives Volume 
Despite this troubling data ahead of several predictions of further price gains in the coming months for the largest cryptocurrencies on the market, Jacob Joseph, a research analyst at CCData, noted that the slowdown in trading activity on centralized exchanges following the Bitcoin Halving event is consistent with patterns observed in previous cycles. 
Moreover, the researcher highlights factors such as higher-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data and escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have introduced uncertainty and fear into the market. 
According to Joseph, these factors, combined with negative net flows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs, have contributed to a decline in the prices of major cryptocurrencies.
As trading volumes decreased, the spot market share of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, dropped for the first time since September 2023. It declined by nearly 4% to 33.8%, reaching its lowest level since January, as reported by CCData.
Similarly, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a prominent derivatives exchange, experienced its first decline in crypto trading volume in seven months. In April, its derivatives trading volume fell by nearly 20% to $124 billion, according to CCData.
Despite the decline, Joseph emphasized that trading activity on centralized exchanges remains relatively high compared to volumes recorded in previous months. Although it has slowed down compared to the peak in March, the trading activity remains elevated.

Overall, this decrease in trading volume and market share highlights the impact of various factors on the cryptocurrency market, including the Bitcoin Halving event, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions. 
However, as Jacob Joseph noted, this decline is a consistent pattern and should not reflect any change in the prospects for further price increases in the market in the coming months.

Bitcoin Commencement Speaker Defends Ayahuasca-Fueled Speech, Praises Satoshi - Decrypt

The viral Ohio State University commencement speaker isn’t backing down, despite the negative attention his now-famous speech has received: Chris Pan believes in Bitcoin’s potential, he told Decrypt in an interview. And he thinks you should too.Why? Pan says that when his interest in Bitcoin was rekindled earlier this year, he was gripped by one key trend: The institutions are here.BlackRock and Fidelity piqued Pan’s interest in February as familiar Wall Street names pushed deeper into the esoteric market through spot Bitcoin ETFs, he told Decrypt. The development encouraged him to buy Bitcoin, and later include mention of it in his commencement speech.“I'm a Harvard MBA and former Facebook guy, so I understand adoption curves,” Pan said. “All of a sudden, I understood: Wow, we're ready to tip into the mainstream [...] This is Bitcoin’s IPO moment.”Graduating from OSU in 1999, Pan’s unorthodox commencement speech drew widespread attention this week—not only for its suggestion to consider investing in Bitcoin, but also for its musical numbers, magic trick, and ayahuasca-fueled origins. His controversial comments included calling Bitcoin “a very misunderstood asset class,” which provoked audience groans.Pan himself said he understood little about Bitcoin when he first heard of the asset in 2017. After purchasing a small amount in 2020, he then sold his BTC after a 20% dip, he said.“So embarrassing,” Pan recalled, adding that a steep drawdown had “freaked [him] out.”For years, the crypto-cognizant have keyed in on financial institutions as power players to watch. Not only could their steadily increasing involvement legitimize the digital assets space, but this year, asset managers’ products have been a main driver of Bitcoin’s year-to-date rally. From Pan’s point of view, it warranted an allocation of more than just “play money,” like before.“The ETFs, to me, offered convenience and a sense of security,” he said, noting that he need not worry about managing a digital wallet’s private keys with the product. “That was a sign that the asset class had matured enough for me to really get serious about it.”Before sharing his knowledge of Bitcoin with 60,000 Ohio State commencement attendees on Sunday, Pan said he sharpened his comments in conversations with family and friends. Within four weeks of rediscovering Bitcoin, that entailed talking with his brother, dad, cousins, and friends. He didn’t want them to miss out on Bitcoin, and believed that the asset could help them financially.It wasn’t until mid-March that Pan decided to include Bitcoin in his speech, he said. While emotional and spiritual health were always something always planned to touch on, he decided Bitcoin could be an example of why it’s beneficial to have an open mind.“I was like, ‘You know what? Let me just throw [it] in,” he said of Bitcoin’s inclusion. “It was just about financial health, of which Bitcoin was my example of something interesting to look at.”A social entrepreneur, musician, and inspirational speaker, one of Pan’s current endeavors involves a positive-affirmation jewelry business called MyIntent. In LinkedIn comments, responding to a psychedelics-centered post, several purported attendees said his speech on Sunday came across as him promoting his business, or an agenda.“All I said was: To be a great investor, you have to be open-minded and look for misunderstood opportunities,” he said. “Unfortunately, people just jump right to the conclusion.”Still, Pan believes that Bitcoin could solve real-world problems, such as addressing the scarcity of housing in the U.S. by providing real estate owners an alternative store of value.Drawing on his experience from the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Pan said he pieced together this new understanding of Bitcoin primarily through “YouTube University.”That included watching videos of Twitter founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey talking about Bitcoin, as well as MicroStrategy executive founder and chairman Michael Saylor. One of Dorsey’s chats left a notable impression on Pan, he said, as it suggested that Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakatomo was somewhat charitable.“Here's a trillion-dollar asset class where the founder disappeared after three years, and didn't want to come back and take credit for it,” Pan said. “I just thought that was like the coolest example of selflessness. And I think that's the most misunderstood part about Bitcoin.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

White House Plans to Nominate CFTC Commissioner Johnson for Treasury Position


                        
                            White House Plans to Nominate CFTC Commissioner Johnson for Treasury Position

                        The White House is reportedly set to nominate Kristin Johnson, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to fill a top role at the US Treasury Department overseeing banks, according to a May 9 report by Bloomberg.According to the report, Commissioner Johnson is endorsed to become the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions, with the announcement expected to be made public soon.CFTC Commissioner Expected to Coordinate with the US SEC
If confirmed, Johnson will lead financial policies on credit unions, insurance, and consumer protection. She will work closely with the Treasury Secretary and coordinate with federal regulators and banking agencies.The Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions role has been vacant since Graham Steele’s departure in January 2024.So far, the news of a potential crossover for Johnson has sparked concerns regarding a conflict of interest in decision-making.Congressman Don Meuser expressed his non-approval of the switch in an X post on May 10.He argued that the commissioner’s imminent switch raises concerns about conflicting loyalties and interests for the official, which he believes could compromise the impartiality of the CFTC as an independent agency.Despite Meuser’s concerns, financial experts and observers are optimistic about Johnson’s confirmation, citing recent endorsements from influential figures such as Maxine Waters, the Congressional Black Caucus, and the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee.In a letter addressed to President Biden on May 2, Waters highlighted Johnson’s notable achievements and experience, endorsing her for the role.“In her role as a CFTC Commissioner, Commissioner Johnson has prioritized maintaining the integrity of our financial markets,” Congresswoman Waters stated. “She has pushed the Commission to adopt rigorous capital, collateral, and margin standards. Commissioner Johnson is also leading the CFTC’s work on artificial intelligence (AI) and encouraging the Commission to carefully evaluate whether existing regulation is fit-for-purpose or new regulation is required.”Waters, who recently expressed concerns about Meta’s crypto ventures, welcomes Johnson’s nomination. She believes her “person of color” status will ensure that the US Treasury Department’s leadership reflects diversity.Johnson’s tenure as a CFTC commissioner has been marked by her proactive stance, drawing major attention and acclaim. Last year, she presented a series of proposals to improve the CFTC’s oversight of crypto businesses.Notably, her plan includes empowering the regulator to scrutinize businesses seeking to acquire 10% or more of a CFTC-regulated exchange or clearinghouse. More recently, Johnson lauded the Binance settlement, which she described as a template for how crypto businesses should operate in the US.CFTC Commissioner Proposes New AI Recommendations
The report of Johnson’s nomination for the Treasury job follows the CFTC commissioner’s drive to address misuse and promote the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI).In a speech at the Sidley Austin and Rutgers Law School Fintech and Blockchain Symposium on May 3, Commissioner Johnson proposed measures such as heightened penalties to tackle AI’s role in financial markets, including decentralized finance (DeFi).The commissioner expressed concerns about AI in DeFi, highlighting how its integration into blockchain-based ecosystems could pose new challenges for supervision, compliance, risk management, and enforcement. She pointed out a key distinction with DeFi: its lack of a central authority, which sets it apart from traditional markets.Johnson also suggested the creation of an “AI Fraud Enforcement Task Force” comprising attorneys and investigators from various departments within the CFTC’s enforcement division and an inter-agency task force involving other regulators like the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

‘I’m Fine With It’: Donald Trump, a Former Digital Asset Skeptic, Continues To Court the Crypto Vote - The Daily Hodl


								Former US President Donald Trump is seeking the support of the crypto community to return to the White House.
In videos shared by crypto influencer Frank Degods on the social media platform X, Trump tells a group of supporters who bought his Mugshot Edition non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that he is accepting crypto donations for his campaign.










“Can we donate to the Trump campaign using crypto? I believe the answer is yes.” 
He also criticizes President Joe Biden and U.S. Securities Chairman Gary Gensler, saying they are against digital assets.
“[SEC Chair] Gensler is very much against it, the Democrats are very much against it.” 
Trump also says he does not have a problem with the current popularity of crypto as he woos digital asset supporters to vote for him in the upcoming November election.
“A lot of people are very much for it – probably a lot of people in this group and I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else, but I’m good with it. If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you’re in favor of crypto, you’d better vote for Trump.”
The former president used to be a crypto critic. In May 2018, while serving in the Oval Office, he reportedly directed then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to “go after Bitcoin [for fraud].”
In a 2021 interview, Trump said that he was not invested in digital assets and that crypto might be fake.
“I like the currency of the United States. I think the others are potentially a disaster waiting to happen.”

Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE) to Surge 7,600% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Doge has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,600% in the coming two days, and Pepe Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Pepe Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Doge by entering its contract address – 7s7VZhFWTez5ykSr214AxnqRTMdcKu5rd77YFAx2DGG1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEDOGE.

Stand With Crypto Unveils Political Action Committee (PAC) To Support Digital Asset-Friendly Candidates: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A nonprofit digital asset advocacy group backed by crypto exchange Coinbase is reportedly launching a Political Action Committee (PAC) to support crypto-friendly candidates.
According to a new report by Reuters, Stand With Crypto, a group with 440,000 members, is launching a PAC to support bipartisan politicians running for Senate or the House of Representatives.










Some of the candidates endorsed by the PAC include Jim Banks and Jim Justice, Republicans running for Senate positions in Indiana and West Virginia, respectively, and Shomari Figures and Eddy Morales, Democrats running for the House in Alabama and Oregon, respectively.
Also represented is Troy Downing, a Republican running to represent Montana’s Second District, according to the report.
As stated by Nick Carr, chief strategist at Stand With Crypto, to Reuters,
“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November.”
PACs differ from Super PACs because they cannot receive donations of unlimited size but are able to directly coordinate with the campaign.
In January, Stand With Crypto identified two politicians – Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming – as being lawmakers who are “strongly supportive” of crypto and gave them an A score.
Furthermore, the advocacy group identified two others – Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Democrat Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio – as being “strongly against” virtual currencies, earning them an F score.

Kraken Challenges SEC's Case Accuracy in Ongoing Dispute


																Kraken and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remain embroiled in a dispute, as the crypto exchange filed a new document questioning the accuracy of the regulator’s case.
The development comes three months after Kraken filed a motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against it.
SEC’s Case Isn’t Worded Correctly
Kraken recently filed a response to the SEC’s April letter regarding the company’s motion to dismiss the case. In it, the exchange alleged that the securities regulator failed to identify any investment contracts that were traded, brokered, or settled on its platform.
The filing claims that the SEC used terms like “investment concept” and “ecosystem” instead of “investment contract” and “enterprise” in its argument.
The SEC had previously stated that “the words themselves do not delimit the security type because ‘the reach of the act does not stop with the obvious and commonplace,'” citing case law.
Kraken was accused of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency by the SEC.




According to the regulator, Kraken unlawfully facilitated the trading of crypto asset securities since at least September 2018, generating hundreds of millions of dollars. The charges were similar to the ones leveled against Binance and Coinbase.
Kraken: SEC Overstepping Regulatory Authority
Following the accusations, the firm and its representatives denied the SEC’s claims, opting to contest the lawsuit in court.
In February, Kraken argued that the Commission was overstepping its regulatory authority in its motion seeking to dismiss the lawsuit. It also contested that cryptocurrencies, particularly those mentioned in the SEC’s complaint, should be treated as commodities rather than securities.
Later that same month, the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC) filed an amicus curiae to back Kraken’s motion, which said,
“The SEC does not allege fraud. The SEC does not allege consumer harm. The SEC’s sole claims are that Kraken has somehow operated in plain sight for almost a decade as an unregistered securities exchange, broker-dealer, and clearing agency, in violation of the Exchange Act.”

Bitcoin Plummets Toward $60k As Federal Reserve Considers Keeping Rates Elevated


																Bitcoin’s price fell 2.5% to $60,300 on Friday as Federal Reserve officials weighed their options for combatting stubborn price inflation in the United States.

Bitcoin traded for $63,400, at noon UTC on Friday, before plummeting below $61,000 over the next few hours.
According to Coinglass, the volatility triggered $175 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours. The single largest liquidation took place on a Binance BTC/USDT trade for $3.56 million.
Speaking at a Louisiana Bankers Association conference in New Orleans this week, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan suggested it may be “too early to think about cutting rates,” according to Reuters.
“I need to see some of these uncertainties resolved about the path that we’re on, and we need to remain very flexible,” Logan said.
For the past few months, core PCE inflation – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation metric – has failed to make meaningful progress towards the central bank’s 2% target. What’s more, data on Friday showed a jolt to consumers’ inflation expectations, with year-ahead expectations rising to 3.5% next May.
During an interview with Reuters, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic predicted that interest rates will still come down – but possibly only by 25 basis points before the end of the year.
“I still have that belief,” he said, noting that it is “going to take some time” before inflation finally falls.
Lower interest rates are perceived as a boon for Bitcoin and stocks, affording investors cheaper debt for buying up risk assets.

Curve DAO Defies $0.43 Resistance with 7-Day Green Streak - DailyCoin


        
The Curve DAO token has set sights on the path to recovery.



The token has mounted healthy gains over the past week.



Market analysts have charted a positive outlook for the altcoin market.  
The recent heightened volatility in the crypto market has taken its toll on various assets, with some experiencing gains while others face significant declines. Among those impacted negatively is Curve DAO (CRV), the native token of the Curve Finance DeFi protocol, which hit new lows following the April market crash due to its susceptibility to market trends.After a prolonged struggle to reverse its fortunes, the token has resurfaced with significant gains, signaling a path to recovery.CRV Uptick: Will It Hold?According to the CoinMarketCap data on Friday, May 10, Curve DAO’s value has experienced an upward momentum over the past week, currently trading at approximately $0.452. 
CRV’s current price marks a near 4% breakthrough from its $0.43 mark resistance, which it struggled at for over two weeks following its record-low plunge in April 2024. In addition, the native Curve Finance token has climbed 35% from its year-low price to reach $0.331. Despite this recent uptick, CRV remains substantially down from its year-high value of $0.863, raising concerns about its sustainability and the potential of reclaiming its previous gains.Curve DAO’s volatile performance mirrors the broader trend observed across the altcoin market.Altcoins’ Peak and Potholes: Where to Next?Over the past weeks, the majority of altcoins have struggled to uphold an upward momentum, with some assets pulling back substantially.
According to market analyst Rekt Capital, the initial excitement and increase in value seen in altcoins during the first quarter of the year has ended, resulting in the ongoing retrace witnessed across the market. The analysis stated that most assets began reaching their lowest point in early February, coinciding with the first quarter Bitcoin hype cycle.Rekt Capital further emphasized that if the same pattern repeats in the second quarter of the year, altcoins could reach their lowest point again as early as mid-May, citing the period between the end of May and early June as a more plausible timeframe.Offering a silver lining, the market analyst added that altcoins are expected to soon stabilize in prices, which could mark a turnaround in the ongoing downturn.Read more about the aftermath of Curve DAO’s crash to a new all-time low:Crypto Crash Puts Curve DAO CEO at Risk of Liquidation Altcoin SUI continues a downward market trend despite chain activity.

Cardano Price Prediction as Hoskinson Claims Biden is 'Killing Crypto' – Will ADA Fall to Zero? / Source: TradingView
                        The Cardano (ADA) price has reversed 4% lower on Friday, having once again found strong resistance at its 21DMA and amid comments from the crypto’s founder Charles Hoskinson that US President Joe Biden is trying to kill crypto.ADA was last changing hands around $0.445, with the 21DMA at $0.467 having blocked rallies for over a week.That’s a strong sign that bears remain in control of this market.As traders monitor the outlook for the Cardano price, they are also keeping comments from its founder on their radar.In a broadcast on X, Hoskinson made it clear to listeners that the Biden administration is trying to kill crypto.“This November, if you vote for J. Biden as a crypto holder, understand that this administration’s intention is to destroy the US crypto industry,” he noted.These claims are not without merit. Under Biden, the SEC has taken an aggressive regulation-by-enforcement approach to the crypto industry.The agency’s underlying assumption is that virtually all cryptos aside from Bitcoin are actually securities, bring them under its jurisdiction.ADA has been explicitly labeled as a security by the SEC, which weighed heavily on its price in 2023.The Biden administration has been accused of conducting “operation choke point 2.0” to debank crypto firms in the US.The SEC has also tried to stifle crypto via other means, including its SAB 121. The SAB 121 is being challenged by the US House, though Biden openly opposes these efforts.Cardano Price Prediction – Is ADA Going to Zero?
The near-term outlook for the Cardano (ADA) price is downbeat. The cryptocurrency has found strong resistance at its 21DMA going all the way back to late March.With the bears very much in control, a retest of recent lows around $0.40 looks likely.The Cardano price is threatening a bearish breakout as it finds resistance at its 21DMA. Source: TradingViewAnd the ADA price could go even lower. Adoption stories are keeping the prices of some of its rivals elevated, like Toncoin.But ADA lacks a strong adoption story, because its struggling to achieve any meaningful adoption.As per DeFi Llama, Cardano only has a TVL of around $350 million. That puts it 26th in the TVL rankings, behind little-known chains like Ultron, MultiverseX and Hyperliquid.That suggests its current market cap ranking of 10th could be an overvaluation.While ADA is unlikely to go to zero, its lack of adoption and lack of regulatory clarity could see it go much lower.Alternative to Consider – Investing in Presales
With the ADA outlook grim, investors will be looking for alternatives with a better chance of delivering short-term gains.An alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy worth considering is getting involved in crypto presales.Upcoming web3 protocols frequently sell their native tokens at an early-bird discount to fund development.If investors can reliably identify high-potential presales, they can make a great return.With so many presales vying for investor funds, knowing where to start can be daunting.Luckily, the team at Cryptonews compiled a list of what they deem to be the best crypto presales.See the 20 Crypto Presales

Bitbot’s native token $BITBOT is in presale at $0.018 per token, with the next stage price at $0.0189.

XRP investors are eagerly eyeing potential price movements amidst ongoing market fluctuations.
While analysts offer varying XRP price predictions, the emergence of innovative trading tools like Bitbot adds a new dimension to the equation.
XRP price prediction
XRP is one of the top digital assets by market capitalization and it has been subject to moderate fluctuations in recent times.
Currently trading at $0.51, analysts foresee a potential rally if it manages to break the $0.57 level, with significant growth expected upon surpassing a major resistance at $0.67.

EIGEN Claim Kicks Off | Bankless


Free Money? Claims on EIGEN, the most anticipated airdrop of 2024, opened earlier today for the majority of eligible first-round recipients! What peculiarities come with this drop, and what can you actually do with your EIGEN? Eligible EigenLayer users for the phase one, season one distribution had been able to see their allocations in the claims portal for nearly two week but were unable to take custody of their tokens until today at 10 AM PST.
Many users had been understandably upset by EigenLayer’s claiming restrictions that prohibited access to residents of specific nations and VPN users, but methods to circumvent the frontend-imposed restriction have made the rounds on Crypto Twitter, highlighting the frivolity of EigenLayer’s ban in the first place and calling to light the unfortunate fact that US regulators will likely still try to establish jurisdiction against any token issuer conducting a permissionless airdrop.The initial outcry that the minimum EigenLayer allocation was insufficient to compensate for gas caused the EigenLayer Foundation to distribute an additional 100 EIGEN to all addresses that had interacted with the application prior to the April 29 “stakedrop” announcement.Despite EIGEN’s current $9 trading price on pre-market perpetual platforms like Aevo leaving this minimum allocation at a generous $900, holders will be unable to cash out as the EIGEN token is expected to be non-transferable until EigenLayer ships a mainnet complete with live actively validated services (AVSs) and operator slashing this September.
Until then, there is literally only one thing to do!After claiming their EIGEN, recipients can stake their allocation and delegate it to EigenDA, the proprietary EigenLayer data availability solution that leverages the network’s restaked capital to provide enhanced capital efficiency as opposed to competitors like Celestia.Users who had previously restaked ETH to an EigenDA operator will have their EIGEN automatically delegated to the same operator once staked, meanwhile, users who have not previously delegated to an EigenDA operator will have to undertake this action for themselves.While EigenDA will be the only AVS allowing users to restake EIGEN upon the feature’s launch, it is anticipated that additional services will soon opt in, enabling stakedrop recipients to generate returns from their allocations by positioning for additional airdrops from AVSs, even though they are unable to directly monetize the drop at this time.

Lightning Labs Is Bringing Stablecoins to the Bitcoin Blockchain: CEO - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe developer behind Bitcoin's Lightning Network has tested a protocol designed to enable stablecoins to be issued on the Bitcoin blockchain, its CEO said.Speaking at the Financial Times Crypto and Digital Assets Summit this week, Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark said that the developer had recently executed a test transaction on the Lightning Network with an asset created using the Taproot Assets protocol."We've released an early part of the code in October, and actually just on this past Thursday, demoed the first-ever transaction on Lightning of an asset," Stark said. "The idea is to have crypto dollars and stablecoins" on the Bitcoin blockchain, she explained."I really care deeply about solving real problems for real people, as opposed to meme coins or gambling," Stark said, adding that the ability to position stablecoins and other assets atop Bitcoin will "facilitate new use cases and bring more people on to the internet of money and digital assets."Stark also highlighted a post-halving wave of developer interest in Bitcoin, with "many builders coming back" to the blockchain. She pointed to developers building out decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin, as well as projects such as bitVM, which enables developers to build Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts.Eliminating the "idea of cross border"Lightning Labs' technology is designed "to eliminate the idea of cross border and just enable people to transact globally," Stark said."The concept of a cross-border payment is something that we hear about a lot," she added, before questioning "Why should we even call it ‘cross border’ anymore? We don't have cross-border emails, we don't have cross-border text messages.""I don't have to pay any fees to send an image to a friend across the world—value on the internet, and money, should function the same," she continued.Stark pointed to a recent IMF report which found that Bitcoin "has become an increasingly important channel to send remittances and evade capital controls in emerging markets."That finding, she said, was "not at all surprising to those of us who are on the ground who are working with developers and communities in these places." In markets subject to hyperinflation and authoritarian regimes, she said, "Bitcoin becomes an asset and a means of transacting when they don't have other options."Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

EigenLayer Airdrop Claims Go Live - The Defiant

The EIGEN token is not yet transferable but can be staked and delegated to EigenDA node operators.Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer has opened up airdrop claims for users that participated in its stakedrop.Eligible recipients can claim their EIGEN tokens here.EIGEN Airdrop ClaimIt appears that the project has dropped some of the geographical restrictions for the claim, although VPNs remain blocked.EigenLayer is DeFi’s third-largest protocol, with $14.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).Once claimed, users can stake and delegate their tokens to a node operator for EigenDA, a data availability protocol that is the first AVS built atop EigenLayer. The project has previously stated that it aims to make EIGEN transferable by Sept. 30.

Dogecoin Gears Up For $0.20 Amid Rising Large Holder Netflow - DailyCoin


        
Whales continue withdrawing DOGE from Robinhood, DOGE fetches 2.5%.



On-chain metrics showcase a long-term holder resurgence for DOGE.



DOGE loses bearish constraints, but is yet to break the $0.15 resistance.
The top dog meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) continues the uphill battle towards the long-term price target of $0.20, last seen on April 8, 2024. While the brutally bearish price trend over the past 30 days has sent DOGE back to $0.12 on May 1, 2024, DOGE managed to recoup some of the monthly losses this Friday, picking up 2.5% gains over the past 24 hours.More DOGE Gets Pulled Out Of RobinhoodThe bullish price trend switch for DOGE came after the continuation of whale withdrawals from Robinhood. The popular American crypto exchange is facing legal scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which issued a Wells Notice to the company’s headquarters at Menlo Park, California. Two days after the Wells Notice issuance on May 4, 2024, one Dogecoin whale had transferred 164 million DOGE, equivalent to $25 million, out of the troubled Robinhood exchange. The whale outflows continued in smaller amounts as well, as Dogecoin’s trading volume topped $1 billion in a 24-hour timeframe on May 8, 2024.
Currently, Dogecoin’s trading volume in spot markets is back above $1 billion, while another crypto whale transferred a hefty 120,000,000 Dogecoins DOGE out of Robinhood, piling up to over $18 million at the current exchange rate. Conducted minutes after midnight on May 10, 2024, this transfer can be labeled as an accumulation move.After further investigation by DailyCoin, it was discovered that the receiving crypto wallet now holds a whopping 1,922,284,865 DOGE, summing up to $288.4 million, according to the wallet statement from Blockchair, a popular blockchain explorer.Dogecoin Thrives On Loyal Holder SupportMeanwhile, Dogecoin’s on-chain metrics are pointing to a positive shift among long-term investors, as the cryptocurrency wallets holding DOGE for over a year have substantially increased. While the long-term DOGE holder count has spiked by 26% since last month, there are now more long-term holders than cruisers, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock.By definition, a crypto cruiser is someone who holds the cryptocurrency between 1 and 12 months, while a crypto trader is someone who trades cryptocurrency on a daily basis, therefore only crypto holders who sell during the first month qualify under that category. 
With both DOGE cruisers and daily traders dropping, it could be understood that Dogecoin’s holders are shifting from quick gain expectations to accumulating Dogecoin (DOGE) as a long-term investment solution. As of press time, DOGE is changing hands at $0.1477, sliding down from the daily heights of $0.1535 recorded minutes after midnight on May 10, 2024.On the Flipside
Dogecoin’s liquidations in derivatives markets have piled up to $2.94 million over the latest 24-hour period, despite a relatively narrow price range.
Why This MattersDogecoin’s holder base has continued to grow since 2021, despite the meme coin having significantly less publicity than during the 2021 crypto boom.Check out DailyCoin’s latest crypto stories:Biden Is “Destroying Crypto”: Cardano Founder Lambasts AdminBlast Initiates 15 Million Gold Points Distribution Event

Banking Giant Wells Fargo Reveals Investments in Bitcoin ETFs - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsAmerican banking giant Wells Fargo disclosed investments in multiple Bitcoin ETFs Friday, per a regulatory filing, making it the latest institution to get onboard with the crypto-based vehicles.Paperwork filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that the bank has bought shares of Grayscale's GBTC spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), and that it also has exposure to Bitcoin Depot Inc., a Bitcoin ATM provider.The document also shows that the bank has invested in ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which gives investors exposure to BTC futures—contracts that bet on the future price of the asset.But the exposure is small: The filing shows that Wells Fargo's investment in GBTC amounts to $141,817, while its ProShares investment is under $1,200. And the exposure to Bitcoin Depot stands at just $99.Back in February, a report claimed that Wells Fargo—along with Bank of America's Merrill division—was offering its wealth management clients exposure to Bitcoin ETFs via brokerage accounts.Wells Fargo has repeatedly talked about investment in digital assets, and back in 2019 piloted its own digital currency.The SEC in January approved 11 spot BTC ETFs, and since then, the products have been wildly successful, notching billions of dollars in inflows.Bitcoin's price has soared as ordinary investors have gotten involved in the space by buying shares that track the price of the biggest digital coin. In March, Bitcoin's price hit a new all-time high of $73,747.It has dropped steadily in recent weeks, however—now Bitcoin is trading at nearly $60,545 per coin, CoinGecko shows.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

                        The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommended on May 10 that Nigeria regulate crypto trading platforms amid the African nation’s detainment of two Binance executives, according to a United Nations Thursday staff report.Nigeria Should Regulate Crypto Trading Platforms, IMF Report Says
“Staff recommends that global crypto trading platforms be registered or licensed in Nigeria and subject to the same regulatory requirements applicable to financial intermediaries following the principle of same activity, same risk, and same regulation,” the report read.Nigeria has been in a financial crisis in recent months, with its once-dominant economy expected to plummet to fourth place on the African continent.Despite the country’s inflation hitting a near 28-year high, the IMF report stated that the country’s currency is beginning to steady.“The naira depreciated sharply after the unification of the official foreign exchange windows in June 2023,” the IMF noted. “Following monetary policy tightening in February and March 2024 and a resumption of FX interventions, the naira has started to stabilize.”Binance Executives Detained Amid Nigerian Crypto Crackdown
Nigeria has been cracking down on digital assets recently. In the coming days, the country will ban peer-to-peer payment systems in hopes of preventing manipulation.Some government officials have shifted the blame for the naira’s weakening to cryptocurrencies, with Nigerian Central Bank Governor Olayemi Cardoso alleging in February that $26 billion worth of illicit funds shuffled through Binance Nigeria in 2023 alone. “We are concerned that certain practices that go on that indicate illicit flows through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,” Cardoso said. “In the case of Binance, $26 billion has passed through Binance Nigeria from sources and users we cannot adequately identify.”Concerns have swirled over the country’s arrest of two Binance executives, Nadeem Anjarwalla and Tigran Gambaryan, on money laundering and tax evasion charges in over the crypto exchange’s operations.Both Anjwarwalla and Gambaryan were in the country for policy meetings with regulators amidst tensions with the African nation.Earlier this week, Binance CEO Richard Teng claimed that “unknown persons” proposed a secret settlement between the crypto exchange’s employees and Nigerian officials “to make these issues go away.”Binance refused to engage in such a deal, leading to Anjarwalla and Gambaryan’s eventual capture. The two are due back in court for a hearing in Abuja on May 17.Despite questions over the legality of the Binance executives’ arrest, IMF’s latest staff report may signify a future increase in foreign crypto exchanges in Nigeria overall.

Was Sam Bankman-Fried Proven Right About FTX’s Solvency?

To make it brief, in the days leading up to FTX’s bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022, SBF was frantically trying to shore up a gigantic hole in his company’s balance sheet by raising funds basically from anyone he could. This reportedly includes everyone from Silicon Valley VCs, Saudi money men and even SBF’s archrival ex-CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (who reneged on a handshake buyout deal after reviewing the state of FTX’s finances, only speeding up the ongoing run on the exchange).

Ethereum Layer-2 Scaling Solution Arbitrum Flashes Potentially Bullish Indicator, According to Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB) could be flashing a potentially bullish indicator.
In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 61,900 followers on the social media platform X that ARB’s Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator has presented a buy signal on the asset’s weekly chart.










“It anticipates a one to four candlesticks rebound for ARB!”

Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles.
ARB is trading at $1.04 at time of writing. The 47th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours but down more than 30% in the past month.
Martinez also notes that Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating for 70 days.

The analyst says that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) 90-day ratio indicates the top crypto asset is still in a “prime buy zone” despite its price surge this week.
MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all BTC at the price they were bought). It is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued.

Bitcoin's roadmap to $75K - Why this pattern is critical for BTC's price - AMBCrypto



BTC’s price has appreciated by over 6% as it approached $63k on the charts
Most metrics and indicators flashed green too

Bitcoin’s [BTC] price action once again turned volatile as it swiftly approached $63k on the charts. In the meantime, however, a pattern seemed to be forming on the cryptocurrency’s price chart – A sign that BTC’s price might hit $75k in the coming weeks. 
Bitcoin’s price action looks promising
According to CoinMarketCap, BTC has gained by more than 6% over the past week, with it appreciating by 3% in the last 24 hours alone. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $62,998.95 with a market capitalization of over $1.24 trillion. 
Despite its fall from its ATH, however, most market analysts remain positive about the crypto’s price action. In fact, AMBCrypto had previously reported that Ki Young Ju, CEO of analytics firm CryptoQuant, claimed that Bitcoin’s network fundamentals could support a market valuation “three times its current size.” 
While BTC’s price action turned bullish, Titan of Cryptos, a popular crypto-analyst, pointed out in a tweet that an inverse head-and-shoulder pattern was forming on BTC’s price chart. As per the tweet, the pattern suggested that BTC’s price might soon cross its all-time high (ATH) and hit $75k in the coming weeks. 
However, the tweet also mentioned the adverse scenario. If everything doesn’t fall into place, then BTC might drop down to $56k again. Hence, it’s worth taking a closer look at the cryptocurrency’s state to see which outcome is more likely. 
What to expect from Bitcoin?
AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have been dropping. This clearly meant that buying pressure was high, which can be inferred as a bullish signal. 
Its binary CDD suggested that long-term holders’ movements in the last 7 days were lower than average, meaning that they have a motive to hold their coins. On top of that, BTC’s NVT ratio dropped last week, meaning that it was undervalued. These metrics backed the possibility of BTC touching or going above its ATH.

However, its aSORP flashed opposing signals. 
At press time, BTC’s aSORP was red, indicating that more investors have been selling at a profit. In the middle of a bull market, this can indicate a market top. 
Source: CryptoQuant
To check whether the market has reached its top, AMBCrypto then analyzed BTC’s daily chart. As per our analysis, BTC was testing its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at the time. A successful breakout above it would ensure a sustained bull rally.

Its Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a sharp uptick. 
On the contrary, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) looked bearish. This was a sign that BTC’s price might start to decline, which could push its value down to $56k on the charts.

Dogecoin Whales Shake The Market With 265 Million DOGE Buy, Can They Send It To $1? | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin holders are accumulating DOGE tokens amidst the recent price dip from $0.1686 to $0.1423. DOGE recently went on a price surge to cross above the $0.168 price level on May 6 to push 5.21 million addresses into profitability. However, the cryptocurrency reversed and went on a little correction throughout May 7. According to on-chain data from Santiment, large DOGE holders capitalized on this drop and added around 265.86 million DOGE tokens to their wallets. 
Whales Accumulating DOGE
According to data from Santiment, an on-chain analytics platform, DOGE addresses holding between 100 million to 1 billion DOGE recently saw their cumulative holdings increase by 1% on May 7 to reach 21% of the total supply. Interestingly, the number of tokens held by this cohort of traders increased by 265.86 million DOGE, worth approximately $41.2 million. This increase, when compared to their holdings a day before, indicated a notable change from a previous 342 million DOGE outflow from large holders. 

Recent on-chain data suggests that this accumulation from exchanges is still ongoing. Interestingly, data from Whale Alerts indicated an example of an accumulation of 120 million DOGE tokens worth $18 million from crypto exchange Robinhood in the last few hours. This continued accumulation suggests that a few whales are still in bullish sentiment for DOGE and are positioning themselves for when their bullish outlook eventually materializes. 

Santiment
Why Does This Matter For Dogecoin?
Whale movement and sentiment are essential for any cryptocurrency, particularly for a meme token like Dogecoin, whose value is mostly driven by hype and market sentiment and not by a demand for its utility. These whales typically move the market, and an accumulation or selloff from a few large traders could change the sentiment of other investors. 
At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1516. The price correction between May 6 and May 9 seems to have ended after bouncing off at the $0.143 level. Currently, DOGE is up by 3% in the past 24 hours and 14% in the past seven days. Consequently, this shows that the accumulation may have contributed to a bullish effect on the price of DOGE.

On a larger timeframe, the $0.143 price level is a strong support level for DOGE. The recent bounce could be a starting point for the next leg up to new highs this month. A continued accumulation from the bulls could send the price of Dogecoin across resistances at $0.16 and $0.20. This, in turn, could lead to DOGE finally pumping above its current all-time high and eventually reaching $1. For this to happen, many bullish factors apart from accumulation need to be put in place. On the other hand, a bearish reversal could see DOGE falling to the next support at $0.13. 
According to Santiment, most of the attention surrounding meme coins is going into TRUMP, TURBO, PONKE, and MYRO.

Crypto Analyst Updates Outlook on Altcoins and the Potential of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF Approval This Month - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is suggesting that altcoins could be on the rise as hopes for an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval this month from the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) this month dwindle.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 717,300 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins are waking up as Bitcoin (BTC) hovers near $61,000.










“Markets did bounce from the crucial area at $61,000 and Altcoins are waking up. 
It’s the final accumulation period before the big surge.”
BTC is worth $60,933 at time of writing, down 2% on the day.
Looking specifically at the altcoin Arbitrum (ARB), the analyst thinks the ETH layer-2 protocol is near the end of its full correction.
“This one has a full correction and is at the end stage of the correction.
Massive cascade in the past weeks, through which the markets often fill that wick in the weeks after.
In that regard, markets are close to the end of the correction.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
ARB is trading for $1.01 currently, down 2% on the day.
Van de Poppe also asserts that he doesn’t believe the SEC will approve an ETH ETF until at least July or August of this year.
“There won’t be an Ethereum ETF this month. 
It is likely to be a delay or extension of 60 days, during which July/August will be the big moment for the markets.
In terms of expectations?
The markets are bottoming in the next 1-2 weeks and rotate back up from that news.”
ETH is worth $2,914 at time of writing, down 5% on the week.

BREAKING: JPMorgan, Largest Bank in the US, Announces It Owns Bitcoin Spot ETF Holdings - Bitcoin Sistemi


JPMorgan, the largest US bank, owns approximately $1 million worth of Bitcoin Spot ETF shares, according to a filing with the SEC.
This statement comes despite the bank's CEO Jamie Dimon having previously expressed strong anti-Bitcoin views.


Dimon has expressed skepticism towards Bitcoin, going so far as to call it a “ponzi scheme” and “a scam with no future as a currency.” He has consistently advised investors to stay away from the volatile digital asset.
However, the latest statement shows a divergence between the CEO's personal views and the bank's investment strategies. JPMorgan Chase is an authorized participant in Blackrock's spot Bitcoin ETF, a stark contrast to Dimon's public stance on cryptocurrency.

Crypto Markets Drop on Disappointing U.S. Economic Data - The Defiant

Bitcoin plunged after lacklustre U.S. economic data and hawkish comments from Dallas Fed President Lori Logan.Crypto markets fell sharply on Friday morning, reversing an earlier rally that had propelled the world's largest cryptocurrency to as high as $64,212 this week.Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $61,015 — down 2% in the last 24 hours. Ether (ETH) is down nearly 4%, with Dogecoin (DOGE) tumbling over 3.5%. Most digital assets in the CoinGecko top 100 posted losses.BTC PriceThe catalysts for the drop in crypto prices were disappointing U.S. economic data and hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Lori Logan.“It’s just too early to think about cutting rates,” Logan said on Friday at an event in New Orleans. “I need to see some of these uncertainties resolved about the path that we’re on and we need to remain very flexible to policy and continue to look at the data that’s coming in and watch how financial conditions are evolving.”Consumer sentiment data released Friday morning showed a significant increase in inflation expectations, dampening market enthusiasm. The preliminary May reading for the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index was 67.4, falling well below the Dow Jones estimate of 76 and representing its lowest reading in six months.Since their July 2023 meeting, Fed officials have maintained the benchmark U.S. interest rate at a steady range of 5.25% to 5.5%.Token unlocks loomCrypto analytics firm 10x Research reported on Wednesday that over $2 billion worth of tokens will be added to circulation in the next two months.The report notes that $97 million of Aptos (APT), $79 million of Starkware (STRK), $94 million of Arbitrum (ARB), $330 million of Avalanche (AVAX), and nearly $1 billion of SUI (SUI), among others, are slated to be unlocked.“A rapid succession of nearly $2 billion of token unlocks during the next ten weeks could lower the market for altcoins," said 10x Research in a report seen by The Defiant.According to Michael Van de Poppe, CEO of MN Trading, Bitcoin is currently at its range low.“This is technically the area where you'd prefer to see it hold, so the upward momentum continues, and the range holds,” he said on X. “If this doesn't hold, then we might expect $52-55K as a potential low on this correction.”Grayscale Bitcoin Trust sees inflowsIn May, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw inflows of $66.9 million, a change after experiencing continuous outflows totaling over $17.5 billion in the last 78 days following its Jan. 11 conversion into an ETF.Meanwhile, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has attracted the largest amount of capital, totaling nearly $15.5 billion to date.

                        Trading volume on major cryptocurrency exchanges has experienced a significant decline in April, coinciding with Bitcoin’s retreat from its all-time high.Spot trading volume on centralized exchanges like Coinbase Global, Binance, and Kraken dropped by 32.6% to $2 trillion last month, as reported by research firm CCData.Additionally, derivatives trading volume saw its first decrease in seven months, falling by 26.1% to $4.57 trillion.Trading Volume Declines Due to Tightening Financial Conditions
The surge in trading volume witnessed earlier in the year, following the introduction of US exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin, waned due to the tightening of financial conditions in the United States.The Federal Reserve’s efforts to address persistent inflation challenges contributed to this shift.Prior to the April 19 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced the supply of new coins by half, there was anticipation and excitement within the market.Jacob Joseph, a research analyst at CCData, told Bloomberg that the decline in trading activity on centralized exchanges after the Bitcoin halving event aligns with patterns observed in previous cycles.He further explained that the release of higher-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data and escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East injected uncertainty and fear into the market.These factors and negative net flows from spot Bitcoin ETFs led to major crypto assets reaching their range lows.The decline in trading volumes also affected the spot market share of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.For the first time since September 2023, Binance’s spot market share dropped by almost 4% to 33.8%, reaching its lowest level since January, according to CCData.The CME Group, a prominent derivatives marketplace, also experienced a decline in crypto trading volume for the first time in seven months.In April, its derivatives trading volume decreased by nearly 20% to $124 billion, as reported by CCData.Despite the decline, Jacob Joseph mentioned that trading activity on centralized exchanges, while slower compared to its peak in March, remains at an elevated level compared to previous months.CEX Trading Volume Triples in 2024
Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) like Binance experienced a large surge in trading volumes between October 2023 and March 2024, according to Bybit’s 2024 Institutional Industry Report released on April 18.Notably, OKX saw a 278% increase in 30-day volumes since October, followed closely by Binance, which saw a 239% surge.Bybit exchange also demonstrated impressive growth, adding 264% to its trading volumes during the same period.As confirmed by a spokesperson for Bybit, these exchanges have outpaced the industry’s average growth rate of 255%.The U.S.-based exchange Coinbase also witnessed growth, albeit slightly trailing behind with a 193% increase in trading volume.The CEX growth hasn’t surpassed the even more rapid expansion of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), however.Leading DEX Uniswap v3, for instance, saw a 320% increase in volumes during the same period, as highlighted in Bybit’s data.Uniswap has surpassed $2 trillion in lifetime trading volume.

Dogwifhat’s $5 Dream Inches Closer As Early WIF Whales Return - DailyCoin


        
An early bird investor who made $8M on dogwifhat comes back for more WIF.



dogwifhat fetches over $1.2B in daily trading volume on Derivatives markets.



Chart analyst examines the bullish pennant’s potential on WIF’s 4-hour charts.
Solana’s meme coin frenzy is unexpectedly returning after a period of calm. A change in large investor sentiment was spotted by LookOnChain, a popular crypto whale tracking agency that notified their X audience about an abnormally large acquisition of dogwifhat (WIF) in the early hours of Friday, May 10, 2024.
In further detail, one Solana (SOL) whale traded a whopping 4.2M of the popular stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) for 1.4M Dogwifhat (WIF) tokens at an average price of $2.99. Digging deeper into the relevant whale’s wallet, DailyCoin discovered that WIF is now the 2nd largest holding in the whale’s portfolio.Interestingly, Dogwifhat (WIF) stands out as the only meme coin in the whale’s crypto portfolio that is listed on centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs). In contrast to other holdings like GEN, Pepe On Fire and Boxxy Coin, WIF is the only major meme coin, currently boasting a global market capitalization of $3,168,454,299.A Bullish Pennant To Save WIF From The Bears?Following the gargantuan whale’s acquisition of 1.4M dogwifhat (WIF), crypto analysts believe this to be a sign of early investor return to Solana’s pink hat-wearing canine cryptocurrency. According to LookOnChain, the Solana whale has previously made a whopping $8 million profit from his early entrance into dogwifhat.Returning a colossal 206,014% profit since the meme coin’s inception 5 months ago, WIF surged all the way to $4.83 on March 31, 2024. However, this milestone has a bittersweet feeling among crypto investors on X, as many have drawn the $5 price target as a key milestone in dogwifhat’s long-term growth.Certainly, dogwifhat backtracked 33.6% from the all-time high, but today’s 12% upswing has brought in some fresh air for WIF holders. To illustrate, crypto analyst YG Crypto spotted a bullish pennant for dogwifhat (WIF) on the 4-hour technical charts. This pattern usually hints at a double-digit breakout, if WIF closes the day above the upper trendline, depicted in blue color.
In such a case, trader YG Crypto forecasts a 50% run for WIF, which could be sufficient to reach dogwifhat’s long-term price target of $5. After being rejected at the price range again in April, dogwifhat’s early investor support could serve as a game-changer for the emerging meme coin. As of press time, the #39 seated Dogwifhat is changing hands at $3.17, according to CoinGecko.On the Flipside
While dogwifhat (WIF) finished March 2024 as the third largest meme coin by global market cap, the competing meme coin Pepe (PEPE) soon outshined WIF due to deeper spot liquidity.



However, Dogwifhat managed to restore dominance in derivatives markets, as dogwifhat’s trading volume in futures spiked by 15% to claim above $1.24 billion in the latest 24-hour period.
Why This MattersAccording to Dune Analytics, the meme coin department has been outperforming other strong narrative crypto sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) and real-world assets (RWAs), yielding a 315% year-to-date profit growth.Read DailyCoin’s popular cryptocurrency news:Robinhood Sees Massive Dogecoin Outflows After Wells NoticeCrypto Mixers Facing the Blender as U.S. Amps up Enforcement

Millions In Dogecoin (DOGE) Pulled From Robinhood Following SEC Wells Notice ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Tens of millions of dollars worth of the leading meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) has exited Robinhood amid potential legal action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the popular trading platform.



Robinhood Sees Massive DOGE Withdrawals 



Robinhood has seen a significant exodus of funds as users rush to pull their Dogecoin holdings from the platform.



According to X-based blockchain tracker bot Whale Alert, a whopping 120 million DOGE tokens — valued at an estimated $18.1 million based on the market price at the time — were transferred from Robinhood to an unknown wallet. 



The receiver of this massive transfer, identified only by the address “DDuXG,” is not new to crypto. DDuXG is a Dogecoin whale well-known for making huge moves in the market. Following the latest transaction, DDuXG’s wallet address now holds a staggering 1.92 billion DOGE, equivalent to $292.4 million.



Additionally, on-chain tracking platform Bitcoinsensus revealed on May 8 that 164 million DOGE worth $25 million was transferred out of Robinhood.

&nbsp



These significant withdrawals come in the wake of Robinhood’s legal drama with the SEC.



SEC Preparing To Sue Robinhood



As we reported previously, Robinhood, which only offers 15 cryptocurrencies, including DOGE, on its U.S. platform, received a Wells notice — a preliminary warning from the securities watchdog about potential enforcement action — on May 4.



Speaking recently on CNBC Last Call, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said the SEC opted to pursue regulation by enforcement despite the stock trading platform meeting with the SEC 16 times “in good faith” in a bid to register as a special purpose broker-dealer supporting cryptocurrencies. 



The attack against Robinhood comes as the SEC has ramped up its regulatory warnings issued toward U.S.-based crypto companies, with the agency recently serving Ethereum development company Consensys and decentralized exchange (DEX) developer Uniswap Labs with Wells Notices. 



The lack of federal regulatory clarity has undoubtedly created an uneven playing field for crypto market participants, challenging regulatory compliance and hampering mainstream adoption. Yet, without a clear regulatory framework, regulators will likely continue to crack down on crypto firms in the coming months.

Pepe (PEPE) price prediction as a new challenger emerges - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Pepe (PEPE) defies volatility, bullish pennant forms, potential breakout predicted.

Pepe’s resilience challenged by Kangamoon’s innovative approach.

Recently, Pepe (PEPE) has been making waves with its resilient performance amidst market fluctuations. Despite its current price decline, market analysts have pointed to bullish Pepe price prediction.
However, a new challenger, Kangamoon, has entered the arena, aiming to disrupt the meme coin sector.
Let’s delve into the price predictions for Pepe and explore Kangamoon’s potential impact on the market.
Pepe (PEPE) price prediction: riding the bullish wave
Pepe (PEPE) has demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of market volatility, defying expectations with its upward trajectory. Despite its low utility, Pepe has carved out a niche for itself, outperforming even established altcoins like Solana (SOL) and giant meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).
Recent analysis indicates a bullish pennant pattern formation, signalling a potential breakout above the $0.000009123 resistance level.
Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggest a sustained bullish momentum, with a target set for a new all-time high (ATH) above $0.0000107.
In addition, investors are also eyeing a golden cross formation at $0.000006862, further fueling optimism for Pepe’s future.
A new meme coin challenging giants like Pepe
Enter Kangamoon (KANG), the latest entrant in the meme coin arena, poised to disrupt the status quo.
With its unique blend of SocialFi and Play-to-Earn elements, Kangamoon aims to create a vibrant community of meme enthusiasts while offering opportunities for users to interact, grow, and earn.
Integrating GameFi features, Kangamoon invites users to embark on quests, engage in epic battles, and earn $KANG tokens and exclusive rewards.
Boasting a presale event that has already raised over $6.5 million, Kangamoon is generating significant interest among investors. Interested investors can purchase Kangamoon’s native token $KANG at $0.025 per token with only 1.10% of the presale tokens sold.
As the project progresses through its roadmap, including the launch of its P2E arcade and merchandise website, Kangamoon presents a formidable challenge to established meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).
Conclusion
As Pepe (PEPE) charts its course amid market fluctuations, the emergence of Kangamoon (KANG) introduces a new dynamic to the meme coin landscape.
While Pepe’s price predictions point to a potential bullish rally, Kangamoon’s innovative approach to SocialFi and Play-to-Earn gaming presents a compelling alternative for investors and meme enthusiasts alike.
As both projects evolve and compete for dominance, the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits the next chapter in this unfolding saga.

New Critical Binance Move by the US Department of Justice - Bitcoin Sistemi

The US Department of Justice has selected Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA), a consulting firm specializing in corruption and fraud investigations, as an outside observer for Binance. This decision comes after Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was found guilty of violating US anti-money laundering regulations and trade sanctions.
FRA was selected from several top contenders, including the elite Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, which was initially chosen. The selection process was secret and the Justice Department refused to comment on the matter.


The appointment of an external monitor was a condition of the plea deal Binance struck in November. In addition, Binance agreed to pay a hefty $4.3 billion fine. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao also pleaded guilty and agreed to resign as CEO. Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison on April 30.
As the designated monitor, FRA will be responsible for ensuring Binance complies with the plea agreement. This will include gaining access to Binance's internal records, facilities, and employees to report to the government on the company's activities.






FRA previously advised Geneva-based commodities company Gunvor SA as it negotiated a $660 million settlement with the Department of Justice over foreign bribery charges.
Sullivan & Cromwell, a firm approached by many Wall Street banks and executives, was the frontrunner to monitor Binance. However, controversy surrounding the firm's work for Binance's former rival FTX caused the government to choose a different direction.


Sullivan & Cromwell served as one of the firms working for FTX before its bankruptcy in November 2022. Following the bankruptcy, he became FTX's primary outside counsel and billed approximately $170 million for efforts to recover funds for FTX's creditors.

Traders shift gears to back BTC ETFs after a failed Bitcoin halving - Join the bandwagon?

Crypto traders are currently backing Bitcoin ETFs after BTC halving expectations fell through. In April, the crypto market had a rather uneventful month after a strong surge in the first quarter, which propelled Bitcoin (BTC) to reach a record-breaking high of $73,750.In the last month, as of May 10, 2024, BTC experienced a decline currently trading slightly above $60K. This crash can also be attributed to the increase in geopolitical tensions and wars. With the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, responses to geopolitical events are swift, surpassing the speed of stock reactions.Bitcoin adoption takes a different pathCurrently, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) stands at $60,325.53, reflecting a 1.0% decrease compared to an hour ago and a 2.7% decrease since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 2.5% lower than its value a week ago.In addition, the current global crypto market cap stands at $2.35 trillion, with a decrease of 2.27% in the last 24 hours and a significant increase of 97.31% compared to one year ago. Currently, BTC’s market cap stands at $1.19 Trillion, indicating a Bitcoin dominance of 50.56%. Meanwhile, the market cap of Stablecoins stands at $161 Billion, representing a 6.82% share of the overall crypto market cap.The Bitcoin halving event takes place every four years. After the recent completion of Bitcoin’s April halving, there is a lot of speculation about the potential price increase for the crypto in the coming months. This is mainly due to the decreased supply of Bitcoins, which could lead to increased scarcity.Since the introduction of the first Bitcoin ETFs on Jan 11, the asset has experienced a remarkable surge of over 50%, reaching a new all-time high of nearly $74,000. The ETFs are a significant development in Bitcoin’s trajectory, providing a regulated and convenient avenue for both retail and institutional investors to enter the crypto market. This development not only improves liquidity, but also helps maintain price stability.BTC ETFs market performanceBitcoin is frequently praised as a safeguard against inflation. Bitcoin has a limited supply. This move stands in stark contrast to traditional fiat currencies, which are subject to unlimited issuance by central banks. Therefore, during periods of inflation, the worth of fiat currencies typically decreases. Meanwhile, certain market observers regard Bitcoin as a valuable asset that can safeguard wealth in the face of rampant inflation, thanks to its finite supply. It is important to mention that the crypto space is highly unpredictable.Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a decline in investor interest in recent weeks. In the last ten days, there has been a noticeable trend of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs experiencing a total outflow of $230 million, as indicated by the data. Market participants, including Schiff, a Bitcoin critic, have expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of this trend on the price.In line with the economist’s perspective, Bitcoin ETFs experienced their biggest one-day outflow on May 1, as a substantial amount of $563.7 million was withdrawn. During this period, there was a simultaneous decrease in Bitcoin’s price, falling by 5% from $63,000 to below $60,000.The initial enthusiasm surrounding the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted a large number of buyers, has now transformed into a significant pool of potential sellers, as per Schiff. This has heightened the risk of further price declines.In addition, several other ETFs, including Ark 21shares (ARKB), WisdomTree’s BTCO, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, also saw positive movements. ARKB experienced $4.4 million in inflows, while BTCO and EZBC recorded $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively.Based on data from Coinglass, the recent drop in prices can be partially attributed to the rise in crypto liquidations, which amounted to $145M.

Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Can Break Out From Falling Pennant, But Can It Reach $1?


																The XRP price, like the rest of the crypto industry, continues to struggle against the bearish winds that have taken over. This has seen its price consistently decline in spite of bulls’ best efforts to prop it up. However, it seems all hope is not lost for the altcoin as expectations are that it will recover soon enough. More specifically, crypto analyst WalterMoon is particularly bullish on the XRP price, noting that it is possible that it will break out of its current pennant.
Analyzing The XRP Price Movement
To try and pinpoint where the XRP price is headed, the crypto analyst first analyzed the movement of the altcoin over the last few weeks. This analysis showed a consistent breakout trend, albeit short-lived, that suggests that the altcoin could be getting ready to mount another one soon.

	Related Reading



One of these breakout trends took place last month in May when the price had entered a failing channel. Eventually, the XRP price was able to muster enough momentum, even after breaking below its support line below $0.5 and then made a run for $0.52.
Again, this is seen later in the month when the price once again fell into a falling channel. This decline saw it fall below support. But like the previous time, it was able to move upward inside this falling channel and eventually broke out of the channel.

Source: Tradingview.com
This trend was recorded a number of times in the month of May, showing XRP’s strength in the market right now. However, the altcoin has fallen inside another falling channel once again, but can it maintain its breakout trend from last month?
Gathering Support Inside A Pennant
Crypto analyst WalterMoon has identified the XRP price inside a falling channel and as it continues to decline inside this pennant, the price has taken hit after hit. But given the performance from the last month, Moon believes there is still upside to come for XRP.

	Related Reading



According to the analyst, there is a possibility that the altcoin can exit its current pennant by bouncing off the support at $0.533. In this case, it could send the price as high as $0.54, like it did the previous times. “Now, I think that Ripple can bounce up from support line to $0.5330, thereby exiting from pennant,” the analyst said.
Despite the bullish outlook, WalterMoon’s target is still conservative for all intents and purposes. The target still remains above the $0.54 level, which, unfortunately, doesn’t show much expectation for the XRP price to cross $1.

DOJ rejects Sullivan & Cromwell, picks FRA for Binance's monitorship - Crypto Briefing




The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has chosen Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) for Binance’s three-year monitorship over initial favorite Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), BNB Bloomberg reported today.This is a requirement of Binance’s November plea deal for violating money-laundering regulations and trade sanctions. Binance also agreed to a $4.3 billion penalty, and CEO Changpeng Zhao stepped down and received a four-month prison sentence.FRA’s role will involve scrutinizing Binance’s internal operations to ensure compliance and reporting findings to the government. The firm has a history of similar assignments, including consultancy for Gunvor SA during its $660 million settlement with the DOJ.The selection of FRA over Sullivan & Cromwell, a prestigious Wall Street law firm, marks a shift from the expected outcome. The firm was initially considered for the role but ultimately rejected. This is likely due to their past work on FTX, Binance’s rival crypto exchange that went bankrupt in November 2022.Sullivan & Cromwell has come under fire from FTX investors for its involvement with the company. A group of FTX investors, who initiated a lawsuit against the firm in February, claimed the firm knowingly provided services or assistance that directly enabled or facilitated FTX’s fraudulent activities.This week, FTX unveiled a new plan to pay out at least 118% of recognized claims to 98% of its creditors. The reorganization plan, subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, faced pushback from Sunil Kavuri, who represents the largest group of FTX creditors. He argued that repayments should reflect the current market prices of assets, not their value at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy.Kavuri also cited S&C’s previous relationship with the exchange. He opposes the inclusion of an exculpation clause that would protect S&C from lawsuits related to misconduct.The DOJ’s choice of FRA for the Binance monitorship has been welcomed by those affected by the FTX collapse, with Kavuri stating, “Truth prevails.”However, the report noted that S&C might still be appointed as a monitor for Binance by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

SBF was convicted of multiple fraud charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison.



Shares a dormitory with 35 other inmates and subsists on rice and beans.



Plans to appeal his conviction, asserting his innocence.
Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former CEO of FTX, became one of crypto’s most influential players. At the height of his career, he managed one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, wielding considerable influence and capital. However, the collapse of FTX in 2022 led to his arrest and subsequent conviction on multiple charges of fraud, resulting in a 25-year prison sentence. In a recent interview from prison, SBF shed light on his life in prison, his ongoing legal battle, and the events that led to FTX’s downfall.SBF Subsists on Prison Rice and Beans, Plays VideogamesCurrently detained at MDC Brooklyn where he serves his prison sentence, SBF shares a dormitory with 35 other inmates and survives primarily on rice and beans from the prison commissary. He has adjusted to prison life by watching movies, playing video games, and avoiding the prison’s poor-quality vegan entrees. 
While Sam Bankman-Fried claims to be managing well in prison, he acknowledges the difficulties of life at the Metropolitan Detention Center. The prison’s dormitory-style setup leaves little privacy, with prisoners often bartering for commodities like rice. Although he has regular access to his prescription medications and legal team, he remains unsure about his long-term placement. His family and legal advisors are concerned about his potential transfer to a federal penitentiary, which could subject him to a months-long journey across the U.S. on a prison bus.SBF Still Believes He Could Have Saved FTXIn the 75-minute prison interview, SBF reiterated that he didn’t commit any crimes, blaming FTX’s bankruptcy on a combination of market conditions and poor legal advice. 
He argued that the primary reason for the collapse was a liquidity crunch exacerbated by a bank run and the actions of competitors. He also said that he still believes that the company could have avoided bankruptcy if he was still in control. SBF also acknowledged mistakes in the management of Alameda Research. He claimed that he asked Caroline Ellison to lead Alameda after pressure from lawyers, who warned him about conflicts of interest in leading the two firms. For that reason, he regretted not finding a different executive for the role but maintained that he didn’t knowingly engage in fraudulent activities.SBF Still Plans to Appeal His SentenceThe former FTX CEO still believes he can challenge the sentence, which he argues was based on incomplete information and a rushed bankruptcy filing. He believes that Sullivan & Cromwell, FTX’s outside counsel, had undue influence over the proceedings and led prosecutors to target him unfairly. His conviction is currently under appeal, with his legal team preparing to file their brief in the coming months.Bankman-Fried was arrested on December 12, 2022, in the Bahamas and extradited to the United States to face charges of wire fraud, conspiracy, and other financial crimes. Following a highly publicized trial, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March 2024, after being found guilty of siphoning off customer funds to his trading firm, Alameda Research.On the Flipside
FTX is currently auctioning off its assets to repay creditors and users of the platform. This includes billions in Solana tokens, of which FTX was a major investor. 



Following the FTX collapse, SBF became one of the most hated people in crypto. His actions also resulted in regulatory pressures on the industry across the globe, as governments hastened to prevent a repeat of the collapse. 
Why This MattersThe SBF trial was the biggest legal case in crypto history, while the FTX collapse affected thousands of users, who lost millions of dollars. Read more about SBF’s plans to appeal his sentence: SBF Plans to Appeal 25-Year Sentence, Citing “Crucial Evidence”Read more about the FTX’s ongoing impact on Solana: Solana Drops on FTX Liquidation, Open Interest Drops

New Development in the SEC-Coinbase Case that Will Determine the Fate of Cryptocurrencies in the US - Bitcoin Sistemi


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the court to reject cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's appeal, stating that “there is no significant basis for disagreement.”
Coinbase last month filed a temporary appeal following a judge's decision to allow a lawsuit involving the SEC and Coinbase to proceed without dismissal.


The appeal was based on differing interpretations of the Howey Test, a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case frequently used by the SEC to determine whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract and therefore a security.
Coinbase's dislike of the Howey Test and the current framework for securities regulation does not provide a compelling reason to prematurely approve an appeal in this case, the SEC said in a statement today. The SEC also stated that Coinbase's decision to regulate its business in ways that could make it costly to comply with existing laws and its desire to rewrite decades of established legal precedent to suit its policy goals and business needs are not valid grounds for an appeal.






The SEC also noted, however, that an appeal filed before a case is concluded is unlikely to be granted. The failure of the SEC's appeal in the case it filed against Ripple last year was also an indication of this.
In her decision to proceed with the case, Judge Katherine Polk Failla disagreed with Coinbase's argument that investment agreements need a formal contract. He noted that when a customer purchases a token from Coinbase, they are not just purchasing a token, they are also purchasing that “token's digital ecosystem.”


In order for Coinbase's appeal to proceed, Judge Failla must grant leave to appeal. If the appeal is allowed to proceed, the remainder of the case will be put on hold in the trial court and the exchange will then await a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

                        Bitcoin (BTC) is rapidly evolving. While the Bitcoin network has primarily been used for payment transactions, current activity appears to be resembling that of Ethereum during the height of decentralized application (Dapp) projects. The introduction of Bitcoin Runes and BRC-20 tokens  – which emerged during the time of the fourth Bitcoin halving event – has likely sparked the evolution of Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (DeFi).The Emergence of Bitcoin DeFi 
Rena Shah, VP of Products at Trust Machines – a team focused on growing the Bitcoin economy – told Cryptonews that two years ago, Bitcoin DeFi wasn’t a narrative the ecosystem was discussing. Yet Shah noted that the emergence of staking platforms and lending protocols across the Bitcoin network has created interest among investors in transitioning assets from a store of value to a source of value. “The desire to go from a passive to a productive Bitcoin asset is real in 2024,” she said. “We have been building towards this future because we can see that Bitcoin DeFi is appealing not just to retail investors but also to institutional investors.”Institutions Will Show Interest in Bitcoin DeFi
Data from DeFiLlama shows that Bitcoin’s total value locked (TVL) is roughly $1.2 billion. Yet, according to Shah, nearly $1 trillion in capital is locked on the Bitcoin blockchain.“Even the smallest percentages of capital becoming productive in DeFi will make huge waves in the Bitcoin ecosystem,” Shah pointed out. This, along with the recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, is increasing the potential for Bitcoin DeFi applications. In particular, this will likely appeal to institutions holding Bitcoin and retail investors. Tycho Onnasch, the co-founder of Zest Protocol, told Cryptonews that he believes BTC is a more institutional asset than the rest of crypto. “Hence, I expect institutions to play a larger part in using and bootstrapping Bitcoin DeFi,” said Onnasch. Bitcoin DeFi Applications For Institutions 
Although Bitcoin DeFi is still a relatively new concept, a number of projects seek to enable and advance the sector.For example, Onnasch explained that Zest Protocol is creating a lending protocol built specifically for Bitcoin. He mentioned that the goal behind the platform is to create a permissionless financial infrastructure for BTC lending markets.“Zest enables users to collateralize BTC to borrow other tokens such as stablecoins,” he said. “The platform also lets users earn yield on their BTC.” Indeed, the primary use case behind Bitcoin DeFi applications seems to be ensuring that Bitcoin becomes a more productive asset for investors.Dr. Chiente Hsu, Co-Founder of ALEX and XLink, told Cryptonews that Alex is a new finance layer for the Bitcoin network. “Our goal is to seamlessly integrate Bitcoin with layer-2 (L2) solutions and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) world,” said Hsu. “This will allow us to expand the Bitcoin economy,” said Hsu.For instance, Hsu explained that investors can earn yield on their BTC by connecting a Bitcoin wallet to XLink. He noted that XLink is powered by ALEX’s automated market maker (AMM) and decentralized exchange (DEX). This will allow cross-chain swaps between Bitcoin L2s and the EVM world. “Bitcoin DeFi for institutions will be the pursuit of Bitcoin yield generating assets,” said Hsu. Hsu believes this will likely be the case due to the large amount of capital on the Bitcoin network.“There’s well over $1 trillion in Bitcoin capital that is ‘idle’ in the sense that its value rises and falls relative to the Bitcoin spot price,” he said. “But unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin can’t be natively locked to generate a yield. This is a solution that ALEX is actively pursuing, which will enable institutions that hold Bitcoin to earn yield through their Bitcoin capital.”Bitcoin DeFi Resembles Ethereum Counterparts
Another interesting point is that while Bitcoin DeFi is unique, applications tend to resemble DeFi projects on Ethereum (ETH). This is important to consider, as institutions have started to show interest in many current DeFi applications. Digital asset management firm Fireblocks recently found increased institutional DeFi activity on the Fireblocks platform. According to the firm, there was a 75% jump in the first quarter of 2024. Fireblocks reported that some of the most popular Dapps that institutional customers interact with across swapping, lending, staking, and bridging include Uniswap, Aave, Curve, 1inch, and Jupiter. Jeff Yin, CEO of Merlin Chain – a Bitcoin L2 facilitating fast, cost-effective transactions with support for BTC Dapps – told Cryptonews that DEXs, derivatives, and lending are all areas where BTC has learned extensively from ETH. He added that many new protocols are emerging. “For example, ‘Surf’ is a derivatives trading protocol that launched on Merlin Chain and now boasts a daily trading volume of over $10 million. These are similar to their Ethereum counterparts,” said Yin. Yin elaborated that a specific Bitcoin DeFi application would replicate one of the largest ETH DeFi protocols, Lido – which holds $28 billion and accounts for half of Ethereum’s DeFi TVL. “SolvBTC is currently developing an underlying BTC yield protocol,” said Yin. “Additionally, Unicross has implemented a Rune trading protocol on a BTC L2, allowing users to trade Layer 1 (L1) assets more cheaply on L2. These represent the more innovative aspects of the sector.” Bitcoin DeFi May Overtake Ethereum 
While Bitcoin DeFi may appear similar to Ethereum, Shah believes that decentralized finance using BTC may eventually surpass Ethereum. “Looking at DappRadar, Ethereum has over 600 active apps with varying volume and activity,” said Shah. “I have no reason to expect that Bitcoin DeFi cannot match Ethereum, and eventually flip it for Dapps in the ecosystem.”Certain solutions are also making it easier to bring Ethereum Dapps to Bitcoin. Zack Voell, Director of Marketing at Botanix Labs, told Cryptonews that Botanix had created a “Spiderchain” that easily enables DeFi on Bitcoin. “Spiderchain creates a fully EVM-equivalent environment for Dapps and smart contracts on Ethereum to be copy-pasted to run natively on Bitcoin,” said Voell. “Botanix Labs is building the Spiderchain to combine the two most Lindy technologies in crypto — the EVM and Bitcoin — instead of trying to reinvent a completely new protocol or virtual machine.”Challenges May Slow Adoption 
Although it’s too soon to determine the fate of Bitcoin DeFi, certain challenges may slow adoption. For instance, Yin pointed out that liquidity fragmentation often results from the difficulty of implementing DeFi on an L1 network. This, in turn, forces most activities to disperse across various L2 solutions, yet Yin noted that this may make it difficult to concentrate liquidity. “A potential solution could be to create omnichain liquidity, similar to the Stone protocol in the Ethereum ecosystem,” he said. “We look forward to future implementations like M-STONEBTC and Solv Protocol that could unify BTC L2 liquidity.”Additionally, Shah mentioned that Bitcoin’s challenge is keeping the base layer secure, stable, and untampered. “That is where scaling becomes paramount,” she said. “A healthy and diverse L2 ecosystem will be what ultimately drives Bitcoin DeFi, as a vertical, to succeed.”Shah added that programming environments on Bitcoin are inherently difficult since many developers from other ecosystems are less familiar with Bitcoin script. She noted that one way to combat this is to create WebAssembly (WASM) or different run-time environments like Rust, Solidity, and Cosmos with L2s. “This approach will likely help bring new developers into the ecosystem,” she remarked.

PEPE to hit new ATH? YES, but only if these conditions are met... - AMBCrypto



Memecoin’s price climbed by over 6% in the last 24 hours 
Technical indicators suggested a sustained bull rally may be possible

PEPE has showcased some impressive performance over the last few days, with the altcoin now steadily closing in on its all-time high. Does this mean the memecoin will soon breach its old ATH though? Well, let’s have a look at PEPE’s current state to see whether that’s a viable possibility. 
PEPE bulls are pushing hard
Investors enjoyed profits last week as PEPE’s price surged by more than 10%. In fact, according to CoinMarketCap, in the last 24 hours alone, the memecoin’s value appreciated by over 6.5%. 
And yet, bullish sentiment around the memecoin declined slightly – With the same evidenced by the drop in its weighted sentiment.
Source: Santiment
However, according to one analysis, the drop in investors’ confidence might not affect PEPE adversely yet. Plazma, a popular crypto-analyst, is of this view, with the analyst tweeting that the memecoin is set to test its ATH. 
To see whether that’s possible, AMBCrypto analyzed PEPE’s on-chain metrics. As per our analysis of Santiment’s data, PEPE’s MVRV ratio had a value of 16.26%. Whale activity around the memecoin was also high last week. 
Following a deeper look at the same, we found that the memecoin’s supply held by top addresses hiked too. This clearly meant that whales were buying PEPE – A sign that they expect the memecoin’s price to surge in the coming days. 
Source: Santiment
PEPE to hit new highs soon?
AMBCrypto then checked the memecoin’s daily chart to see how likely it is for the coin to touch its ATH again. 
The MACD projected a bullish advantage in the market, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was resting above neutral. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands implied that PEPE’s price was well above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), meaning a sustained rally would be possible. 
Source: TradingView
To see whether there were any other resistance zones before the ATH, we then took a look at Hyblock Capital’s data. We found that PEPE’s liquidation would rise sharply near the $0.00000928-mark. A rise in liquidations often results in price corrections. 
Therefore, it’ll be crucial for the memecoin to go above that level. A successful breakout above it would clear its path towards testing its ATH.

However, nothing can be said with certainty, as IntoTheBlock’s data revealed that only 1% of PEPE investors are out of money right now. This can motivate investors to sell their holdings. This can also increase selling pressure and in turn, put an end to the memecoin’s rally.

Crypto Nonprofit To Support Industry-Friendly Candidates


								The November US elections could become a major event for the crypto industry as the government’s crackdown on the sector has created an unclear and uncertain landscape for investors and businesses.
As such, voters and crucial figures are taking presidential and congressional candidates’ stances on the sector as a defining factor to consider. Recent reports revealed a nonprofit organization has launched a new Political Action Committee (PAC) to support industry-friendly politicians running for Congress.

Raising Funds For Pro-Crypto Candidates
On Friday, Reuters reported on Stand With Crypto’s newly launched project to raise money to endorse crypto-friendly politicians running for this November elections.
Stand With Crypto is an advocacy group started by Coinbase in 2023 and operates as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, according to its website. The organization has nearly 450,000 members and “champions for clear, common-sense regulations for the crypto industry.”
Stand With Crypto’s PAC seeks to raise money for a bipartisan slate of candidates running in the House of Representatives and the Senate and put those who support cryptocurrencies and blockchain in office.
Nick Carr, the chief strategist of the nonprofit organization, told Reuters “The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates (…) throughout November.”
The PAC’s endorsements include Jim Banks, a Republican running for Senate in Indiana; Jim Justice, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia; Troy Downing, a Republican running to represent Montana’s Second District; Shomari Figures, a Democrat running to represent Alabama’s Second District; and Eddy Morales, a Democrat running to represent Oregon’s Third District.
According to the news outlet, other crypto super PACs like Fairshake, Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress have raised more than $110 million during this election cycle. Supper PACs differentiate from Stand With Crypto’s PAC because they can receive unlimited-sized donations but can’t coordinate with campaigns directly.
A recent report by Public Citizen found that over half the money raised by most of these super PACs comes directly from corporate expenditures like Coinbase and Ripple Labs. The rest of the funds have been donations from billionaire executives and venture capitalists, including founders of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, the Winklevoss twins, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.
Industry’s Role In Politics
Super PACs like Defend American Jobs claim that the industry already plays a role in this election cycle. The organization felt victorious after four endorsed candidates won the Indiana primaries on Tuesday, including Jim Banks, and Mark Messmer, a Republican running to represent the state’s Eighth District.
However, the industry’s involvement in this electoral campaign has faced some scrutiny by US regulators. During FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried trial, prosecutors alleged that SBF had used his customers’ funds to donate over $100 million to US political campaigns, which raised concerns.
Despite this, crucial figures in the industry continue to advocate for a clearer and more friendly regulatory framework in the country. The US House of Representatives recently passed a bill to the Senate to nullify some policies by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Ultimately, politicians have greatly criticized the SEC’s “overreaching” actions against the crypto industry. US Senator Cynthia Lummis and Chair of the Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry have expressed their concerns about the regulator’s “unnecessary” crackdown on the sector on different occasions, calling for a better and less aggressive landscape in the US.

Change Of Heart: Crypto Scammer Returns $34.7 Million To Victim


																A week ago, a crypto whale fell victim to a scam that resulted in the loss of over $71 million. In the following days, the scammer moved the funds to veil them. But in a shocking turn of events, they returned the funds to the victim.

Address Poisoning Scam Snatches $71 Million
On May 3, whale 0x1E22…8FD5 lost 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), worth around $71.31 million, after falling victim to an address poisoning scam. This scam, also known as address spoofing, consists of trying to trick users into sending funds to fraudulent lookalike accounts.


The “vanity addresses” are custom-made with specific characters that look like the intended recipient’s address. Scammers send transactions of no value, hoping the similarity between the addresses will fool the user under attack.
If successful, victims copy the fraudulent address from the previous transactions and accidentally send their assets to the scammers instead.
PeckShieldAlert reported that the phisher immediately swapped the stolen WBTC for 23,000 Ether (ETH) before transferring them to a different address. Throughout the following days, the scammer laundered the funds. Sending them to ten different addresses before distributing the tokens through over 100 other addresses.
This development painted a looming picture for the crypto whale. At this point, the funds appeared to be unrecoverable. One user called the massive number of transfers a “crypto musical chairs” game.
Others justified the scammer, claiming he had not stolen the funds, as “he just received them.” This stance disregards the transaction’s nature. The transfer occurs under the belief that funds are safely being transferred to the intended account and not a lookalike.
Moreover, the lookalike address is in the victim’s transaction history, clearly intended to deceive the user into receiving funds not meant for them.
Change Of Heart Or Scared Of The Crypto Community?
In a shocking turn of events, the scammer sent 51 ETH, worth around $153,000, back to the victim on Thursday. Alongside the funds, the phisher sent a message asking to contact the whale, seemingly looking to negotiate.
The reasons behind the sudden change of heart remain a mystery to the community. Many are jokingly theorizing why the scammer returned the funds. One X user playfully suggested that the phisher feared being investigated by crypto sleuth ZachXBT.
Others claimed that “even the scammer doesn’t want ETH,” referencing the criticism the second-largest cryptocurrency has faced after its performance during this cycle.
In the early hours of Friday, PeckShieldAlert revealed that 2,683.7 ETH, worth about $8 million, had already been transferred to the whale from nearly 50 different addresses. A couple of hours later, an update showcased that around 50% of the total funds had been returned, accounting for 11,446.87 ETH, or $34.7 million.

Retrieving all the assets might take time due to the large number of addresses holding the funds. At the time of writing, over $45 million worth of ETH has already been returned, and the transactions continue.

Crypto Biz: SEC targets Robinhood, Grayscale’s Ethereum ETFs, and more

Another Wells notice has hit the crypto industry as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intensifies its scrutiny, targeting Robinhood. The popular trading platform received the notice on May 4, signaling potential enforcement action over alleged securities violations related to cryptocurrency listings and custodian operations. Like other crypto firms that have received similar notices from the agency — including Coinbase, Kraken and Uniswap — Robinhood has promised to fight any SEC action while complaining about the lack of federal guidance. Meanwhile, Grayscale withdrew its application for an Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) just three weeks before the SEC is set to make a decision, and crypto exchange Coincheck is on its way to becoming a Nasdaq-listed company. Along with Robinhood’s Wells notice and Grayscale’s Ether ETF applications, this week’s Crypto Biz features Coincheck’s merger deal and Block’s billionaire debt offering. Robinhood crypto business slapped with SEC Wells noticeThe U.S. SEC issued a Wells notice to Robinhood on May 4, signaling potential enforcement action over alleged securities violations. According to a regulatory filing, the SEC has been investigating the platform’s cryptocurrency listings and custodian operations despite Robinhood’s attempts to comply with regulations — including avoiding the listing of certain tokens or providing crypto lending and staking services. Robinhood criticized a lack of regulatory clarity at the federal level, claiming that this complicates compliance and hinders broader crypto adoption. Grayscale withdraws its Ethereum futures ETF applicationGrayscale has withdrawn its 19b-4 application for an Ether futures ETF just three weeks before the SEC was scheduled to decide on it. The cryptocurrency asset manager filed a notice of withdrawal for the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust with the SEC on May 7. The Ether futures ETF was initially filed on Sept. 19, 2023, and if it were approved, it would have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart previously suggested that Grayscale intended to use the ETF as a “trojan horse” to pressure the SEC into approving its spot Ether ETF.Deadlines for the spot Ether ETF applications before the SEC.

According to a May 7 press release, the companies filed a Form F-4 registration statement with the U.S. SEC, marking a milestone in their two-year journey toward a public offering. Initially disclosed in March 2022, the proposed business combination aims to make Coincheck a publicly traded entity through a de-SPAC transaction with Thunder Bridge. Originally valued at $1.25 billion, the merger completion was delayed by the severe bear market and regulatory uncertainties following the collapse of FTX. The transaction is now expected to be completed in the second or third quarter of 2024.Jack Dorsey’s Block to raise $1.5 billion in senior notes offeringJack Dorsey’s fintech firm Block has announced a plan to raise at least $1.5 billion through a private offering of senior notes. The company aims to utilize the funds for general corporate purposes, such as capital expenditures and repayment of existing debt. The notes will be offered in two series, with maturities of 2027 and 2033. Investors permitted to join the round include pension funds, banks, mutual funds and high-net-worth individuals.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionToday, Bitcoin is trading at $60,620, marking a 4% decrease over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s recent uplift is attributed to dovish economic data from the U.S., hinting at possible Federal Reserve rate cuts.This anticipation has weakened the dollar and, in turn, boosted Bitcoin’s value. Additionally, significant inflows of $11.54 million into Bitcoin ETFs, like Grayscale and Bitwise, along with Trump’s positive remarks on cryptocurrencies, have further fueled the upward movement.Rising US Jobless Claims Boost Crypto Market Amid Rate Cut Hopes
The latest US employment data reveals a slowing labour market, stirring optimism within the cryptocurrency sector. Recently, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that initial jobless claims rose unexpectedly to 231,000 for the week ending May 3, significantly higher than the anticipated 210,000. This uptick suggests a softening job market, which might prompt the Federal Reserve to consider rate cuts sooner than anticipated—a scenario that typically benefits cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Investors are now keenly awaiting further economic reports, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), to gauge future monetary policy directions. This expectation fosters a bullish outlook for cryptocurrencies.
Unexpected Rise: Jobless claims hit 231,000, hinting at a softening job market.
Federal Reserve Impact: Potential rate cuts could favour cryptocurrency investments.
Market Watch: Investors await CPI and PPI reports for further economic clues.
Jack Dorsey’s $1M Bitcoin Forecast Faces Regulatory and Market Challenges
Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and former CEO of Twitter, has made a bold prediction that Bitcoin will reach at least $1 million by 2030. This forecast coincides with his recent departure from the decentralized platform BlueSky, motivated by shifts away from its original vision of true decentralization.Simultaneously, Dorsey’s fintech enterprise, Block, faces regulatory scrutiny, impacting its services like Square and Cash App. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin shows robustness in the market, maintaining a price of around $61,000. While Dorsey remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential, the ongoing regulatory pressures and market uncertainties continue to pose significant challenges.
Bold Prediction: Jack Dorsey foresees Bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2030.
Regulatory Scrutiny: Block, including Square and Cash App, under compliance review.
Today, Bitcoin is priced at $60,620, witnessing a decline of around 4% within the last 24 hours. Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish as BTC is holding below $60,975. Above this pivot, immediate resistance levels are observed at $63,400, followed by $65,050, and extending to $67,160, which may challenge further upward movements.Conversely, support levels are marked distinctly, beginning at $59,075 and subsequent support at $56,640 and $54,400.Bitcoin Price PredictionTechnical indicators reflect a cautious outlook; the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 38, indicating a potential overselling scenario. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned at $62,325, providing a reference point for current price actions.Bitcoin’s recent market behaviour shows a bearish engulfing pattern on the 4-hour chart, breaching the upward trendline at $60,975. This breakdown suggests potential downward pressure, targeting the immediate support level at $59,075.Conclusion: Bitcoin’s current market stance is bearish, below the $60,975 threshold. A decisive move above this level could, however, pivot towards a bullish trend.

Based on What Does the Bitcoin Price Go Up and Down? When Will It Rise? Analyst Reveals His Expectation - Bitcoin Sistemi

The direction of Bitcoin price is once again in the hands of the Federal Reserve, according to a new analysis. This comes after excitement around Bitcoin ETFs faded.
Bitcoin's price movements are being driven by broader conversations about interest rates, CoinShares, a European digital asset manager, said in a report published today.


“A closer examination of the last 40 trading days reveals increasing alignment with interest rate expectations for June,” wrote CoinShares Research Manager James Butterfill. He noted that a similar trend was observed in 2023.
According to CME Fedwatch, the market is confident that interest rates will remain stable in June, with a potential decline only in the 4th quarter of this year. Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation, which excludes food and fuel, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, remained stubbornly flat at 2.8% in March, well above expectations.





On the other hand, GDP growth figures were disappointing, recorded at 1.6% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 3.4% in the previous quarter.
The data also shows that growth in the manufacturing and service sectors contracted and stagnated, respectively. These measurements are fueling fears of stagflation and raising expectations that the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer. In response, Bitcoin's price dropped below $57,000 heading into the Fed's next meeting on May 1, CoinShares explains.



However, the central bank also announced a “dovish surprise” with plans to reduce quantitative tightening (QT) while maintaining the policy rate above 5.25%. That means slowing the pace at which the economy shrinks its dollar supply by reducing its balance sheet by $25 billion a month instead of the previous rate of $60 billion.
In theory, this is good for Bitcoin and other risky assets that have previously thrived in easy-money macro environments, according to the analyst. Bitcoin's price rose above $60,000 shortly after the Fed's announcement.





“Tightening the QT while simultaneously keeping front-end rates high can be likened to both braking and accelerating a car,” Butterfill wrote. Butterfill added that the US Treasury may be reaching its limit in paying its short-term debts and that a change in the FED's QT strategy is the only remaining option.
Butterfill expects the Fed to cut interest rates later this year in response to weakening economic data, and that the cut will likely be “later but larger than expected.” The analyst said the following about BTC:

“Thanks to Bitcoin's fixed supply and high immutability, when the Fed eventually lowers interest rates, this turbulent situation is likely to support Bitcoin prices.”

SEC asks court to deny Coinbase’s motion for interlocutory appeal - Blockworks


The Securities and Exchange Commission asked a court to deny Coinbase’s motion for an interlocutory appeal on Friday. 
The regulatory agency and the crypto exchange have been locked in a legal battle for nearly a year after the agency charged Coinbase with operating as an unregistered exchange and alleged that its Staking program was violating securities laws.
“Interlocutory review is not warranted simply because Coinbase proposes a new legal test and disagrees with the Court’s rejection of that test, nor can it be supported by Coinbase’s desire for quicker appellate review of its invented test,” the SEC said in the filing. 
The SEC further argued that there’s no “substantial ground for difference of opinion,” because that would mean there is more than the obvious disagreement between the two parties. Coinbase, the SEC said, has yet to create “substantial doubt” about the court’s ruling.
“It is also possible that Coinbase simply does not like the answer provided for years now by the SEC and the courts, having decided to structure its business in ways that now may make it difficult or costly to comply with the securities framework put in place by Congress and the SEC over our capital markets for nearly a century,” the SEC wrote. 
Read more: Court largely rules against Coinbase’s dismissal efforts in SEC case
“But Coinbase’s desire to change the rules, to do so quickly, and to enlist the federal judiciary in this endeavor, supply no basis to certify an appeal,” the filing continued.
The SEC’s response comes after Coinbase filed for an interlocutory appeal last month. Coinbase wanted a higher court to review whether or not the SEC can apply Howey to crypto transactions. 
The company noted that the amount of differing opinions — from regulators to politicians on Capitol Hill — shows the “difficulty of the subject matter.”
Coinbase and the SEC have been engaged in multiple legal battles since last year after the SEC served the former with a Wells notice last March. Coinbase took to the courts afterward, asking for answers from the regulator. Then, in June, the SEC filed its suit. 
Last December, the SEC denied Coinbase’s rulemaking petition, which it filed in 2022. The petition asked the regulator to create rules for crypto and argued that the current securities laws don’t work for the blossoming industry. The SEC, notably, had made the opposite claim and it shows through its regulation-by-enforcement approach under Chair Gary Gensler.

Coinbase, in a ruling last month, was mostly denied its motion to dismiss. However, the court found that the SEC’s claims against its wallet service — the SEC alleged that it acted as an unregistered broker by offering the service — were unfounded. 
“The factual allegations concerning Wallet are insufficient to support the plausible inference that Coinbase ‘engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others’ through its Wallet application,” Judge Katherine Polk Failla wrote.
Failla said that the SEC could move forward with its claims against the Staking service and Coinbase’s role as an unregistered exchange. The SEC, she said, “plausibly alleged” that Coinbase violated parts of the security act. 
The reasoning, she said, is because Coinbase’s “managerial effort” could meet Howey’s standards, which would make it a security offering.
Coinbase didn’t immediately return a request for comment.

U.S. House's McHenry Says Bill on Crypto Market Structure Will Get Floor Vote

The bill, which had also been approved by the House Agriculture Committee, is the "culmination of years of bipartisan efforts to finally provide clarity," said the North Carolina lawmaker, who is retiring from Congress at the end of the year and made crypto legislation one of his priorities on his way out.

Bitcoin's surge turns out to be short-lived - What to think | Cryptopolitan

The recent uptick in Bitcoin’s value proved fleeting, as a cocktail of economic factors and cautious statements from U.S. Federal Reserve officials drove the price down sharply in just a matter of hours. This sudden dip not only highlighted Bitcoin’s sensitivity to external economic indicators but also tempered the optimism that had recently buoyed the cryptocurrency market.Market Reactions to Economic IndicatorsFriday morning witnessed a significant decline in Bitcoin prices, plunging from a promising high of $63,500 to a lower stance at around $60,700. This drop coincided with the release of lackluster U.S. economic data and hawkish commentary from Dallas Fed President Lori Logan. The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Survey for May reported a stark decline to 67.4 from 77.2 the previous month, missing expectations by a wide margin and signaling growing consumer apprehension.Moreover, inflation expectations for the coming year edged up to 3.5% from 3.2%, contradicting forecasts and recent dismissive remarks regarding stagflation by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. This shift in sentiment is crucial as it reflects a growing concern among consumers about the potential for ongoing economic instability.The impact of these developments was felt not just in the cryptocurrency sphere but also saw the U.S. dollar and bond yields experience modest gains. Interestingly, while traditional stock markets showed little reaction, Bitcoin’s price trajectory starkly deviated, highlighting its volatile nature in response to macroeconomic shifts.Long-Term Outlook Amid Short-Term FluctuationsDespite the immediate setbacks, the broader outlook for Bitcoin by analysts remains tentatively optimistic, albeit cautious in the short term. The introduction of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year and the effects of the April 19 Bitcoin halving contributed to a major year-to-date increase of 48%. However, the second quarter painted a bleaker picture, with an 11% decline, a departure from its peak in March.Experts like H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese have suggested that it might take several months for Bitcoin to revisit its recent highs. In the interim, the market may see further corrections, which are not uncommon even during bull cycles, with retracements between 25% and 30% considered normal. These corrections are viewed as temporary setbacks within the framework of a longer bullish trajectory.The potential for a downturn to the mid $50,000 range was noted, driven by persistent high inflation and slower economic growth. This outlook places a spotlight on the inherent risks and the necessity for investor patience and strategic flexibility in response to evolving market conditions.Bitcoin’s sensitivity to shifts in economic indicators and Federal Reserve policies highlights its unique position within financial markets. As it stands, Bitcoin continues to offer high beta exposure, making it a potent but risky asset for investors seeking to leverage its high volatility.In this current cycle, despite the recent price dips, the reduced supply from the halving and increased demand from new financial products like ETFs enhance Bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics, potentially setting the stage for future value increases.

SEC's Gensler Under Fire as Emmer Launches Crypto Defense - DailyCoin


        
The U.S. crypto industry faces hostility under Gensler’s SEC.



Congressman Tom Emmer supported proposals to reform the agency.



Crypto regulation is a divisive issue.
The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) under Gary Gensler has left little doubt about its intent to exercise control the U.S. crypto industry. The latest anti-crypto actions perpetrated by the agency include sending Robinhood a Wells Notice and objecting to Ripple’s stablecoin plans. 
Stepping in to bring the SEC to account, Congressman Tom Emmer has lent his support to a trio of bills aimed at reforming the SEC, stating the agency has wandered far off its path.SEC and Gensler PannedWading into the “war on crypto,” Emmer blasted the SEC under Gensler for straying from its core mission, announcing his co-sponsorship of three legislative proposals to bring reform and oversight to the agency. The bills, authored by Congresswoman Ann Wagner, aim to rein in the SEC’s overreach and lack of accountability.In unveiling the bills, Emmer accused the agency of abandoning its “statutory mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.” He insisted the reforms, if passed, would “force the SEC to get back on track” with its mandates.While some believe the solution for SEC hostility lies in “regulating the regulators,” the broader issue of crypto oversight remains a major partisan flashpoint in Congress.Crypto Remains DivisiveCrypto regulation remains a hugely divisive, partisan issue on Capitol Hill, making legislative proposals to reform the SEC’s oversight a highly contentious issue. Although presidential hopeful Donald Trump lent his support to the U.S. crypto industry recently, there are many Republicans, including Senator Mike Rounds, who strongly oppose digital assets, as well as supportive Democrats.
Nonetheless, Joe Biden’s veto of the recently passed H.J. Res. 109, which repealed an SEC policy preventing regulated entities from custodying crypto assets, demonstrated where the White House stands with cryptocurrency.With presidential backing under the current administration, the odds of SEC reform remain uncertain.  On the Flipside
Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes the path to correcting regulatory hostility lies in supporting pro-crypto politicians.



The feedback to Emmer‘s message was mixed, with some replies accusing the congressman of having vested interests.
Why This MattersEmmer is attempting to hold Gensler and the SEC accountable for overstepping its mandate at the expense of an emerging industry. Whether there is the political will to make this happen is another matter.The SEC pulled approval for Exodus’ stock listing at the last minute.SEC Scuppers Exodus’ Stock Debut in Sudden U-TurnBitcoin miners face short-term uncertainty as mining revenue plummets.Bitcoin Difficulty Sinks as Miners Mull Post-Halving Perks

Crypto exchanges Binance and KuCoin secure registration with India's FIU - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Binance and KuCoin has obtain FIU-IND approval, marking a milestone in Indian crypto regulation.
KuCoin pays $41,000 penalty as Binance awaits fine determination amid compliance proceedings.
The return of the exchanges to India signals the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in India’s regulatory framework.

In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry In India, two major exchanges, Binance and KuCoin, have obtained registration approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND), marking a pivotal moment in their journey toward regulatory compliance in the country.
This comes after months of negotiations and challenges following the ban of the two exchanges for alleged illegal operations.
Binance and Kucoin to re-enter India after ban
The path to registration was fraught with obstacles, as both Binance and KuCoin, along with several other offshore entities, faced a ban in December of the previous year for non-compliance with Indian regulations.
The ban, enforced by the Indian Finance Ministry, led to the blocking of URLs and mobile applications associated with these exchanges in January 2024. However, despite these setbacks, Binance and KuCoin emerged as the first offshore crypto-related entities to secure registration with the FIU-IND.
KuCoin took proactive steps by paying a penalty of $41,000, allowing it to resume operations in India swiftly. On the other hand, Binance’s compliance proceedings are still ongoing, with the exact penalty yet to be determined after a hearing with the FIU-IND. Reports suggest that Binance might face a fine of up to $2 million for non-compliance, highlighting the seriousness of regulatory infractions in the Indian crypto market.
Has India’s perception of crypto changed?
The approval of Binance and KuCoin signifies a shift in the perception of crypto exchanges in India and adds credibility to the regulatory framework governing the industry.
Vivek Aggarwal, the head of FIU-IND, emphasized the importance of these registrations in safeguarding the Indian economy against financial crimes. He stated that while the industry awaits parliamentary and governmental legitimacy, registered entities inherently possess a degree of credibility within the system.
India’s position on crypto has been somewhat ambiguous, with the imposition of stiff taxes and periodic crackdowns on offshore exchanges. However, the country’s push for global consensus on crypto regulation within the G20 framework reflects a proactive approach toward addressing regulatory challenges at the international level.
However, despite the challenges, India’s crypto industry continues to evolve, with efforts underway to foster a regulatory environment that balances innovation with financial security. The unveiling of a report titled “Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers: Road to Effective Compliance under PMLA” by the Bharat Web3 Association reflects a commitment to enhancing compliance standards in the crypto sector.
Moreover, the compliance efforts of crypto exchanges with Indian regulations have intensified, with platforms like Kraken, Gemini, and Gate.io initiating negotiations with regulators to address compliance issues. However, some exchanges, such as OKX and Bitstamp, have opted to exit the Indian market altogether in response to regulatory pressures.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Is In a 'Bore to Death' Phase. When Will the BTC Rally Resume?

The current period resembles the action from April through September of 2023 when bitcoin was stuck in the $25,000-$30,000 range for an excruciating six months. Eventually, cryptocurrencies were able to sustain a multi-month rally, with BTC ultimately hitting an all-time high in March of this year.

"Base Season?" Coinbase L2 Earns Institutional Nod: Here's Why - DailyCoin


        
Coinbase-incubated Layer 2 Base has received recognition from Franklin Templeton.



The trillion-dollar asset manager has heralded the network’s strides in the SocialFi space.



The nod comes as the network records significant gains in several metrics outstripping market leaders Arbitrum and Optimism.
Base‘s notoriety is extending beyond degen circles.
In recent months, the Coinbase-incubated Ethereum Layer 2 has experienced a meteoric rise in several key metrics. This rise has now drawn the attention of $1.5 trillion asset manager Franklin Templeton. The firm has heralded the network’s potential, particularly in the SocialFi sector.A SocialFi HomerunIn a Thursday, May 9, report, Franklin Templeton asserted that Base “has hit a homerun” in SocialFi. The firm noted this while citing data that the Ethereum Layer 2 accounted for 46% of the SocialFi market share, outstripping close rivals Polygon and BNB.Base’s SocialFi landscape is dominated by Friend.Tech. The application, which allowed users to tokenize their social media accounts, was a hit sensation right out of the gate, gaining sign-ups from NBA stars and Y Combinator CEO Gary Tan. But, in recent months, the platform’s meteoric rise has taken a hit amid privacy, legal, security, and user experience concerns. Following a recent airdrop, however, the project appears to be experiencing a resurgence.Franklin Templeton tipped the combination of Base’s support of leading SocialFi applications and Coinbase’s partnership to see the network maintain a key position in the SocialFi and Ethereum Layer 2 space in general.
The recent Franklin Templeton nod comes as Base is beginning to outstrip other Layer 2 networks in several key metrics.Base Set to Sieze the Ethereum L2 Crown?On Thursday, May 9, crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock shared data that showed that this week, Base had led the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem in several key metrics, including active addresses, daily transactions, and ETH inflows. According to the data, the network boasted 548,000 active addresses compared to Optimism‘s 534,000 and Arbitrum‘s 528,000. At the same time, the network also recorded 2.48 million transactions compared to the 1.97 million recorded by Arbitrum and the 550,000 recorded by Optimism. Base also saw the most ETH net inflows with 5.81K ETH, far more than the 2.73K ETH recorded by Arbitrum and the 1.46K ETH net inflows to Optimism.The recent strides come as the network has emerged as a favorite among investors following the Dencun upgrade.On the Flipside 
Coinbase maintains that Base will have no native token.



Base’s success has also attracted bad actors. According to a recent Scam Sniffer report, thefts on the network increased 145% month on month in April 2024.

JP Morgan, Wells Fargo latest major banks to disclose Bitcoin exposure via ETFs

JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are the latest major global banks to disclose exposure to Bitcoin via some of the spot BTC exchange-traded funds launched in January.The two lenders filed their 13F disclosures on May 10, revealing a modest investment in the Bitcoin ETFs.JP Morgan disclosed $731,246 of spot Bitcoin ETF investments in BlackRock’s IBIT,  Bitwise’s BITB,  Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC. The majority of the amount — $477,425 — was invested in IBIT. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo reported a $141,817 investment in Grayscale’s GBTC during the first quarter.Earlier disclosures have revealed that both BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon have also invested amounts into the Bitcoin ETFs, signaling a growing trend among traditional financial institutions despite the modest exposures.Furthermore, other major banks, including Morgan Stanley and UBS, have indicated an intent to allow clients to invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the two lenders have yet to disclose direct exposure to Bitcoin as of press time.Industry experts, including BlackRock’s head of digital assets, believe that the trend of institutional flows into Bitcoin ETFs is only beginning with the volume expected to rise as more sophisticated money, like sovereign wealth funds, begin entering the sector.BlackRock 13FBlackRock disclosed a $6.6 million investment in its own IBIT fund in its 13F filing on May 10.The company’s strategy follows other spot Bitcoin ETF issuers that have similarly invested in their own funds. Ark Invest holds $206.4 million of its ARKB fund, while Van Eck holds $98,000 of its HODL fund.BlackRock’s latest investment comes alongside solid performance for BlackRock’s IBIT. The fund has the highest cumulative inflows of any spot Bitcoin ETF at $15,490 and is the second-largest spot Bitcoin ETF in terms of assets under management.BlackRock’s IBIT has also set a new record for reaching $10 billion in AUM. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented on the trend, noting:“The record speed for an ETF to reach $10b in assets was held by JEPQ who did it in 647 trading days … IBIT got there in 49 days, FBTC in 77 days.”TradFi entering BitcoinChicago-based hedge fund CTC Alternative Strategies reported a $27.7 million investment in IBIT on May 9.Other financial institutions and companies that recently disclosed investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs include Hightower Advisors, US Bancorp, SouthState, Susquehanna International Group, Burkett Financial Services, and Legacy Wealth Asset Management.The above companies are a few of the hundreds of other firms that have made similar disclosures in their 13F filings since spot Bitcoin ETFs went live in January.According to data from Fintel, over 240 firms have invested in IBIT, while over 130 companies have invested in FBTC. More than 467 firms have invested in Grayscale’s GBTC, which existed before its conversion to an ETF in January.Mentioned in this article

Jack Dorsey Predicts Bitcoin Boom to $1 Million by 2030: What's Driving His Bold Vision?


								Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter and a well-known figure in the tech and cryptocurrency sectors, recently shared his view that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030.
His prediction is part of a broader bullish outlook on the pioneer cryptocurrency, suggesting that its value could continue to climb even after hitting this milestone.
Dorsey’s comments came during a detailed discussion about the future of digital currencies and his own experiences in the industry.

Dorsey’s Vision: Beyond Bitcoin’s Price
Dorsey’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin extends beyond its potential price appreciation. In the interview with Pirate Wires, he expressed a deep appreciation for the Bitcoin ecosystem, noting that it has been a significant source of learning for him.
According to Dorsey, the collaborative and open nature of the Bitcoin community means that efforts by any individual to improve the network or engage with it positively can lead to broader benefits for all participants. This aspect of Bitcoin, as much as its price potential seems to captivate him.
Dorsey particularly noted:
The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up.
In the same conversation where he discussed Bitcoin’s future, Dorsey also touched on his reasons for departing from BlueSky, the alternative social media platform he helped to co-found after leaving Twitter.
He criticized BlueSky for what he sees as its deviation from the original vision of decentralization, noting that the platform has started to mirror traditional corporate structures with its focus on venture capital and a formal board of directors.
This shift, according to Dorsey, contradicts the ethos of “decentralization and open-source protocols” that he aimed to champion. Dorsey’s critique extends to the broader tech industry’s approach to developing and managing digital platforms.
He believes that many of the mistakes made by Twitter are being repeated by BlueSky and others, particularly when it comes to governance and the balance between open protocols and corporate control.
His views highlight a tension within the tech world between the push for innovative, user-driven platforms and the pull of traditional business models.
Bitcoin Market Movements And Broader Predictions
While Dorsey has put forward a long-term view of BTC reaching $1 million, the crypto is currently trading above the $62,000 mark, showing a steady increase of 2.5% in the past 24 hours and 3.7% over the past week.

These movements are part of a wider trend that has seen various experts put forward optimistic forecasts for Bitcoin’s price trajectory.
For example, Tom Lee of Fundstrat has predicted that Bitcoin could rise to $150,000 by the end of the year, citing the launch of several spot Bitcoin ETFs as a key development that simplifies crypto investments for mainstream audiences.
Lee’s bullish stance is supported by his belief that the current crypto bull cycle is far from over, despite recent price dips and inflation concerns.

Further supporting this optimistic outlook, Standard Chartered’s research notes suggest that Bitcoin could reach $150,000, while Ethereum could hit $8,000 by the end of 2024. These projections reflect a growing consensus among financial analysts that major digital assets have substantial room to grow.

ARK Invest removes staking feature from its Ethereum spot ETF filing - Crypto Briefing




ARK Invest and 21Shares have amended their S-1 form for the proposed spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by removing the staking component, as shown by a filing dated May 10.In February, the two firms updated their filing with the option to stake Ethereum, in addition to cash-only redemption. Staking is considered a good way for fund managers to profit from the large amounts of crypto that ETFs can hold beyond just earning management fees.However, at the time, experts suggested that ARK Invest’s staking proposal for Ethereum was more of a “probe” to test the SEC’s response rather than a confident expectation that it would be approved by the securities agency.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indicated that staking could classify the asset as a security, which is undesirable for spot Ethereum ETFs. Last year, the SEC fined Kraken and demanded a halt to its staking services.Legendary trader Peter Brandt said in a recent post on X that the SEC is going to crack down on staking.The latest amendment to ARK Invest’s application fuels speculation about ongoing discussions between the SEC and spot Ethereum ETF applicants, suggesting that the applications are being modified to align with SEC preferences.The reasons for ARK Invest’s recent modification remain undisclosed, as no official statements have been made by the involved parties.Crypto analysts are marking May as a critical month for the future of these spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck’s filing on May 23. The general consensus among analysts is that the filing will likely be rejected.Earlier this week, Grayscale, the world’s leading digital asset manager, withdrew its Ethereum futures ETF application, potentially to avoid sole responsibility for legal challenges in case of a denial from the SEC.[Updated with ARK Invest’s filing in February, Kraken’s case, and Peter Brandt’s statement]

JPMorgan reports holding shares of several spot Bitcoin ETFs

United States-based financial company JPMorgan Chase has disclosed investments in Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds offered by Grayscale, ProShares, Bitwise, BlackRock and Fidelity.In a May 10 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), JPMorgan Chase reported it held roughly $760,000 worth of shares of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. In addition, the bank reported 25,021 shares worth roughly $47,000 in Bitcoin Depot, a crypto ATM provider.The SEC filing came the same day as Wells Fargo reported exposure to Grayscale and ProShares Bitcoin ETFs in its holdings and Bitcoin Depot. Susquehanna International Group reported on May 7 that it purchased more than $1 billion worth of shares of the spot crypto ETFs in the first quarter of 2024.Related: JPMorgan debuts tokenization platform, BlackRock among key clients: ReportJPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the U.S. by assets, controlling roughly $2.6 trillion. The SEC added that observers should not assume that the information provided by the financial firm was “accurate and complete.”The SEC approved the listing and trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs on U.S. exchanges in January. Many experts expect the commission to decide on spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds by May 23, when an application from asset manager VanEck reaches its final deadline.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

‘Sleeping Giant’ XRP About To Awaken - Why Ripple's XRP $5 Eruption Price Now Looks Nigh ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Throughout 2024, Ripple’s XRP has lagged behind its top crypto rivals, registering around 4.5% year-to-date returns and failing to revisit its peak value set in January 2018. Contrarily, the wider cryptocurrency market has grown considerably, gaining circa 55% during the same timeframe.



The key reason behind XRP’s underperformance is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) pending case against Ripple. A court ruled last year that Ripple’s XRP sales to institutional customers constituted unlawful securities sales. The regulator has now requested a federal judge to impose a $2 billion penalty on the fintech startup.



However, according to Evai CEO Matthew Dixon, the tides could soon turn in favor of XRP. Dixon suggested that the forthcoming consumer price index (CPI) report for April, which is set to be released on May 15, could awaken the “sleeping giant” and drive the XRP price to new heights. He anticipates a weeker-than-expected CPI index to light a fire under the XRP bulls.



Economists estimate that the CPI rose 0.3% month-on-month in April ahead of the Wednesday report, which would cast doubt on hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut this summer. Nevertheless, lower-than-expected numbers would benefit risk assets such as major altcoins like XRP.



XRP Set For Rapid Rally To New Highs?



Despite facing extreme sell-pressure over the last five years, XRP remains in a consolidation phase, with the XRPArmy attentively looking out for a huge breakout that could propel its price past the magical $5 milestone, setting a new record high.

&nbsp



Ripple and the SEC are currently in the lawsuit’s remedies stage. Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty recently indicated that the nearly 4-year long legal battle is almost coming to an end, as ZyCrypto reported.



As the crypto community eagerly awaits the outcome of the long-drawn-out suit, experts expect a final judgment around September. Meanwhile, Ripple is primed to launch XRPL enterprise solutions to the Japanese market via a strategic partnership with Tokyo-based consulting company HashKey DX.

Only a fool would vote on crypto alone - Blockworks


US presidential candidates on both sides of the two-party spectrum are taking advantage of the crypto industry.
You’ll notice how I didn’t say that crypto will be a hot button topic this election season, or that the crypto space will play any sort of role in shaping election discourse. 
No. It’s clear to me that some of the main players in this presidential race are planning to exploit the crypto world for money and votes — and those in crypto should stop playing along.
Why should favorable cryptocurrency legislation take precedence over all else? Perhaps you really believe that the financial system is broken, and that a path forward for cryptocurrency in the US is the best way to create a new, more egalitarian society that will allow all to flourish. 
But that’s not what I see. 
What I see is a small number of wealthy individuals, who made that wealth from cryptocurrency, looking for the government to let them continue growing that wealth unfettered.
Among diehard crypto evangelists right now, “voting for crypto” means voting Republican for president. According to this side of the debate, any other decision will virtually assure the death of the American crypto industry. 
This fear (true or not) has led some major personalities in Web3 to push crypto supporters into becoming single-issue voters. Their message is clear: Choose your 2024 candidates based solely on their cryptocurrency stance, or else.
In other words, Americans should prioritize their own selfish financial interests over broader societal and ethical concerns. When you promote the idea of voting for America’s crypto industry above all else, you’re deciding to ignore all of the other issues that are really at stake this election season — healthcare access, Social Security, gun legislation, women’s rights, LGBT issues, immigration, to name a few.  
I want to be clear — I do not care if you vote Republican, Democrat, or third-party, as long as you care about the issues at stake, and truly believe that the candidate in question is representative of your views. But voting for a candidate you would not otherwise support, simply because they favor the deregulation of a sector in which you hold a profit motive, is a compromise that you should not make.
Crypto isn’t political by accident
Cryptocurrency has undeniably (and perhaps unfortunately) become a partisan issue.
Blockchain technology, which underpins the entire crypto industry, is neither inherently good or bad. But it’s the actions of individuals and what they do with this technology that has drawn regulatory scrutiny over the years. This has transformed a neutral technology stack into a deeply partisan issue, with sharply divided views across party lines concerning its integration into the American financial system and beyond.
On the left side of the political spectrum — the same side already in favor of stricter financial regulations — politicians often place crypto against a global backdrop of scams, money laundering and market manipulation to strengthen their calls for oversight. Their tagline is to keep consumers safe.
Lawmakers on the right — who already favor less financial regulation as a rule — instead posit that intense crypto regulation will cripple innovation and impede technological advancement. They say that their aim is to keep American innovation moving forward at a brisk pace, far ahead of other countries like China. 
However, their supposed motivations are arguably applicable only during the election season. Because what all politicians actually want is your attention, your money, and ultimately your ballot. As with most issues, when the time comes, it is unlikely that much in the way of meaningful change will come from either side of the aisle. Instead, it will be the actions of the innovators within the crypto space that move the needle forward — which you would think that anyone who truly supports a limited government would appreciate.
The very idea that crypto needs to be “voted” into office has led to the platforming of some very unsavory people who really have nothing to do with crypto at all — besides a shared desire to solicit donations from this niche, newly rich subset of Americans.
Last year, Vivek Ramaswamy gave a fireside chat at Messari’s Mainnet last fall, promoting his presidential crypto plan a few months before he dropped out of the race. Consensus will have Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speak this year, announcing the news with a headline calling him a “pro-crypto presidential candidate.” I can think of a lot of other modifiers for RFK Jr. that are more headline-worthy than his stance on crypto. 
And most importantly, Crypto Twitter has, for the most part, widely embraced former President Donald Trump’s words of support for NFTs and crypto. And far be it for me to say whether that support is genuine, or more largely based on the fact that he’s made millions of dollars selling NFTs branded with his own image.
Backing these candidates simply because they seem to make positive noise about crypto isn’t taking back the power from Wall Street or helping make the world a more financially equitable place — it’s falling for empty campaign rhetoric. 
The idea that any presidential (or gubernatorial or senatorial) candidate is trying to win favor with the crypto crowd because they truly believe in crypto is laughable. These candidates are looking for crypto money, nothing more and nothing less. Those in crypto who support such candidates are either willing to pretend that these officials understand even the basic strokes of how crypto works under the hood (let alone its implications for the broader frameworks of finance and democracy), or they are willing to compromise their morals and ethics for the mere possibility of moon-making crypto legislation in the future.
As the one, big, obvious example: If you believe that Donald Trump will truly support the crypto industry, you have to be willing to overlook his judicially acknowledged sexual assault charges, overt institutional fraud and genuine attempts to overthrow American democracy when you cast your vote in November. 
Is cryptocurrency really that important to you?

Will Vitalik Buterin’s Gas Fee Proposal Make Ethereum More Like Solana? - Decrypt

Ethereum could use a much better system for charging transaction fees from its users, the network's chief architect Vitalik Buterin argued in a widely circulated essay published Thursday.Buterin's post, which laid out a path toward a more customized and equitable system, immediately garnered reactions from two principal groups: Ethereum users, who expressed their excitement at the prospect of lower fees on the network’s costly mainnet; and Solana users and developers, who noticed that Buterin's proposal sounded an awful lot like the Solana network's own fee model.“It’s certainly a Solana-esque approach,” Mert Mumtaz, a prominent Solana builder and the co-founder and CEO of infrastructure startup Helius Labs, told Decrypt.So just how similar is Buterin’s “multidimensional gas fees” proposal to Solana's "local fee markets"?Gas fees refer to the transaction costs that blockchain users pay to the network. This system is in many ways what gives tokens like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) their value. You need ETH to pay gas if you want to do just about anything on the Ethereum network, just like you need SOL to do things on Solana. When there's a lot of activity on the network, gas fees go up. And when there's less activity, gas fees go down.In some ways, Solana's current gas fee structure and Vitalik's “multidimensional gas fees” proposal stem from the same philosophy: In the name of fairness, different types of on-chain transactions should cost different amounts, depending on demand. But in practice, leaders of both networks appear to have different ideas about how to implement such a philosophy—leading to a potentially significant difference in user experience.Solana currently operates on a “local fee markets” structure, wherein gas fees are calculated on a per-account basis, project by project. In this system, spikes in gas fees due to network congestion are effectively quarantined to specific projects.For example, a spike in gas fees induced by a hot Solana NFT mint should only impact users who are interacting with that project—users elsewhere across the entire Solana network should be unaffected. (There is currently some disagreement within the Solana community about whether local fee markets actually work as effectively as intended, in part due to the hyper-congestion that can occur in crowded mini-gas ecosystems.)But Solana’s setup makes a clear contrast to Ethereum—where demand for wildly popular NFTs has previously clogged the entire network, sending gas fees skyrocketing for everyone. The “multidimensional gas fees” concept proposed by Vitalik Buterin does seek to make Ethereum transaction costs more equitable. But it doesn't appear to outline a boutique system like Solana’s, in which every individual project on Ethereum would become its own siloed gas ecosystem. Instead, multidimensional gas on Ethereum would only distinguish between different macro categories of effort required to complete network transactions, Ethereum core developer Marius Van Der Wijden told Decrypt. For example, computation, storage, and calldata might fetch different premiums at a given moment, depending on demand. Different on-chain transactions consist of different ratios of those categories of computing. Per Buterin, Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade, which went live in March, constituted the debut of such a system by sending layer-2 data, the sort that comes from layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, to “blobs.” Blobs feature different prices and different limits than the rest of an Ethereum block. At a macro level, expanding multidimensional gas to differentiate between more computational categories might improve Ethereum’s efficiency, and in Buterin's view, significantly increase scalability of the network’s mainnet. But it likely wouldn't insulate Ethereum users from spikes in network volatility induced by trending projects—it’s not that boutique in design.So, all that is to say: Solana and Ethereum maximalists, fear not. There will still be plenty of differences to pick apart.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ondo Finance to Launch Real World Assets Payment Network


Ondo Finance, a pioneer in decentralized finance (DeFi), has announced a strategic partnership with Zebec Network, a platform specializing in tokenized real-world assets (RWA). 
This collaboration aims to enhance real-time payroll payments using Zebec’s advanced payment technology and Ondo’s USDY stablecoin system.
Ondo Finance Partners With Zebec Network
The partnership seeks to expand the operation of USDY, a stablecoin known for its stability and performance. It will also integrate Zebec’s Instant Card technology and RWA payment solutions. 
The combined technologies aim to provide companies, traders, and individual users with “real, free, and problem-free” financial services, enhancing the overall efficiency and experience of payroll and financial management.

“Zebec Network’s continuous payment technology revolutionizes payroll by enabling payments per second, improving efficiency and ultimately the end-user experience. Zebec’s integration of USDY into its payment solutions is an exciting option but logical,” Justin Schmidt, president of Ondo Finance, said.


The integration of USDY into Zebec’s suite of products marks a significant step in redefining global financial ecosystems. 
With a current capitalization of $7.8 trillion and an 11.3% growth rate, the RWA market presents a substantial opportunity for both companies. Daily trading volume within this ecosystem is $494.3 million, reflecting its robust activity and potential for further expansion.


“This integration marks a significant advance in our shared quest to redefine financial ecosystems globally. By incorporating USDY, an RWA asset, we further enhance Zebec’s suite of products, empowering businesses and individuals to manage their finances with immediacy and unprecedented efficiency,” Sam Thapaliya, founder of Zebec Network, said.

Wells Fargo Banks Has Invested $143 Million In Bitcoin, Filing Reveals

                        Wells Fargo, the third largest bank in the United States, has invested in one of the country’s new Bitcoin ETF products.According to a 13F-HR form submitted on Friday, the bank held exposure worth $143 million across three different Bitcoin investment products as of March 31.Wells Fargo Buys Bitcoin
The vast majority of those funds were held with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) – a Bitcoin spot ETF whose shares are designed to track Bitcoin’s spot price during traditional stock market hours. The fund directly backs its shares with a fixed amount of BTC, which gradually declines over time due to management fees.The other two Bitcoin-related investments include a $99,000 position in the Bitcoin ATM provider Bitcoin Depot and a $1.2 million position in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), a Bitcoin futures ETF.The total position represents just a drop of Wells Fargo’s $603 billion in assets under management and has likely shrunk alongside Bitcoin’s price since the reporting period.Nevertheless, the crypto community has hailed the bank’s allocation as a massive step toward institutional Bitcoin adoption.Back in 2018, the same bank temporarily banned crypto credit card purchases, but its analysts came to recognize Bitcoin’s rapid adoption growth and price appreciation over the coming years.Why Choose Grayscale?
Wells Fargo began offering Bitcoin ETFs as an investment option in February for clients who specifically requested the product. Since launching in January, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs have absorbed $11.8 billion of net inflows.Other major financial institutions have also disclosed substantial allocations to Bitcoin ETFs in previous weeks. So far, the largest known owner of the products is Susquehanna International Group, an investment firm with $438 billion AUM holding $1.8 billion in Bitcoin ETFs.Interestingly, both Wells Fargo and Susquehanna invested most heavily into GBTC, which is the most expensive of all its competitors. The fund charges 1.5% per year in management fees, compared to a 0.3% management cost from most other rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity.Grayscale is currently the largest Bitcoin ETF thanks to its pre-ETF launch Bitcoin stack, but only by a thin margin. The fund has suffered nearly endless outflows since January 11.

MetalCoreâs CTO on how to make a Web3 game fun: âWe use what we understandâ - Crypto Briefing




Blockchain games dominated the first quarter, representing 30% of all on-chain activity in this period, according to the “State of the Dapp Industry Q1 2024” report by DappRadar. The report highlights that an average of 2.1 million wallets were active daily during Q1.This dominance in gaming activity on the blockchain could mean that analysts’ expectations about Web3 games focusing on entertainment this cycle are being fulfilled. MetalCore is a blockchain shooting game from this new batch of titles focused on entertaining gameplay, and it is finding success in its second closed beta testing.“[The number of players] It’s actually a lot more than we expected. We planned for a couple hundred, maybe 1,000 players. We’ve got close to 9,000 players and about 1,500 to 2,000 daily active users. And then at any given time, we have somewhere between 300 and 400 concurrent users, which is really good for a game that is not freely available, you still have to sign up on a waitlist and get keys,” shared Dan Nikolaides, CTO of MetalCore.The second closed beta test for MetalCore ends May 16th, after a two-week period used majorly to test game economy and check bugs, added Nikolaides. Since those testing periods are executed without the completed game, they are harder to retain players, which is why MetalCore’s team is surprised by the number of players dedicating up to 50 hours a week to the game.However, making a blockchain game fun is not an easy task, especially because most of the teams behind new Web3 titles are from the traditional gaming industry, and must get acclimated to new standards.“Web3 industry is really young still, so it’s hard to know what’s right. And that leads to changing directions, more so than we would do in Web2. Changing directions from a business perspective is not something that you typically would need to do in Web2. It is pretty much about thinking: well, this is going to be a premium game or a free-to-play game, or we’re going to sell it in bundles, or whatever it is going to do. Whatever the business plan is, that doesn’t require you to change your entire development process.”Yet, in Web3 there are more factors to consider, such as choosing a blockchain to deploy digital assets and deciding whether or not the game will have tokens. This drastically affects the technology stack used and what the team can do with digital assets, said MetalCore’s CTO.“Are we going to be able to upgrade them? Are they gonna have attributes that we can cheaply upgrade and can players level them up? Or is that gonna be too cost-prohibitive? That is just the simplest of things. Even from the business side, we have to question when we should launch from a market perspective. Like when is a good time to launch a token? Who should we partner with? All of these are very, very difficult decisions that we have to make besides just making the game, which definitely there was a learning curve there for us to figure all this out.”Scratching an ideaMetalCore is a multiplayer shooting game that reminds famous titles, such as Titanfall and Destiny. Players can go on missions, use different battle vehicles, and fight alien monsters. Nikolaides shared that the decision to create a multiplayer online game is tied to the “company DNA,” but it started outside the Web3.“We started this off actually as a VR game. So we made a VR game called World of Mechs for Quest 2 [VR goggles]. And that was really fun. Our founder has a long history of developing mech games. And once we did that, we had a really good foundation for fun mech combat. And we were like: ‘What if we took this and made a big PC game out of it?’ And at the time, we weren’t sure how to fund it. We weren’t sure how to make it happen.”Migrating to Web3 then made sense, as the team would be able to create a new blockchain title from scratch, instead of just trying to “slam a game into Web3.” After this decision, Nikolaides explains that making the game free-to-play was the next logical step, as the team didn’t want to gatekeep the game with costly NFTs, allowing players to build a community around it.“Gatekeeping games with NFTs is just not fun. The fun thing about games like this is when you can show off. If you have something really cool, naturally you want to show off to other people. But if you make a game where you have to buy a super expensive NFT just to play, there’s nobody to show off to. Nobody else is there to be like ‘oh my god, that’s so cool.’ So people generally, just the average person, really loves to feel they have achieved something.”Keep it simpleBesides the initial barrier of getting used to a new industry, Nikolaides shares additional challenges when creating a fun Web3 game, and how MetalCore’s team overcame them. “There are all the normal challenges that come with making a fun game even in Web 2, which is difficult by itself. Then there are additional challenges, which are the kind of economic challenges of designing a system that works in Web3.”MetalCore’s approach then was to keep “as close as possible to something they understood,” says Nikolaides. They already understood the idea of building a character, leveling it up, improving its load-outs, spending time, energy, resources, and money potentially upgrading it and making it “super bad-ass,” he adds.“And then we thought that with a free marketplace of NFTs, people would want to sell upgraded characters. And so we kind of designed our game around upgrading characters, right? This was very important for us, because instead of trying to do something very complicated, we kind of could take a lot of lessons that we learned in Web2, that we understood from designing game economies that involved upgrading characters, and then just kind of do it in such a way that it was Web3 friendly.”

WBTC address poisoner sends nearly all funds back to victim after negotiations

The address poisoning attacker who tricked a user into sending them 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) (worth $68 million at the time) has returned nearly all of the funds stolen, blockchain data shows.

A new player has entered the meme coin arena, making waves with a crazy purchase of over 350 billion PEPE tokens on the Binance exchange. This acquisition, worth an estimated $2.914 million, has ignited speculation and excitement in the crypto space, raising questions about PEPE’s future trajectory.



The transaction, reported by the analytics account @lookonchain on X, marks the emergence of a potential mega whale in the PEPE ecosystem. With such a substantial investment, this new player has positioned itself as a powerful force in the meme coin market. This event has also sparked speculation about their motivations and the potential impact on PEPE’s price movement.



Major Moves



Furthermore, PEPE’s ecosystem is becoming increasingly active. That’s because a significant volume of tokens is exchanged between anonymous wallets, and substantial transfers are made to wallets associated with major exchanges like Kraken. These movements suggest active trading and strategic positioning by investors.



Despite a minor decline following the initial surge, PEPE’s price remains relatively stable, currently trading at $0.000008326 per token at the time of writing. However, the entry of a new whale investor and the surge in trading activity raises the question: can this significant acquisition send the meme coin even higher?



What’s Next for PEPE?



The answer remains uncertain, as the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. That’s especially true when talking about meme coins. While the influx of a large investor could potentially increase confidence and drive further price appreciation, it also introduces new dynamics and uncertainties into the market. Crypto enthusiasts will follow the situation closely in the coming days to see the impact of this acquisition on PEPE’s price dynamics.

Here's Why Vitalik Buterin Endorsed Privacy Protocol Railgun


In a recent interview with BeInCrypto, Alan Scott, a researcher at Railgun, elaborated on the recent endorsement by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. 
This endorsement highlights the advancements and the unique privacy features that Railgun aims to bring to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
DeFi Through Zero Knowledge Proof Tech
Railgun leverages zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to ensure user privacy while interacting with DeFi applications. 

“Zero-knowledge proofs allow users to prove a statement’s truth without revealing the actual information. In Railgun’s case, users can prove they own a specific balance of encrypted tokens in the Railgun smart contract, enabling privacy-preserving transactions,” Scott told BeInCrypto. 


The project stands out in the DeFi space with its ability to perform cross-contract calls privately. This innovation allows users to engage in various DeFi activities, such as swapping and farming, from a privacy-preserving externally owned account (EOA). “This feature is a huge advantage,” Scott noted, and “it’s encouraging to see recognition from one of the greatest minds in the space.”
Vitalik Buterin’s endorsement has invigorated the Railgun team, sparking new initiatives and driving execution. While new collaborations have not yet materialized, the endorsement boosts the project’s credibility and motivates contributors to enhance DeFi privacy solutions.
Read more: What is Railgun? A Guide to the EVM Privacy Protocol
Railgun’s features include Private Proofs of Innocence, which help users demonstrate non-interaction with malicious actors on-chain. This technology ensures that users are not sharing a system with nefarious addresses. Additionally, Railgun integrates auditability features, such as a view-only private key, enabling users to reveal transaction graphs to third parties and integrate with tax software like Koinly.
Scott emphasized the importance of both technology and education in addressing privacy challenges. This approach pushed Railgun into developing comprehensive documentation and active community presence on platforms like Telegram and Discord.


“The best approach to these kinds of challenges is tech and education based. It’s about demonstrating from a technical standpoint not only how these tools work but also their practical effects,” Scott said. 

Privacy on the Blockchain Should Be Easy
Looking ahead, Railgun is set to introduce two major updates. The first is Version 3, which is a complete rework of the contracts to a modular architecture. It enables new private DeFi capabilities such as leverage and reducing gas costs by up to 50% for certain transactions. 
The second one is Railgun Connect, a universal privacy plugin for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It allows users to use their private balance on most DeFi platforms without requiring integration. 

With these, the protocol aims to make private transactions as straightforward as public ones. Therefore, it ensures that DeFi users do not have to sacrifice privacy for self-custody and on-chain opportunities.

“The goal is to make private transactions as easy to use as public transactions such that all DeFi users can remain private with as much of the complexity abstracted away as possible. DeFi users shouldn’t be forced to choose between embracing self-custody and on-chain opportunities or giving up their valuable financial data,” Scott explained.

Collaboration within the privacy ecosystem is also a priority. Scott highlighted efforts by Ameen Solamani and initiatives like Web3Privacy.info, which compile research on privacy mechanisms. These collaborations aim to advance the understanding and implementation of privacy technologies in the DeFi space.

JUST IN: A Glimmer of Hope for Ethereum Spot ETFs? SEC Gets the Change It Wanted - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to the hot development, Ark Invest has updated its application again by removing the staking part from the Ethereum Spot ETF application.
It was known that the SEC did not want the staking feature for spot ETFs, as it made the asset a security. Now the removal of this feature from the application has led to speculation that there are negotiations between Ethereum Spot ETF applicants and the SEC and that the applications are shaped according to the SEC's wishes.




However, the reason for this latest change is not known for certain and no statement has been released from the parties yet.






Cryptocurrency analysts point to May as a very important month for these ETFs. May 23 is particularly highlighted as an important date for VanEck's spot Ethereum ETF application deadline. So far, analysts are leaning towards the possibility that these ETFs will likely be rejected.
Grayscale, the world's largest digital asset provider, recently withdrew its own Ethereum futures ETF, thus avoiding shouldering the burden of litigation alone in the event of a rejection from the SEC.

EigenLayer Exclusive $15 Billion Token Launch: Who's In And Who's Out?


																The crypto world is currently abuzz with the launch of EigenLayer’s new token, EIGEN, which has quickly become one of the year’s most anticipated digital asset events.
According to Bloomberg, the project has attracted significant attention for its approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) and its “controversial” decision to exclude users from certain jurisdictions, including the US, China, and Canada, from participating in the token distribution.

EigenLayer Challenges And Opportunities in Token Distribution
EigenLayer, a DeFi protocol based in Seattle, has made waves in the industry by introducing a concept known as restaking. This method aims to increase rewards on the Ethereum blockchain by allowing users to deposit ETH to help operate the network.
According to data from DeFiLlama, since its debut in 2023, EigenLayer has attracted over $15 billion in assets, demonstrating the significant interest and potential of this new approach.

The launch of the EIGEN token is set to commence with an airdrop, a process where tokens are distributed to users based on certain criteria, including a points system that rewards early service adopters.
Kunal Goel, an analyst at Messari, noted that anticipating this airdrop was a “primary incentive” for users to place funds in EigenLayer’s service.
However, the excitement has been tempered by the fact that many participants who accumulated points are now barred from claiming their tokens due to using virtual private networks or residing in excluded countries.
Robert Drost, executive director at the Eigen Foundation, explained that the exclusions were a necessary step to adhere to regulatory guidelines, which are often unclear and challenging to navigate, noting:
It’s not possible to operate in the space without following regulatory guidelines and being responsible, and the challenging part is that there is not a lot of clarity.
This sentiment was echoed by Nick Cote, co-founder of Secondlane, who noted:
Issuers not being upfront with jurisdictional restrictions leaves a sour taste in people’s mouth when it comes time to receiving your rewards, and then you find out you’re disqualified for X, Y, Z reason.
Impact On The Broader DeFi Ecosystem
EigenLayer’s restaking service is not just a new feature in the Ethereum ecosystem; it represents a shift in how applications can leverage the deep pool of transaction validators that underpin Ethereum.
This service increases the yield from staking ETH – from a baseline of around 3% to higher rates, albeit with additional risks.

As a result, EigenLayer has risen to become the “second most popular DeFi application,” as reported by Bloomberg, partly at the expense of liquid staking protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool, which have seen significant outflows in recent months.

Ethereum's latest 'low' - How ETH's price action is affecting staking - AMBCrypto



The number of new ETH staked daily has dropped on the charts
This can be attributed to the altcoin’s meek price performance

The daily amount of new Ethereum [ETH] staked fell to a year-to-date (YTD) low on 6 May, according to Glassnode’s data. 
Information from the on-chain data provider revealed that the number of coins transferred to the staking deposit contract address on that day totalled 11,285 ETH (valued at approximately $34 million). This figure marked a 92% decline from the YTD peak of 192,008 ETH coins staked on 28 March.
Source: Glassnode
Assessed using a 30-day moving average, the amount of new ETH staked initiated its downtrend on 29 February, with the same since down by over 85%.
Fall in ETH’s price to be blamed?
The crash in the daily amount of new ETH staked can be attributed to the altcoin’s price action. In fact, according to CoinMarketCap’s data, ETH was valued at $3,033 at press time, having shed 14% of its value in just 30 days. 
When ETH holders “lock” up their coins, their rewards are typically paid out in ETH upon maturity or expiration of the staking period. Therefore, if ETH’s value declines, the dollar value of those rewards to which they are entitled also falls. 
For example, on the leading liquid staking platform Lido Finance [LDO], its staking Annual Percentage Rate (APR) has trended south since 19 April. With a reading of 2.9% at the time of writing, this has dropped by 19% since the aforementioned date, according to data from Dune Analytics.
Source: Dune Analytics
This can make staking a less attractive venture to new investors seeking returns.
Also, the coin’s short-term holders, known to be the major drivers of day-to-day price action, are often paper-handed. This means they are willing to sell at any sight of “trouble.” As such, they may be discouraged from staking their holdings if ETH’s price continues to drop, and they may opt to sell their coins instead.

Network validators are unmoved by low price action
Despite ETH’s current performance, voluntary exits by its network validators have continued to fall. According to Glassnode’s data, after rallying to a YTD peak of 2000 on 2 April, the daily count of validators that have left the network has dropped by 61%. 
Due to this, the number of active validators on the network has continued to surge. At press time, there were 994,000 active validators on the Ethereum network.

XRP Price Prediction: Crypto Pundit Predicts 46,900% Breakout To $246, Here’s How | Bitcoinist.com


								A crypto analyst has predicted a mega-bullish rally for the XRP price, the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Using trend lines, a technical analysis tool used to identify the direction in which a cryptocurrency’s price is moving, the analyst has projected a breakout to $250. 
Analyst Predicts XRP Is About To Go Parabolic
A crypto analyst identified as “The Block Bull,” on X (formerly Twitter) has shared a blueprint of XRP’s price action during this market cycle. The analyst has identified crucial junctures for XRP, including anticipated break-out points, interim peaks and the transition into a bear market as the market cycle completes. 

He has projected that XRP could rise to $250 during this bull cycle, potentially experiencing a 46,900% surge by year-end, with the momentum extending into 2025.
Sharing a chart depicting XRP’s price movements from 2015 to 2024, the crypto analyst noted several super cycles XRP had experienced. He revealed that XRP had witnessed a breakout in 2018, occurring 36 weeks after the Bitcoin halving and concluding after 77 weeks.
During the second Bitcoin halving in 2021, the crypto analyst revealed that XRP also underwent another breakout within 36 weeks, reaching an interim peak 48 weeks after Bitcoin halving. Based on this time analysis of the XRP price, The crypto pundit projects a parabolic surge in XRP’s price in the present market cycle, potentially leading to a breakout 36 weeks after the Bitcoin halving event on April 20, 2024.  
The Block Bull foresees the possibility of XRP experiencing a breakout akin to previous cycles, with a potential interim peak 48 weeks after the Bitcoin halving, specifically on March 24, 2025. Additionally, he suggests that XRP could transition into a bear market phase by October 2025, likely within the first or second week of the month. 
XRP Price Update
Currently, 20 days after the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, XRP’s price is trading at $0.51, marking a monthly price decrease of 15.90%, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has failed to witness a significant rally, despite the market’s overperformance at the beginning of the year. 
While The Block Bull has maintained an optimistic outlook for XRP’s price trajectory in the 2024 bull cycle, several community members hold divergent views. A crypto member who criticized the analyst’s ambitious price target, argues that a more conservative rise to $1 for XRP seems more plausible than a dramatic surge to $250 by the end of the year.

Others have outrightly dismissed the $250 price prediction, highlighting the prevailing pessimism within the broader crypto community concerning the XRP’s price fundamentals. Since the legal clash between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the XRP price has declined significantly, struggling to regain its past momentum.
The cryptocurrency has also been consolidating around the $0.5 price point for months, disappointing most XRP investors and holders who hope for a potential price surge to new all-time highs.

‘Open-source’ CBDCs aren’t going to protect you from government

People are taking notice more each day that central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, are not worth the risk. Yet, to combat these concerns, some policymakers have been increasingly looking toward open-source coding as a way to offer transparency and perhaps win the public’s trust. But make no mistake, while transparency is welcome, it’s no silver bullet.For those familiar with cryptocurrency, the concept of using open-source code needs no introduction. However, for those that might not be familiar, the concept simply refers to publicly publishing the source code behind a project instead of locking it away as confidential or a trade secret. For example, the code behind Bitcoin (BTC) is free and open for all to see. Making a project open source has many advantages. For instance, doing so opens the doors for external audits. After a careful review, someone may find a vulnerability that wasn’t apparent to the original designers. Or, perhaps more concerningly, someone may find something nefarious embedded deep within the project. Related: 3 trends to think about before Bitcoin's bull run resumesTurning back to the example of Bitcoin, having the code be freely available allows people to verify that the 21 million supply cap is more than just an advertising slogan — it’s embedded within the design. In effect, publishing the code behind a project helps people know who they can (or can’t) trust. Yet, open-source coding is no silver bullet — especially when it comes to the problems that plague CBDCs. Consider what happened in Brazil last year. Brazil’s central bank published the source code for its pilot CBDC and it took just four days for people to notice that the CBDC had tools for surveillance and control embedded within its code. Were this the case with a decentralized cryptocurrency, people could carve out a new path and fork the chain, or simply not use it. But what recourse is there for CBDC users when a CBDC is the epitome of centralized money under government control? People could speak out, but central banks are often steered by unelected officials who do not answer to the public. People could choose an alternative money, but governments often try to stomp out currency competition. So while the transparency is helpful for understanding how the system works, it does little by itself to help citizens who want to change the system.Shifting the focus slightly, the U.S. code offers an illustrative example. Anyone can crack open the U.S. code, look to title 12, chapter 35, section 3413 and section 3414 to see there are 20 different exceptions that allow the government to effectively ignore your right to financial privacy. This transparency is certainly helpful for understanding how the government maintains such an expansive financial surveillance system, but transparency alone is not enough to fix the problem. Another example of why open-source code is not a silver bullet for fixing CBDCs can be seen in Norway where the Norwegian central bank also published the code behind its CBDC project. Yet here the problem is slightly different — it demonstrates that what is open source today may not be open source tomorrow. When dealing with a centralized entity like a national government, that decision can come quickly and without consulting the public. Norway’s central bank acknowledged this point quite explicitly by noting that its current focus in no way represents a long-standing commitment to open-source code.As a final example, the experience in the United States also demonstrates that previous statements do not represent a future commitment to open-source technology. The Federal Reserve has conducted CBDC research and pilots for years. However, one notable project was the collaboration with MIT. Referred to as “Project Hamilton,” this project led to the creation of an open-source CBDC model. Yet, nothing binds the Federal Reserve to the results of Project Hamilton or any open-source model. In fact, the Federal Reserve seems to have all but abandoned the project. Related: Jerome Powell’s pivot heralds a boring summer for BitcoinWe are still seeing the very early stages of CBDC development, but these examples are telling. Policymakers should be commended for embracing transparency, but the public shouldn’t be fooled into thinking that transparency is a panacea that fixes all of the problems posed by a CBDC. Although the use of open-source technology has been one of the cornerstones of cryptocurrency development, people should not lose sight that decentralized cryptocurrency also gives people the power to act on that information. And it is that condition that has created a revolution in the way people think about money and finance. There is no way a CBDC can replicate that benefit. The problems here extend far beyond the often-obfuscated conduct of central banks and go right to the core question of how much power a government should have . Fundamentally, the problem with CBDCs is that they risk centralizing money more than ever before, so much so that it risks giving the government virtually unlimited power over citizens’ economic choices.

Cardano ($ADA) Price Could Surge Over 1,500% in Near Future, Analyst Says | Cryptoglobe


                                
A popular cryptocurrency analyst known as Javon Marks on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has recently suggested that the price of the native token of smart contract platform Cardano ($ADA) could surge over 1.500% in the near future.



In a post shared with their nearly 40.000 followers, the analyst noted that the price of Ada has showed “major progress since breaking the resisting trend” surging more than 200$ toward “its first target at $2.7709,” with a recent pullback potentially “streghtening them for even more climbing.”



The analyst added that if the breakout holds ADA could see a potential further upside of over 460% to reach its target. Adding that based on historical data it could go much higher, pointing to the $7.8 mark as a possibility. That mark would represent a rise of over 1.500% for the cryptocurrency.







Another cryptocurrency analyst, known as Trend Rider on the microblogging platform, said that the price of ADA is holding onto its support level and if it manages to do so over the next one to two weeks, bears will get tired and the cryptocurrency’s price could bounce.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Cardano’s native token Ada is at the time of writing trading at $0.45 after losing over 2% of its value over the last 24-hour period and more than 23% over the last 30 days amid a wider cryptocurrency market correction.



Nevertheless the Cardano community has kept on building, with the number of its Plutus V2 smart contract growing by over 1,000 in a single month even as the cryptocurrency market corrected.



The number of smart contracts on Cardano surpassed 1,000 back in January 2022 after the price of ADA exploded with the rollout of the widely anticipated Alonzo hard fork, which brought smart contracts into the network, allowing it to compete with other blockchains such as the BNB Chain ($BNB), Ethereum ($ETH), and Solana ($SOL).

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) Will Surge 8,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

Will OpenAI Let ChatGPT Make Porn? AI Maker Says It Depends - Decrypt

Leading AI developer OpenAI riled up the tech world and the mainstream press alike on Thursday when it introduced a new model specification that many interpreted to mean that its wildly popular generative AI tools would be allowed to generate not-safe-for-work adult content.“We believe developers and users should have the flexibility to use our services as they see fit, so long as they comply with our usage policies,” OpenAI wrote. “We're exploring whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts through the API and ChatGPT.”In its announcement, OpenAI also reiterated that its current policy prevents ChatGPT from serving up NSFW content, described as content that would not be appropriate in "a conversation in a professional setting, like erotica, extreme gore, slurs, and unsolicited profanity."Nonetheless, the idea that OpenAI was contemplating lifting restrictions on the creation of pornography raised eyebrows. In retrospect, an Open AI product lead tells Decrypt, the company could have better explained what it was “exploring.”“I think what I would love to do—based on the feedback and the reaction, in the next version we share—is be more precise about what some people's definition of NSFW content and the taxonomy here," OpenAI product lead for model behavior Joanna Jang said, noting that NSFW could mean anything from written profanity to AI-generated deepfake images.As for what specific material would be allowed under a more permissive stance, Jang told NPR that it “depends on your definition of porn.”She stressed that deepfakes are absolutely off the table."Following applicable laws and protecting people's privacy, we thought that would cover it—but we should be clear that we are not in it for creating AI deepfakes or AI porn," Jang told Decrypt. "That is just not something that we even should have the time or bandwidth to be prioritizing when there are more important problems to be solved.”In addition to blocking NSFW content and ensuring legal compliance, the OpenAI model specification includes several other rules that ChatGPT is designed to follow, including not providing hazardous information, respecting creators and their rights, and protecting people’s privacy.Currently, OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus—which includes Dall-E 3 for images and GPT-4 for text—will not allow users to generate overtly sexual or gory images or text. When asked to do so, ChatGPT will respond that the request violates its terms of service. As a result, Jang points out that the web is rife with complaints from OpenAI users that the company is censoring them."There's a lot of criticism of censorship and what have you, and a lot of that discussion is conflating—to no one's fault—what is OpenAI's policy versus what is actually not our policy,” Jang said. “Are these models behaving that way, even though it goes against the guidelines?"As Jang explained, OpenAI published the spec to lay out ideal model behaviors, focusing on legal compliance and avoiding NSFW content while embracing transparency.“We want to bring more nuance to this discussion because right now—before the model spec—it was, ‘Should AI crate porn or not?’” Jang said. “And I'm hoping that through the model spec, we can actually have these conversations.”Again, this is why I wish I had actually put down [a framework] so that we could have kickstarted this conversation even a day earlier,” she added.For mental health experts, the prospect of popular AI platforms moving into the realm of pornography and adult content is troubling.“In the field of sex and porn addiction, with AI-generated pornography, we are starting to see an increase in addictive behaviors,” Brandon Simpson, a behavioral health specialist at the Men’s Health Foundation, told Decrypt. “Since AI-generated pornography creates the unique and ever-growing intensity needed to fulfill a dopamine response, people are diving in and replacing it with human interactions, which leads to levels of social anxiety, performance anxiety, and a variety of other sexual-related dysfunctions.”Even with guardrails put in place by OpenAI and other major generative AI platforms from Google and Meta, there is strong demand for AI-generated porn, and myriad ways to harness the technology to depict an unsuspecting victim—or generate child sexual abuse material (CSAM)."The spec is only part of our story for how to build and deploy AI responsibly,” an OpenAI representative later told Decrypt. ”It's complemented by our usage policies, how we expect people to use the API and ChatGPT”—ultimately intended to demonstrate transparency and “to start a public conversation about how it could be changed and improved.”OpenAI has invested heavily in improving the privacy and security of its suite of AI tools, including hiring cybersecurity red teams to find vulnerabilities on its platforms. In February, OpenAI and Microsoft announced a joint operation blocking Chinese and North Korean hackers from using ChatGPT, and OpenAI joined with Google and Meta last month in a pledge to prioritize child safety in the development of its AI models.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Zombie Coin to Surge 8,000% After Solana Launch, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Zombie Coin presents a similar opportunity.



Zombie Coin has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,000% in the coming two days, and Zombie Coin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Zombie Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Zombie Coin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Zombie Coin by entering its contract address – FbkoYsCAPbcyJkSoqXTxDKKoGQrYoqgtdLf9GBEqy2vr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ZOMCOIN.

Notcoin (NOT) Rides Wave of Excitement as Major Crypto Exchanges Prepare Listings Amid Surging Interest



                    

Notcoin (NOT), a play-to-earn game with an associated token that operates within the Telegram app, is currently making waves on social media platform X. 



This surge in popularity comes as major cryptocurrency exchanges gear up to list the NOT token.




ByBit, a cryptocurrency exchange, officially announced the listing of Notcoin on its platform on May 9, commencing with the immediate availability of deposits. 



Trading and withdrawals for NOT are scheduled to begin on May 16 and May 17, respectively. 



ByBit has clarified that these transactions will be conducted through The Open Network (TON) and its automated trading tool.




Simultaneously, the Binance exchange launched NOT in its launch pool on May 9 and plans to start spot trading of Notcoin on May 16. 



In line with this, Telegram’s third-party custodial crypto wallet, Wallet, will also incorporate NOT into its offerings starting May 16.



Adding to the excitement, the OKX exchange has announced its plan to include Notcoin in its Jumpstart Mining event on May 13. 



This event will allow Toncoin (TON) holders to stake their coins and earn rewards in NOT.




The anticipation surrounding NOT has been mounting on social media, with over 35,000 posts tagged with “#Notcoin” on X at the time of writing.

Introduced in January 2024, Notcoin presents itself as a free play-to-earn game on Telegram. Users can earn the NOT token by simply engaging with the game’s coin icons. 



The token, based on the TON blockchain, was developed by Sasha Plotvinov and his team, Open Builders, who also created the game. 



The game quickly became a sensation on Telegram, attracting millions of players even before its token was available for trading on exchanges like Binance.



Sasha Plotvinov explained the token’s unique position in the market, stating, “Notcoin — or ‘not a coin until it is’ — has solved the issue of attracting Telegram users to crypto,” noting the app’s user base grew to about 30 million in just a few months post-launch.



The official Notcoin Community channel on Telegram now boasts over six million subscribers, and the Notcoin bot reports a player count of 648,015 who have not previously owned any cryptocurrencies.



As for the token’s future, the Notcoin team has expressed uncertainty about its post-listing price but confirmed that the mining phase has been completed.



These developments occur as the TON ecosystem itself is gaining traction. 



Just a day before the ByBit listing, Pantera Capital revealed that its investment in TON was its “largest investment ever,” coinciding with a substantial price increase in Toncoin, which jumped from approximately $5.5 to almost $7 in a week, now trading at $6.88, marking a 27% rise.

VELO, the XRP of Southeast Asia, Skyrockets 358%


VELO has emerged as the latest sensation in the crypto market, earning the moniker “the XRP of Southeast Asia.” 
Over the past six weeks, this crypto has experienced a staggering 358% surge in value, capturing the attention of traders worldwide.
VELO Surged 358% in 6 Weeks
Velo Labs developed VELO, designed to enable digital credit issuance and borderless asset transfers for businesses. The protocol uses smart contracts to facilitate transactions. It provides a secure and transparent way to transfer value across borders.
Much like XRP, which aims to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments, it focuses on enhancing financial infrastructures and enabling seamless remittances. However, what sets VELO apart is its incorporation of smart contracts, a feature that the XRP blockchain currently lacks.

These set of features have allowed VELO to reach a market bottom of $0.0088 within the last 30 days. The token is now up by a remarkable 225.51%. This significant positive gain over the last month contrasts with the current market situation. Indeed, most cryptos continue to shoulder double-digit percentage losses amid the latest bearish downturn.
According to market intelligence platform Santiment, VELO’s trading volume has increased 30% over the past day, climbing to $0.029. Such price performance reflects the growing interest among investors.


“Genuinely, I see only one direction this will go in over the next couple weeks. As a worst case scenario, $0.015 level would need to hold if we get a huge retracement. But for now, VELO showing strength,” a crypto community memeber said.

Several factors have contributed to VELO’s popularity surge. The project has built its ecosystem and formed strategic partnerships. Notable partners include iRemit, Visa, and Lightnet. These collaborations have expanded VELO’s regional reach and demonstrated its potential to enhance cross-border payments and digital finance solutions.

FIT21 Clear For Vote? Revolutionary Crypto Bill Moves to House - DailyCoin


        
The United States House Financial Services Committee is considering voting on FIT21. 



FIT21 could make a big difference in how crypto is regulated, giving much-needed clarity to the industry. 



However, recent interventions by the White House against pro-crypto legislation dampen hopes.
The US crypto industry still finds itself tangled in a convoluted maze of regulatory uncertainty. Despite repeated pleas for clarity, regulators continue to maintain the status quo, running a rampant campaign against crypto companies and driving them away. In a bid to stem the exodus of talent and companies from the country, lawmakers took a decisive step in the summer of 2023 by voting in favor of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a crypto bill promising to provide much-needed clarity to regulators and investors. 
After much delay, the crypto bill is finally set to advance to the House floor, marking a pivotal moment for the US crypto industry. Revolutionary Crypto Bill Makes It to the HouseLawmakers with the United States House Financial Services Committee announced on May 10 that they are gearing up for a full floor vote of the FIT21 act. House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry suggested that the bill might be up for a vote “later this month” after much consideration in the House Committee on Rules. The FIT21 bill, passed out of committee in July 2023, seeks to clarify how digital assets are regulated by clearly defining the roles of both the US CFTC and the SEC. It is the first time the committee has marked up crypto-specific legislation, with lawmakers highlighting that these bills are necessary to prevent the U.S. from falling behind other countries in regulating crypto. 
“After tirelessly working across the aisle and across the nation over the past year to craft a clear, pragmatic regulatory framework for digital assets, I am proud that this landmark legislation is coming to the House Floor,” said Representative French Hill. “As the collapse of FTX demonstrated, we need strong consumer protections and a functional regulatory framework to ensure the rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem is safe for investors and consumers while securing America as a leader for blockchain innovation.”The act, if passed, could make a big difference in how crypto is regulated, giving much-needed clarity to the industry. However, the impending vote is just one layer of its concerns.A Challenging Course Awaits For FIT21The House is the starting line for the FIT21 act, with a challenging obstacle course waiting ahead. If it manages to clear the House, the bill would need to pass the Senate and then be signed into law by President Joe Biden. However, given the White House’s staunch anti-crypto campaign, hopes remain low. Earlier this week, the US House of Representatives passed a groundbreaking resolution to overturn the SEC’s crypto accounting guidance, which had barred banks from handling crypto customers. However, before Congress could celebrate, US President Joe Biden vowed to stay the course with his anti-crypto stance, pledging to veto any pro-crypto legislation.President Biden claimed that overturning the SEC’s SAB121 act would jeopardize the regulator’s mission to safeguard investors in crypto markets and the broader financial system. Still, despite the looming hurdles for the bill, it is a critical and historic step toward establishing a regulatory framework for digital assets in the US.On The Flipside
Crypto exchange Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto initiative, a political action committee, looks to support pro-crypto candidates in 2024. 



Former President Donald Trump recently rubber-stamped crypto assets, claiming a vote for him for a vote for crypto. 
Why This MattersThe crypto industry has ballooned into an elephant in the room that regulators can no longer overlook. Despite purported efforts by US regulators to rein it in, the industry only grows stronger, attracting institutional and retail interest. FIT21 represents a major leap forward for the industry, offering the potential for much-needed clarity and paving the way for a healthier ecosystem.Is President Biden’s administration destroying crypto?Biden Is “Destroying Crypto”: Cardano Founder Lambasts AdminRead more about FTX’s new Chapter 11 plan:FTX Pens Plan Promising 118% Cash Back to Creditors

Why ShapeShift Founder Erik Voorhees Is Pivoting to a Privacy-Centric AI Startup - Decrypt

Cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees announced on Friday the public launch of his latest venture, Venice AI, a privacy-focused generative AI chatbot.Privacy is a critical concern for the cryptocurrency space and among artificial intelligence users—a crucial factor in the creation of Venice AI, he said.“I saw where AI is going, which is to be captured by large tech companies that are in bed with the government,” Voorhees told Decrypt. “And that really worried me, and I see how powerful AI is, how consequential it can be—an amazing realm of new technologies.”Large tech companies are often under the thumb of government and act as gatekeepers to AI, Voorhees lamented, something that could lead us into a dystopian world.“The antidote to that is open-source decentralization,” Voorhees said. “Not giving monopoly power over this stuff to anyone.”Acknowledging the important work done by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google in pushing the field of generative AI forward, Voorhees said consumers should still have the choice to use open-source AI.“I don't want that to be the only option; I don't want the only option to be closed source, proprietary, centralized, censored, permissioned,” he said. “So, alternatives need to exist.”Voorhees launched the ShapeShift cryptocurrency exchange in 2014. In July 2021, the exchange said it would transition to an open-source decentralized exchange (DEX), with control of the exchange transferring from Voorhees to the ShapeShift DAO.ShapeShift announced in March that it would shut down after becoming embroiled in a battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The exchange agreed to pay a $275,000 fine and abide by a cease-and-desist order to settle allegations that the exchange allowed users to trade digital assets without registering as a broker or exchange with the agency.In the intervening three years, Voorhees said he had turned his attention to building a permissionless, decentralized AI model.Venice AI does not store user data and can’t see user conversations, Voorhees said, explaining that Venice AI sends users’ text input through an encrypted proxy server to a decentralized GPU that runs the AI model, which then sends the answer back.“The whole point of that is for security,” Voorhees said.“[The GPU] does see the plain text of the specific prompt, but it doesn't see all your other conversations, and Venice doesn't see your conversations, and none of it is tied to your identity,” he said.Voorhees acknowledged that the system does not provide perfect privacy—it is not completely anonymous and zero knowledge, but expressed the view that Venice AI’s model is “substantially better” than the status quo, where conversations are sent to and stored by a centralized company.“They see all of it, and they have it all forever, and they tie it to your identity,” Voorhees said.AI developers like Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta have worked strenuously to improve public and policymaker perceptions of the generative AI industry. Several of the top AI firms have signed onto government, and non-profit initiatives and pledges to develop “responsible AI.”These services ostensibly allow users to delete their chat history, but Voorhees says it's naive to assume the data is gone forever.“Once a company has your information, you can never trust it’s gone, ever,” he said, noting that some government regulations require companies to retain customer information. “People should assume that everything they write to OpenAI is going to them and that they have it forever.”“The only way to resolve that is by using a service where the information does not go to a central repository at all in the first place,” Voorhees added. “That's what we tried to build.”On the Venice AI’s platform, chat history is stored locally in the user’s browser and can be deleted, whether the user creates an account or not. Customers can set up an account with an Apple ID, Gmail, Email, Discord, or by connecting a MetaMask wallet.There are advantages to creating a Venice AI account, however, including higher message limits, modifying prompts, and earning points—although points don't currently serve any function apart from making it easier to track usage. Users looking for more even features can also pay for a Venice Pro account, currently priced at $49 annually.Venice Pro provides unlimited text prompts, removes watermarks from generated images and document uploads, and allows users to “turn off Safe Mode for unhindered image generation.”Despite the MetaMask account integration, Voorhees noted that users cannot yet subscribe to Venice Pro with digital currencies—but said it is “coming soon.” Meanwhile, because it is built atop the Morpheus Network, the company is rewarding holders of the Morpheus token.”If you have one Morpheus token in your wallet, you get a free pro account indefinitely,” he said. “You don't even have to pay, you just hold one Morpheus token and you automatically have the Pro account as long as that token is in your wallet.”As they do with any tool, cybercriminals persistently develop ways to circumvent the guardrails built into AI tools to harness them to commit crimes, whether via using obscure languages or creating illicit clones of popular AI models. However, according to Voorhees, interacting with a language calculator is never illegal.“If you were to go on Google and search for ‘how do I make a bomb?’ you can go find that information—it's not illegal to go find that information, and I don't think it's unethical to find that information,” he said. “What is illegal and unethical is if you build a bomb to hurt people, but that has nothing to do with Google.“That's a separate action that the user is taking. so Venice in particular, or AI is generally, I think a similar principle applies,” he said.Generative AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have also come under increased scrutiny over how AI models are trained, where the data is stored, and privacy concerns. Venice AI collects limited information, like how the product is used—creating new chats, for example—but its website says the platform cannot see or store “any data about the text or image prompts shared between you and the AI models.”For its text generation, Venice uses the Llama 3 large language model, which was developed by Facebook parent company Meta. Customers can also switch between two Llama 3 versions: Nous H2P and Dolphin 2.9.In a Twitter Spaces after the launch of Venice AI, Voorhees praised the work Mark Zuckerberg and Meta have done in generative AI, including making the powerful LLM open source.“Meta deserves tremendous credit for essentially spending hundreds of millions of dollars to train a cutting-edge model and just releasing it for free to the world,” he said.Venice also allows users to generate images using open-source models Playground v2.5, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, and Segmind Stable Diffusion 1B.When asked if Venice AI would use services from OpenAI or Anthropic, Voorhees’ response was an emphatic no.“We will never provide Claude LLM and never provide OpenAI's service,” he said. “We're not a wrapper for centralized services, we are a way to access open-source models explicitly and only.”With Venice AI built atop the decentralized Morpheus network that powers open-source smart agents, Voorhees acknowledged that there are concerns about Venice AI’s performance. It's something they're focused on, he explained.“If we want to bring private, uncensored AI to people, it has to be roughly as performant as centralized companies,” Voorhees said. “Because if it's not, people are going to prefer the convenience of the central company.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Top Crypto Exchange Binance To Roll Out Support for New Altcoin Connected to Telegram Game - The Daily Hodl


								Top global crypto exchange Binance plans to launch trading support for a new altcoin connected to a viral game on the encrypted messaging platform Telegram.
Binance plans to roll out support for NOT, a community token for the popular Telegram-based tap-to-earn mining game Notcoin, via its Launchpool platform, which lets users stake coins to farm new assets.










Between May 13th and 16th, Binance users can stake BNB, the crypto exchange platform’s native asset, as well as the stablecoin First Digital USD (FDUSD) into separate pools to farm NOT tokens.
The exchange then plans to list the asset on May 16th. Binance will attach a seed tag to NOT, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens.
Binance requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks before trading the tokens.
Other major crypto exchanges have also announced support for NOT, including Bitfinex, OKX and Bybit.
The token is issued on the The Open Network (TON) blockchain, which was initially developed by Telegram. The messaging platform parted ways with the chain in 2020 following a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The Open Network, an open-source community of developers, took over management of the technology that year.TON, however, can still be sent by Telegram’s 700 million users within the platform without entering long wallet addresses.

JPMorgan Chase Suffers Data Breach Affecting Personal Information of 451,809 Customers - The Daily Hodl


								JPMorgan Chase says it has discovered a data breach affecting the personal information of nearly half a million customers.
New filings with the Office of the Maine Attorney General show the banking giant recently found a software issue that’s been active since August 26th, 2021.










The bug allowed unauthorized access to retirement plan records of 451,809 customers, which contain names, addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account numbers.
JPMorgan says it now fixed the issue, which erroneously gave full access to several “authorized system users” who were employed by JPMorgan customers or their agents.
The bank says it has no indication that the personal information has been misused, and it’s offering two years of free credit monitoring through Experian to affected customers.
This isn’t the first time JPMorgan Chase has discovered a crack in its security infrastructure.
In 2014, the bank reported one the largest data breaches in history in a cyberattack that affected the accounts of 76 million households and seven million small businesses.
As the New York Times reported, JPMorgan’s security team had failed to add two-factor authentication to one of its network servers, which led to the theft of customers’ email addresses, home addresses and phone numbers. The bank said there’s no evidence that account information was leaked in the hack.
