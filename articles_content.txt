Trader Sketches 'Somewhat Safe' Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Investment Ideas For 4 To 7 Figure Portfolios - Benzinga

Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared strategies for trading and investing in various portfolio sizes, offering tailored advice for crypto enthusiasts with different financial backgrounds.What Happened: Sherpa's tweet breaks down investment strategies into different tiers based on the amount of capital one is working with. He provides options ranging from relatively safe bets to high-risk, high-reward scenarios. However, investors who want to check their portfolio only once in three months should buy Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD.
For Seven Figures or More
The trader suggests sticking to major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Dogecoin DOGE/USD, "ETH to ATH, DOGE to $0.40+". These established assets are considered safer bets given their stability and potential for growth.Investors with six-figure portfolios are advised to look at trending meme coins. "Can go with Pepe PEPE/USD or one of the Solana memes like Dogwifhat WIF/USD/Bonk BONK/USD," he noted. These meme coins have seen significant volatility, offering the potential for strong returnsSherpa advocates for a more risk-on approach for those with five-figure investments. He suggests looking into less mainstream projects. "Probably avoid all of the above and get to work and go riskier for generational wealth," he stated, pointing to options like PURR with Hyperliquid, BTC ecosystem ventures, and unusual ecosystems like Mode.Investors with four-figure portfolios are cautioned against meme coins due to their high risk. Instead, they are encouraged to pursue strategies like those suggested for five-figure portfolios but with an even greater emphasis on risk.Also Read: This Trader Sees A ‘Barbell Portfolio Of BTC And Memes’ As Most Profitable Trading StrategyWhy It Matters: Sherpa noted that his suggestions are "going farther and farther down the risk curve" with the lesser investment that a trader can undertake. While he acknowledges the experience of seasoned traders, "With that said if you’ve gotten to six figures+ in crypto, you’ve probably already taken a lot of these risks before and are a veteran."He highlights that as the portfolio size decreases, the need for taking on more risk grows, but so does the chance of significant losses.Meanwhile, his recommendation to buy BTC, and ETH reinforces the stability and growth potential of these foundational assets in any crypto portfolio.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Top Crypto Trader Dumps Entire Bitcoin Portfolio To Buy Altcoins, But Should You Be Taking This ‘Huge’ RiskThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

Turkish Authorities Dismantle $1 Billion Crypto Ponzi Scheme


							

Turkish authorities have busted a $1 billion cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme.



FBI reports a 53% surge in cryptocurrency scam losses in 2023 to $3.94 billion.



Turkey plans transaction tax on stocks and crypto assets to boost fiscal discipline.




Turkish law enforcement successfully dismantled a criminal organization accused of running an illegal cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme. The gang reportedly convinced unsuspecting citizens to invest a combined $1 billion, promising high returns.



In a coordinated crackdown, Turkish authorities arrested 127 individuals linked to the fake crypto investment scheme and seized 238 assets worth over $31 million.



Last month, Beijing’s police solved a case involving an organized crypto-pyramid scheme. The complainant, Xie, ironically emerged as the prime suspect. Seeking rapid financial gains, Xie invested in cryptocurrency through an organization called ‘Hua.’ He eventually recruited over 300 individuals across nine levels and became the scheme’s lead figure.



Losses from cryptocurrency scams rose by 53% in 2023, totaling $3.94 billion, according to the FBI. The FBI’s Internet Crime Report 2023 indicates a broader increase in investment fraud, reaching $4.57 billion. Cryptocurrency scams comprise a substantial portion of this total. The report said:




“Fraudsters are increasingly using custodial accounts held at financial institutions for cryptocurrency exchanges or third-party payment processors, or having targeted individuals send funds directly to these platforms where funds are quickly dispersed,”




In a separate development, Reuters reported that Turkey is set to implement a transaction tax on stock and crypto asset trades.









“The move is part of tightening measures that Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek is pushing through to boost fiscal discipline and price stability after years of turmoil that fueled soaring inflation,” Reuters stated.



Simsek recently signaled the government’s intent to introduce a minimum corporate tax to ensure a more equitable tax framework. Meanwhile, President Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party submitted a bill proposing licensing and registration requirements for providers of crypto asset services. This move underscores Turkey’s commitment to regulating the crypto sector in lieu of the growing concerns of investor protection and financial stability.

"These are the indicia of a security," he said, reiterating his earlier statement on legally-required disclosures.

Missing ‘Cryptoqueen’ Behind $4,000,000,000 OneCoin Fraud May Never Be Found: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The infamous scammer behind the $4 billion OneCoin fraud allegedly worked with a prolific drug kingpin, according to a new report.
Ruja Ignatova, a Bulgarian woman known as the “Cryptoqueen,” started OneCoin in 2014 and operated the company as a multi-level marketing (MLM) network.










Ignatova falsely claimed the project maintained a private blockchain, and the fraud reportedly lured in more than 3.5 million victims.
Ignatova has been a fugitive since 2017 and was placed on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list in 2022. A February 2023 report from BIRD, a Bulgarian investigative journalism outlet, indicated she may have been murdered at the order of suspected drug lord Hristoforos ‘Taki’ Amanatidis.
BIRD cited documents found at the home of a former top Bulgarian police officer, Lyubomir Ivanov, after he was murdered last year.
A new report from the BBC indicates US government lawyers said Ignatova employed Amanatidis as her head of security. A different US government lawyer reportedly said in court that the head of security was “involved in the disappearance” of Ignatova.
The BBC also reports that leaked Europol documents indicate police suspect Taki used OneCoin’s financial network to launder drug money.
The FBI says it will pay out a $250,000 reward for information leading to Ignatova’s arrest.

All of Michael Saylor’s Ethereum predictions were wrong


Michael Saylor has made a lot of predictions during his career. And because he became a billionaire in the process, many assume that his forecasts are generally accurate. For example, Bitcoiners applauded his support for — and multi-billion dollar purchases of — bitcoin. He invested at the right times and prices and has earned billions in profit. So when Saylor decided to place a bet on the future of Ethereum, millions listened.
Unfortunately, Saylor got all of his predictions about Ethereum totally wrong. 
First, he predicted that the SEC would classify Ethereum as an unregistered security. At his corporate conference in Las Vegas a few weeks ago, he said, “Sometime this summer it will become very clear to everyone that Ethereum is deemed a crypto asset security, not a commodity.”
Second, Saylor predicted that US stock markets would never list a spot Ethereum ETF. “It will never be wrapped in a spot ETF. It will not be accepted by Wall Street; it will not be accepted by mainstream institutional investors.”
Furthermore, he claimed that spot bitcoin ETFs would be the first and last type of spot cryptocurrency ETF. Pointing to the Bitcoin logo, he said, “This is the one, universal, consensus-accepted, institutional-grade crypto asset in the world. There won’t be another one.”
Every one of those predictions turned out to be wrong within five weeks.

Saylor lost all his bets on Ethereum
Despite Joe Lubin’s ConsenSys lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claiming that commissioners secretly classified Ethereum as a security in some redacted document, there’s no public evidence that they have actually done so.

Read more: ConsenSys says the SEC designated ETH a security but won’t say where
Furthermore, the SEC recently approved three 19b-4 exchange rule change requests from three US stock markets — NYSE, NASDAQ, and CBOE — to list spot ether ETFs. With those landmark approvals out of the way, the SEC will soon review and is widely expected to approve associated S-1 filings from up to nine ETF sponsors.
Worse for Saylor, those sponsors include the largest and most mainstream Wall Street institutions imaginable: BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Ark, and others.
That sets a final score for Saylor’s three bets on Ethereum at 0-3: no SEC unregistered securities designation (yet, at least), likely SEC spot ether ETF approval, and mainstream institutional investor support.
Saylor lost many bets, then won one
Of course, Saylor has lost other bets during his career. For example, he lost $15 million in his bet that Washington DC wouldn’t notice his $25 million tax evasion scheme. A few days ago, he agreed to pay $40 million to resolve his tax fraud lawsuit.
Saylor also lost $8.5 million in his bet that he would avoid an SEC penalty for declaring false financials during the dot-com mania. He paid $8.2 million in stock plus $350,000 to settle.
Saylor also lost an uncomfortable number of bets about the best corporate strategy for MicroStrategy for two full decades. From late 2000 through 2020, MicroStrategy stock failed to rally anywhere close to an all-time high despite Saylor’s continuous leadership. Finally, in recent months, and thanks to an improved price of bitcoin, shares are approximately two-thirds of their way back to their dot-com highs.
In all, Saylor got a lot of bets wrong in his career, but only one mattered. His prediction that bitcoin was worth buying on margin has made up for all of his previous and subsequent errors. His company, MicroStrategy, owns 214,400 bitcoins today worth over $15 billion after buying at an average price of $35,180 per coin. With the crypto trading at double that price today, MicroStrategy has doubled its $7.5 billion investment.

JUST IN: Paxos, Previously Issued BUSD, Now Introduces a New Stablecoin - It Has a Feature First in History - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to breaking information, cryptocurrency trading platform Paxos announced today that it introduced a USD-denominated stablecoin called Lift Dollar (USDL), which is issued and yields in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Cryptocurrency trading platform Paxos announced the launch of Lift Dollar (USDL), a new yield-generating USD-denominated stablecoin. The stablecoin is issued in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and was introduced today.


Lift Dollar is issued by Paxos International, the firm's UAE division, and is regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). The move comes as major stablecoin issuers such as Tether and Circle accumulate billions of dollars worth of interest on the US-dated bonds they hold.
Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla explained that Lift Dollar is structured similarly to other stablecoins issued by the firm, including PayPal USD (PYUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP), and Pax Gold (PAXG). These stablecoins are matched 1:1 to the dollar, backed by short-term US government securities, and all are overseen by a prudential regulator. All assets are safely positioned away from potential bankruptcy situations.





“We added programmatic daily returns so it looks a little more like a savings product than a checking account product, which is perhaps the way to think about it for traditional stablecoins,” Cascarilla said. said.
Due to lack of regulatory guidance, Paxos USDL will not be available in the US. However, it will be accessible to individuals who want to hold dollars in many other regions, including Europe, the United Kingdom, and Japan.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) have all seen their shares rise in today’s trading session, catching the attention of investors and analysts alike.



HPE’s shares surged to a record high following impressive fiscal second-quarter results, driven by strong AI server sales and a backlog of $3.1 billion; Broadcom is expected to beat earnings estimates, with analysts revising their projections upward due to the company’s history of outperforming consensus estimates; and Super Micro Computer introduced a cutting-edge liquid-cooled AI data center optimized for NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, positioning itself as a leader in the AI hardware market and driving investor enthusiasm.



HPE Shares Reach Record High on AI Server Sales



Hewlett Packard Enterprise shares surged up to 16%, reaching a record high, after the company reported impressive fiscal second-quarter results.

The server business drove the strong performance, which generated $3.87 billion in revenue against an estimated $3.45 billion. AI-oriented systems sales doubled from the first quarter to over $900 million, largely due to increased demand and better availability of high-powered semiconductors from Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA).

Bitcoin Needs To Hold Above $70,000 For Bullish Momentum: Analyst | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency asset by market cap, broke through the $70,000 resistance level today, demonstrating momentum for further upsurge. Delving into the significance of this development, cryptocurrency analyst and trader YG Crypto has emphasized that Bitcoin must break above the level and maintain that break in order for the digital asset to regain its bullish momentum.
The $70,000 Price Mark Is Crucial For Bitcoin
The analyst’s findings underscore the possibility of large price swings if this barrier is overcome and sustained, which coincides with the resurgence of interest in BTC among institutional and individual investors. This resistance level is believed to be crucial for sustaining market optimism and propelling Bitcoin’s upward trend toward new all-time heights.

YG Crypto noted that Bitcoin tried to break out when the United States market opened, but the barrier near the $70,000 mark persisted. “We might see another attempt soon, but a sustained break above this level is crucial for regaining bullish momentum,” he added.

Furthermore, the crypto expert highlighted that should the coin manage to clear this obstacle, it may aim for even greater prices in the coming days. Thus, he has urged the crypto community to watch out for impending economic data that may have an impact on investors‘ moods.
Well-known cryptocurrency expert Michael Van De Poppe has also shared insights on the development, further proving that the level is critical for the next phase of the crypto asset. Michael Van De Poppe claims that currently, BTC keeps grinding higher slowly, which may have propelled the coin to break through the $70,000 price level. Following the breakout, the analyst believes BTC is probably headed for a new all-time high in the foreseeable future.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin was changing hands between $70,990 and $71,000, indicating an over 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Both its market cap and trading volume have also seen positive sentiment, rising by over 3% and 30%, respectively, in the past day.
BTC Is One Weekly Close From Entering The Parabolic Phase
Bitcoin’s recent momentum has garnered several bullish price predictions from market experts lately, presenting the coin as a potential asset in the rapidly changing cryptocurrency market. Crypto strategist Rekt Capital has underlined the asset is on the brink of transitioning into a parabolic phase. 

According to the analyst, BTC has returned to the Range High of the Re-accumulation Range and the result is unchanged. Thus, the parabolic phase which the analyst previously predicted will occur after BTC breaks out of the re-accumulation, is only one weekly close above the range high from entering the phase.
However, past trends indicate that BTC might not be able to accomplish this within 50 days after the Halving event. “Will historical tendencies prevail, or will Bitcoin continue its Accelerated Cycle with a historic breakout?, he added.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana Over 150% Annual Gains Leave The Stock Market, Gold In The Dust


																Despite the relative tepid movement in the crypto market since Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH) in March, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have continued to top traditional assets, including Gold. This was highlighted in a recent report that showed how crypto assets have provided the best returns for a while now. 
Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Outperform Traditional Assets
Raoul Pal, Co-Founder of Exponential Age Asset Management (EXPAAM), shared the crypto investment firm’s latest monthly update, showing annualized returns on all major assets.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have topped traditional assets with annualized returns of 141%, 152%, and 224%, respectively. For context, NDX, the best major traditional asset, boasts an annualized return of 17%. 
Source: x
Thanks to this, these crypto assets have been the best-performing assets in 11 of the last 14 years. These digital assets also look on course to outperform traditional assets again this year, as they boast higher year-to-date (YTD) gains. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana currently have YTD gains of over 67%, 66% and 70%, respectively. 
On the other hand, Gold, the best-performing non-crypto asset this year, has a YTD gain of 13%. The NDX boasts a YTD gain of 10%, while the SPY has recorded a YTD gain of 11%. Interestingly, while the volatility of crypto assets has been criticized at times, this has largely contributed to why they have continued outperforming traditional assets. 
The Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Investments, Jurrien Timmer, previously highlighted how Bitcoin has continued to record the best risk-reward since 2020. He also alluded to Bitcoin’s high volatility, stating that Bitcoin’s huge drawdowns have also come with large gains. The same can also said about crypto tokens, especially considering that a token like Solana, which dropped to as low as $10 in late 2022, is now trading above $170. 
More Gains Ahead For BTC, ETH, SOL
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are expected to record more YTD gains as the year progresses, given that the crypto market is currently in a bull run. Recent developments in the crypto market also paint a bullish outlook for these crypto tokens. One is the increased demand for the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Data from Farside Investors showed that these funds recorded net inflows of $886.6 million on June 4, their best day since March.

Meanwhile, the Spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to begin trading by July. Crypto analysts like Michael van de Poppe predict these funds could spark a significant rally for Ethereum and other altcoins. ‘Solana Summer’ also looks to be on the horizon, with the crypto token showing signs of imminent parabolic upward trend. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin has broken above the $70,000 resistance level and is trading at around $71,000, up almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Shiba Inu Rallies on Renewed Investor Confidence, Echoing 2021 Surge


							

Early SHIB investors acquire nearly 1 trillion tokens, boosting market confidence.



Whale purchases drive SHIB price up 4.6%, signaling potential bullish trend.



Renewed interest in Shiba Inu from early investors hints at future gains.




Shiba Inu coin witnessed a surge in activity that has captured the attention of investors. Early investors have re-entered the market, purchasing almost one trillion SHIB tokens.



This large transaction has fueled speculation of a price surge reminiscent of 2021’s bull run. This renewed interest from early SHIB investors signals their confidence in the project’s future potential.



One notable transaction involved an early buyer, often referred to just as “whale,” who spent 1,000 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), approximately $3.83 million, to acquire 149.3 billion SHIB. This whale still holds 1,169 WETH, valued at around $4.45 million. Such moves by early investors typically indicate a belief in the asset’s long-term value.



Furthermore, another significant transaction occurred involving an early buyer who previously profited $145 million from SHIB. This entity had been inactive for two years before reentering the market.



Within a six-hour window, the investor exchanged 4,849 WETH, equivalent to $18.5 million, for 715.8 billion SHIB. This transaction triggered a 4.6% price surge for SHIB. Currently, the entity holds 9,207 ETH and WETH worth $34.9 million, suggesting the possibility of further purchases.







The recent transactions gain significance when considering SHIB’s historical context. The coin launched in 2021 and reached an all-time high of $0.0000857 during the bull market. Although the current trading price is $0.00002572 at the time of writing, the renewed interest from seasoned investors hints at a potential bullish rally.









Additionally, the substantial investments and calculated acquisitions by early investors point toward a potential bullish trend for Shiba Inu. Enthusiasts and market analysts are closely monitoring these strategic moves, which could foreshadow a significant market shift similar to the 2021 gains.



The large capital infusions and strategic acquisitions by early investors suggest a potential price increase for Shiba Inu. Market participants are closely observing these moves, which could indicate expectations of a significant market rally akin to that of 2021.

Solana Stablecoin Inflows Totaled $1.5 Billion in 6 months.


Solana has experienced a significant surge in stablecoin inflows, amounting to billions over the past six months. During this period, SOL price has soared by nearly 250%.
The total stablecoin market capitalization currently stands at $161 billion, approximately 14% from the $188 billion all-time high recorded in April 2022. Analysts suggest the Layer-1 token could see even greater gains if the stablecoin market capitalization returns to its peak.
Solana Stablecoin Inflows Drive SOL Price Rally

The volume of stablecoin inflows into the Solana network has reached $1.5 billion since December 2023, DefiLlama data shows. During this period, the SOL price is up 246% to $173 at the time of writing. The current value of stablecoins on Solana is $3.04 billion, while the total value locked (TVL) sits at $4.92 billion.
Stablecoin inflows and the rise in Solana’s price are closely connected. Higher liquidity makes it easier to trade SOL tokens, leading to more trading activity and investment.
As a result, demand for SOL tokens increases, pushing the price higher. This growing interest and investment further boost confidence in the Solana network, attracting more developers, projects, and users.

The crypto community shares this positive outlook on Solana. Many believe that the continued inflow of stablecoins will further strengthen the network’s liquidity and trading volume. 
Stablecoin market capitalization peaked at $188 billion in April 2022. Currently, DefiLlama reports it at $160 billion. According to pseudonymous blockchain researcher Gumshoe, closing this $28 billion gap could lead to a 102% increase in SOL’s price from its current level of $173.

“When stablecoin market cap goes back to ATHs, SOL will be at a $350 minimum”, said Gumshoe.

Moreover, a recent CoinShares report highlights up to $5.8 million in weekly inflows into Solana-based instruments. Significant investments from large financial entities indicate institutional interest and confidence in the asset’s potential.
SOL Price Outlook

Solana price is trading with a bullish bias, holding within the confines of an ascending parallel channel. It faces immediate resistance due to the mean threshold of $177.24. This is the midline of the supply zone, extending from $167.78 to $187.01.
A decisive candlestick close above this roadblock would see SOL price extend the gains to the next resistance order block between $194.12 and $202.47. Breaching its midline at $198.28 would set the tone for an extended move north. SOL could then go as high as to reclaim the $210.18 peak of the March 19 trading session.
Momentum indicators show that SOL bulls are primed for more buying momentum. This is seen with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossover above its signal line (yellow band). The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also at the cusp of crossing above its signal line (orange band). These crossovers suggest growing bullish sentiment and a stronger likelihood of positive price movement.

On the flip side, a rejection from the channel’s center line and a slip below the immediate support of $162.75 could trigger panic selling. Nevertheless, the bullish outlook for SOL would only be invalidated once the Solana price closes below $126.88 in the one-day timeframe.

The much-hyped launch of Base Dawgz’s presale has caught the attention of meme coin enthusiasts, both retail investors and whales alike. 
Indeed, it is rare for such new meme coins to already receive praise from smart-money traders. However, YouTube trading expert ClayBro – who has close to 130k subscribers – did not hesitate to claim that Base Dawgz could create future millionaires.

The token has already raised over $250k in its ICO in less than a day, potentially a sign of its high upside potential. 
What is Base Dawgz?
Base Dawgz (Dawgz) is a new dog-themed meme coin on the Base blockchain. 
Base meme coins are quickly emerging as the new meta, with the asset class already boasting a market capitalization of over $2 billion. With Coinbase looking to integrate the L2 chain into more of its services, Base’s valuation is expected to skyrocket. 
Considering that Solana meme coins already have a market cap of over $10 billion, experts believe that Base meme coin investors are likely extremely early. 

Base’s top token is Brett, which currently has a market cap of over $1 billion. Analysts expect Brett to remain one of the top-performing meme coins, which could draw attention to the high upside potential of other Base tokens such as $DAWGZ. 
However, Brett is not a dog-themed token. In fact, none of the top 5 meme coins on Base belong to the doge genre. DAWGZ is aiming to change this fact and emerge as the next big meme coin on Base. 
Despite DAWGZ being native to Base, it also boasts multi-chain status. In fact, the meme coin is live on Solana, Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain and Avalanche. This means investors can buy DAWGZ with ETH, BNB, SOL, USDT and AVAX during the presale. 
Staking, Share-to-Earn Contribute to DAWGZ’s Strong Fundamentals
Floki’s recent success has highlighted the importance of strong fundamentals, even in meme coins. The Base Dawgz project also prioritizes this, as seen by its multi-chain status. 
However, the developer team behind the token has also introduced a novel share-to-earn utility. It allows investors to share DAWGZ-related content on social media, be it memes, important updates, etc and earn free crypto for it. 
Similarly, investors can create their own referral links from the Base Dawgz website. They will receive 10% of every presale investment made through their link. 
Investors should not see this only as an opportunity to earn free crypto. The share-to-earn concept could be a game changer in increasing the meme coin’s brand awareness, which could provide a massive boost to its price. 
Additionally, presale buyers can stake their holdings to earn additional passive income. They can expect the staking protocol to go live within the next few days. Investors are advised to follow the Base Dawgz X and Telegram accounts to keep up with the latest updates. 
DAWGZ’s community-centric tokenomics also contributes to its strong fundamentals. No portion of its token supply is reserved for the developer team or any private sale. 20% of the tokens will be used up in the presale while the staking protocol and community rewards will receive 20% and 15% of the supply each. 

The remaining tokens are allocated to the project’s marketing strategy, listings and token liquidity. 
Finally, the Base Dawgz smart contract has been audited by SolidProof, which did not reveal any vulnerabilities or security risks. 
Is Base Dawgz The Next 100x Meme Coin?
As previously mentioned, experts and smart-money traders are already bullish on DAWGZ. 
In another instance, popular YouTuber Jacob Bury believes that Base Dawgz could potentially be the next 100x meme coin. Considering the demand for Base meme coins and the token’s strong fundamentals, his projection is not much of a surprise. 

Investors currently have the opportunity to earn the maximum profits, considering that DAWGZ is at its lowest presale price of $0.00479. However, this price is set to increase by 5% in just over 5 days. 
Interested buyers can visit the basedawgz.com website and use the over-the-counter widget to purchase the meme coin.

Lawmakers Seek to Skirt Biden’s Anti-Crypto Veto, Tighten SEC’s Purse - Decrypt

U.S. House lawmakers are set to debate legislation Wednesday that would restrict the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ability to carry out a controversial crypto accounting rule.The bill from the House Committee on Appropriations outlines funding for government agencies through September 2025, and for Wall Street’s top regulator, it comes with several strings attached. While slashing the SEC’s annual budget by nearly $145 million, the bill also prohibits the SEC from implementing or enforcing Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. The rule introduced and enacted last year requires companies custodying customers’ crypto to treat digital assets as liabilities, and hold “corresponding assets” on their balance sheets against them.Lawmakers in the House and Senate recently passed a bill erasing the SEC’s rule—with votes in both chambers of Congress drawing bipartisan support. However, the measure was later vetoed by President Joe Biden, as his administration had promised to do.Though advocates of overturning SAB 121 would need a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate to override Biden’s veto, the spending bill debated Wednesday provides an alternative means for Republican-led efforts to rein in the SEC. However, the bill would be subject to markup in the Democrat-controlled Senate on its way to eventually becoming law.A summary of the bill published by the Committee—which is chaired by Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK)—claimed SAB 121 “implements harmful digital asset requirements.” Lawmakers have previously described SAB 121 as an overstep of the SEC’s regulatory authority.“It provides sensible cuts to federal financial and consumer protection agencies and prohibits funding for their overreaching, harmful, regulatory policies,” Cole said of the bill in prepared remarks.At the same time, the bill debated Wednesday restricts the SEC’s ability to carry out enforcement actions related to “digital asset transactions,” except for instances of fraud and market manipulation. Until the SEC clarifies which digital assets are securities under existing law, or it’s granted new authorities, the bill prohibits the SEC from policing crypto broadly.To temper the “aggressive” nature of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, the bill’s summary states that its funding would be limited to $644 million in the government’s coming fiscal year. The figure represents a $168 million decrease compared to a request from the Biden administration.The SEC requested $2.6 billion in March, citing its oversight of around 40,000 entities in a report. Describing the digital assets industry as a space “rife with noncompliance,” the agency asked for more resources to address “critical and evolving risks” associated with the industry.Providing the SEC with $2 billion, the spending bill’s allocation comes in nearly $590 million below that request. On top of that, the proposed appropriation falls below the nearly $2.2 billion the SEC was allocated for regulating markets in the government’s current fiscal year.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

New Development in the Altcoin Case that Binance Delisted Years Ago: Users Demand $13 Billion - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to a recent development, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has applied to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) to dismiss most of the collusion case filed against it.
The lawsuit, which also involves three other crypto exchanges, was filed by BSV Claims and could potentially be worth up to 10 billion British pounds ($13 billion).


The essence of the case lies in the fact that the BSV token was delisted by exchanges in 2019. BSV Claims argues that this action is a result of collusion and anti-competitive behavior. The firm also claims that token holders missed out on more than £9 billion in potential gains. This figure was calculated by comparing the gains made by other cryptocurrencies since delisting.

In response to these allegations, Binance asked the court to reject claims that BSV could become a major cryptocurrency. Binance's lawyer, Brian Kennelly, argued that BSV holders “could reasonably sell BSV and reinvest in similar cryptocurrencies.”





The case is being brought on behalf of an estimated 240,000 UK investors. Founded in 2022, BSV Claims is led solely by David Curries, a former chairman of the CAT and member of the House of Lords.
Other defendants in the lawsuit include Bittylicious, Kraken and Shapeshift. One of BSV's most prominent supporters is Craig Wright, who was recently ruled in a London court to have lied “extensively and repeatedly” when falsely claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Miners Struggle Post-Halving as Reserves Plunge - The Defiant

New Bitcoin addresses, miner revenue, transaction fees, and on-chain volumes have also dropped post-halving.
Bitcoin miners are feeling the pinch as their reserves have plummeted since the April Bitcoin halving.Data shows a steady decline in miner reserves, hitting lows not seen in years. According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, reserves fell to 1.80 million BTC from 1.84 million BTC a year ago, the lowest since July 2021. The 2.17% annual decline is the biggest in over a decade, marking the first significant drop since 2011​.This drop suggests miners are selling more Bitcoin to cover operational costs, likely due to reduced block rewards following the halving."Rising electricity expenses, hardware upgrades, and some miners diversifying their investments into emerging technologies like artificial intelligence contributed to the plunge in miner reserves," Kashif Raza, CEO of Bitinning, told The Defiant.Bitcoin halving is an event that typically takes place every four years, intending to decrease the rate at which new Bitcoins are created by reducing the block reward miners receive for adding a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain. Following the latest halving, miners now receive 3.125 BTC for every block issued, from 6.25 previously."With reduced rewards, only the most efficient mining operations can remain profitable. Increased competition leads to higher operational costs and thinner profit margins for miners,” said Raza.It’s not just miner reserves that are affected. New Bitcoin addresses, miner revenue, transaction fees, and even Bitcoin on-chain volumes have also plunged as side effects of the halving.New Bitcoin Addresses SlideThe number of new Bitcoin addresses created each day has dropped to its lowest level since 2019.On June 3, the figure plummeted to 265,000 — down from a previous low of 352,000 in 2019, marking a decrease of 24%. On the day of the halving, the number of daily new wallet addresses stood at 377,000.Rising new addresses usually indicate fresh investor interest, suggesting optimism and potential growth in the network. Conversely, a low number of new wallets may signal reduced investor interest and lower network activity.Data from blockchain.com indicates that the halving event notably impacted miners' revenue. It dropped from $107 million to $36 million, representing a decrease of approximately 70%.On-Chain Volume DeclinesTransaction fees on the Bitcoin network have fallen sharply too. In June, the average transaction fees (7-day moving average) have dropped to $3.70 from $4.13 a year ago. Although the launch of Runes and the post-halving period initially saw fees spike to $40 in April, they have stabilized subsequently.Lower fees generally indicate reduced network congestion and fewer transactions, which could be due to decreased user activity.The adjusted on-chain volume, which measures the total value transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain, has also seen a notable decrease. It dropped to $50 billion on June 2 from a peak of $83 billion on March 14. According to Santiment, Bitcoin's on-chain activity is nearing historic lows as traders have reduced transactions in the two months following its all-time high.“This isn't necessarily a sign of more BTC dips, but rather a signal of crowd fear and indecision,” the on-chain analytics platform tweeted.Shift to AITo mitigate these challenges, some Bitcoin miners are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) as a means to diversify and boost their revenue streams. Bitcoin miners use powerful GPUs, which can also be used to support AI computation.On June 3, Core Scientific announced on X a $3.5 billion agreement with AI cloud provider CoreWeave. Through this contract, Core Scientific will supply an additional 200 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure to support CoreWeave's high-performance computing (HPC) operations.Hut 8 also reported a substantial move in this direction. Hut 8 made its first purchase of 1,000 Nvidia GPUs and secured a customer agreement with an AI cloud platform.Meanwhile, Bit Digital said it has 251 servers actively generating revenue from AI operations, earning around $4.1 million in April alone.

Trader That Made $120,000,000 on Shiba Inu Begins Accumulating SHIB Again: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								A deep-pocketed entity who made $120 million on Shiba Inu (SHIB) is suddenly accumulating the memecoin again, according to on-chain data.
The blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain reports that “a SHIB super big winner” just spent 4,849 Ethereum (ETH), worth $18.44 million at the time, to buy 715.9 billion SHIB.










Says Lookonchain,
“This guy spent only ~$400K to buy 5.5 trillion SHIB in the early stage and sold for ~$121 million at two peaks. He made more than $120 million on SHIB before, an amazing gain!”
Source: Lookonchain/X
The crypto tracker also noticed nine other wallets belonging to two entities making massive SHIB buys.
“Nine wallets (two whales) spent $35.2 million to buy 1.356 trillion SHIB at an average price of $0.00002596 [on June 5th]!”
Source: Lookonchain/X
SHIB Is trading for $0.00002604 at time of writing, up 6.7% in the last 24 hours.
On the Solana (SOL) network, Lookonchain also noticed one crypto whale was staring at six-figure losses after continuing to accumulate sloth-themed memecoin SLERF.
“A whale withdrew 2.91 million SLERF ($923,000) and 2,280 SOL ($378,000) from Gateio [on June 4th]. Then he spent 2,281 SOL ($378,000) to buy 1.17 million SLERF. He has bought 11.9 million SLERF ($4.09 million) at an average price of $0.3432 since April 25th and currently has a loss of $266,000.”

However, the trader now appears to be in profit as Slerf is trading for $0.40 at time of writing, up more than 22% in the last 24 hours.

Ripple CEO Reveals When Investors Should Expect An XRP ETF To Be Approved | Bitcoinist.com


								The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, has shed light on the potential timeline for an XRP ETF. Previously speaking at the Consensus 2024 conference, Garlinghouse declared that the introduction of an XRP Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) was inevitable.
XRP ETF Slated For 2025
In an exclusive interview with Fox Business on June 4, Garlinghouse offered insights on the current regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the recent approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and discussing the potential introduction of an XRP ETF. 

When asked if he believes that the Ethereum Spot ETFs will start trading by next month, Garlinghouse concurred, suggesting that Spot Ethereum ETFs could begin trading by July 2024.
He emphasized that the introduction of an Ethereum Spot ETF was “a big deal,” because it broadens market access for global investors. Additionally, he pointed to the successful launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, revealing that the digital asset has attracted billions in inflows, which underscores the strong demand and interest from investors in the asset class. 
Garlinghouse has predicted the imminent launch of an XRP ETF by 2025, emphasizing the fundamental similarities between Ethereum and XRP in terms of functionality and decentralization.
Speaking at the Consensus 2024 conference last week, the Ripple CEO asserted that an XRP ETF was inevitable. He revealed to Fox Business that the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs paves the way for more cryptocurrency ETFs to enter the market soon. 
Garlinghouse also acknowledged that the US SEC might present challenges during the XRP ETF approval process. However, he remains confident that the regulator will ultimately authorize an XRP ETF.  
He noted that investors currently seek diversification rather than exposure to a single investment product. In the context of ETFs, this implies that the growing interest in more Spot Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs could result in the approval of more crypto ETFs, including Solana, XRP, and Cardano. 
XRP Price Experienced Slight Uptick
During the interview, Garlinghouse was questioned about the possible factors behind the recent surge in several cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, over the past week. According to the interviewer, Bitcoin has surpassed $70,000, while Ethereum has experienced substantial inflows following the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs. 

Additionally, CoinMarketCap data shows that XRP is seeing renewed momentum, witnessing a 1.17% increase in the last 24 hours and trading at a price of $0.52. Concerning this, Garlinghouse noted that the unexpected market momentum was largely driven by ongoing political developments in the United States. 
The Ripple CEO pointed out that despite its status as the largest global economy, the US has remained backwards in terms of cryptocurrency innovation and development. He disclosed that the recent support and attention given to the crypto industry by US Presidential candidate Donald Trump has been a welcome boost for the market.

ZK-Rollup Taiko Airdrops Token And Reaches $2 Billion Fully-Diluted Valuation - The Defiant

Roughly 50 million tokens, or 5% of the total supply, can now be claimed.
Taiko, a Layer 2 scaling network, started the first phase of its token distribution plans with the cryptocurrency launching at a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $2.1 billion and a market capitalization of $110 million.The token has suffered a rocky start, however, dropping 40% to $2.20. Its token valuation makes it the 15th largest among Layer 2 networks in terms of market cap, and the 7th largest in terms of FDV.TAIKO Price - CoinGeckoTaiko is a rollup, which takes transactions and computation off the Ethereum mainnet to allow for faster and cheaper use. It uses “zero-knowledge” technology, which refers to a way of confirming transactions from the Layer 2 onto mainnet. The team also says the protocol is Ethereum-equivalent, which means it does not require any additional compiling, reaudits, or tooling to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.Airdrop ClaimersEligible users include Taiko proposers, which determine the transaction sequence in a block; provers, which prove a block’s transition from one state to another; bridgers, allowing for users to lock ETH and receive funds on Taiko, developers, Github contributors, and members of the DEX Loopring community.To claim tokens users first need to bridge ETH to Taiko to cover gas fees, the team wrote on X today. The claim window ends July 5.For users that did not qualify for this round's airdrop, Taiko has allocated 10% of the total supply to their upcoming Trailblazer program. The program looks to reward users that “explore” the ecosystem, and the project has established a number of special boosts for users engaging with the community and the protocol.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $50 billion market cap in the second half of the year


    The cryptocurrency market in 2024 has seen a surge of activity, marked by significant rallies for major cryptocurrencies, approvals of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the BTC halving event in April.



While the potential for increased capitalization largely depends on the broader recovery of the crypto market, several assets retain strong fundamentals likely to drive growth.



In this context, Finbold has identified two digital assets likely to reach a market cap of $50 billion by the second half of the year







XRP



XRP’s journey to a $50 billion market cap has been challenging, with its price remaining predominantly in a consolidated phase below the $1 mark. The token currently faces downward pressure from overall market sentiment, struggling to maintain support above the $0.55 threshold.



XRP  market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap



Despite its absence from the recent bull run, XRP is generating optimism due to recent legal advancements between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Blockchainedbb, a crypto analyst on X, highlighted that XRP’s prolonged consolidation period, lasting over 700 days, could soon end in a significant breakout.



The analyst noted that XRP has been confined within a specific price range, notably around the $0.52 level, and this extended period of consolidation typically precedes substantial price movements. The potential breakout from this range is being closely monitored by investors and analysts alike, with many anticipating a notable rally.



Meanwhile, Ripple’s monthly token unlocks, alongside occasional additional sell-offs, could contribute to capitalization through inflation of the circulating supply.



As of press time, XRP is trading at $0.5291 and has a market capitalization of $29.34 billion, indicating that the token would need an upside of approximately 70% to reach $50 billion.



Dogecoin (DOGE)



Dogecoin (DOGE) has demonstrated potential and volatility, positioning it as a notable asset in the cryptocurrency space. Recent developments suggest a possibility of Dogecoin rallying soon. 



DOGE market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap



Dogecoin whales have shown increased interest in the leading meme coin, accumulating the cryptocurrency in the past few days. In a week, these highly capitalized investors added over 1 billion DOGE to their stack, worth $157 million.



A crypto trader, Kevin, has provided further insights into the technical indicators suggesting an imminent breakout for Dogecoin.



He highlighted the two-month Bollinger Bands Breakout indicator, which is signaling a major movement for the first time since November 2020. 



Additionally, the approaching two-month LMACD bullish cross points to significant upcoming price action. His analysis suggests that Dogecoin is preparing for a substantial move, similar to its past performance patterns.



Dogecoin also stands to benefit from its steadfast supporters, including Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, and associated products. 



At press time, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1631 and has a market capitalization of $23.58 billion, requiring an upside of approximately 112% to reach the $50 billion mark.



Both XRP and DOGE are strategically positioned to potentially achieve the $50 billion market cap milestone, driven by their ecosystem developments and the prevailing bullish sentiment in the market. 



However, the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market necessitates cautious investment. Investors should continuously monitor market trends and individual asset performance to capitalize on these opportunities effectively.

Ryan Salame is whitewashing his role at FTX and Alameda


Despite Ryan Salame pleading guilty to conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter, you wouldn’t be able to tell from his presence on X (formerly Twitter).
The former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets is begging to be interviewed, providing political commentary, stating he’s ready to release a memoir, and denying much of his role at FTX and Alameda (despite his guilty plea).
Salame insists that there’s much more to the FTX and Alameda sagas, but hasn’t clarified what new information he has to provide and no one has publicly stated that they’ll be interviewing him. Nor has any publisher offered to publish his memoirs. So why has Salame returned to X and why is he talking so much?
It’s impossible to know what’s going on in the mind of Salame, but it’s obvious that he’s desperately seeking attention and is completely unrepentant for the crimes he committed and the individuals he harmed with his actions. It’s also worth noting that Salame was sentenced to 90 months in federal prison, his one intelligent move being that he didn’t open his enormous mouth before his sentence was decided.

First Step Act
Most nonviolent, first-time federal offenders are now extended an offer of early release through a Donald Trump-passed law called the First Step Act. The act allows criminals to take off as much as half of their sentence so they can be released into a halfway house or the home of a relative. This means that if Salame changes his attitude and behavior and instead chooses to act like a decent human being while behind bars, his 90-month sentence will be reduced to 45 months.
It’s important that everyone remember what Salame is guilty of and why he’s going to be spending years in prison.
Salame helped name the FTX-related company North Dimension so that it obscured the ultimate beneficial owner, he lied to a bank so that customer funds could be sent to the account he opened, he falsely claimed he wasn’t running a money transmitter, and he directed others to move customer funds into and out of bank accounts. Put simply, he helped steal from hundreds of thousands of people.
And none of that even touches on the real reason he’s going to be spending so much time behind bars: his insane straw donations to numerous politicians.
Salame ‘conspired with [SBF] to make [political] contributions [under his name]’ and a ‘private message to a confidant’ explained that the ‘bipartisan donations would be to weed out anti crypto dems for pro-crypto dems and anti-crypto repubs for pro-crypto repubs, and that donations would likely be routed through Salame ‘to weed out that republican side.’
Salame knew he was breaking the law, he knew that he was helping FTX and Alameda executives move money in illegal ways, and he knew that customer funds were moving through a supposed corporate account.
Now, he’s desperate to have you believe his side of the story but it’s important to remember that, like his co-workers and friends at the top tier of the FTX criminal syndicate, Salame is a liar and has no reason to share the truth with you or anyone else.

Paxos launches Lift Dollar (USDL), a unique overnight yield generating stablecoin - CoinJournal



                    

                    
The new Lift Dollar (USDL) stablecoin launched by Paxos offers daily yield from US government securities.
The USDL stablecoin is issued on Ethereum.
Currently the new stablecoin is accessible in the UAE, Europe, UK, and Japan.

Paxos International has introduced a revolutionary stablecoin, Lift Dollar (USDL), issued and regulated under the Abu Dhabi Global Market’s (ADGM) Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA).
At its core, the USDL stablecoin offers unique overnight yield from US government securities, representing a significant innovation and democratizing access to interest earned from stablecoin reserves.
The unique features of the Lift Dollar (USDL)
Lift Dollar (USDL) is distinguished by its yield-generating capabilities, offering overnight yield from short-term, high-quality liquid US government securities and cash-equivalent reserve assets.
Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDL pays daily yield to token holders, reflecting the total value of the circulating USDL, which is fully backed by reserve assets.
This approach shifts the interest earned from stablecoin reserve assets directly from the central issuer to the appropriate end holders, democratizing access to financial gains typically reserved for institutional investors.
Furthermore, Paxos International will ensure USDL’s issuance is permissionless on the Ethereum blockchain, promoting transparency and accessibility. This permissionless issuance model allows for greater trust and ease of access for users.
Additionally, the design of USDL includes programmatic daily returns, likened to a savings product, offering users a consistent and predictable yield, distinguishing it from other stablecoins that function more like checking accounts.
Paxos’ regulatory compliance and strategic availability
Paxos has launched USDL through its UAE branch, Paxos International, adhering to stringent regulatory standards set by the ADGM’s FSRA. This compliance underscores Paxos’ commitment to regulatory adherence and financial security, positioning USDL as a reliable and secure investment option.
In addition, the assets backing USDL are kept safe from potential bankruptcy situations, ensuring that the value of the stablecoin remains robust and protected.
However, due to a lack of regulatory guidance in the US, USDL will not be available to American users. Instead, Paxos has strategically targeted regions including Europe, the United Kingdom, and Japan, where regulatory environments are more favorable.
This strategic move allows Paxos to tap into markets with significant demand for stable, yield-generating investment options, expanding its global footprint.
Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla has emphasized that USDL is structured similarly to other stablecoins issued by Paxos, such as PayPal USD (PYUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP), and Pax Gold (PAXG). All these stablecoins are matched 1:1 to the dollar and backed by short-term US government securities, ensuring stability and trust.
With planned collaborations with exchanges and wallet service providers, Paxos aims to enhance the usage and accessibility of USDL, making it a significant player in the stablecoin market.

Jil Sander, Maison Margiela, and Marni Fashion Brands Adopt On-Chain Authentication - Decrypt

OTB, the international fashion and luxury group that owns brands like Jil Sander, Maison Margiela, and Marni, announced Wednesday that it will provide blockchain-based digital authenticity certificates for all products from those labels starting with the Fall/Winter 2024/2025 collections. The certificates utilize blockchain technology and an NFC (near-field communication) chip embedded in each garment or accessory. This allows customers to verify a product's authenticity by scanning the chip with their smartphone, accessing a tokenized certificate that’s stored as an NFT on a blockchain network."This is an important advance in the OTB innovation process, because it enables us to guarantee greater transparency, new ways of interaction, and an increasingly high-profile experience for our luxury brands' clients," said Stefano Rosso, Marni CEO and a board member of the Aura Blockchain Consortium, in a statement.OTB, a member of the Aura Consortium, has already registered about 1.2 million products with NFC chips on Aura's Ethereum-compatible blockchain network since early 2022. With the process now standardized across all luxury brands, OTB expects to register over 1.5 million products annually.OTB's Aura-powered authentication app in action.

Germans In The Dark On Digital Euro: Survey Reveals Confusion Over New Currency | Bitcoinist.com


								A recent survey by Germany’s central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, reveals a surprising openness among Germans towards the digital euro, the European Central Bank’s (ECB) proposed digital currency. However, the survey also exposes a significant knowledge gap that needs to be addressed before the system’s potential can be fully realized.

While a staggering three-fifths (60%) of Germans surveyed admitted to having never encountered information about the digital euro, half (50%) expressed a willingness to potentially use it if offered as an additional payment option. This openness, despite a lack of familiarity, suggests a public appetite for innovation in the payments landscape.

Misconceptions Cloud Curiosity
However, the survey also paints a picture of confusion surrounding the digital euro. Nearly a third of respondents (30%) mistakenly believed it would replace cash entirely, highlighting the need for clear and concise public education efforts. The ECB has repeatedly emphasized that the digital euro would be complementary to cash, offering a secure and convenient alternative for digital transactions.
Source: Deutsche Bundesbank
Privacy emerged as the single most important factor for Germans considering the digital euro. Over three-quarters (76%) deemed strong privacy protections “very important” or “important.” This concern likely stems from the ever-present issue of data privacy in the digital age. The ECB assures users that their data will be far more secure with the digital euro than with existing commercial payment solutions.
Building Trust In A Digital Future
The survey results underline the importance of comprehensive public information campaigns, stated Burkhard Balz, Bundesbank board member responsible for the digital euro project. Balz added that under the current plans, people would be able to make their first payments with the digital euro no earlier than 2028.

As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com
The ECB is aiming to bridge this knowledge gap through a multi-pronged approach. Public information campaigns will explain the concept of the digital euro, emphasizing its role as a complement to cash, not a replacement. Additionally, the ECB is committed to building a system that prioritizes user privacy. They claim that transaction details will be known only to the payer and the payee, with no unnecessary data collection by authorities.

Digital Euro: The Road To 2028
Currently, the digital euro is in its initial phase, with a focus on finalizing regulations and exploring potential distribution channels. This preparation phase is expected to conclude in October 2025. Germans, and Europeans as a whole, shouldn’t anticipate utilizing the digital euro for everyday transactions until at least 2028, according to Bundesbank estimates.

Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Explains What Celebrity Tokens Get Wrong - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsVitalik Buterin has a problem with the latest spate of celebrity meme coins, taking to Twitter to rail against pop culture-powered cryptocurrencies—and explaining how they could regain credibility.The problem, Buterin emphasized, was not with meme coins as a caategory, but instead the fact that most don’t serve a purpose beyond making money.“I'm feeling quite unhappy about with ‘this cycle’s celebrity experimentation,’ so far,” he wrote. “‘Financialization as a means toward an end’ I can respect if the end is worthy—healthcare, open source software, art, etc.”The tweet came in response to a post by Placeholder VC partner and author Chris Burniske about the Mother Iggy (MOTHER) token. The Solana-based meme coin was launched in May by Australian rapper and model Iggy Azalea.Meme coins refer to cryptocurrencies based on internet memes, such as current events like elections, and celebrities. Currently, MOTHER is trading at $0.10, up 11.7% for the day and 520.3% for the last seven days, according to CoinGecko.Buterin referenced the Stoner Cats NFTs backed by Hollywood stars Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis in 2021 as more worthy examples.“Ashton and Mila's Stoner Cats was vastly more honorable than anything we've seen from this 2024 celebrity memecoin era,“ Buterin said. “At least there was an actual show being funded.”Buterin also shared recommendations for future celebrity meme coins, including setting a goal that serves the public good rather than simply enriching early adopters. He also said there should be more creativity in what holders of the coin can do.“As much as I dislike token voting DAOs, at least they give something for people to do and organize around,” he said. “The DAO should not fully decide the agenda, but it can have some influence.”Finally, Buterin said the project should have a long-term roadmap.“Make something that lasts 10+ years, rather than bubbling around for a few months and then being forgotten,” Buterin said.Meme coins exist on many different blockchains—including the original meme coin Dogecoin. Solana, however, has seen a surge in meme coins this year, including two based on the upcoming U.S. presidential election: Jeo Boden (BODEN), named after Pres. Joe Biden, and Doland Tremp (TREMP), named for his presumed rival.Pointing to a March 2024 blog post where he shared similar advice, Buterin reiterated that a meme coin project’s “north star” should be where—even if the tokens go to zero—participants are still happy to have been a part of the experience.“Regular businesses and charities accomplish this goal all the time,” he said. “It's a low bar, but things we build should meet this bar as well.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

IOTA has launched its L2 EVM network focusing on real-world asset usage - CoinJournal



                    

                    
IOTA launches layer 2 EVM network, integrating real-world assets and boosting DeFi.
The newly launched EVM network features smart contracts, cross-chain capabilities, and MEV protection.
IOTA token has seen a 3.23% increase to $0.2352 following the EVM network launch.

IOTA has launched its layer 2 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) network focused on the integration and tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).
Besides revolutionizing the IOTA ecosystem, the L2 EVM network offers robust functionalities tailored to meet the needs of both individual users and institutional investors.
Features of IOTA’s L2 EVM network
The new L2 EVM network introduces advanced features such as smart contracts, cross-chain capabilities, and parallel processing. These enhancements are designed to facilitate the seamless operation of decentralized financial (DeFi) applications and enable the efficient tokenization of physical assets.
A notable aspect of this network is its built-in protections against Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), a predatory practice where network validators manipulate transaction order to extract higher fees.
By preventing such activities, IOTA aims to create a more secure and equitable environment for all participants.
Dominik Schiener, co-founder of IOTA, in a Telegram message emphasized the network’s potential to bring vast amounts of real-world assets on-chain. Dominik said:
“We are positioning IOTA to bring the real world to Web3 and help to bring trillions of assets and institutional investors on-chain.” 
Dominik’s ambition is supported by the establishment of the IOTA Ecosystem DLT Foundation, the first distributed ledger technology foundation registered under Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) regulations.
This regulatory compliance ensures that IOTA is well-equipped to cater to the requirements of institutional investors, including features like on-chain KYC to identify investors and facilitate institutional DeFi trading pools.
Parallel processing is another key feature of the new L2 EVM network, enabling multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously. This approach significantly enhances the network’s scalability, reduces gas costs, and increases transaction speeds, addressing some of the most pressing challenges faced by blockchain networks today.
IOTA price reaction
Following the launch of the layer 2 EVM network, the IOTA token has experienced a notable uptick.
At press time, the IOTA token price was $0.2352, marking a 3.23% increase in the last 24 hours. The market capitalization stood at $773,040,069, reflecting a 3.27% rise. In addition, over the past 24 hours, the trading volume has surged by 25.71%, reaching $20,353,145.
However, the current price of is a far cry from its all-time high of $5.69, achieved in December 2017.
Despite the fluctuations, the recent developments and strategic focus on real-world asset usage points to a promising future for the token.

Why AI Needs Crypto’s Values | Bankless


The tech industry's dreams of an AI revolution has always been a double-edged sword. Unleashing AI could solve humanity’s biggest challenges, but it could also concentrate power in dangerous ways.That's where crypto and blockchain come in. The same values that make crypto cool can help make AI better. These values can help build a fairer, safer, and more open future for AI.Decentralization, permissionless innovation, open source systems, privacy, transparency, user ownership. These aren’t just fancy words; they can potentially crack open the black box of AI. Here’s why the AI industry needs crypto’s magic 👇Building an Inclusive and Open-Source AI EcosystemThe synergies between AI and crypto. Source: The promise and challenges of crypto + AI applicationsA few big tech companies currently control most of the computing power and are building moats around their AI research. This has created an 'AI mafia' that stifles innovation and competition faster than you can say "walled garden.”Decentralization, however, is the ultimate plot twist.In the decentralized AI paradigm, there’s permissionless access to computing power and AI research. AI becomes a tool for everyone, breaking down the barriers set by the AI mafia and democratizing access to knowledge, tools, and resources. Sharing resources means more people can work on AI's toughest challenges. The more diverse the builders, the less biased the algorithms, and that's a win for everyone.
However, open-source development has always been hard to monetize. How do you get people to build great things if they can't earn from it? This often forces companies to go closed-source and for-profit. ‘Decentralized AI with crypto incentives’ fixes this.Crypto offers new ways to monetize open-source AI. It creates an open marketplace for AI development, ensuring access and rewarding contributions with tokens.For example, in decentralized AI networks like Bittensor, developers earn TAO tokens for their machine learning models when used in different AI applications.This dynamic allows decentralized AI networks to attract top talent through tokenized incentives, creating a sustainable value chain that doesn't exist in closed-source, centralized models.Ensuring Privacy of User DataWe live in a data-hungry world. Everyone wants your data to learn about your likes and dislikes and then use it to sell you things.AI is no different. AI systems need lots of data to work well. Big AI companies often store entire conversation histories to train their models and improve services, but this creates a huge privacy issue.Imagine all your personal info – shopping habits, browsing history, even health records – being thrown into a big AI pot. You have to trust the company not to misuse or sell it. Scary, right?To truly gain user trust, AI needs to embrace privacy-preserving techniques. Building trust requires transparency and verifiability, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can help with that.There are also other ways AI projects in crypto are adopting privacy-preserving techniques. For example, Venice.ai stores conversation history only in the user's browser and ensures user requests are encrypted. GPU providers process these requests, but no server sees the entire conversation history or knows the user's identity.We can create AI systems that respect user privacy and data ownership by integrating these cryptographic approaches and values.VIDEOHow do we train AI models while maintaining privacy but without using user data? Without enough data, AI can't understand real-world situations well, leading to 'AI hallucinations' where the AI generates incorrect outputs.This is where synthetic data comes in. Synthetic data is artificially generated using algorithms to mimic real data. It has privacy-preserving qualities because it doesn't expose personal information. All major AI companies use it, and it's an emerging area of research.Crypto can incentivize the creation of synthetic datasets for training AI models by crowd-sourcing the work. Users can earn tokens for contributing verified data points, solving the problem of insufficient training data. For example, projects like Synthetic AI build tools for creating synthetic data, allowing users to contribute synthetic data and earn SAI tokens. Ensuring the quality of these datasets can significantly accelerate efforts to generate data for training AI models while maintaining user data privacy.Closing ThoughtsThe future of AI is uncertain, but one thing's for sure: it needs to be built on an open-source foundation of trust and transparency. Crypto, with its focus on decentralized ownership, permissionless access, and privacy, offers the missing piece. The tools are there, and it's time to use them and write the next chapter of the story of AI.Can crypto's values improve the AI industry? Comment below and let us know your thoughts!This is the AI x Crypto Cycle on BanklessAI x Crypto is real. The fundamentals are there & so is the speculative degeneracy.

Over 40% of Bitcoin (BTC) Supply Now Held by This Group of Whale Addresses


																Since mid-March, there has been a notable trend of large bitcoin holders or “whales” stashing more tokens.
The latest data suggest that a particular cohort of whale addresses now collectively own more than 40% of the total bitcoin supply.
Whales Gobble Up Bitcoin Supply
The accumulation of bitcoin by large holders or “whales” holding over 1,000 BTC has been a notable trend since mid-March. According to IntoTheBlock’s tweet, addresses with over 1,000 BTC now collectively own more than 40% of the total bitcoin supply.


This concentration of ownership signals increased confidence and conviction among wealthy investors and institutions in BTC’s future price trajectory as investor sentiment remains bullish on the top asset.




Historically, such accumulation by large holders has often preceded significant price rallies, as it reduces the circulating supply and increases scarcity.
The steady accumulation by whales suggests they anticipate bitcoin’s value to continue appreciating, which could attract further institutional adoption and drive the next bull run.
Spot ETFs’ Global Hype
The development comes as investors continue to actively invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, with Wednesday marking the strongest inflow day since March. This surge in interest coincides with BTCtrading above $71,000. These investment vehicles, which received regulatory approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January, have played a crucial role in legitimizing and facilitating activity in the market.
According to data from Farside, spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed inflows exceeding $886 million on Tuesday. Fidelity’s FBTC attracted the highest inflows of $378 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw an inflow of $270 million. Notably, Grayscale’s GBTC, which has historically experienced outflows, also attracted $28 million from investors.
Investor confidence in Bitcoin and the broader market has been boosted by a series of positive developments globally. Last month, Hong Kong gave the green light to Bitcoin ETFs, while Australia welcomed its first BTC ETF earlier this week. Additionally, the SEC approved eight spot Ether ETFs in a landmark decision last month.
More recently, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved One Asset Management, a local firm, to introduce Thailand’s first spot Bitcoin ETF.

Bitcoin Miner Riot Platform's Stock Plummets On Kerrisdale Short Report: Buying The Dip? - Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) - Benzinga

Riot Platforms, Inc. RIOT experienced a sharp decline following a bearish report from Kerrisdale Capital's Founder and Chief Investment Officer Sahm Adrangi.The immediate market reaction was significant. Riot’s stock plunged over 5% by 12:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday. This sharp decline in share price has raised questions among investors about whether this dip represents a buying opportunity.Kerrisdale Capital Is Short Riot StockAdrangi's analysis criticized Riot Platforms, highlighting that the $3-billion company derives more of its value from energy arbitrage and stock issuance rather than actual Bitcoin BTC/USD mining.Adrangi’s report argues that Bitcoin mining is among the least favorable business models for a public company. The issues cited include unpredictable revenue streams, high capital expenditure requirements, intense competition, the commodity nature of Bitcoin, and mounting regulatory scrutiny, even in traditionally crypto-friendly regions like Texas, where Riot operates.Riot clapped back against Adrangi in a prepared statement to Benzinga. “We disagree with the characterization of the Bitcoin mining industry and of Riot, and the equally unsound conclusions reached in the Kerrisdale Capital report,” the company stated. “We believe these errors will be demonstrated through the execution of our ambitious 2024 growth plans and resulting financial performance.”More on the report here: Riot Platforms Targeted by Kerrisdale Capital’s Short Sell Report: DetailsKey Indicators Suggest A Strongly Bearish TrendThe technical indicators for Riot’s stock currently suggest a strongly bearish trend. The share price is trading below its 5, 20, and 50-day exponential moving averages, which collectively indicate significant selling pressure and the potential for further declines.Chart: Benzinga Pro
Short-term Indicators: RIOT's current share price of $9.24 is below its eight-day simple moving average (SMA) of $9.88, signaling bearish trader sentiments. Additionally, the 20-day SMA stands at $10.05, reinforcing this bearish outlook.



Medium-term Indicators: The stock price remains below the 50-day SMA of $10.25, another technical signal indicating a continued bearish recommendation.



Long-term Indicators: The 200-day SMA is at $11.67, substantially higher than the current price, suggesting a long-term bearish outlook as well.
Chart: Benzinga Pro
MACD Indicator: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator stands at -0.22, further suggesting that Riot Platforms is under selling pressure.



RSI Indicator: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 40.12, with Riot Platforms’ stock treading towards the oversold territory but not yet at a level that typically signals a strong buying opportunity.



Bollinger Bands: The Bollinger Bands (20) ranging from $9.12 to $10.97, suggest the stock is trading on the lower end, reinforcing the bearish signal.
Buying The Dip? Caution AdvisedGiven the current technical landscape and Kerrisdale Capital’s bearish outlook, Riot Platforms appears to be facing substantial downward pressure. The combination of adverse market sentiment and unfavorable technical indicators suggests that investors should approach Riot’s stock with caution.While the notion of a “buy-the-dip” opportunity may appeal to some, the bearish signals from the moving averages, MACD, and RSI indicate that RIOT stock is more likely to continue its downward trajectory in the near term. Investors considering entering the market at this stage should be prepared for potential further declines and should closely monitor any shifts in technical indicators and market sentiment.Read Next: BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Up 50% Since Launch: Indicators Point To Continued BTC Bull RunImage: Shutterstock

Biden’s Surprise Veto Signals Democrats’ Crypto-Friendly Era May Have Been Wishful Thinking - The Defiant

Experts say Biden’s latest move against crypto could cost him the 2024 election.
Many thought the Biden administration was warming up to cryptocurrencies after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighting Ethereum ETFs, while the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill gained bipartisan support and Biden walked back a decision to veto it.But it was short lived.Things took a surprising turn when U.S. President Joe Biden put his foot down, vetoing legislation designed to dismantle the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.121 rule, even as 11 Democrats voted for it, joining 48 Republicans.This move has left the crypto community questioning Biden's and the Democratic party’s support.“Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory,” Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz said. “The [Democrats] were trying to defuse [Donald] Trump being the crypto president and were doing a great job. But this doesn’t help at all. Whoever is advising Biden needs to have his head examined.”Prevent Misconduct SAB 121 requires financial institutions holding crypto assets to record them as liabilities, ensuring that these entities keep a one-to-one reserve of different assets and maintain stringent internal records. The rule makes it tough and pricey for banks to offer large-scale crypto custody services.Biden, however, insisted that this accounting guidance was necessary to protect customers and prevent financial misconduct. In a statement, he mentioned that his administration aims to work with Congress on a “comprehensive and balanced” crypto regulation framework.It Will Cost HimThe crypto community wasn’t pleased."We are disappointed that Biden chose to override the bipartisan majorities in both Houses of Congress who acknowledged the harm caused by SAB 121,” Dan Spuller, vice president of the Blockchain Association said.Anthony Scaramucci from Skybridge Capital didn’t mince his words.“[Biden’s] position on crypto may cost him more than he realizes,” Scaramucci tweeted. “It was a really bad decision to veto that bill. Especially at this critical time.”Crypto lawyer Pablo Enrique weighed in, saying, “With Biden vetoing even against recommendations of the banking industry, it’s hard to see that he passes anything really solid regarding crypto.”Political ForceOf the 335.89 million U.S. residents, an estimated 50 million eligible voters are crypto enthusiasts. Crypto ownership is notably high among younger demographics, with over 40% of men aged 18-54 and more than 30% of African Americans and Hispanics owning cryptocurrencies in 2024.The growing crypto-holding demographic, plus sizable lobbying efforts with organizations such as from Coinbase, Blockchain Association, and Crypto Council for Innovation, means the once fringe blockchain industry is becoming a powerful political force​.Trump’s GainDonald Trump has tried to position himself as the pro-crypto candidate, taking a U-turn on his views on cryptocurrency. In May, Trump’s campaign accepted crypto donations, expressed support for commuting Ross Ulbricht’s sentence, and promised to keep crypto innovators in the U.S.According to the crypto-betting marketplace Polymarket, despite his conviction on May 30, Trump is predicted to win the upcoming election in November. As of the latest data, Trump's chances of winning are at 56%, while Biden's are at 37%.Glimmer of HopeStill the passing of FIT 21, which aims to create a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and digital assets, provides a glimmer of hope for the crypto industry that it is getting more bi-partisan support.The bill passed in the House with a vote of 279 to 136, and the Senate with a vote of 60 to 38. Notably, 135 Democrats in the House supported FIT 21, while 27 Democrats in the Senate voted in favor.This level of Democratic support for a cryptocurrency-related bill is substantial compared to previous crypto bills.Bills like the Token Taxonomy Act (2018) and the Crypto-Currency Act of 2020 had minimal Democratic support, with fewer than 10 and 5 Democratic co-sponsors, respectively.But for some experts like Joe Vezzani, CEO, LunarCrush, it doesn’t really matter if Biden is pro or against crypto.“I’m not worried about the short-term effects that Biden will have on the industry,” he told The Defiant. “The industry will continue to grow and flourish with or without the support of these people, like it always did."

‘Hamster Kombat’ Daily Cipher Guide: How to Use Morse Code to Earn a Million Free Coins in the Telegram Game - Decrypt

If you’re playing Hamster Kombat on Telegram, then you’re surely trying to rack up as many in-game coins as possible ahead of the token launch on The Open Network (TON) and accompanying airdrop. The daily combo is a solid option, but now there’s another way to bank a million free tokens every single day.The daily cipher is a new addition that lets you tap a specific daily term in Morse code and immediately get one million free in-game coins. It’s as simple as that—although we’ll see whether the game gets craftier about conveying the daily message to players.Here’s how to enter the daily cipher code to earn your free coins, and where to find it.What is the daily cipher?Introduced on June 5, Hamster Kombat’s daily cipher offers engaged players 1 million free tokens daily. It was teased via a post on the game’s official Telegram channel, along with a string of Morse code displayed on the Telegram mini app’s loading screen (it literally read “LOADING”).There’s a specific input method, though, so here’s what you need to know.To begin the process, tap the “Earn per tap” box three times on the main screen. This will change the background of your hamster icon to red, and a “Daily Cipher” box will appear below your earnings meter. Now you’re set to enter the code.The very first term for June 5 was “BTC” (aka Bitcoin), and it’s inputted through the following Morse code string: long hold and then three quick taps (B), long hold (T), and finally a long hold followed by a tap, another long hold, and another tap (C).Screenshots from Hamster Kombat. Image: DecryptEach letter is displayed on the screen after it’s accurately entered, so you’ll know whether you’ve got it right.

Popular Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Outperform Bitcoin As Market Enters Meme Coin Super Cycle


																Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo has laid out a bullish narrative for Dogecoin (DOGE), revealing how well the foremost meme coin could perform in this bull run. He also suggested that there was no need to worry about Dogecoin’s current price action, which paints a bearish outlook for the meme coin. 
Dogecoin Will Outpace Bitcoin In This Market Cycle
Crypto Kaleo mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he has “an insanely high conviction” that Dogecoin will “outpace” Bitcoin in this market cycle. He made this statement while revealing that he is also bullish on the flagship crypto. Given how high Bitcoin is expected to rise in this bull run, this undoubtedly paints an ultra-bullish narrative for the foremost meme coin.

From the chart he shared, Crypto Kaleo predicts that Dogecoin could rise over 200% against its Bitcoin pair and climb to as high as $0.55. He is convinced that Dogecoin can make such a run because he claims the market is in a “meme super cycle.”As such, he remarked that the “king of memes won’t be left behind.”
Despite this being a meme super cycle like Crypto Kaleo claims, Dogecoin’s price has continued to lag compared to other meme coins. However, the analyst suggested that DOGE’s current price action is normal, stating that the meme coin “moves sideways for extended periods, followed by rapid vertical growth.”
In an earlier X post, the analyst suggested that this “rapid vertical growth” could happen once GameStop’s (GME) stock tops. He drew a correlation between both assets, noting that Dogecoin’s price rallied in the 2021 bull run after GME topped. He expects something similar to happen this time, especially with Roaring Kitty’s return.
Meanwhile, Crypto Kaleo isn’t the only one who believes that Dogecoin can outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle. Crypto analyst Don Alt also seems to hold this belief as he previously suggested that Dogecoin was a better investment than Bitcoin based on his claim that Dogecoin can rise to as high as $2 in this bull run. 
DOGE Going To Go Parabolic Later This Year
Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa has also offered a bullish narrative for Dogecoin. In a recent X post, he stated that the foremost meme coin “is going to do something stupid later this year,” suggesting that a parabolic rise was on the horizon for Dogecoin. He added that Dogecoin is still one of the “safest trades” anyone can make in this cycle.

He also seems to believe that Dogecoin can outperform Bitcoin in this cycle, noting in another X post that Dogecoin was one of the few altcoins that increased and held above their Bitcoin pair in the 2021 bull run. He added that these altcoins “are for this cycle” and that crypto investors should keep this in mind.

Bitcoin Breaks $71,000 As Coinbase Premium Sees Green Spike


								The Bitcoin price has observed a surge back above the $71,000 level during the past day as buyers appear to have returned on Coinbase.
Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Has Witnessed A Large Positive Spike
As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC Coinbase Premium Index has registered a high value recently. The “Coinbase Premium Index” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).
When the value of this metric is positive, it means the price of the cryptocurrency listed on Coinbase is greater than on Binance right now. Such a trend implies the presence of a higher buying pressure (or just a lower selling pressure) on the former exchange than the latter one.

On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies a larger amount of selling may be occurring on Coinbase than on Binance at the moment, which has pushed the price on the former to a lower value.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the last few weeks:

The value of the indicator seems to have spiked quite high recently | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has been mostly at negative levels during the past couple of weeks. Prior to this red streak, the metric had seen a phase of positive levels. Interestingly, the price of the cryptocurrency had marched up alongside those green values. This would imply that the buying pressure on Coinbase may have helped fuel the rally.
Coinbase is widely known to be the preferred platform of the US-based institutional entities, while Binance hosts a more global traffic. As such, the index’s value can provide hints about how the behavior of these American whales differs from the rest of the world.
This year, these institutional investors have taken the center stage in the Bitcoin market with the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with their movements reflecting on the BTC price. The earlier pattern of the potential buying pressure from these large American investors driving the rally is just one example of this trend seen at different points in the year.
As mentioned before, what has followed this accumulation has been negative values of the Coinbase Premium Index in the past two weeks or so. While this selling pressure hasn’t caused any significant bearish effects on Bitcoin, the coin has still been unable to mount any further upward moves.
One glimmer of hope, perhaps, may have appeared in the past day, as the indicator has registered a large positive spike. It’s unclear currently whether this is going to lead to another buying streak like last month or if it’s just a temporary deviation like the two short-lived spikes already witnessed in the past week.

Whatever the case be, though, Bitcoin has been able to enjoy some bullish momentum in the last 24 hours, likely at least in part because of this buying pressure.
BTC Price
In this latest fresh surge, Bitcoin has so far been able to climb towards the $71,300 level. It now only remains to be seen how long this run can continue.

Complexity of Ethereum Driving Solana To Find Product Market Fit, According to Anatoly Yakovenko - The Daily Hodl


								Ethereum’s (ETH) complexity brings Solana’s (SOL) mission into focus, according to Anatoly Yakovenko.
The Solana co-founder says in a new interview on Bankless that his mission is simply building a hyperfast chain.










[1:49:29] “Yeah, network effects, TVL (total value locked), all these things could matter, but it’s not hard. It’s not something that I can bet my work on, that I would want to bet my career on. I want to build stuff that I know is going to work. 
So from my perspective, the more L2s (layer-2s) and networks and different environments there are for digital assets the better, because the more of that stuff that exists, the easier it is for a price discovery engine that runs as fast as the speed of light allows to actually find product market fit. There’s just more stuff to do price discovery on. 
So, please, go build as many L2s as you can. Build as many ultrasound monies as you can. Go forth. We’re going to build a chain that runs as fast as physics allows given the hardware gods and where they go.”
SOL is trading at $173.10 at time of writing. The 5th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 4% in the past 24 hours.

Gary Gensler Says Crypto Exchanges Are Doing What the NYSE Would ‘Never Be Allowed to Do’ - The Daily Hodl


								The Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says that crypto exchanges are doing what the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) would never be allowed to do.
In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, SEC Chair Gary Gensler says that crypto exchange platforms are not giving investors the proper disclosures required by the law and could be trading against consumers.










“Right now, without prejudging anyone, these tokens have not given you the disclosures that you not only need to make your investment decisions but also that are required by the law. 
It’s a basic concept in our securities markets… and what President Roosevelt did is he created this commission to oversee that you, the investors, get disclosure, and in the crypto markets, they aren’t giving you that disclosure. 
And secondly that exchanges, like the floor of the New York Stock Exchanges, get properly regulated to protect against fraud and manipulation, and they don’t trade against you. And these crypto exchanges are doing things we would never allow the New York Stock Exchange to do. Our laws don’t allow you to trade against your customers.” 
Gensler also touched on the approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), noting that deciding on launching the ETH ETFs could take some time, but didn’t give any specific dates.
“Ethereum has been traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for three+ years and the staff looked at that closely and that was approved. Now the underlying exchange-traded products still need to go through a process to have a disclosure about that and that will take some time and they’re working on that.” 
The SEC approved Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January, paving the way for billions of dollars worth of inflows for the top crypto asset by market cap.

JPMorgan Analysts Announced: "The Event That Could Shift the Balance in Bitcoin (BTC) Mining is Near" - Bitcoin Sistemi


JPMorgan highlighted in a recent research report that Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies with attractive energy contracts could make interesting acquisition targets. This comes at a time when hyperscalers and artificial intelligence (AI) companies are exploring different alternatives to secure their energy needs.
The mining industry is witnessing a surge in mergers and acquisitions, especially after the Bitcoin halving. Shares of Core Scientific (CORZ) rose on Tuesday after cloud computing firm CoreWeave signed a 200-megawatt (MW) AI deal with Bitcoin mining. CoreWeave has also reportedly made an all-cash offer to acquire the company. In another development, Riot Platforms (RIOT), another major Bitcoin miner, made an aggressive bid to acquire peer Bitfarms (BITF) last month.


According to JPMorgan, Core Scientific news will be most impactful for Iris Energy (IREN), which is an early adopter of HPC and has rights to develop over 2 gigawatts (GW) of power.
JPMorgan suggests that this deal could raise the “valuation base for subscale mining operators” as a new customer class, Hyperscalers, emerges. The bank also added that it could help “rationalize the Bitcoin network” by shifting power capacity away from miners, thus increasing the profits of the remaining operators.





The bank estimates that US-listed Bitcoin miners draw up to 5 GW of power and have access to an additional 2.5 GW, making them potentially attractive targets. Additionally, some Bitcoin miners who are under financial pressure to exit the market following the recent halving event may be more open to a deal.

GameStop Pumps 16% as SEC Chair Gensler Sidesteps Roaring Kitty Question - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsGameStop shares popped 16% to over $31 on Wednesday after Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), was asked about Keith Gill.Better known online as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, the meme stock influencer was brought up by the hosts of CNBC’s Mad Money. Before they could finish asking a question about Gill’s online return, Gensler interrupted to address the show’s audience directly.Describing the SEC as a cop on the beat, Gensler said the agency investigates the behavior of financial market participants as one might expect. But, “following the facts and the law,” he said the agency would only speak publicly about a matter if it was being brought before a court.“Generally speaking, you have to make sure you don’t mislead the public, and that you don’t, in any way, do things in the markets that may be manipulative,” Gensler said, declining to say whether the SEC is currently scrutinizing Gill’s trading or online behavior.Gill’s social media posts and recently purchased GameStop (GME) holdings have caught the attention of the SEC, as well as the securities regulator in Massachusetts.Kicking off his online return with an image of a man leaning forward in a chair on Twitter last month, Mad Money host Jim Cramer posited that Gill could’ve been sending gamers a coded message.“We know from video game playing, [that] means: come on, this is the ninth inning, get ready,” Cramer said. “Is this something, hypothetically, that the SEC should worry about?”While solidly up for the day, GameStop shares exhibited some irregular trading activity. While the stock traded at around $29.10 on Wednesday afternoon, it dipped momentarily to $26.27, a 10% decrease that was quickly reversed in the midst of the trading day.While Gill’s Twitter presence drew chatter on Wednesday, the meme stock influencer has recently resurfaced on Reddit too. Echoing his “YOLO updates” where he posted GameStop positions in 2021, Gill has posted his purported holdings on the platform twice so far this week.Gill’s Reddit account, however, was silent on Tuesday. In his most recent post, a screengrab suggested that Gill owns $289 million in GameStop shares and call options. Overall, the positions shown had increased by over $85 million in value.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

RWA industry still faces regulatory and infrastructure challenges, says eSync executive - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The tokenized US Treasuries market surpassed the $1.5 billion market on June 4th and serves as an important metric on how tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is growing as an industry. Nevertheless, this market is still distant from its traditional counterpart, as the US government sold a record $23 trillion in Treasuries last year, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.For Sally Meouche-Ghrawi, an executive from the RWA-focused infrastructure eSync Network, the relatively small size of the tokenization industry can be tied to the infrastructure and regulatory landscape. “There are many risks when it comes to real-world asset tokenization, and these risks are usually off-chain. The digitalization process is fairly straightforward, what comes before that is more questionable, which is the off-chain formalization,” she explained. “This is affected by factors such as the legal framework, the different market prices, and the historical performances of assets.”Additionally, the process of onboarding institutional investors in RWA tokenization hits a wall when it comes to proper infrastructure to adequately support them. Although Sally highlighted that significant developments have been made in the RWA industry, such as interoperability solutions developed by Chainlink and Axelar, those services still have their issues when it comes to onboarding different institutions.“First it’s because of trust issues, and then it’s because of understanding. And then how do you provide the proper infrastructure and security within a specific legal and regulatory framework to maneuver this? So there are a lot of moving parts when it comes to the RWA tokenization process. And this needs time, I guess, for the markets to mature, but also for the technology and the infrastructure to be more favorable.”Onboarding regular Joes and JanesThe RWA industry has seen the entrance of significant traditional institutions, such as Franklin Templeton and, more recently, the largest asset manager in the world BlackRock. This makes the market competitive and challenging for new projects.However, Sally stated that eSync is not looking to compete with those goliaths since they are not focused on onboarding decentralized finance and Web3-experienced users, even though they are a desirable audience.“I think that the RWA market itself is quite big enough, and it’s going to only grow further and further within the coming months and years. When it comes to what we’re doing, I would say that we’re focusing on specific niche use cases and we are focusing on a specific target audience. When it comes to the specific target audience we are targeting, I’m talking about the average Joes and Janes out there.”Therefore, eSync’s efforts are directed to democratize access to investments and provide regular users with passive income. “We’re talking about the regular people that have $200 per se per month that they can allocate to specific investments.”

Bitcoin Price Rises After Bank of Canada Cuts Interest Rate Below 5% - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsCanada’s central bank just cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four years—a pivotal move that suggests other monetary authorities could soon start doing the same.That’s good news for risk assets like Bitcoin, which have historically performed well when borrowing money is cheap and when the fiat money supply is on the rise. After the news broke, Bitcoin shot up 1.5% to $71,600, its highest price since March. The price of BTC has settled to $70,930 as of writing, according to CoinGecko data.“We've come a long way in the fight against inflation,” said Bank governor Tiff Macklem during opening remarks on Wednesday. “And our confidence that inflation will continue to move closer to the two per cent target has increased over recent months.”The cut, which brings the country’s policy rate down 2 basis points from 5.0% to 4.75%, makes Canada the first G7 country to begin relaxing its fight against inflation, which overran the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.In Canada, annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has now cooled from 8.1% in June 2022 down to 2.7% in April 2024."We don't want monetary policy to be more restrictive than it needs to be to get inflation back to target,” said Macklem. “But if we lower our policy interest rate too quickly, we could jeopardize the progress we've made.”The central bank of Switzerland, where inflation was a low 1.4% in April, led the world with an interest rate cut back in March down to 1.5%. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is largely expected to cut its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% at its next meeting – which is tomorrow.By contrast, inflation in the United States has proven more sticky at 3.4% in April, prompting suspicions that the Federal Reserve could keep rates “higher for longer.”According to CME Fedwatch, the market still believes the Fed will keep rates flat at its June meeting, though a 25 basis point cut by September is viewed as the most likely outcome.That said, the Fed also cut the rate of its quantitative tightening program by over 50% last month, which has a net effect of reducing the pace at which the Fed takes money out of the economy.“Keeping front-end rates elevated while simultaneously tapering QT can be likened to both applying the brakes to a car and accelerating at the same time,” wrote Coinshares Head of Research James Butterill in May.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

The Cutting Edge for Rates | Bankless


Cuts Are Coming! After two rough years combating inflation through higher interest rates, global central banks are finally beginning the rate cut process! How will this developing trend impact your investment portfolio in the coming months?Early this morning, the Bank of Canada (BOC) reduced its overnight interest rate target by 0.25% to 4.75%, the bank’s first cut in four years and the first instance of a G7 nation adopting looser monetary policy in the post-COVID era.While the Canadian consumer price index (CPI) for the month of April came in marginally above the bank’s long-term target of 2%, the BOC cited “continued evidence that underlying inflation is easing” in justifying its initial round of cuts.
Despite widespread uncertainty about when America’s Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, with one audacious Barron’s headline released this weekend even claiming there will be no cuts in 2024, interest rate reductions from the BOC were the base case scenario for this meeting: swap markets had priced in an 80% chance of their occurrence.Tomorrow, the European Central Bank (ECB) is set to announce its interest rate target for the month ahead, and market participants are near unanimous they will be cut, pricing in with 96% certainty that the ECB’s rate target will be reduced by 25 basis points.Falling risk-free rates globally amid resistance to cuts from the Fed increase the attractiveness of holding dollar investments, bolstering dollar strength that could potentially reignite inflationary pressures overseas and placing immense pressure on U.S. monetary officials to implement their own cuts in the near future.
 Western Bloc nations, particularly those belonging to the G7, exhibit extremely close policy alignment, meaning it is unlikely that the BOC and ECB would have made such major changes in policy without first consulting the Fed on when it intends to cut.Although the CME’s FedWatch Tool indicates that there is little change for change in US interest rates until September, it is clear that global policy makers are coordinating on lower interest rates, illuminating the pathway towards an aggressive cutting cycle.Bulls have been invigorated by the development, sending the prices of both stock indexes and crypto’s majors surging within inches of establishing new cycle highs, and while U.S. interest rate cuts remain largely unexpected from a seemingly hawkish Fed, this stance will is set to be reversed at the first sign of objectively troubling economic data.Many data series already show the economic decline has begun, and when taken in combination with emerging global trends of easing monetary policy – particularly among key economic allies – surprise Fed cuts could be in store for next week.
During the Global Financial Crisis, Fed officials attempted to kickstart the deteriorating economy and stall out the stock market slide with a dramatic 0.75% rate cut on January 22, 2008.While these cuts succeeded in producing temporary bullish tailwinds for risk assets, allowing the broad-market S&P 500 to rebound nearly 15% off its lows, unfortunately, they ultimately proved unsuccessful at yielding a lasting impact and the index’s price had halved by year end.The need for policy makers to cut rates is a harbinger for impending economic trouble, and historically, the tools available to central banks have proved ineffective at stymying the economic downside they are intended to prevent.

Ether Price Poised For Ballistic Rally As Spot ETH ETFs Could Pull In Record $4 Billion In First Five Months ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that directly hold ether will perform similarly well to their Bitcoin-based predecessors, drawing in $4 billion of inflows within the first five months after introduction, according to cryptocurrency analytics firm K33 Research.



1 Million ETH In Five Months



Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain network, is now the focus of the next spot crypto ETF following the SEC’s recent approval of key regulatory filings from applicants. Analysts at K33 Research predict the stunning success of the incoming Ether-based products.



K33 Research’s $4 billion estimate is based on comparisons between existing Bitcoin (BTC) products and assets under management in similar ETH-based exchange-traded products (ETPs).



“This estimate is based on the relative global ETH assets under management (AUM) market share compared to BTC of 28%,” wrote K33 Senior analyst Vetle Lunde and DeFi analyst David Zimmerman in a Tuesday report.



Similarly, the ETH’s open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is currently 23% of the size of BTC futures, indicating a similar market share in another institutionally concentrated market.

&nbsp



US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have so far attracted $13.9 billion since their January launch. Globally, these Bitcoin products now control more than 1 million BTC, comprising over 5% of the crypto’s circulating supply.



Contrarily, institutional funds presently hold 3.3% of the ETH’s total supply. Based on this, K33 expects anywhere from $3.1 billion to $4.8 billion worth of ETH ETF net flows within the first five months after the offerings officially go live. This would equate to 800,000 to 1.26 million ETH or approximately 0.7% to 1.05% of Ethereum’s circulating supply.



It’s a big prediction, considering the Ether futures ETF launch last year saw much lower demand than the debut of the first Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021. K33 believes this muted launch was an outlier, given the bad timing with which ETH ETFs became available for investors, and does not represent ETH’s actual investment demand.



Big Ether Price Breakout Expected



Looking ahead, K33 anticipates an explosive Ethereum rally post-ETF approval.



“Such significant supply absorption shock will likely lead to price appreciation in ETH, per the strong relationship witnessed between BTC ETF flows and returns throughout the year,” said Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research.



After an initial retracement in late January, Bitcoin surged roughly 60% to historic highs, thanks to listing spot ETFs on U.S. exchanges. K33 analysts noted that they are not “betting against [Larry] Fink,” with the BlackRock chief’s “Midas touch” creating a bullish setup for incredible strength for the crypto throughout the summer.



They predicted that with the introduction of Ethereum ETFs, the ETH price would start beating BTC after 2.5 years of the ETH-BTC pair’s downward trend.

In today's piece, I am going to break down ten market lessons that I wish I learned earlier. Market participants who thoroughly understand these principles will be on the fast track to profitability. Let's jump straight into it:1. Markets Discount the FutureWall Street and financial markets are master manipulators because they often bottom on poor news and vice versa. For example, Bitcoin BTC/USD bottomed within days of the FTX crypto exchange collapse, and hasn't looked back since.For equity markets, the psychology is the same. The S&P 500 Index ETF SPY and the other major indices bottomed the day inflation hit 40-year highs in the U.S in late 2022.2. Fundamentals Mean Little in a VacuumTo successfully analyze fundamentals, investors must account for the context of said fundamentals. The struggling e-commerce firm Carvana CVNA has soared more than 500% over the past year and provides a perfect fundamental lesson for investors. Why has the stock run so much? In late 2022, Carvana was on the brink of collapse. However, the company secured funding to keep the company in business. Later, it turned its earnings from awful to less bad.3. Valuations are Not a Timing DeviceAn important lesson is that valuation metrics like the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are not a valid timing tool – especially for innovative growth stocks. While the numerator (price) is known, the denominator (sales) is not known (moving forward). Because of this misconception, Zacks Investment Research heavily weights its analysis and ratings based on forward EPS expectations. Amateur investors would probably be surprised to find that Nvidia's NVDA P/S ratio has actually fallen since mid-2023 despite the massive bull move in the stock.4. Strive to Trade Like a Casino (Edge)Like life, nothing on Wall Street or investing is ever obvious or certain, which is why most active retail investors lose money or underperform. Fortunately, perfection or a very high trade success rate is not necessary to achieve investment success. Think of a casino. Casinos don't make money on every hand. However, casinos enjoy an edge that, when played out over a large series of hands, pays the bills (and then some). Similarly, investors pay "tuition" to the stock market through stop losses and risk management.Amateur investors suffer from inconsistent returns because they tend to rely on gut feel and make emotional trades. Conversely, savvy investors leverage historical precedent, data sets, fundamentals and charts to gain an edge.5. Take Asymmetric BetsAmateur investors apply more emphasis to stock picking when they should focus more time and energy on sound money management principles. Fortunately, the math is simple to understand. If an investor risks $1 to make $5 on each trade, they can be wrong 80% of the time and still break even. Using these same numbers, an investor who achieves a 40% hit rate with this reward-to-risk ratio will be highly profitable over a large enough series of trades. Don't overthink investing; let the math work in your favor.6. Fundamentals are One Piece of the PuzzleThough fundamentals are integral to a stock's long-run performance, other factors, such as changes in share supply, play a role in direction. For example, "animal spirits" and hype have largely driven GameStop's GME super performance over the past few years. Meanwhile, though Apple's AAPL earnings have largely stagnated recently, record share buybacks have decreased supply and increased demand, driving the stock higher.7. U.S. Markets Rise in TimeDespite war, recession, and countless "Black Swan" events, U.S. equities tend to rise in the long run due to America's innovative nature. The S&P 500 Index has averaged returns ~100% over the past century. While the market suffers corrections in the short term, understanding the long-term picture pays long-term dividends.8. Innovation Breeds True Market LeadersThe best-performing growth stocks are driven by growing earnings, which are sparked by innovation and disruption. For example, Blockbuster was once far larger than Netflix NFLX. However, Blockbuster failed to recognize that technology was changing and the brick-and-mortar approach to movies would no longer be relevant. Conversely, NFLX pounced on the emerging DVD-by-mail trend, and later, the streaming trend, leading to a life-changing move for its investors.9. Forward EPS Estimates & The Zacks RankInvestors can screen a large database of stocks by sorting by the Zacks Rank. Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks signify that Wall Street analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on a company's fundamentals ahead. Our extensive in-house studies show that Zacks Rank #1 stocks tend to outperform dramatically, all else equal.10. Market Direction is KingApproximately 75% of a stock's move can be attributed to the general market's direction. The most straightforward way to size up the long-term trend is to plot the 200-day moving average over the major indices like the Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ.When price is above the 200-day moving average, the market is in a bull phase, and vice versa. Never fight the trend.Bottom LineInstead of "trial by fire" investors can circumvent years of frustration by understanding ten essential principles.To read this article on Zacks.com click here.

Gary Gensler Is Now Being Asked About Bonk ETFs Following Ethereum Approvals - Decrypt

United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler found himself criticizing the crypto industry on live television yet again on Wednesday—but this time, the regulator appeared to use markedly softer language as he was asked about potential crypto ETFs ahead.“These tokens… have not given you the proper disclosures you not only need to make your investment decisions, but also that are required by the law,” Gensler said on CNBC when questioned by Jim Cramer about a slew of successful cryptocurrencies listed by the television personality. While Gensler’s tone was undeniably critical, his implication that tokens like Solana meme coin BONK might be considered acceptable investments given adequate disclosures is a far less harsh tune than the SEC chief has sung in the past. Just months ago, Gensler routinely dismissed the crypto market as a scam-riddled sector rife with “hucksters” and “fraudsters” that investors should best avoid.His apparent change in rhetoric comes just weeks after the SEC, in an eleventh-hour about-face, abruptly approved the trading of spot Ethereum ETFs on Wall Street. For months, such an outcome appeared increasingly unlikely, given recent allegations that the SEC has internally considered Ethereum to be an illegally unregistered security for over a year.While questions abound as to why Gensler and the SEC changed tack on Ethereum so suddenly, many believe the move was a direct result of shifting political winds in Washington. With the 2024 election fast approaching, and the crypto lobby dumping some $160 million into tight congressional races, many legislators have come to embrace the industry rather than fight it. Some financial analysts predict that by approving spot Ethereum ETFs, the SEC has opened the floodgates to other altcoin spot ETFs, including Solana and XRP.On Wednesday, Jim Cramer asked Gensler about the likelihood of an imminent BONK ETF trading on Wall Street—a question the SEC hair delicately sidestepped. In addition to crypto tokens, Gensler also criticized crypto exchanges from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. “These crypto exchanges are doing things we would never allow this New York Stock Exchange to do,” Gensler said. “Our laws don’t allow you to trade against your customers.”The regulator has long accused major crypto exchanges of front-running, or using publicly available knowledge of pending on-chain transactions to beat out other users bidding for block space.

Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, PEPE Top Institutional Investors Meme Coin Holdings, How Much Did They Buy? | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto exchange Bybit recently released a report highlighting how much institutional investors have invested in meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The platform revealed that these investors have been actively trading these meme coins since the start of the year and noted what specific meme coins they are currently holding. 
How Institutional Investors Have Been Going All In On Meme Coins
According to the report, institutional investors began accumulating meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) between February and March, around when the meme coin trend began to pick up. Their spot holdings in these meme coins are said to have increased by 226% to $204 million. 

These institutional investors didn’t stop there. In April, they accumulated more of these meme coins, with their total meme coin holdings rising to $293.7 million. However, these investors looked to have exited their positions as the sentiment around meme coins peaked, with their meme coin holdings dropping to $139 million by May. 
These investors are believed to have taken some profits in anticipation of the prices of these meme coins dropping due to a wave of profit-taking. Meanwhile, these investors investing heavily in these meme coins in the first place again highlight the broad adoption that this category of crypto tokens has begun to enjoy since the beginning of the year.
The interest in these meme coins among institutional investors was also evident when asset manager VanEck launched a meme coin index to track the performance of the foremost meme coins. This index includes Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Dogwifhat (WIF), Floki (FLOKI), and Bonk (BONK). 
Bybit revealed that retail investors have also been heavily invested in these meme coins, with their holdings rising by 478% from February to April. Like institutional investors, these retail investors also sold off a significant portion of their holdings, reducing their meme coin allocation from $567 million to $371 million. 
Dogecoin Tops Meme Coin Holdings Of Institutional And Retail Investors
Bybit mentioned that Dogecoin is the largest among the meme coin holdings of these institutional and retail investors. Institutional investors are said to have allocated more to the largest meme coin by market cap than retail investors, with Dogecoin accounting for 36.17% of their holdings. In comparison, DOGE only accounts for 24.58% of the meme coin holdings of retail investors.

Both categories of investors are believed to have favored Dogecoin more due to its “higher liquidity and relative stability.” Meanwhile, Ethereum-based meme coins Shiba Inu and Pepe also account for a significant portion of institutional and retail investors’ meme coin holdings. 
Shiba Inu and PEPE account for 20.95% and 14.61% of retail’s meme coin portfolio. On the other hand, institutions have invested 22.23% and 10.39% of their meme coin holdings in Shiba Inu and PEPE, respectively. Solana-based meme coin BONK was the most favored among the newer meme coins, with retail allocating $136 million to the meme coin while institutions allocated $74.5 million.

New Coinbase Smart Contract Wallet eliminates gas fees and recovery phrases - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Coinbase has launched a Smart Contract Wallet with simpler onboarding and no gas fees.
The smart contract wallet supports Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and others for seamless transactions.
Developers using the smart contract wallet can waive gas fees.

In a move to enhance user experience and streamline cryptocurrency transactions, Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has unveiled its latest innovation: the Coinbase Smart Contract Wallet.
The groundbreaking smart wallet promises to revolutionize the way users interact with cryptocurrencies by eliminating gas fees and simplifying the onboarding process.
Key features of the Coinbase Smart Contract Wallet
Unlike traditional wallets that require users to manage complex recovery phrases and incur gas fees for transactions, the Coinbase Smart Contract Wallet offers a seamless and cost-effective solution.
One of the key features of the smart contract wallet is its simplified onboarding process. Users can create a new wallet and onboard onto a blockchain without the need to download additional apps or manage recovery phrases. Instead, the smart wallet integrates seamlessly with major applications and offers multiple authentication methods, including Face ID, fingerprint ID, and Yubikey.
Moreover, the smart wallet ensures self-custody, allowing users to have full control over their funds. Users can make payments directly from their Coinbase Wallet or Coinbase account, further enhancing convenience and accessibility.
Another notable aspect of the Coinbase Smart Contract Wallet is its integration with major blockchain networks.
At launch, the wallet will support a variety of networks, including Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Zora. This multi-chain support enables users to access a wide range of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (DApps) within a single platform.
Furthermore, Coinbase has introduced a unique feature that allows developers to waive gas fees by sponsoring transactions through a paymaster. This incentivizes developers to support the adoption of the smart wallet and contribute to a more seamless user experience.
The companion web app serves as the primary platform for users, offering comprehensive asset and identity management, as well as features such as buying, sending, swapping, NFTs, and transaction history.
Coinbase aims to provide users with a fluid and intuitive experience throughout their interactions with the smart wallet.
Loopring and Argent pioneered the smart contract wallets
Coinbase is not the first to launch a smart contract wallet. It is only building upon the growing trend of smart wallet technology in the cryptocurrency space.
The smart contract wallet technology was pioneered by companies like Loopring and Argent. The wallets offer enhanced security, usability, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional wallet solutions.

Bitcoin (BTC) Options Traders Anticipate Brakeout Above $74K to New Record Prices Soon

Bitcoin has spent almost three months consolidating since notching an all-time high slightly below $74,000 in mid-March. After plummeting briefly below $57,000 in early May, it saw a steady recovery, now changing hands at around $71,000, only a few percentage points from new record prices.

The Protocol: Another Episode in the Layer-2 Teams Drama

This isn’t the first time that Matter Labs has found itself in hot water with its competitors. In August 2023, the Polygon team went on a media blitz with the claim that Matter Labs had copied its Plonky-2 software system without proper attribution. Leaders from other teams, like Starkware, also weighed in at the time, expressing their disappointment with Matter Labs. (Gluchowski denied the claims of copying but said his team “could have done better” by providing clearer attribution to other teams' open-source code.) Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal seemed to reference the debacle when he weighed in on the earlier dispute, saying in a statement last week that "zkSync has repeatedly acted contrary to the Web3 ethos, despite consistently signaling those same values. We believe that if we do not publicly address this behavior, it will persist and potentially worsen." Alex Gluchowski, the CEO of Matter Labs, initially dismissed the complaints, sharing that his intention with the trademark application was to protect users and adding that Matter Labs would eventually move to share the trademark with a yet-to-exist consortium of ecosystem stakeholders. Three days later, however, Matter Labs opted to walk back on its trademark efforts entirely.

Good News from Franklin Templeton CEO on Bitcoin: "We Have Not Seen The Second Wave Yet" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson expressed optimism about the future of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in a recent interview. Johnson believes his company's fund is well positioned to capture greater market share and expects an increase in demand for these products.
“We haven't even had the second wave yet. This is really the first wave of early adopters, and I think the next wave will be larger institutions that are more comfortable with how the system fits in,” Johnson said.


Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant capital inflow since their launch on January 11, generating over $13 billion in net inflows in less than three months. To date, they have seen a total inflow of 14.8 billion dollars. This influx of capital has driven the BTC price up over 60% year-to-date, reaching a new peak price of $73,700 in March.

However, both ETF inflows and price movements stagnated in April and May, leading to speculation that demand may have peaked. Despite this, Johnson believes many professional money managers are still figuring out how to incorporate Bitcoin into their portfolio strategies.





“Right now Bitcoin is a little bit risk-on, a little bit risk-off,” he said, adding: “It's a little bit like gold, so some people think about it that way, some think about it in terms of technology.”
Johnson stated that the firm hopes its Bitcoin product will attract fee-sensitive investors and thus capture a larger market share.

US employment data reinforces rate cuts, boosting crypto: Nansen analyst - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The US ADP National Employment Report increased by 152,000 in May, below the expected number of 175,000 and the smallest increase since January. The ADP measures the monthly change in non-farm and private employment and a result below the expected signals that employment growth and wage growth are slowing down.Aurelie Barthere, Principal Research Analyst at research firm Nansen, assesses that this result paints a picture of moderating real growth and a cooling labor market in the US when combined with other real activity data, such as retail sales, Q1 GDP, and CAPEX.“As long as growth slows but does not contract, it is likely to push US rates lower and become a tailwind for crypto. So far, we cannot say that the slowdown in growth is too severe,” added Barthere.Moreover, she mentions the services sector, which is holding up as proven by the latest PMI business survey, and highlighted that Jerome Powell has indicated that, were unemployment to increase with inflation sticky, he would have a preference for rate cuts.“So investors are pricing a ‘Fed put’ when growth data comes in weak, but not too weak. Friday’s payroll is likely to become the next major data point in this narrative.”A bright JuneCrypto industry players expect a “bright June” for the market, as reported by Crypto Briefing. Fueled by the spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval in the US, this month can be met with an ETH price leap.Additionally, ETH price momentum could spark a broad altcoin market growth, resulting in a “meme coin summer”, as this sector of the crypto market is showing the same signs of the non-fungible token (NFT) summer witnessed in 2021. As a result, retail money pulled from other high-yield projects temporarily might flow into crypto.There are also the European Parliament elections, set to happen between June 6th and June 9th, in which the results could mean a more pro-crypto stance in the European Union, resulting in favorable regulations.

Chainlink Tops Real-World Crypto Assets With the Most Development Again


																Chainlink (LINK), the native token of the decentralized blockchain oracle network built on Ethereum, has emerged once more as the top real-world asset with the most development activity in the last 30 days.
According to a tweet by Santiment, LINK is followed by Synthetix (SNX), Centrifuge (CFG), and Oraichain (ORAI).
Top RWAs With the Most Development
Real-world assets are cryptocurrencies that represent physical assets like properties and objects. Like other crypto assets, they run on smart contracts and blockchains and have been gaining popularity recently, with a market capitalization running into billions of dollars.
Santiment determines which real-world assets are seeing significant developer activity by pulling their projects’ GitHub data from repositories through a back-tested process to ensure only the teams’ efforts to innovate and improve are included. The on-chain analytics firm compiles the list of the top ten most developed projects by counting their non-redundant GitHub activity and averaging their daily data over the last 30 days.
Through the methodology, Santiment found that LINK was the most developed real-world asset in the crypto sector. The cryptocurrency also topped the list for April, producing 2.49x more daily activity than Synthetix, which came second place at the time. In May, Chainlink recorded a developer activity of 428.83, roughly 45 points up from its April activity of 383.03.




LINK to See Higher Rally
It is worth noting that SNX and CFG maintained their second and third places on the list after LINK, with GitHub activities that spiked significantly, indicating rising interest in the projects. Oraichain surpassed Dusk Foundation and took fourth place, while the latter fell to fifth.
Santiment noted that MakerDAO and Polymesh also emerged as notable risers, climbing up two positions. On the other hand, IX Swap fell to the eighth position as MakerDAO surpassed it. Projects like Defactor appeared on the list while Creditcoin left.
Chainlink’s sustained development activity coincides with LINK’s 25% rally in the past month and analysts’ belief that the digital asset could keep rising in the coming months. The predictions are substantiated by the rise in LINK whale activity, daily transaction volume, and major partnerships with heavyweight traditional finance firms.

Jim Cramer Asks SEC Chair If There Will Be A BONK ETF


																Gary Gensler – chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – sat down with CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer on Wednesday to discuss the regulator’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals, alongside what may be coming next.
That included questions about whether obscure meme coins could soon receive their own ETFs, such as SushiSwap (SUSHI) and Bonk (BONK).

Cramer named a host of coins to Gensler that had all traded “millions of dollars” on Wednesday morning – including Cardano, Cosmos, Immutable, Ronin, and MyNeighborAlice, among others.

“Now in two weeks, should we have a SushiSwap ETF?” asked Cramer. “I would think that Bonk is a natural, and Osmosis. These are millions of dollars these things are trading – shouldn’t we have some sort of product?”

Gensler did not provide specific answers to those questions, but noted that many of the crypto tokens generally “have not given you the disclosures you need to make investment decisions,” implying that such tokens are unregistered securities.
He also called out crypto exchange platforms, which are “doing things we would never allow our New York Stock Exchange to do.”
“You’ve seen the bankruptcies in this space,” Gensler said. “The most leading lights in this field are either in jail, about to go to jail, or awaiting extradition.”
Gensler also commented on the Ethereum spot ETF approvals late last month, which he said will still “take some time” before their registration statements are approved and they can be listed on public exchanges.
When previously questioned on the matter, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets said the fund had little interest in launching altcoin ETFs, with Bitcoin being the “overwhelming top priority” among its client base.

Coinbase Reveals New Smart Wallet Platform Offering ‘Gasless On-Chain Experience’ - The Daily Hodl


								Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, has announced the launch of its new smart wallet platform.
In a blog post, Coinbase says the launch will kick off the next chapter in the firm’s Coinbase Wallet product by “revolutionizing the on-chain experience” by getting rid of network fees and recovery phrases.










Says Coinbase,
“Smart wallets offer a streamlined, gasless on-chain experience. This simplicity, combined with multi-chain support and integration with major applications, will make onboarding to the blockchain as effortless as signing into your favorite website. 
Until now, going on-chain has been slow, expensive, and hard, with separate wallet app installs and first-generation blockchains. Smart wallets, with their ease of use, paired with next-generation Layer 2 networks like Base, finally set the stage to bring many more people onchain. Now, getting onchain is easy, fast, and cheap.”
Coinbase will be offering a companion web application for the new smart wallet with features like asset and identity management, buy, send, swap, NFTs, and transaction history. The web app will be the primary platform for smart wallet users to manage their wallets.
Once it launches, Coinbase says that smart wallets will initially support eight networks, including Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB and Zora, though other chains will be integrated in the future.
The firm is also encouraging developers to integrate smart wallets into their apps by allowing them to earn up to $15,000 in gas credits through the “Base Gasless Campaign” which will essentially allow the sponsorship of their users’ transactions at zero cost.
Says Coinbase,
“Our smart wallets represent a significant leap forward in the world of self-custody and onchain transactions. By addressing the main concerns of traditional self-custody wallets and providing a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience, smart wallets are poised to transform the way we interact on-chain. 
We’re excited for developers and users to take advantage of this new groundbreaking solution, and we believe that simplifying the onboarding experience will lead to widespread adoption.”

Binance Exec Saga: 16 US Lawmakers Urge For Biden’s Action


								The complex saga between crypto exchange Binance and the Nigerian government has intensified as US congress members have called for the Biden administration’s immediate action.
In a letter addressed to the US president, the lawmakers expressed concern about Binance Executive Tigran Gambaryan’s health and urged the government to bring him back from Nigerian imprisonment.

US Lawmakers Urge For Binance Exec Safely Return
On June 4, 16 US congress members signed a letter urging President Biden to intervene in the case of former US federal agent Tigran Gambaryan. The executive has been detained in Nigeria for the past three months, and his current health state has raised alarms among House members.
Nigerian authorities detained Gambaryan on February 26 alongside his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla, who later escaped. Since then, the executive has been in custody, without access to his passport, and under supervised communication with his legal team and family.

The letter states that Gambaryan’s unlawful detention has been marked by excessive and harsh treatment. It emphasizes that the charges against the executive are “baseless and constitute a coercion tactic by the Nigerian government to extort his employer, Binance.”
In court, the Nigerian authorities have admitted to retaining Gambaryan as their only bargaining card against the crypto exchange. On April 25, the prosecutor stated that since “The 1st defendant [Binance] is operating virtually. The only thing we have to hold on to is this defendant [Tigran].”
Binance’s CEO, Richard Teng, has addressed this in a letter. Teng called out the Nigerian government for trying to set a dangerous precedent for all companies worldwide with its crackdown on Binance’s mid-level employees.
A Call For Action “Before It’s Too Late”
The US lawmakers highlighted Gambaryan’s “impressive and distinguished” background as a federal agent. Additionally, they pointed out the irony of his legacy being acclaimed by the government while the former federal agent fights for his life in a prison cell:

Mr. Gambaryan’s legacy of dedication to justice and the law continued even after he left federal service. On May 3rd of this year, while Tigran fought for his life inside a prison cell designed to hold ISIS combatants, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a press release announcing a historic seizure, thanking former Special Agent Tigran for his groundbreaking work in the investigation.

In the letter, the congress members painted a worrying picture, explaining that the executive’s life was at risk due to a lack of medical treatment. As reported by Bitcoinist, Gambaryan suffered from a health episode during a court hearing on May 23.
The day prior, the former US federal agent failed to appear in court for the tax evasion case against him, raising concerns about his physical state and whereabouts. However, he showed up to the money laundering charges hearing the next day, where he collapsed and required medical assistance.
Since then, it has been revealed that Gambaryan tested positive for malaria and has been denied adequate medical assistance by the prison officers. Due to his collapse, the court ordered that the executive be sent to a hospital to be treated.
According to the lawmakers’ letter, this request has not been fully complied with, and Gambaryan has not received adequate treatment for the disease. As a result, the House members, including Chairman Michael McCaul, are urging the US government to step forward.
The letter requests Gambaryan’s case to be transferred to the Office of the Special President Envoy for Hostages Affairs. Ultimately, the politicians expressed their fear for the executive’s life and called for immediate action “before it’s too late.”

Giant Ethereum Whale Adds 7,000 ETH to its $140 Million Stash as Spot Ether ETFs Loom | Cryptoglobe


                                
A “giant” Ethereum (ETH) whale that has mad over $76 million in profit from investing in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has restarted accumulating more tokens amid growing speculation that spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will soon start trading in the United States.



According to blockchain analytics firm SpotOnChain, this “giant whale” has recently withdrawn 7,000 ETH worth over $26 million from leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance at around $3,800 per coin, after withdrawing most of their ETH during last year’s bear market, and depositing it back onto the centralized exchange once the price rose.



The whale currently holds 36,785 ETH worth over $140 million and is sitting on a profit of around $76.6 million.







As CryptoGlobe reported, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission unexpectedly permitted spot Ether exchange-traded funds for Ether last month in a surprising move that saw the price of ETH soar over 25% as the market was expecting a rejection.



Investors are likely to be encouraged by the successful debut of US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which have accumulated billions in assets at a rapid pace, to the point BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) became the fastest ETF to hit $20 billion in assets in just 144 days, with the runner-up having done so in over 900 days.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Adding to this whale accumulation has been growing, as according to an analyst from cryptocurrency analytics firm CryptoQuant, over 800,000 ETH worth around $3 billion has moved off of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in little over a week.



The analyst noted that institutions preparing for a spot Ethereum ETF to start trading in the United States could be behind the centralized exchange outflows in a bid to meet the potential demand from investors for such a fund.



Notably IntoTheBlock, a cryptocurrency intelligence firm, has noted that whale accumulation has recently intensified, with 41% of the supply of the second-largest cryptocurrency now being held by addresses with more than 1% of its total circulating supply, up from 36% at the beginning of the year.



Per the firm, the trend highlights the increasing confidence in ETH among large holders.

Three Whales Activated: They're Making Crazy Transactions on This Memecoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to onchain data provided by Lookonchain, a whale has started to accumulate truly incredible amounts of memecoins.
A total of 9 cryptocurrency wallets owned by two different whales purchased 1.35 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) worth 35.2 million dollars at an average price of 0.00002596 dollars in the last 12 hours.


At the time of writing this article, SHIB price is trading at $0.00002581. It appears that the whale's purchase did not result in a meaningful increase in the price of the memecoin.

Further onchain analysis showed that yet another SHIB whale was buying. According to the data, in the last 6 hours, a whale purchased 715.9 billion SHIB tokens by paying 4,849 ETH worth 18.44 million dollars. Previously, this whale had purchased 5.5 trillion units of SHIB for only $400 thousand in the early period of SHIB and sold it for $121 million at the two peaks.





So this whale had previously earned approximately 120 million dollars in total through SHIB.

Crypto Case Fiasco Leads To Complete Shutdown Of SEC Office In This City | Bitcoinist.com


								As a result of its ongoing crackdown on the nascent crypto industry and mounting unfavorable results in its cases against digital asset platforms, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced the impending closure of its regional office in Salt Lake City, citing “significant attrition.” 
The Salt Lake City office is the SEC’s sole regional outpost, and its enforcement authority is limited to a single state. Utah’s jurisdiction will now be transferred to the SEC’s Denver office while the regulator affirms its commitment to keeping other regional offices open.
SEC’s Loss In Debt Box Crypto Case 
According to the Wall Street Journal, the decision to close the Salt Lake City office comes after a turbulent period, primarily associated with the SEC’s failed enforcement action against Digital Licensing, also known as Debt Box, a cryptocurrency platform. 
People familiar with the matter clarify that the office closure is related to, but not solely a consequence of, the SEC’s setback in the Debt Box case.

In August of the previous year, the Salt Lake City office secured a temporary asset freeze and restraining order against Debt Box, as it accused the company and its principals of defrauding investors of at least $49 million.  
However, in November, Judge Robert Shelby expressed concerns over material misrepresentations by SEC lawyers from the Salt Lake City office while obtaining the temporary restraining order. 
The following month, SEC enforcement director Gurbir Grewal apologized in a court filing, and in January, the agency filed a motion to dismiss the case.
SEC Ordered To Pay $1.8 Million In Fees
Despite initial admissions of mistakes and apologies for the “shortfall” in the case, the SEC’s attempt at damage control proved ineffective. In an 80-page ruling, Judge Shelby imposed sanctions on the SEC, requiring them to cover Debt Box’s legal fees related to the temporary restraining order. Furthermore, the judge denied the SEC’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice. 
The SEC faced another setback when ordered to pay Debt Box approximately $1.8 million in fees, including receiver fees and legal expenses.
Debt Box expressed satisfaction with the dismissal, characterizing it as a significant victory. However, the SEC’s legal entanglements within cryptocurrency are far from over. 
The regulatory agency continues to face ongoing challenges with prominent cryptocurrency companies such as Binance, Kraken, Ripple, and Coinbase, in addition to its unresolved conflict with Debt Box.

The Salt Lake City office experienced personnel departures after the Debt Box case. Two SEC lawyers, Michael Welsh and Joseph Watkins, resigned in April, while the office’s director, Tracy Combs, also stepped down in May.
As the SEC grapples with the fallout from its failed enforcement action and the closure of its Salt Lake City office, its engagements with major cryptocurrency industry players remain in the spotlight.

Analyst Says Get Ready As Dogecoin Enters ‘Expansion Stage’, Can DOGE Reach $12?


																Dogecoin is one of the cryptocurrencies getting a lot of interest from analysts recently. With meme coins expected to outperform once again during this bull cycle, crypto analyst Crypto Kinfolk has pointed out where the Dogecoin price could end up as this bull cycle manifests.
Dogecoin Enters Expansion Stage
In an analysis posted on the TradingView platform, crypto analyst Crypto Kinfolk laid out a possible scenario that could see the Dogecoin price soar from here. Starting out with a brief history, the crypto analyst highlighted how far the meme coin has come since being created back in 2013 as a joke. Also, having such a long history has made it possible for historical analysis to be drawn for the meme coin.

	Related Reading


One of these historical analyses is how the price of Dogecoin has performed in previous bull markets. In the last two bull markets, meaning the 2017-2018 and 2020-2021 bull markets, the DOGE price saw massive gains of 21,000% and 50,000%, respectively.
Given this, a continuation of this trend could suggest that the meme coin could outperform in another bull market. As Crypto Kinfolk points out, Dogecoin has created a habit of mimicking its performance from the last bull cycle. So if there is a repeat, then this bull cycle could be just as explosive as the last, leading to what the analyst calls “a mind melting bull run.”
Can DOGE Price Rise To $12 This Bull Cycle?
Pointing to the chart, Crypto Kinfolk explains that Dogecoin has finally completed its bear market trend, which is now giving way for recovery. More importantly, the meme coin is breaking out of accumulation, something that is historically bullish for price. As a result of this, the crypto analyst believes that the DOGE price has now entered an “expansion stage.”
In this expansion stage, the meme coin is expected to outperform, and even if it replicates just a small percentage of its previous bull runs, its price could quickly rise to unprecedented levels. The first target put forward by the analyst in this stage is $4.20. Hitting this first target would mean an almost 2,500% increase from its current price level of $0.1626 at the time of writing.
Source: Tradingview.com
However, the analyst does not stop there, expecting further outperformance from the meme coin. The second target is a 6,100% increase to hit the $10.10 level. Last but not least, the third target was placed at $12, representing an expected 7,200% increase in price.

“With rumors shooting around the internet that Elon may add DOGE as the local currency for the X platform and this being a real possibility, I think it is counterproductive to think these type of gains are not in the cards,” Crypto Kinfolk concluded.

Bitcoin Users Just Wasted $100K on Invalid Rune Mints - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsNearly $100,000 in BTC was vaporized on invalid Rune Protocol mints, according to Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes explorer Ord.io. On Wednesday, the specialized tracker tweeted that 1.365 BTC (worth approximately $97,662) was lost by users attempting to mint Rune 777, also known as LEEROY JENKINS.Runes is a fungible token protocol on the Bitcoin network that lets users “etch” and mint tokens on the world’s largest blockchain.“The way Runes minting works is there is a mint window in which all Runes minting transactions are valid,” pseudonymous Ord co-founder Leonidas explained to Decrypt—for example, from block 840,000 to block 841,000. “Towards the end of every Runes mint, people rush to get their mint transactions mined before the window closes.”In the above example, Leonidas explained, if a mint transaction was mined in block 841,001, the collector would have paid the network fees to no avail.“If you fail to get your transactions in there, you lose your BTC and don't receive Runes,” Leonidas said. “This is just how the protocol works.” Toward the end of popular mints, he added, demand for minting outpaces the supply of space in a blockchain block.According to the Ord website, LEEROY JENKINS has a max supply of 69.4 million and currently has 1,350 holders. Of 57,850 completed mints, 276 were labeled as invalid—and those disappointed minters have no recourse.“Bitcoin is not aware of the Runes protocol and does not have the capability to use logic the way a smart contract would to refund invalid mints,” he said. “To the Bitcoin network, a Runes mint is just a meaningless piece of data.”The name LEEROY JENKINS comes from the iconic World of Warcraft character of the same name. The infamous player, created by Ben Schulz, cost his dungeon party their treasure by recklessly charging into a battle, ignoring the plan of attack. Jenkins has since become an internet meme.Leonidas said that while Runes minting sites could attempt to help users avoid losing out, there may always be losers.“The minting platforms can only make a recommendation and educate about how minting on the Runes Protocol works—ultimately it is still very zero-sum, though, and somebody will be losing,” he said. “If one minting platform is very good at educating their users about setting fee rates extra high at the end of mints, those minters are still taking spots from somebody else who will then have an invalid mint.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum Price to Hit $22,000 by 2030, Predicts VanEck - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsGlobal asset manager VanEck predicted Wednesday that the price of Ethereum will reach $22,000 by the end of the decade, dubbing the cryptocurrency “digital oil” in a new report. That would represent a 468% increase from Ethereum’s current price.While Ethereum has generated $3.4 billion in revenue over the past year, VanEck additionally sees that figure reaching $51 billion by 2030.“We believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world,” the report asserted. “The Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech.”VanEck characterized Ethereum as the centerpiece of its own financial system, as its network already secures over $90 billion in stablecoins, around $7 billion in tokenized assets, and $308 billion in digital assets.At the same time, VanEck sees Ethereum making inroads outside of crypto. Based on the size of business sectors that Ethereum-built applications could disrupt, VanEck estimated that the network's total addressable market stands at $15 trillion. Those opportunities lie largely in finance, banking, and payments, VanEck said.Ethereum could also find roles in infrastructure and artificial intelligence, the firm added, as well as marketing, advertising, social, and gaming.The report highlighted some of Ethereum’s distinct aspects as a network and an asset, from its nature as “programmable money” to a “yield bearing commodity.” Notably, VanEck’s report calls Ethereum an “internet reserve currency,” central to its massive ecosystem and layer-2 networks.VanEck’s report comes not long after the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. Allowing mainstream investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency in a traditional brokerage account, the move also had implications for Ethereum’s regulatory status.For crypto natives, the concept may be basic, but its significance was underscored by VanEck: In order to send Ethereum or engage with smart contracts, a user needs to spend Ethereum on gas fees, which are then removed from circulation through burning. In essence, VanEck said that this dynamic benefits Ethereum holders two-fold: providing demand while reducing supply.The asset manager expects Ethereum will also chip away at established tech giants like Google and Apple as a platform for developers to create consumer-facing applications. While the firms take around 30% of revenue from apps hosted in their respective digital stores, VanEck said Ethereum currently takes around 24% of reventhrough gas fees.“Compared to data-centric social networking platforms like Facebook, we believe Ethereum may enable more capable and lucrative applications for entrepreneurs,” the report stated. “As more data is generated in public and more commerce is moved off expensive, closed financial rails, business moats will erode.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum Devs Shut Down Linea-Can Layer-2 Networks Be Trusted? - Decrypt

Late Saturday, an Ethereum layer-2 network called Linea found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place.Using an exploit, attackers had drained $2.3 million worth of ETH from a decentralized exchange that operates on Linea, called Velocore. Unable to reach the Velocore team, Linea’s leadership made the decisive call to freeze all transactions across the network in an effort to prevent further malfeasance. The plan worked: Linea users were insulated from additional losses. That’s when the trouble started. Crypto users immediately decried Linea’s actions across social media, arguing that the company had violated the industry’s core principle, decentralization. If a few people could halt Linea in their pajamas, then how could the network be considered any better than Wells Fargo?Linea immediately pivoted, posting on Twitter that the network was still in the “training wheels” phase of decentralization, but that it planned to eventually transition to a completely trustless structure. (Disclosure: Linea is owned by Consensys, which is one of 22 investors in Decrypt).   The incident laid bare a contradiction, some developers say, that doesn’t only pertain to just one blockchain. Rather, it exposed flaws in the entire, burgeoning layer-2 ecosystem—a collection of privately owned networks that has been frequently touted as Ethereum’s path forward.  “So you're saying you intervened on behalf of users here, but in the future, hopefully, if you work really hard, you won’t be able to intervene and your users will lose all their money?” Tom Lehman, the co-founder of several Ethereum projects including layer-1 alternative Facet and Ethscriptions, told Decrypt. “It doesn’t make sense.”To Lehman, the contradictions exposed by Linea’s public relations woes this week are not isolated—they are endemic to layer-2 networks. “Having a layer-2 that's centrally controlled is not a problem,” he said. “It’s just that every single one of them being centrally controlled is a problem.”Nearly all major scaling networks—like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and Polygon—were created by private, for-profit companies. Most rely on sequencers, controlled by the network’s team, which batch transactions together and submit them to the Ethereum mainnet. In such cases, like Linea’s, project teams have the power to effectively shut off a network by halting said sequencers. Why do most layer-2s exert such centralized control over their transactions? Linea, which did not respond to Decrypt’s questions by the time of publication, claimed in statements this week that the issue is a technical one that requires long-term finesse. But financial incentives may also be at play. By controlling that single choke point through which all transactions must pass, layer-2 teams also control the profits derived from processing every network transaction. Such fees are the lifeblood of layer-2s, which often employ dozens of people, and such Ethereum networks are collectively raking in millions of dollars in monthly, on-chain profit.“L2s can be very profitable to run,” Lehman said. “But that profit is tied to how much control you have.”Some layer-2 teams say they are ahead of the pack, and have taken distinct steps towards decentralization. Arbitrum, for example, features a backup pathway that allows users to post their transactions to Ethereum directly, in case any issues emerge within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Submitting transactions via this delayed inbox is not ideal, however, and can take up to 24 hours. Steven Goldfeder, the CEO of Arbitrum core developer Offchain Labs, told Decrypt that the company is currently working to decentralize its sequencer—but made a point of arguing that it poses less of a centralization threat than other layer-2s, given that the Arbitrum Foundation could not single-handedly prevent users from posting transactions.  “On Arbitrum, the problem is a lot smaller than on other networks,” said Goldfeder.Goldfeder welcomes vocal criticism of centralization risks in the layer-2 ecosystem. He believes such dissent applies crucial pressure to companies that otherwise might focus on different priorities.“Otherwise, you have the wrong incentives: growth first, and decentralization at some point,” he said. “If we just take one centralized system and replace it with another centralized system with a vague claim of eventually decentralizing—often without technical details—then I think it's very dangerous.”Some developers like Arjun Bhuptani, the founder of inter-blockchain bridge Everclear, however, feel that even Arbitrum’s solution to current centralization issues on layer-2s is insufficient.“It is better, but is still not ‘censorship resistance,’” he told Decrypt of Arbitrum. Further, Arbitrum itself has suffered network-wide outages repeatedly in the last year. To Bhuptani, the issue of centralization is so pervasive on layer-2s simply because the privately owned networks are currently facing other, greater concerns.“It largely just comes down to prioritization,” he said. “Projects are seeing bigger threats to their survival today on other axes than censorship, and so building decentralization is lower priority than things like security, custody risk, and market traction.”It’s true that the matter of censorship on layer-2 networks is still largely theoretical. The Linea team, for example, has never used its power to block transactions on behalf of a sovereign government. But such a scenario is by no means fanciful. The U.S. government has blacklisted Ethereum wallet addresses on multiple occasions. Centralized crypto exchanges have cooperated with the Israeli government to ban flagged accounts. Just last month, a Dutch court sentenced a developer of Tornado Cash, an Ethereum coin mixer designed to keep transactions private, to over five years in prison. Even those within the layer-2 ecosystem worry about what might happen if the private teams behind so many networks—which, thanks to their incredibly low transaction fees, have recently been positioned as the best way to securely onboard the masses to crypto—are legally compelled to do the bidding of governments across the world. “Something that I might think is legitimate,” Goldfeder said, “some oppressive regime somewhere might think is illegitimate behavior that should be censored.”Some Ethereum developers feel, however, that the whole debate this week about Linea and crypto’s future has been blown out of proportion.  “It's easy for people who were not affected by hacks to complain,” Joseph Schiarizzi, developer of Arbitrum-based stablecoin OpenDollar, told Decrypt. “But if you've ever been a victim, you understand the Linea team made the right move.”“I do not expect every piece of infrastructure to be decentralized,” he continued. “I care much more about honesty and transparency, which Linea was great on.”Lehman, who is currently developing a more decentralized alternative to networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, said he doesn’t want to demonize layer-2 networks or dismiss their usefulness. He only worries about crypto’s future if they become omnipresent.“The problem comes when you say ‘L2s are the future, that's how we scale, that's it,’” Lehman said. “And in the process, [you] hand over the keys to giant billion-dollar entities and endorse them running insecure systems.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin has finally broken through $70,000, setting itself up for further growth. As we can see, there is a good chance it will succeed at it, as the price is moving closer to $71,000 and trading volumes remain elevated.This bullish momentum is easily visible on the daily chart of Bitcoin versus the U.S. dollar (BTC/USD). Bitcoin is currently trading around $70,977 with the price action showing a steady climb. A major turning point was reached recently when the market broke above $70,000, indicating fresh interest and optimism. This optimistic view is supported by several important technical indicators. Bitcoin/USD Chart by TradingViewThe 50-day and 200-day moving averages in particular are positioned in a way that indicates sustained upward momentum. A traditional bullish signal known as a golden cross formed when the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average.Volume analysis supports this optimistic scenario even more. The recent price surge is accompanied by elevated trading volumes, indicating strong market participation and interest at these price points. Maintaining the present upward trend and possibly pushing Bitcoin above $71,000 require this volume support. Furthermore Bitcoin remains a favorable investment option given the current macroeconomic climate. Bitcoin's allure as a store of value and safeguard against the devaluation of fiat currencies is still great in light of persistent worries about economic stability.Ethereum's weird positionThe surge toward $3,800 was not expected by the market, yet we are here. However, Ethereum's activity raises a lot of questions as the asset's price is going through an extremely prolonged consolidation phase, and it is unclear whether or not it will come out as a winner from it.After the steep increase to $3,800, the price of Ethereum has been trapped in a narrow range, as can be seen by looking at the daily chart of ETH against the USD. When buyers and sellers are evenly matched, the market is usually in a state of indecision, as indicated by this sideways movement. Ethereum has tested $3,750 several times without breaking below what appears to be the key support level. A number of technical indicators shed light on Ethereum's present situation. A golden cross, or the potential continuation of a bullish trend, could be indicated if the 50-day moving average, which is approaching the 200-day moving average, crosses above it. However, the market continues to be cautious until such a crossover occurs. Further more, the fact that trading volumes have been comparatively low during this phase of consolidation suggests that a sizable portion of market participants are holding off until a more distinct trend becomes apparent. Solana's market positionSolana's path on the market was tough in the last few weeks, but things are changing rapidly, with Bitcoin bouncing toward $70,000 and investors gaining some of that positive sentiment back. However, fundamentally, Solana might not be doing as well as it used to.Solana shows a gradual but consistent recovery. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are supporting the modest uptrend that Solana is currently showing at about $172. 92.  Though technical indicators point to a bright future, the larger ecosystem surrounding Solana paints a different picture. The Solana meme coin scene used to be a hive of activity and creativity, but it is not as active as recently.There has not been much buying interest in Solana, as seen by the low trading volume. This is concerning because price movements need to be supported and maintained by sustained volume, which is probably the biggest issue for it right now.

Nvidia Flips Apple As Stock Hits $3 Trillion Market Cap Amid AI Boom - Decrypt

The stock price of AI and gaming chip manufacturer Nvidia (NVDA) surged past $1,235 on Wednesday, up 14.2% for the day, bringing the company's market capitalization to $3.01 trillion, according to Yahoo! Finance. If the trend holds, Nvidia will be the second most valuable publicly traded company, leapfrogging iPhone maker Apple (AAPL).Nvidia—which has seen its stock skyrocket more than 150% so far this year—began the week trading at $1,125 on Monday before rising 9.78% on Wednesday. Apple is trading at $195.87, up 0.78% for the day.The only other company in the $3 trillion club is Microsoft (MSFT), which has long held the top spot at $3.15 trillion and is trading at $424.01.By comparison, the entire cryptocurrency marketplace has a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, according to CoinGecko.The Decrypt Emerge 2023 company of the year, Nvidia has charged headlong into artificial intelligence, including hardware, software, and robotics.In February, the market cap of the global chipmaker flipped cloud computing and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) when Nvidia hit $1.78 trillion, compared to Amazon’s $1.75 trillion at the time. Later that month, Nvidia reported $22.1 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2024.“Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said at the time. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.”In March, Nvidia unveiled their new Blackwell AI GPU, as well as Project Gr00t—aimed at advancing humanoid robotics and AI—and a limited integration with Apple's Vision Pro.Reaction to the news of Nvidia’s new $3 trillion market cap was swift, with many—like Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunasa—putting the giant numbers into perspective.Others noted that Nvidia's success was remarkable, because it primarily provides products and services to other companies rather than directly to consumers.Among Nvidia's more prominent investors is U.S Rep. and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, whose investment in Nvidia has so far netted her $4 million, according to Unusual Whales.“[Pelosi] is up over 210% in 197 days and [has] still not sold her calls,” Unusual Whales wrote. “Pelosi has made twenty times her salary. Her portfolio is near all-time highs, up 93%.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Analyst Says Blue-Chip Altcoin Could Hit New All-Time Highs Shortly, Updates Outlook on Three Additional Coins - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst believes one top-10 altcoin by market capitalization could soon hit new all-time highs (ATHs).
Pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,700 followers on the social media platform X that BNB, the native token of the BNB Chain, continues to have a strong market structure.










“BNB: slow and steady wins the race. This thing goes to ATH shortly. Wish I still had a bag of it, sold it during the bear market. Hard times then.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Looking at his daily chart, the trader suggests that BNB is about to flip the upper bound of a trading range at $621.50 into support and continue higher.
BNB is trading for $669 at time of writing, up more than 7% in the last 24 hours. BNB reached an ATH of $686 on May 10th, 2021.
Next up, the trader is long-term bullish on Bittensor (TAO), a decentralized blockchain platform that focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI).
However, he warns TAO needs to hold the key level of $350 as support or it could collapse in value.
“TAO: I would like to see this continue chopping around $350-$500 for a bit to form a solid bottom. This is likely to take weeks and this is the time period to scale in. Obviously if $350 gets lost, this thing is going to sub-$300 quickly.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
TAO is trading for $392 at time of writing, up nearly 4% in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the trader says My Neighbor Alice (ALICE), a non-fungible token (NFT) play-to-earn video game, could revisit lower Fibonacci levels before bouncing.
“ALICE: if scalping, I think taking a quick trade at .382 and .50 are decent setups. $2.13 and $2.03 are reasonable areas to bid in the short term and should provide a bounce.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
ALICE is trading for $2.15 at time of writing, down more than 10% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the trader says that NOT, a community token for the popular Telegram-based tap-to-earn mining game Notcoin, may have formed a market bottom after bouncing from $0.0199.
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
NOT is trading for $0.0240 at time of writing, up 8% in the last 24 hours.

Shiba Inu Investors Beware: Lead Dev Sounds Critical Warning On Dangerous Scam | Bitcoinist.com


								A lead developer of the doggy-themed meme coin, Shiba Inu has issued a critical warning to SHIB community members about an ongoing scam attack involving one of SHIB’s native tokens, TREAT. 
Scam Attackers Launch Fake TREAT Token
On June 2, a Shiba Inu member identified as ‘Digarch’ shared a screenshot of a scam alert issued by Shiba Inu’s lead developer, DaVinci, on X (formerly Twitter). Alongside this alert, Digarch released a stern warning, urging the SHIB Army to exercise extreme caution during this volatile period.

The screenshot released by Digarch originated from SHIB’S official discord account, a platform regularly used for updates and daily discussions about the Shiba Inu ecosystem. In his message to the Shiba Inu community, DaVinci raised serious concerns about the listing and distribution of fraudulent tokens falsely claiming association with the SHIB ecosystem, its developers, and the Shibarium project. 
DaVinci’s statement revealed that “deceitful individuals” have launched a fake TREAT token, under the guise of being directly involved with the SHIB ecosystem. These fake tokens are currently listed on popular crypto platforms such asCoinMarketCap and crypto exchanges like CoinGecko. 
Informing community members of these malicious activities, the Shiba Inu developer has advised SHIB members to practice caution and conduct thorough research before investing or engaging in any tokens. He disclosed that the malicious actors have changed their scam tactics, initially misusing Ryoshi Research mediums, but now illicitly exploiting Shiba Inu State and Canine code.  
Disturbingly, these scam attackers have also integrated the official SHIBwebsite address, shib.io, into their promotional scam videos to bolster the credibility of their false claims and illegal schemes.
DaVinci has explicitly clarified that the SHIB native token, TREAT, has not yet been launched. Therefore, any tokens claiming to be Treat or associated with Treat are fraudulent and intended to fleece and deceive SHIBcommunity members. Engaging with these fraudulent tokens could result in severe financial consequences, as they are not affiliated with the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and have any intrinsic value or strong community backing it.  
The Shiba Inu developer has acknowledged that due to ShibaSwap’s decentralized nature, bans on the fake TREAT token cannot be enforced. However, to protect the SHIB community members, the team will persist in unequivocally expressing their disapproval of these malicious individuals and their unsavory scam practices.
About tHE Shiba Inu Real TREAT Token
The real Shiba Inu TREAT token is part of the ecosystem’s utility tokens, SHIB, LEASH, SHI, and BONE. While each token has a distinct function within the Shiba Inu ecosystem and Shibarium network, TREAT was specifically designed to enhance liquidity for the SHI stablecoin and serve as a reward token like BONE for the crypto exchange ShibaSwap. 

According to official reports from SHIB’s lead marketing member, Lucie, the TREAT token is still in the development phase and has not been released. Despite rumors suggesting that the SHIB token was launched in 2023, Lucie has debunked these claims in a previous X post, clarifying that TREAT has not been introduced yet.
“TreatsforShib, aka $TREAT from SHIB.IO, has NOT been released yet. I’ve noticed some confused journalists posting that it was released in 2023. NO, IT WASN’T,” Lucie stated. 
The Shiba Inu marketing lead has also urged community members to stay alert and always verify information from SHIB’s official website or its account on Discord.

Is $100K Bitcoin Inevitable? This Expert Say 'Yes'-Find Out When


																As Bitcoin teeters close to its previous peak, discussions about its next big price targets have reignited. Among the voices contributing to this conversation is Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and a prominent Bitcoin advocate.
Recently, on X (formerly Twitter), Mow expressed his belief in Bitcoin’s imminent rise to $100,000, a milestone he sees as a stepping stone toward an eventual value of $1 million. His forecast is based on events triggered by breaking past the all-time high of $73,750 in March.

	Related Reading


Critical Factors To Drive Bitcoin Price To $100k Target
Mow outlines a cause-and-effect scenario that could catapult Bitcoin to these new heights.
First, surpassing the previous all-time high would initiate a “recursive Bitcoin demand shock,” as increased demand and limited supply drive prices upward rapidly. According to Mow, this chain reaction could swiftly elevate Bitcoin to the $100,000 mark.

His confidence is mirrored in the recent market behavior. Despite a minor pullback from its 24-hour peak of $71,312, Bitcoin has maintained an upward trajectory, gaining 1.7% in the past 24 hours and nearly 5% over the past week.

Supporting Mow’s optimistic outlook, Chris Vermeulen, Chief Market Strategist of The Technical Traders.com, shares a technical perspective that aligns with Mow’s predictions.
In a detailed analysis, Vermeulen pointed out a cup and handle formation on the chart, a bullish signal suggesting significant potential for an upward breakout. He uses Fibonacci extensions to project that Bitcoin could soon reach targets of $80,000 to $90,000, possibly climbing as high as $106,000.
Market Dynamics And Long-Term Prospects
Both experts view the current market dynamics as a prelude to more substantial gains. Vermeulen’s analysis not only supports Mow’s prediction but extends it by suggesting that Bitcoin could encounter resistance around $100,000, a psychological barrier likely to prompt significant market reactions.
Beyond this point, a consolidation phase might occur, but the long-term trajectory remains overwhelmingly positive. The broader financial context also plays a critical role in these forecasts.

With growing concerns about the stability of traditional assets like the dollar and the stock market, investors are increasingly turning to alternatives like BTC and gold. This shift indicates a deeper financial narrative where Bitcoin is not just seen as a speculative asset but as a viable hedge against economic uncertainty.

VanEck predicts Ethereum will hit $22,000 per token by 2030

VanEck believes Ethereum (ETH) will be worth roughly $22,000 by 2030, the asset manager said in a comprehensive analysis published on June 5.The forecast, developed by the firm’s Digital Assets Research team, led by Matthew Sigel, highlights Ethereum’s strong growth potential within both traditional and cryptocurrency-focused portfolios.VanEck’s analysis attributes the optimistic price target to Ethereum’s expanding role as a high-growth, internet-native commercial system that could disrupt traditional financial sectors and Big Tech platforms.The report emphasized Ethereum’s significant user base and economic activity, noting that the network currently supports approximately 20 million monthly active users, facilitates $4 trillion in annual settlement value, and oversees $308 billion in digital assets.$2 trillion market capVanEck’s valuation model for ETH is based on a forecast of $66 billion in free cash flows — the amount of money generated by a blockchain network — by 2030, with a 33x valuation multiple on those cash flows.The model considers Ethereum’s potential to disrupt various business sectors, including finance, marketing, infrastructure, and artificial intelligence (AI).According to the report, the Ethereum network is poised to capture substantial market share from traditional financial markets and technology giants.If Ethereum maintains its dominance among smart contract platforms, VanEck sees a credible path to generating $66 billion in free cash flow — the amount of money generated by a blockchain network — for token holders — supporting a $2.2 trillion market capitalization and a $22,000 price per ETH by 2030.Revolutionary assetThe company emphasized ETH’s broad use cases, stating:“We believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world.”VanEck cited ETH’s role as “digital oil” consumed in on-chain use and called it “programmable money and a yield-bearing commodity.”It also referred to ETH as an internet reserve currency that prices activity and assets in Ethereum’s $1 billion ecosystem and connecting blockchains.According to the report, Ethereum generated $3.4 billion in revenue over the past year, surpassing some web2 apps like Etsy, Twitch, and Roblox. Meanwhile, its 20 million monthly active users surpass Instacart, Robinhood, and Vrbo.VanEck added that ETH offers cost-saving features, better interconnectivity for social applications, the opportunity to share earnings with end users, and a basis for AI applications.Investment risksWhile the report is optimistic about Ethereum’s future, it also emphasizes several risks associated with investing in ETH.One major concern is Ethereum’s reliance on speculative activities, which could lead to significant downside risk if market sentiment shifts.Regulatory changes pose another risk, as they could classify ETH as a security, thereby imposing stringent legal requirements on Ethereum-based businesses. The competitive landscape is also a threat, with emerging technologies like Solana challenging its market dominance.Additionally, government actions to control non-sovereign financial systems could negatively impact Ethereum’s growth prospects.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Bitcoin DeFi security concerns still lurk, says Fireblocks executive - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            A Bitcoin (BTC) decentralized ecosystem has been in rapid development in 2024, with its total value locked (TVL) jumping 263% so far and surpassing $1 billion, according to data aggregator DefiLlama. Nevertheless, as a nascent sector where builders try to create applications compatible with other blockchains, new security issues might surface while it grows. Shahar Madar, VP of Security and Trust at Fireblocks, shared with Crypto Briefing his insights on Bitcoin decentralized application risks and how mature the security of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is.Crypto Briefing – Did you find any issues with the different applications built on top of Bitcoin that raised your concern?Shahar Madar – I would say this is very early on. Although I think there are many conversations about Bitcoin DeFi, I’m not sure we are at the stage where it’s as adopted as it could be. Bitcoin is definitely a staple of the blockchain industry and the blockchain ecosystem. We see Wrapped Bitcoin as one of the important tokens, and our customers use it a lot.On DeFi over Bitcoin, personally, I feel it’s too early to tell. Usually, the way you see this kind of thing is that you iterate pretty quickly with different implementations. We’ve seen this. We see this even with account abstraction. We see this with some technologies that have been spoken about for a very long time. So because this place is very innovation-driven, there’s going to be usually many iterations. I don’t know if that’s specific to Bitcoin DeFi, but usually, this kind of thing evolves over time. We only find the core issues or points of pain when people start using it.Crypto Briefing – Recent studies show that private key compromises are the most recurring and damaging attack vectors in the crypto industry. Do you think it will become an even bigger threat?Shahar Madar – So since day one, one of the core values that Fireblocks offered for institutions and honestly any organization, any business, is the ability to securely manage their operations, and their keys, and onboard safely and securely to blockchains on one side. So this part of private key compromise that many people are experiencing, I feel is strongly mitigated by the fact of how we generate keys, and how we store the keys for our customers. The way our self-cultivated platform works is that we leverage MPC and essentially break down the private key into three different parts, each of them being held at a different security safe, so it’s impossible to take out. I also want to add other significant threats we see today. One of them is the extension of the first one we’re talking about, which is securing custody of keys. And that is the orchestration and management of smart contracts. We are at a point where people trick with social engineering and scam out of private keys from contract managers, owners, and admins. When this security process is done with our tokenization platform on top of Fireblocks, you obviously are in much better shape, because you know everything goes through our security user management, and secure policy engine, which dictates the authorization flow. If there’s a sensitive operation related to the smart contract you manage, and I’m saying as a DeFi protocol owner, as a token manager, and as a stablecoin issuer, you can do this as well through the Fireblocks platform. I feel this mitigates a lot of this risk for private key compromises.Another attack vector is rogue employees, insiders either being rogue going against you or being hacked and attackers leveraging their access and privilege against you. This is the extension of the private key management.We’ve also extended our DeFi security offering, and this is more meant for people who are doing on-chain trading and on-chain operations. Essentially, it extends what we offer to them the ability to authorize sensitive operations with smart contracts and dApps. We’ve extended this because one threat that we’re seeing is phishing dApps, scams that impersonate legitimate decentralized applications, or just plain malicious smart contracts, which are altogether targeting traders.We’ve launched this new suite of features, essentially scanning every dApp connection you make through the Fireblocks platform, scanning every interaction you have with a smart contract, and simulating every control call that you have, so you can get a sense of what is the expected outcome. You can get more comfortable and you know what’s going to happen once you approve it. And we’ve integrated that into the entire operation flow that we know institutions that use Fireblocks go through. Crypto Briefing – Do you believe the new institutions entering the crypto market now are aware of how to make proper custody? Do they prefer to have their own custody team, or are they keen to work with companies such as Fireblocks?Shahar Madar – Absolutely. These institutions understand, they go into a space after a thorough examination and due diligence. They know there’s an opportunity for them, but they also are very educated about cybersecurity in general. A lot of them, when they come to us, they also want to learn.So they’re looking to partner with someone who’s an expert in this field. They always have a security team, but always, nine out of 10 times, they understand it’s better to partner and leverage existing technology than to build their own. Most people don’t grow their own tomatoes, they don’t need to invent the wheel. If there’s a great battle-tested technology and Fireblocks is definitely one, you should use it and be on top of it. We do invest a lot and we work very closely with our big enterprise institutions that either examine the market or go all in and use Fireblocks. We help them with education, we help them to understand the best practices we use in Fireblocks and their entire business around that. Finally, we also listen to them. It’s part of the reason why we offer many customizations and many different deployment models because we understand that what’s fitting for a very small business, a very small startup consisting of three guys and a dog, is not the same thing that suits a big institution.Crypto Briefing – From the previous bull cycle to this one, which is just starting, do you see any significant developments in crypto security?Shahar Madar – It’s a cat-and-mouse game with attackers. We are, as Fireblocks and as the industry as a whole, pushing forward for wider adoption, for better security standards. And we’ve gone a very long way since inception. And attackers are always trying to get at us, right? They always try to push forward. They try to find new ways to get in and it’s our job as people who work in a block of security ecosystem to keep chasing them, to keep blocking them, research, and investigate what they do. I think we are doing overall as an industry better than we were two, three, four, five years ago. But also, on the other hand, we’re seeing the exploiters changing, evolving, and trying to get ahead of the latest protections and defenses that people put out. It’s a never-ending game. You have to keep researching, tracking, and improving. And to a point about the role of blocking security firms in the space, I think it’s a big part of that. You need to keep and stay on top of the latest threats. And if you’re not, and if you’re just using the same technology you built half a decade ago, you’re not going to keep people secure.

Former OpenAI Safety Researcher Says ‘Security Was Not Prioritized’ - Decrypt

Former OpenAI safety researcher Leopold Aschenbrenner says that security practices at the company were "egregiously insufficient." In a video interview with Dwarkesh Patel posted Tuesday, Aschenbrenner spoke of internal conflicts over priorities, suggesting a shift in focus towards rapid growth and deployment of AI models at the expense of safety.He also said he was fired for putting his concerns in writing.In a wide-ranging, four-hour conversation, Aschenbrenner told Patel that he penned an internal memo last year detailing his concerns and circulated it among reputable experts from outside the company. However, after a major security incident occurred weeks later, he said he decided to share an updated memo with a couple of board members. He was quickly released from OpenAI."What might also be helpful context is the kinds of questions they asked me when they fired me... the questions were about my views on AI progress, on AGI, the appropriate level of security for AGI, whether the government should be involved in AGI, whether I and the superalignment team were loyal to the company, and what I was up to during the OpenAI board events," Aschenbrenner said.AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is when AI meets or exceeds human intelligence across any field, regardless of how it was trained.Loyalty to the company—or to Sam Altman—emerged as a key factor after his brief ouster: over 90% of employees signed a letter threatening to quit in solidarity with him. They also popularized the slogan, “OpenAI is nothing without its people.”“I didn’t sign the employee letter during the board events, despite pressure to do so,” Aschenbrenner recalled.The superalignment team—led by Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike—was in charge of building long-term safety practices to make sure AI remains aligned with human expectations.The departure of prominent members of that team, including Sutskever and Leike, brought added scrutiny. The whole team was subsequently dissolved, and a new safety team was announced… led by CEO Sam Altman, who is also a member of the OpenAI board to which it reports.Aschenbrenner said OpenAI's actions contradict its public statements about safety."Another example is when I raised security issues—they would tell me security is our number one priority,” he stated. “Invariably, when it came time to invest serious resources or make trade-offs to take basic measures, security was not prioritized.”This is in line with statements from Leike, who said the team was “sailing against the wind” and that “safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products” under Altman’s leadership.Aschenbrenner also expressed concerns about AGI development, stressing the importance of a cautious approach—particularly as many fear China is pushing hard to surpass the United States in AGI research.China "is going to have an all-out effort to infiltrate American AI labs, billions of dollars, thousands of people... [they're] going to try and outbuild us,” he said. "What will be at stake will not just be cool products, but whether liberal democracy survives.”Just a few weeks ago, it was revealed that OpenAI required its employees to sign abusive non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that prevented them from speaking out about the company’s safety practices.Aschenbrenner said he didn’t sign such an NDA, but said that he was offered around $1M in equity.In response to these growing concerns, a collective of nearly a dozen current and former OpenAI employees have meanwhile signed an open letter demanding the right to call out company misdeeds without fear of retaliation.The letter—endorsed by industry figures like Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Stuart Russell—emphasizes the need for AI companies to commit to transparency and accountability.“So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public—yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues,” the letter reads. “Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated.“Some of us reasonably fear various forms of retaliation, given the history of such cases across the industry,” it continues. “We are not the first to encounter or speak about these issues.”After news of the restrictive employment clauses spread, Sam Altman claimed he was unaware of the situation and assured the public his legal team was working to fix the issue.“There was a provision about potential equity cancellation in our previous exit docs; although we never clawed anything back, it should never have been something we had in any documents or communication,” he tweeted. “This is on me and one of the few times I've been genuinely embarrassed running OpenAI; I did not know this was happening and I should have.”OpenAI says it has since released all employees from the contentious non-disparagement agreements and removed the clause from its departure paperwork.OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Spanish Court Grants Bail To 'Bitcoin Jesus' Roger Ver Amid Extradition Requests | Bitcoinist.com


								In a significant legal development, Roger Ver, an early investor in Bitcoin, who has been indicted by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on multiple charges, including mail fraud and tax evasion, has been released on bail by a Spanish court amid extradition requests from US authorities. 
 Tax Evasion In Connection With Bitcoin Fortune
According to a Bloomberg report, Ver’s arrest in late April in Spain led to his release on May 17, after posting €150,000 ($163,000) in bail. However, he was required to surrender his passport, remain in Spain, and appear in court every two days. The prosecutor’s subsequent appeal against Ver’s release was rejected two weeks later.

The US DOJ indictment notes that Roger Ver, who earned the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus” for his early advocacy of Bitcoin, is accused of acquiring Bitcoin for himself and his companies as early as 2011, amassing a substantial fortune in the cryptocurrency. 
Ver allegedly failed to report capital gains or pay taxes on his Bitcoin holdings despite selling Bitcoins for approximately €240 million in 2017. The indictment alleges Ver concealed these transactions from his accountant, evading tax obligations.
To complicate matters, Roger Ver renounced his US citizenship in 2014 through eviction, becoming a St. Kitts and Nevis citizen. However, US law still required him to disclose and pay taxes on capital gains from his global assets, including his Bitcoin holdings. 
The indictment also claims that Ver provided false or misleading information to his legal representatives and appraisers, understating the value of his companies and Bitcoin holdings. This resulted in the filing of “false tax returns” that significantly undervalued his assets and evaded substantial tax obligations.
US Authorities Pursue Roger Ver’s Extradition
According to the report, US authorities are actively seeking Ver’s extradition to face tax fraud charges. The Justice Department alleges that Ver failed to pay at least $48 million in taxes from his Bitcoin transactions and that his assets were consequently undervalued. 
Roger Ver’s legal counsel, Jaime Campaner, has stated that Ver has been in contact with US authorities through his Californian lawyers, emphasizing that his arrest seemed unnecessary given his cooperation.

The case against Ver underscores the increasing scrutiny and regulatory measures applied to the cryptocurrency industry. 
As digital currencies grow in prominence and value, governments worldwide are stepping up enforcement actions against platforms and key individuals to ensure compliance with tax and financial regulations.

This iPhone Challenger Could Transform Smartphones by Trading Apps for AI - Decrypt

London-based electronics maker Nothing wants to revolutionize smartphones, ditching conventional apps in favor of a fully AI-managed interface."The way we use our smartphones needs to be redefined,” Nothing CEO Carl Pei declared on Twitter. “The current user experience hasn't evolved for more than a decade… the next era needs a highly personalized, dynamic, and cross-device interface.”Pei is betting on AI as the best way to get there, which he said will bring smartphone user interfaces that are completely different from the ones we know today. He shared a preview of what the next Nothing smartphone might look like, straying far from the typical grid of apps and widgets.“We have been exploring ways of deeply integrating AI into the operative system,” said Walid, a designer at Nothing featured in a video shared by Pei. “We tried to reimagine the home screen—we wanted to move away from it just being a launcher into becoming more of a hub of contextual, relevant information.”In “tomorrow's post-app world,” Nothing proposes that users will simply interact with AI, asking it to do everything. The AI assistant would then coordinate any required applications in the background to complete requests without requiring any further interaction from the user.Nothing’s idea, he said, is to provide every user with a “highly personalized companion that feels almost like a best friend.”Walid demonstrated the AI assistant setup, where the system asked for personality traits he valued in a companion. After saying he liked people who are fun, thoughtful, and have a good sense of humor, the assistant introduced itself as Oliver.“We’ve all been playing internally with this prototype for the past week or so,” he reported. “We all managed to get different companions that seem uniquely tailored to each one of us.”Pei asserted that his company is ready to compete in the red-hot AI space."Over the last 3.5 years, we’ve been busy establishing our end to end capabilities... and as we reach stability and with solid growth plans, we’re ready to shift gears,“ he said. “See this as us throwing our hat into the consumer AI race."Nothing’s companion seemed quite similar to ChatGPT's voice chatbot —at least per the preview: A flat circle in a black background with a pleasant, human-like voice. However, Nothing didn’t reveal whether this assistant will run locally or in the cloud. Given the computing power required to run similar AI tools, however, it is likely to be a cloud-dependent feature.Image: Carl Pei/TwitterPei started Nothing in 2021 after leaving Chinese electronics manufacturer OnePlus, which had entered the smartphone market in 2014 with the $300 OnePlus One. The first phone from Nothing was released in 2022, priced under $500 and running a customized version of Google’s Android operating system.The Nothing Phone (2) moved solidly toward the high-end of the smartphone market, gunning for Apple, Google and Samsung with a $600 flagship device that earned rave reviews. Last month, a more modestly configured Nothing Phone (2a) went on sale for $350.It’s unclear whether the re-imagined interface Pei shared today will be part of the yet unannounced Nothing Phone (3), but he did say it would be released in 2025.Image: Carl Pei/TwitterPei didn’t share any additional details about the upcoming device, so its design, specs, and features remain unknown. Hardware enthusiast sites and forums predict that it may adopt an upgraded Snapdragon 8 processor, along with upgrades to its camera module and a bigger battery. But the key to Pei’s pitch is the overhauled user interface."We've come a long way, being the only company that built a smartphone business in the last 10 years,” he said. “We've also developed a creative culture in the company that emphasizes great UX and thoughtful integration between software and hardware."Meanwhile, other smartphone companies are already incorporating AI features into their devices. The Google Pixel lineup—with new Google Tensor chips—is incorporating on-device Large Language Models (LLM), while the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, with its Galaxy AI, is offering features like Live Translate and Circle to Search.Smartphones featuring the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, like the Xiaomi 14 and new Motorola models, also offer AI-powered features.Ultimately, the best way to carry AI with you might very well be the ubiquitous smartphone rather than a specialized device. The Humane AI pin was criticized for its lack of practicality, huge latency, and low accuracy. The better-received Rabbit R1 has turned out to be mostly powered by an app that runs scripts in the cloud. And the promised Limitless AI pendant has yet to prove its value.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Crypto Investors Rejoice: Turkey Declares No Taxes On Digital Gains


								In a notable announcement, Turkey’s Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has clarified that the government does not plan to impose taxes on profits derived from “stocks and cryptocurrencies.”
This decision reflects a broader strategy to “foster” investment and growth in financial markets in the region without the burden of direct taxation on gains.
Tax Strategies And Crypto Regulatory Innovations In Turkey’s Financial Markets
While Turkey has disclosed its no tax plan for digital gains, the government is reported to be still exploring the implementation of a “very limited” transaction tax on these assets, the specifics of which have yet to be detailed.
This approach aligns with Minister Simsek’s philosophy of ensuring comprehensive taxation to promote “justice and efficiency.” However, concerns have been raised about the potential impact of even a minimal tax on market dynamics.
Although limited, Mehmet Gerz, CEO of Ata Portfoy, argues that any tax on stock transactions could inadvertently introduce “inefficiencies, raise commission costs, and ultimately deter trading activities.”
This perspective highlights the delicate balance policymakers must navigate to enhance revenue without stifling economic activity.
The decision to keep stock and cryptocurrency profits untaxed comes as Turkey nears the completion of its regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This framework is a pivotal development for the country’s financial technology landscape.
Minister Simsek has indicated that these regulations are primarily aimed at enhancing the security of crypto trading and aligning with international standards to address money laundering and terrorism financing—key factors for Turkey’s objective to be removed from the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) grey list.
The new regulations will introduce a licensing system for crypto trading platforms overseen by Turkey’s Capital Markets Board (CMB). This system will set minimum operating standards, including qualifications for founders and managers and organizational and capital requirements.
These measures are expected to provide a “safer and more structured” market environment, contributing positively to the sector’s “stability and growth.”
Industry Reaction And Future Prospects
The industry’s response has been cautiously optimistic. Mucahit Donmez, CEO of Binance Turkey, recently expressed support for the regulatory directions, particularly the emphasis on security, capital adequacy, and operational standards for crypto platforms.
According to Donmez, these regulations will significantly benefit the sector by ensuring “better protection” for users’ assets and establishing clear operational criteria.
As Turkey moves forward with these regulations, the region has the potential to become a significant hub for digital finance growth.
Regulatory clarity and the absence of profit taxes could attract more investors and companies to the Turkish markets, contributing to the country’s economic resilience and technological advancement.
With these strategic moves, Turkey is positioning itself as a leading player in the global digital economy. It aims to leverage its geographic and economic position to bridge various financial ecosystems across Europe and Asia.

Crypto Analyst Predicts $1,000 for BNB After Price Surges Past $700 | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the native token of the BNB Chain, $BNB, has recently seen its price soar to surpass the $700 mark for the first time ever, rising over 7% in a day amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally. A popular crypto analyst has now suggested BNB could top $1,000.



BNB is at the time of writing trading at $697 after enduring a slight correction from a new all-time high above the $712 mark, and popular cryptocurrency analyst Sheldon The Sniper has said that BNB’s price chart is “looking extremely bullish,” and pointed to $1,000 as its next price target.







Another popular cryptocurrency analyst, Kaleo, has said that while the market is paying attention to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, Binance’s BNB is “entering price discovery,” and pointed out the cryptocurrency “was an early leader of the last bull market as well.”



Per his words, history “doesn’t always repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” BNB’s price rally comes shortly after Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance – which is itself behind BNB – started serving a four-month prison sentence in California after pleading guilty in November to violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to implement adequate safeguards against money laundering at Binance.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Ted Zhang, an associate portfolio manager at Revere Asset Management, also pointed to BNB’s chart on social media and said that it “doesn’t get better than this,” and added “these are the setups that you want to find yourself in. They are SCREAMING at you and JUMPING off the page.”

BNB’s upward movement also comes shortly after the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced its “largest ever rewards pool” in the Binance World Championship, an event in which its users will be competing in skills-based tournaments.

VanEck Forecasts Ethereum to Hit $22,000 to $154,000 by 2030


VanEck, a leading asset manager, has boldly predicted that Ethereum (ETH) will reach $22,000 per coin by 2030. This projection stems from the anticipated approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
According to the firm, such approval would enable financial advisors and institutional investors to hold Ethereum securely and benefit from improved pricing and liquidity. This potential market development shows cryptocurrencies’ growing acceptance and integration into traditional financial systems.
Ethereum’s Growth and Value Proposition According to VanEck

VanEck has updated its financial model to evaluate ETH’s investment case. It highlights Ethereum’s impressive value proposition. The model points to significant contributions from various sectors, including finance, banking, payments, marketing, advertising, social gaming, infrastructure, and artificial intelligence.
Ethereum’s open-source nature fosters innovation and connectivity among applications, offering unique value propositions not found in traditional platforms. This advantage positions Ethereum as a disruptive force capable of attracting substantial market share from established financial and tech giants.

“Should [Ethereum] do so while maintaining its dominant position among smart contract platforms, we see a credible path to $66 billion in free cash flow to token holders supporting a $2.2 trillion asset by 2030,” VanEck wrote.


Moreover, VanEck sees ETH offering investors exposure to a high-growth, internet-native commercial system. The firm analyzed key Ethereum metrics, including 20 million monthly active users and $4 trillion in transactions. Over the past year, Ethereum also facilitated $5.5 trillion in stablecoin transfers.

“The centerpiece asset of this financial system is the ETH token, and in our updated base case, we believe it to be worth $22,000 by 2030, representing a total return of 487% from today’s ETH price, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.8%,” the firm stated.

The $22,000 price prediction is based on the base case. VanEck’s analysts estimate that Ethereum could reach $154,000 in a bull case and $360 in a bear case.

However, ETH’s valuation remains susceptible to several risks. These include speculation, regulatory changes, interest rate fluctuations, competition from other blockchain platforms, and geopolitical factors.
Indeed, the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETF has sparked fresh interest in the crypto market. In late May, the British banking giant Standard Chartered made a bullish prediction on Ethereum’s future price.

Geoff Kendrick, Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, predicted that ETH could reach $8,000 by the end of 2024. Assuming the bank’s estimated Bitcoin (BTC) price level of $200,000 by the end of 2025, this could imply an Ethereum price of $14,000 by then. Kendrick also predicted that spot ETFs could attract an influx of 2.39 – 9.15 million ETH in the first 12 months following approval.

“In US dollar terms, that equates to roughly $15 billion to $45 billion,” he said.

Bloomberg’s analysts anticipate that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve spot Ethereum ETFs between the end of June and early July.

Bitcoin Surges Past $71,000, But TD Sequential Says 'Sell'


																The Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has given a sell signal for Bitcoin after the asset broke past the $71,000 level in the past day.
Bitcoin TD Sequential Is Giving A Sell Signal Right Now
As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, a TD Sequential signal has appeared in the 1-hour price of Bitcoin. The “TD Sequential” refers to an indicator in technical analysis (TA) that’s generally used for locating probable points of reversal in any commodity’s price.
The TD Sequential involves two phases: setup and countdown. During the first of these, candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) are counted to nine. After these nine candles are in, the asset may be assumed to have encountered a turnaround.

	Related Reading


Naturally, if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were red, the TD Sequential would give a buy signal for the asset. On the other hand, green candles would imply a potential reversal towards the downside.
After the setup is over, the countdown phase begins. This second phase of the indicator is much like the first one, except for the fact that the number of candles to be counted here is thirteen rather than nine. The countdown’s completion implies that the price has encountered another likely point of reversal.
A TD Sequential phase of the former type has recently been completed in the 1-hour price of Bitcoin. Below is the chart shared by Ali that shows this pattern in cryptocurrency.

From the graph, it’s visible that TD Sequential has recently finished its setup phase with green candles for Bitcoin. This signal comes as the coin has surged beyond the $71,000 level for the first time since mid-May.
This TD setup would mean that the party could already be over for now as the coin may have reached a local top, and a reversal to the down direction could be coming.
While the TD Sequential could spell a worry for BTC in the short-term, another TA indicator could point towards a bullish outcome for the asset instead. As CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has pointed out in an X post,  the Bitcoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at a level where recent uptrends have begun.

Usually, the price is considered to be undervalued when this metric drops below 30%. Strangely, the last three major uptrends in BTC began when the RSI had a value of 56%. This could be a coincidence, but BTC could see a sharp surge soon if it’s truly a pattern.

Binance Counters $13 Billion Lawsuit: Pursues Size Reduction In UK Legal Showdown | Bitcoinist.com


								In a recent development, cryptocurrency exchange Binance has moved to dismiss the majority of a £10 billion ($12.8 billion) lawsuit filed in London, as reported by Reuters. 
The lawsuit, being heard at the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), accuses Binance and other exchanges of conspiring to “delist” the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) cryptocurrency.
BSV Delisting Controversy
The case, brought on behalf of over 200,000 BSV coin owners, alleges that Binance and other exchanges engaged in “anti-competitive behavior” by delisting the BSV token in 2019. 

Lawyers representing BSV Claims, the entity pursuing the case, contend that the delisting caused a significant drop in BSV’s value and hindered its potential to become a “top tier” cryptocurrency, leading to a claim valued at up to £9 billion.
While Binance has not opposed the case’s certification under the UK’s collective proceedings regime, the exchange has requested the CAT to dismiss the part of the lawsuit about BSV’s alleged potential as a major cryptocurrency. This particular aspect of the case represents individuals who retained their BSV holdings after it was delisted.
Binance’s Legal Arguments
Binance’s legal representative, Brian Kennelly, argued that those holding onto BSV made “a voluntary decision” and could have chosen to sell it and invest in comparable cryptocurrencies. BSV Claims’ lawyers, however, contended that the issue should proceed to trial along with the rest of the case.
When approached for comment by Reuters, Binance declined to provide a statement on the ongoing litigation. A spokesperson for Kraken, another exchange named in the lawsuit, dismissed the claims as “baseless.”
Per the report, the decision to delist BSV by Binance, Kraken, and other exchanges in 2019 was partly triggered by assertions by Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, who claimed to be the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, known as “Satoshi Nakamoto.” 
In a separate legal proceeding earlier this year, Wright was found to have lied and forged documents supporting his false claim. Wright has expressed his intention to appeal against the ruling.

The lawsuit’s outcome could affect Binance, the other exchanges, and the wider crypto community. As the proceedings continue, stakeholders will closely watch the developments and subsequent decisions made by the Competition Appeal Tribunal.

Shiba Inu Accumulation: Whale Splashes $18 Million on Billions of SHIB | Cryptoglobe


                                
Amid the ongoing memecoin crazy a massive cryptocurrency investor has recently started heavily accumulating Shiba Inu ($SHIB), pouring millions onto the meme-inspired cryptocurrency to accumulate billions of tokens.



That’s according to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, which noted that a successful SHIB investor who has in the past made more than $120 million worth the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has now spent 4,849 ETH worth $18.44 million to buy 715.9 billion SHIB.



The trader, according to the service, has in the past spent $400,000 to buy 5.5 trillion SHIB, which were then subsequently sold for around $121 million over two peaks.







The buying frenzy wasn’t a single act. The whale strategically executed a series of purchases, starting with 149.3 billion SHIB for $3.83 million, followed by a swift addition of 173 billion SHIB. Within a three-hour window, the entity gobbled up a total of 323 billion SHIB tokens, spending an additional $8.29 million.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Beyond the whale’s actions, the Shiba Inu ecosystem itself has witnessed significant developments that likely fueled the token’s recent price rise. Shibarium, the Layer-2 scaling solution, has seen notable progress this year, enhancing the network’s capacity to handle a higher volume of transactions efficiently.



Furthermore, the Shibdentity initiative promises a new era of digital identity, while the recently launched Sheboshis NFT collection boasting 20,000 digital avatars on the Ethereum blockchain adds another layer to the Shiba Inu universe.



Further bolstering the ecosystem’s prospects, Shiba Inu secured a $12 million funding round from heavyweights like Polygon Ventures, Mechanism Capital, and Animoca Brands, earmarked for the development of a privacy-focused Layer-3 blockchain. The integration of the Shibaswap decentralized exchange with Shibarium signifies another step towards a more robust and comprehensive ecosystem.



As reported, these developments help SHIB briefly overtake Cardano to become a top 10 cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Paxos USDL Stablecoin Offering 5% APY Launched - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Paxos introduces Lift Dollar (USDL), a stablecoin offering a 5% daily yield through its UAE-based entity.



Paxos USDL stablecoin, built on Ethereum and backed by U.S. dollars and Treasury notes, is regulated by Abu Dhabi’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority.



USDL launches first in Argentina via crypto platforms Ripio, Buenbit, and TiendaCrypto.




Paxos, a prominent player in the stablecoin market, has launched a new stablecoin named Lift Dollar (USDL) through its UAE-based subsidiary, Paxos International.



Paxos USDL Stablecoin Offering 5% APY Launched 4



Paxos USDL Stablecoin Secured and Regulated by Abu Dhabi Authority



The Paxos USDL stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar, offers a programmatic daily yield of approximately 5%, aligning with returns on US Treasury bonds.



Announced on Wednesday, the USDL is regulated by Abu Dhabi’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority, ensuring stringent oversight. Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla emphasized that the structure of USDL mirrors that of Paxos’s other stablecoins, including PayPal USD (PYUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP), and Pax Gold (PAXG). Each of these stablecoins is matched 1:1 with the dollar and backed by short-term U.S. government securities, safeguarding assets against potential bankruptcy scenarios.



USDL is built on the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating unrestricted creation and providing daily payouts to token holders. Each USDL token is fully collateralized by the U.S. dollar and secured by cash assets, including U.S. dollar deposits and short-term U.S. Treasury notes. This structure is intended to maintain sufficient reserves to support the total USDL in circulation, thereby reinforcing investor confidence.




Cascarilla highlighted the strategic decision to introduce Paxos USDL stablecoin in jurisdictions with clear regulatory frameworks. In the US, a stablecoin with a pre-programmed yield could be classified as a security by regulators. This approach aims to ensure compliance with diverse rules and regulations globally.



Initial USDL Launch in Argentina via Crypto Platforms



Initially, Paxos International is launching USDL in Argentina through partnerships with crypto platforms Ripio, Buenbit, and TiendaCrypto. This strategic entry point leverages these platforms’ extensive user bases to facilitate adoption.



The move comes after Paxos Trust Company, regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, ceased offering BUSD, a stablecoin linked to Binance, under regulatory directives last year.

Bitcoin's low volatility will have THIS effect on BTC prices - AMBCrypto



The volatility in the Bitcoin market has declined significantly. 
AxelAdlerJr, in a new report, found that this has dropped to historical levels.

The Bitcoin [BTC] market currently witnesses low volatility, pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst AxelAdlerJr has found in a new report. 
AxelAdlerJr assessed two of BTC’s key volatility markers and found that they have trended downwards in the past few weeks, suggesting a decline in the possibility of a short-term price swing.
The first metric the analyst observed was BTC’s Garman-Klass Realized Volatility. This metric measures BTC’s price’s historical volatility. It combines the highs, lows, opening, and closing prices of an asset over a specified period to track its volatility during that time. 
According to AxelAdlerJr, BTC’s Garman-Klass Realized Volatility has dropped to 20%. When this metric returns low values, it indicates a decrease in the asset’s price volatility. 
A historical assessment of the indicator revealed that when its value dropped to this low in the past six years, BTC’s price witnessed significant changes.
Further, the analyst considered BTC’s Volatility Index using a 30-day small moving average (SMA). This metric measures the degree of fluctuations in BTC’s price over a specified period. 
Similar to the coin’s Garman-Klass Realized Volatility, BTC’s Volatility Index has also declined, confirming the low volatility in the leading coin’s market.
According to the CryptoQuant’s analyst, the index’s value has dropped to extremely low levels, “which have only been seen four times in the last six years.” 
BTC’s price swings are minimal
AMBCrypto’s assessment of the coin’s Bollinger Bands and Average True Range confirmed the analyst’s positions. 
Readings from BTC’s Bollinger Bands showed a narrowing gap between the indicator’s upper and lower bands. This happens during a period of reduced price swings.
BTC’s declining Average True Range (ATR) confirmed this trend. This indicator measures market volatility by calculating the average range between high and low prices over a specified number of periods. 

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

When the indicator falls, it suggests lower market volatility and hints that the asset’s price is trending within a range. At 2138.35 at press time, BTC’s ATR has declined by 44% since 19 April. 
Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView
According to AxelAdlerJr, the current low volatility in the BTC market is a good sign. “
“Given that the market’s current structure remains bullish and that the end of the low volatility period could be followed by a strong price movement, it can be concluded that the market is in the process of forming a new bullish trend,” the analyst added.

May's Crypto Market: Centralized Exchange Declining Volumes Hint at Bigger Changes Ahead


								The trading volume across centralized cryptocurrency exchanges has notably declined, dropping to $5.27 trillion in May 2024. This decrease, roughly 20.1% from the previous month, marks a continued downtrend following the muted price activity of Bitcoin after its April Halving.
Crypto Exchange Landscape And Institutional Interest
According to CCData reports, this deceleration affects both spot and derivatives markets. Spot trading diminished by 21.6% to reach $1.57 trillion. The decline was slightly less steep at 19.4% on the derivatives front, totaling $3.69 trillion.
Centralized crypto exchange metric. | Source: CCData
Despite the overall drop, derivatives trading claimed an increased market share, a shift attributed to the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s unexpected endorsement of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This endorsement sparked a 50.3% boost in Ethereum derivative instruments’ open interest to $14.0 billion.

Regarding market presence, Bybit surged to a record high in spot market share at 7.36%, even as its trading volume contracted by 12.7%. Binance, maintaining its lead, captured a 34.6% share of the spot market.

In the derivatives sector, Binance also increased its dominance to 45.4%, with competitors OKX and Bitget holding substantial portions as well.
Meanwhile, the US CME exchange displayed mixed results; while its overall derivatives volume receded, ETH futures and options soared, achieving record highs of $20.5 billion and $931 million, respectively. This upswing suggests a growing institutional fascination, particularly following regulatory advancements.
The trading scene in May also reflected a reactive adjustment to regulatory developments, notably the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs—a decision that momentarily increased trading activities.
Bitcoinist, citing the CryptoQuant report, has recently reported that such regulatory nods often lead to speculative trading, evident from significant outflows from major exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken.
Continuous Outflows From Exchanges Signal Bullish Sentiment
Recent reports reveal that on-chain data has detected significant Bitcoin outflows from Coinbase, suggesting possible large-scale acquisitions. According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake analysis, Coinbase has experienced substantial outflows for the seventh time this year.
The ‘exchange outflow’ metric, which measures the volume of Bitcoin withdrawn from exchange wallets, indicates investors removing their assets for long-term holding, hinting at a strong bullish sentiment.

These movements are not isolated to Coinbase; Kraken has also seen significant outflows, recording the highest movement of Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017.

This pattern underscores a broader market behavior where large holders transition from short-term trading to permanently securing their assets. Such strategic withdrawals often signal a positive outlook for future price appreciation, reflecting investor confidence in the enduring value of cryptocurrencies.

FOMO Frenzy Versus Community Focus - Why Celebrity Meme Coins Need More Than Star Power - The Daily Hodl


								
 
The dynamic cryptocurrency market continuously churns out new trends (organic and not-so-organic), with the recent surge of celebrity-backed meme coins being a prime example.
Most avid users of digital wallets witnessed the initial excitement surrounding these tokens, like JENNER, RICH and BANDO.
Fueled by the meme coin craze and celebrity endorsements, these tokens experienced a surge in trading activity. However, the dream quickly turned sour.
Within a mere two to three days of launch, the market value of these tokens plummeted dramatically, with some experiencing dips close to 90%.
JENNER by Caitlyn Jenner, for instance, launched with a market cap that briefly touched $43.3 million but now sits at a meager $5.6 million, marking an approximate 87% decline.
Similar stories unfolded for RICH from Rich the Kid (originally valued at $5.3 million, now at $237 thousand) and other celebrity-backed coins like the mentioned BANDO from Trippie Redd, or DAVIDO (Davido), and MOTHER from Iggy Azalea.
Speaking about the dramatic price drops – the threadbare inherent volatility of the crypto market is now heavily influenced by news-driven sentiment and speculation.
Early investor exits to secure profits can trigger rapid sell-offs, especially when a coin lacks liquidity, which is common for meme coins.
Building beyond the buzz
While the recent crash highlights the risks associated with meme coins, I believe there’s potential for successful projects.
Meme coins thrive on community consensus, much like dedicated fan bases.
Celebrities wield considerable influence, and their involvement could be leveraged to launch projects with high potential.
A successful celebrity-backed meme coin could pave the way for wider crypto adoption, similar to the ‘NFT summer’ phenomenon, where celebrities sparked mainstream interest in digital assets.
However, a critical distinction exists between hype and substance. Can celebrity involvement alone translate to long-term success?
The answer lies in a combination of factors. Successful meme coins will need more than just a celebrity name attached.
Clear utility, a strong development team with a proven track record and a dedicated community are crucial for sustained growth.
A bit more on this below.
Utility
What problem does a meme coin solve? Does it offer unique features or functionality within DAO or the metaverse?
Dogecoin, for example, is considered a meme coin, but it has also established itself as a viable medium of exchange for some online transactions – on social media, for instance.
For a meme coin to achieve long-term success, it needs a clear purpose that goes beyond simply being associated with a celebrity.
Development team
Who is building the project? A strong development team with experience in blockchain technology is essential.
Look for teams with a history of successful projects and a clear roadmap outlining the coin’s development goals.
Community
A strong, engaged community is essential for any cryptocurrency project.
Look for projects with active social media channels, forums and discussions where the community is actively involved in the project’s future.
A passionate and engaged community can help promote the coin and provide valuable feedback for development.
Fleeting celebrity endorsements shouldn’t sway investors. Researching the project’s fundamentals – tokenomics (distribution and use of tokens), roadmap and development team – is crucial before investing in any meme coin or any cryptocurrency for that matter.
The future of celebrity meme coins
The recent crash serves as a cautionary tale for investors considering meme coins based solely on celebrity hype.
However, the potential for successful meme coins with real-world utility and strong communities shouldn’t be entirely discounted.
As the crypto market matures, we may see more celebrity-backed meme coins that offer genuine value propositions and contribute to wider crypto adoption.
If we focus on fundamentals, foster strong communities and prioritize long-term utility over short-term hype, the future of celebrity meme coins and meme coins in general can be brighter.

Whale Accumulation Drives Shiba Inu, Cardano, JasmyCoin Upwards: Do They Know Something We Don't? - Benzinga

Whale investors, known to move cryptocurrency markets with their moves, are showing significant interest in coins like Shiba Inu, Cardano, and the latest sensation, JasmyCoin.What Happened: Large transactions, worth at least $100,000, for each of these cryptocurrencies have more than doubled this week compared to the 2024 averages, according to on-chain analytics firm Santiment.Following this, the aforementioned coins witnessed a notable surge in price, as indicated below.CryptocurrencyGains this week +/-Price (Recorded at 10:35 p.m. EDT)JasmyCoin (CRYPTO: Jasmy)+12%$0.03899Shiba Inu SHIB/USD+9%$0.00002588Cardano DOGE/USD+3.8%$0.4612The surge in whale activity, followed by a rise in price, led Santiment to infer that wealthy investors were accumulating—a bullish signal for any cryptocurrency.Among the three, SHIB was the most-traded coin in the last 24 hours, with volumes rising 31% to $929 million.Why It Matters: Whales possess a large stash of cryptocurrencies and typically include institutional investors, including big banks, hedge funds, and high-income individuals.Their growing interest in the coins mentioned above indicates confidence in their near-term prospects, spurred partly by the recent rally in blue-chip currencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD.More than 65% of SHIB holders are currently in profit, while nearly 80% of JASMY holders are "in the money," according to data from IntoTheBlock.

Ethereum vs Solana: Which blockchain will dominate in 2024? - AMBCrypto



Solana outperformed Ethereum in active addresses and trading volume.
Despite Solana’s growth, Ethereum’s network activity and security position it as superior.

Mirroring the broader market trend, both Ethereum [ETH] and Solana [SOL] exhibited positive trading activity, with ETH experiencing a 1.4% increase and SOL showing a 4.64% hike in the past 24 hours.  
However, delving deeper into their performance revealed an interesting insight: Solana has surpassed Ethereum in activity metrics, boasting a higher number of active addresses and trading volume. 
Solana’s active addresses surged above 1 million, while Ethereum’s remained stagnant, highlighting a notable disparity between the two networks.
Further confirming this sentiment, AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment data revealed that SOL outperformed ETH in social dominance as well.
Source: Santiment
With such key metrics hinting at Solana’s potential to overtake Ethereum, a fundamental question emerges: Which blockchain will emerge victorious in 2024 and beyond? 
Ethereum vs Solana: The debate
Sharing their insights, Ethereum Researcher Justin Drake and Solana Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko engaged in a debate on Ethereum versus Solana on the ‘Bankless’ podcast. 
Shedding light on what’s good about Solana, Drake noted, 
“I think what Solana is doing for Ethereum is that it is providing healthy competition. It’s a sort of accelerationism and not only because of good execution but also because of contrarianism.” 
In response, Yakovenko, while praising ETH’s decision to prioritize security over scalability, he said, 
“People think Ethereum is moving slowly but if you look at the size of the network, its value…I would be terrified of any changes to Solana if it was at that value.”
He further went ahead and added, 
“Ethereum is at a point which I think every other L1 should be envious of, and try to get there as fast as they can. All of that I think puts it in a class in my mind actually above Bitcoin.”  
This highlights that Ethereum is still the winner in the L1 space owing to the most network effects, liquidity, maturity, and security, making it pre-ordained to surpass Bitcoin and become number one. 
However, on the other hand, Drake justified that Solana could become the ‘internet of value’, justifying its $100 billion valuation. 
He further added that SOL’s developers are more focused on building user-targeting products rather than infrastructure, which contributes to its success.
SOL a competitor to ETH?
Adding to the fray, Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision and Global Macro Investor, drawing parallels with ETH’s 2020 bull run highlighted Solana’s emergence as a strong Ethereum competitor. 
He best put it when he said, 
“If you go back to 2020, Ethereum started basing and then began outperforming from about the summer onwards. It really started picking up towards the end of 2020, and then by 2021, it went ballistic, you know, it went into full banana mode. I think we’ll see something similar.”

Bitcoin Whales Keep Buying, Now Control Over 40% Of Supply


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin whales now own over 40% of the entire BTC supply, as they have continued to accumulate more recently.
Bitcoin Whales Have Been In Buying Mode Since Mid-March
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the BTC whales have been increasing their supply since the middle of March. The “whales” here refer to the Bitcoin addresses carrying more than 1,000 BTC in their balance.

At the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency, this amount converts to around $71.4 million, which is quite quite massive. Because of these large holdings, the whales are considered influential entities on the network.
As such, their collective behavior can be something to watch, given that their movements may affect the cryptocurrency’s price. There are many ways to track this behavior, one of which is through the trend in their total supply.
Below is the chart shared by IntoTheBlock, which reveals the trajectory of the collective balance of these large holders over the past few months.

As the above graph shows, the balance of the Bitcoin whales has been constantly increasing during the past few months. This rise started as the consolidation following the price’s all-time high (ATH) began.
It would appear that while the rest of the market was panicking about the struggle BTC’s price was facing, these colossal entities were seeing it as an opportunity to accumulate more of the asset.
Following the latest buying spree, the holdings owned by these large investors have risen to a figure equivalent to more than 40% of the cryptocurrency’s entire supply in circulation.
If the whales keep up buying, they may soon cross the 50% supply mark. While buying from these holders is a positive sign for the coin’s price, the fact that these holders aren’t far from controlling most of the supply may not be optimal.
In some other news, as CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn has shared in an X post, the total Open Interest across the cryptocurrency sector currently stands at $51.01 billion, which is quite close to the ATH.

The trend in the aggregated global Open Interest in the digital asset sector | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
The Open Interest here measures the total amount of derivatives positions (in USD) related to cryptocurrencies currently open on all exchanges. Generally, the total leverage in the market goes up when the metric increases, so the market could become more unstable.

As Open Interest in the digital asset sector approaches its ATH, it’s possible that some sharp volatility could soon be coming for coins across the market.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $71,400, up 6% over the past week.

The bullish and bearish price predictions were $154,000 and $360, respectively.Why It Matters: VanEck is one of several Wall Street firms aiming to list spot ether ETFs in the wake of successful spot Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs launched earlier this year. The SEC gave the green light to spot Ether ETFs last month.“We anticipate that spot Ether ETFs are nearing approval to trade on U.S. stock exchanges,” said the VanEck analysts. They estimate that these ETFs could draw between $3.1 billion and $4.8 billion in net inflows during their first five months of trading. The optimism is in contrast to SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s position, who hinted at delays.These estimates come on the heels of recent projections by cryptocurrency analyst Flow, who fixed a base price target of $5,294 for ETH by the end of 2024. The bullish and bearish price predictions were $6,730​ and $4,428, respectively.Price Action: At the time of writing, ETH was exchanging hands at $3,863.06, following a 1.37% increase in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Will Dogecoin’s Price Discovery Follow Bitcoin Like It Did Historically?Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

XRP Price Faces Hurdles: Will It Overcome the Obstacles?


																XRP price is slowly moving higher above the $0.5200 zone. It is now facing hurdles near $0.5320 and might correct lower in the near term.

XRP is attempting a fresh increase above the $0.5250 zone.
The price is now trading above $0.5220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.5260 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could correct lower toward the $0.5220 support before the bulls appear again.

XRP Price Gains Traction
XRP price remained well-supported above the $0.5120 zone and extended its increase like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price was able to clear the $0.5200 and $0.5250 levels.
There was a clear move above the $0.5300 resistance and the price tested the $0.5320 zone. A high was formed at $0.5325 and the price is now correcting gains. It traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5080 swing low to the $0.5325 high.
There was also a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.5260 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair is now trading above $0.5220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.5200 level. The first key resistance is near $0.5320. The next major resistance is near the $0.5350 level. A close above the $0.5350 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.550.
Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com
If there is a close above the $0.550 resistance level, there could be a steady increase toward the $0.5560 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5650 resistance.
More Losses?
If XRP fails to clear the $0.5350 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5260 level.
The next major support is at $0.5200 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5080 swing low to the $0.5325 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.520 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline and retest the $0.5120 support in the near term.

BTC Price Came 3% Away From Charting New ATH as Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Equals Record


																After a relatively quiet and sluggish weekend, bitcoin’s price started moving north once again at the start of the business week and kept rising until it popped to $71,767 (on Bitstamp) yesterday evening.
This came amid the growing inflows toward most US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, as yesterday saw nearly $500 million being poured in. Even Grayscale’s GBTC saw positive flows.
What’s even more impressive about the amount of USD going into the largest US spot BTC ETFs is the streak they have been on.
The last time there were outflows from these financial vehicles was nearly a month ago – on May 10. Since then, there have been very few occasional outflows from certain ETFs, like $100 million being taken out of Ark Invest’s ARKB on May 30, but the overall numbers have not been in the red.
Thus, the positive streak of consecutive inflow days has risen to 16, which equals the previous record set in February. As reported recently, June 4 saw the second-biggest day of inflows ($886.6 million), while the number for yesterday was $488.1 million.




Fidelity’s FBTC was once again in the lead, raking in more than $220 million. BlackRock’s IBIT followed suit with $155.4 million, and even Grayscale’s GBTC, which has seen the most substantial outflows ever since its conversion, gathered $14.6 million.
These positive numbers were perhaps the main source fueling another price rally for the underlying asset. BTC had dipped to around $69,000 on June 4 but started gaining traction once again yesterday and soared to a 15-day peak of $71,767 (Bitstamp).
As such, bitcoin came less than 3% away from its all-time high set on March 14 ($73,737). Despite losing around a grand since then, the crypto community believes charting a fresh peak is a matter of when and not if.

Here's Why XRP ETF is 'Inevitable:' Ripple CEO Chips in


																TL;DR

The approval of spot BTC and ETH ETFs has led to speculation about the potential launch of a spot XRP ETF in the US, with Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse suggesting it’s “inevitable.”
However, the ongoing legal battle between the company and the SEC over allegations of unregistered securities offerings might complicate the green light of such a financial product.


Is XRP ETF Coming Next?
The cryptocurrency market has been booming since the beginning of 2024, with bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new all-time high of over $73,700 in mid-March and currently trading well above the $70K mark. This success could be partially attributed to the historical launch of certain financial products unavailable in the US several months ago. 
The products in question are spot BTC ETFs, which received the SEC’s green light in January. Last month, the agency gave the thumbs up for spot ETH ETFs, too.
Those financial vehicles provide investors with exposure to digital assets without having to purchase them directly from exchanges. They simplify the investment process and mitigate some risks associated with handling cryptocurrencies (such as self-custody, for example).




In the past few months, many industry participants have speculated that a spot XRP ETF can also see the light of day in America. Not long ago, Ripple’s CEO – Brad Garlinghouse – claimed that such a product, alongside SOL ETFs and ADA ETFs, is “inevitable.”
Most recently, he doubled down on his stance, suggesting that investors want exposure to numerous ETFs, not only those with Bitcoin and Ethereum as underlying assets:
“To me, it only makes sense. You don’t want to have just a single-threaded asset exposure. I think people also forget that it wasn’t that long time ago (before the SEC got involved) that XRP was the second-most valuable digital asset.”
Garlinghouse’s first comments on the potential launch of a spot XRP ETF in the US came in February this year. Back then, he said his company would welcome such a product. A few months later, the CEO outlined the firm’s roadmap for the next three years. Interestingly, the launch of a spot XRP ETF was not among the top priorities.
The Difficulties With the SEC
It is worth noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the agency approving or rejecting such financial products in the United States. Those who have been following the crypto industry in the past few years must be aware that the regulator and Ripple are involved in a legal battle that recently entered its trial phase.
It all started in December 2020 when the SEC accused the firm and some of its executives of illegally raising more than $1.3 billion in an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. Ripple secured three partial court victories last year, and according to some, it has the upper hand for a decisive victory.
XRP’s price spiked substantially after each triumph, meaning the eventual resolution of the case might trigger enhanced volatility once again. Those curious to learn about the lawsuit’s specifics and its impact on the asset’s valuation, feel free to check our dedicated video below:

Ethereum ETF Approval Timeline Uncertain, SEC Chair Warns


								The saga of Ethereum ETFs in the US continues with a new twist: cautious optimism. After the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s unexpected green light for spot Ethereum ETFs in May, investors have been eagerly awaiting the launch date. But according to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, patience remains key.

Gensler Throws Cold Water On Rapid Launch Hopes
In a recent interview with CNBC, Gensler tempered expectations, stating that final approvals for individual ETFs “will likely take some time.”
This suggests that the review process will likely take a long time, which could postpone the establishment of Ethereum ETFs, according to Eleanor Terrett, a writer for Fox Business.  However, Gensler did offer a glimmer of hope, acknowledging that the process is underway.


This wait-and-see approach comes amidst ongoing communication between the SEC and ETF issuers. Several companies have tweaked their applications based on the SEC’s feedback, including removing staking options and disclosing custodian details. These amendments suggest a collaborative effort, potentially expediting the approval process.

Total crypto market cap at $2.5 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com
Expert Opinions Divided On Timeline
Market experts are divided on the exact timeline for these ETF launches. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, remains optimistic. He believes issuers could receive the SEC’s nod by the end of June, with a possible launch date as early as July 4th. James Seyffart, another Bloomberg analyst, is more cautious, avoiding specific dates but suggesting approvals are likely within weeks, not months.


Ethereum ETF: Long-Term Success Uncertain
While the prospect of Ethereum ETFs is exciting for some, experts caution against unrealistic expectations. Unlike Bitcoin, which saw a surge in inflows with its ETF launch, Ethereum’s future might be less meteoric. The market’s overall volatility and the lack of clarity around staking within these ETFs could dampen investor enthusiasm.

A Calculated Move, Not A Gold Rush
The approval process for Ethereum ETFs highlights the SEC’s measured approach towards crypto regulation. While the agency seems receptive to innovation, it prioritizes investor protection. This cautious stance might delay the launch, but it could also ensure a more stable and secure entry point for mainstream investors into the Ethereum market.
For now, investors should buckle up for a potentially bumpy ride. While the launch of Ethereum ETFs appears to be on the horizon, it’s likely to be a gradual rollout rather than a sudden explosion. This measured approach, while frustrating for some, could ultimately pave the way for a more sustainable future for Ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole.

'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Robert Kiyosaki Comes Up With Another Bold Projection: 'Bitcoin Will Be $350,000 By August 25' - Benzinga

Renowned investor and author Robert Kiyosaki grabbed the attention of cryptocurrency enthusiasts with his staggering $350,000 price prediction for Bitcoin BTC/USD in less than three months.What Happened: Kiyosaki took to social media platform X on Wednesday to make the bold projection about the King Crypto hitting the mark by August 2024."It's a prediction. It's speculation, it's an opinion, but it's not a lie," the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad" wrote. "I am confident Bitcoin will hit $350,000 sometime in 2024 but for it's only a target, a dream, and a wish."Kiyosaki also said that he is grabbing more Bitcoin, Ethereum ETH/USD, and Solana SOL/USD for he is confident that their prices will continue to soar.The author of the best-selling personal finance book also used the opportunity to ridicule President Joe Biden and SEC Chair Gary Gensler, saying, "What I am confident of is the incompetence of our leaders, President Biden, Treasury Secretary Yellin, and Fed Chair Powell. Protect your self from the 3- Stooges."Why It Matters: Kiyosaki, a staunch supporter of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has been known to make outlandish price predictions.Earlier this year, he posted on X that Bitcoin would hit $100,000 by June 2024. Going by the asset's ongoing trajectory, it seems highly unlikely now.The latest prediction of $350,000 by August 2024 will mean a nearly 5X jump from Bitcoin's price at the time of writing. Considering that the asset has grown by just 70% year-to-date despite bullish catalysts like spot ETFs, the forecast can be safely deemed unrealistic. That said, on a practical note, Bitcoin, along with Ethereum ETH/USD were poised to grow steadily, driven by demand from permanent holders and whales, according to Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant.Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $71,099.25, trading mostly flat in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Image created using photos on Flickr and ShutterstockRead Next: Ethereum Could Soar To $22K By 2030, Predicts VanEck — Investment Giant Says Spot ETFs ‘Nearing Approval To Trade’

Experts Debate Real-World Assets Tokenization at Hearing


On Wednesday, the US Financial Services House Committee held a hearing titled “Next Generation Infrastructure: How Tokenization of Real-World Assets Will Facilitate Efficient Markets.”
The hearing aimed to assess the need for more regulations to support the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) and derivative products.
Diverse Opinions Emerge on Blockchain Use in Traditional Finance

Notable individuals from a range of professions participated during the hearing. Carlos Domingo, the Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, and Robert Morgan, the CEO of the USDF Consortium, represented the real-world assets tokenization industry.
From the financial markets, Lilya Tessler, a Partner at Sidley Austin LLP, and Nadine Chakar, the Global Head of Digital Assets at the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, also contributed. Additionally, the hearing featured an academic perspective from Prof. Hilary Allen, a Law Professor at American University Washington College of Law.
During the session, witnesses and lawmakers shared varied perspectives on tokenization. Chairman French Hill highlighted tokenization’s potential to bring traditional finance onto the blockchain, promising enhanced efficiency and reduced costs.

“Tokenization can leverage the efficiency and transparency of blockchains to help modernize US markets. […] With the help of blockchain, tokenization can automate some of these critical processes within financial transactions, bringing along streamlined settlement and lower costs,” he said.

Tessler emphasized the widespread digital representation of assets, noting that blockchain could enhance these processes by offering programmability and liquidity. Morgan discussed the evolution of ledger technologies in banking. He suggested that distributed ledger technology (DLT) could break down silos in the financial system.

“Today, financial infrastructure consists of a series of siloed systems. Tokenization has a unique ability to break down these silos, facilitating real-time collaboration among financial institutions,” Morgan explained.

Chakar echoed the sentiment. She stressed the importance of building interoperable infrastructures with built-in compliance. Additionally, Domingo showcased Securitize’s role in modernizing private capital markets through tokenization, underlining the technology’s efficiency.
Ongoing Debate: Can Tokenization Transform Traditional Finance?
However, not all experts and lawmakers were optimistic about real-world assets tokenization. Congressman Brad Sherman and Professor Hilary Allen voiced concerns over the implications of tokenization. Particularly, they are worried about regulatory oversight and financial stability.

Sherman questioned the potential for tokenization to bypass existing regulatory frameworks. Meanwhile, Allen criticized public blockchains’ inefficiencies and operational fragilities.

“Public permissionless blockchains suffer from inescapable inefficiencies and operational fragilities, making them unsuitable for real-world financial assets. […] Tokenization should not be used to integrate real-world financial services with the crypto universe,” Allen opined.

Despite the differing opinions, the hearing shows the ongoing debate about the future of blockchain technology in traditional finance. Indeed, the potential regulatory clarity from such discussions could pave the way for broader adoption of tokenization. Particularly in high-potential industries like real estate and securities.
As the debate continues, it’s clear that the finance industry is on the brink of a transformation. Industry leaders are exploring the innovative applications of real-world asset tokenization.

Notably, some banking giants like Citi are exploring tokenization’s potential. In a report, Tony McLaughlin, one of Citi’s executives, explained that tokenization could revolutionize digital money by surpassing traditional account-based systems and creating networks of regulated liabilities. This innovation promises a new generation of digital money that is regulated, redeemable at par value, and legally owned by the holder.

SEC chair Gensler cautions crypto exchanges on enforcement


U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler issued a warning to cryptocurrency exchanges, stating that providing disclosures to investors does not shield them from regulatory enforcement. 



Gensler emphasized in a CNBC interview Wednesday that disclosures alone are inadequate if crypto exchanges engage in activities such as market manipulation or disseminate misleading information that affects investment decisions. 



He also pointed out that many crypto companies fail to provide any disclosures, operating in a manner that would be unacceptable in conventional financial markets.



The SEC has ramped up its enforcement actions in the digital assets space, particularly after the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in late 2022. 



The agency is actively involved in litigation against some of the largest players in the U.S. crypto market, including a case against Coinbase, the largest exchange by daily trading volume in the United States.



Gensler showed a more nuanced approach when discussing the potential for crypto ETFs, such as those involving the Solana memecoin BONK. 



This softer tone aligns with the SEC’s recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, a decision that was unexpected by many due to previous considerations of Ethereum as an unregistered security.



The SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETFs has sparked discussions about the agency’s willingness to consider other altcoin spot ETFs. 



Political dynamics, including the influence of the crypto lobby and the approaching 2024 election, are thought to have influenced the SEC’s evolving stance.

Top Analyst Says Blue-Chip Altcoin Primed To Spark 70% Rally, Updates Outlook on Ethereum - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader believes that a top-10 altcoin by market cap is destined to rally by double-digit percentage points from the current level.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 260,900 followers on the social media platform X that BNB, the utility token for the BNB Chain ecosystem, is set to reach a price of at least $1,000.










“There’s no way BNB doesn’t get a four-digit handle this cycle.”
Based on Bluntz’s chart of BNB on the weekly timeframe, it appears that the pseudonymous analyst who sometimes employs the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis expects BNB to reach a price of around $1,200 in a five-wave pattern – a gain of about 71% from the current level.
The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern.
Source: Bluntz/X
BNB is trading at $700 at time of writing, around 1% below the all-time high of $710 reached on June 5th.
Next up is the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair. The pseudonymous analyst says that the downward movement that followed a bearish divergence that had formed on the 12-hour timeframe chart of ETH/BTC appears to have ended.
A bearish divergence is a technical analysis pattern characterized by the price of an asset going up while an indicator, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, in this case, is trending downwards.

Cardano Founder Discusses ADA's Future And Exciting Updates


								In a forceful rebuttal to widespread media speculation about the viability of Cardano, founder Charles Hoskinson has provided a detailed rundown of forthcoming developments and initiatives which he believes underscore the cryptocurrency’s robust health and its promising future.
Cardano Founder Slams Crypto Media
In a statement via X, Hoskinson expressed his frustration with the current narrative surrounding ADA in the crypto media landscape. “Never in my career have I seen such a profound disconnect between reality and opinion with the cryptocurrency influencer and media perception of Cardano versus its actual fundamentals,” he stated.
He emphasized that Cardano is on the brink of significant developments, including what he describes as the “most significant hard fork in the history of the project.” The forthcoming Chang Hard Fork represents a pivotal evolution for Cardano, transitioning control of the protocol fully to the community.

This move will burn all seven genesis keys, thereby marking a historic leap toward complete decentralization. The upgrade, anticipated to significantly advance on-chain governance as outlined in CIP-1694, will also see the introduction of delegated representatives (DReps), further decentralizing decision-making processes within the ecosystem.
Beyond the hard fork, Hoskinson highlighted several other initiatives poised to catalyze growth and innovation within the ecosystem. These include the introduction of new technologies such as Hydra, a layer-two scalability solution designed to enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs, which is currently in the maturation phase. Moreover, Hoskinson highlighted that Cardano can boast several partner chains with Midnight and Prism.
Cardano’s active community participation is evident in the rapidly growing number of DApps, significant research and development in blockchain scalability, and the organization of major events such as the Rare Evo blockchain convention (August 15-17), the Cardano Foundation Summit in Dubai (October 23-24), and participation in TOKEN2049 in Singapore (September 18-19).

Moreover, the Project Catalyst initiative continues to be a driving force for community-led innovation, providing funding and support to projects that promise real-world applications and solutions. Looking forward, the Cardano ecosystem is also preparing for a significant constitutional convention in Buenos Aires, where delegates will ratify a final version of Cardano’s Constitution, further establishing the framework for decentralized governance.
“We are on the verge of the most significant hard fork in the history of the project, tons of community DApps are growing rapidly, we are leading the industry in scaling R&D, rare evo is going to be a huge event, the Foundation summit huge, we’ll be at Token 2049, technologies like Hydra are maturing, we have partnerchains, Midnight, Prism, tons of community events, catalyst, and then the constitutional convention in Argentina,” Hoskinson stated.
The ADA founder concluded with a strong message to detractors, asserting, “Cardano is here to stay, and it’s a juggernaut that will drag this industry kicking and screaming if it has to towards solving the real-world economic, political, and social issues we all is beyond pathetic and just reflects on the low quality and low effort they put into our ecosystem.” This statement not only refutes claims about Cardano’s demise but also challenges the cryptocurrency community to recognize and engage with the substantive advances being made.
At press time, ADA traded at $0.459.

Bitcoin miners pivot to AI: New revenue stream post-halving? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin miners are embracing AI as alternative revenues amidst a decline in mining income. 
Possible miner capitulations flash a BTC buy signal as spikes in Hash Ribbons persist. 

More Bitcoin [BTC] miners, like Core Scientific, are massively diversifying into AI (artificial intelligence) to boost the revenue streams after April’s halving event. 
April’s BTC halving event reduced miners’ block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, slashing their revenue by half.  
As of 5th June, Bitcoin Miner Revenue per day stood at $30.05 million. This was down over 70% from the record high of $107 million hit on April’s 2024 halving day, per YCharts. 
Source: YCharts
AI to solve Bitcoin miners’ revenue problems?
However, according to a recent CNBC report, miners are now shifting their focus to AI computing for its higher rewards and increasing demand following the successful ChatGPT AI model from OpenAI. 
Per the report, Bit Digital now gets 27% of its revenue from AI. Hut 8, another BTC miner, and Hive generated 6% and 4%, respectively, of their revenue from AI. 
According to Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan, the shift to AI will help create, 
‘Diversified business model and more predictable cash flows.’
The AI diversification could be a welcome relief given the reported miner capitulations. 
Are some Bitcoin miners exiting?
In mid-May, an AMBCrypto report found that Bitcoin’s network hashrate dropped significantly, alongside possible miner capitulations amidst spikes in Bitcoin Hash Ribbons. 
Hash Ribbons track short and long-term moving averages of Bitcoin’s hashrate. Spikes in the metric demonstrate low mining activity or exit of less efficient Bitcoin miners. 
The Hash Ribbons signal has persisted, and crypto hedge fund Capriole Investments referred to the latest flash as a ‘tempting Bitocin buy signal.’
‘Hash Ribbons is back. Perhaps the best long-term Bitcoin buy signal there is, Hash Ribbons is now tempting us with the current Miner Capitulation, which started two weeks ago.’
Additionally, the Bitcoin miner reserve hit its yearly low of 1.8 million BTC. The low level was last seen 14 years ago and suggested that miners were offloading their holdings, probably through OTC (over-the-counter) markets. 
Source: CryptoQuant
Perhaps another piece that corroborated the Hash Ribbons’ ‘buy signal’ was Willy Woo’s claim that institutional traders were ‘risk-on’ and have pivoted to buying. Should you copy professionals or wait for a range breakout to jump in?

Ethereum's Buterin denounces celebrity memecoins, urges purposeful innovation


Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has voiced criticism against the rise of celebrity-endorsed memecoins, calling for a shift towards cryptocurrencies with substantive, long-term goals. 



Addressing the crypto community through tweets on Wednesday, Buterin said that a crypto project needs to “have some kind of public-good goal” rather than enriching celebrities.



He suggests that while financialization is commendable when aligned with noble causes, many celebrity-driven tokens appear to prioritize immediate financial returns over meaningful objectives. 



Buterin’s comments come amid a wave of memecoins promoted by celebrities, which he argues lack a clear purpose or vision for the future.



One of the most popular celebrity memecoins launched recently belongs to Iggy Azalea, an Australian rapper who recently launched the token “MOTHER.”



The token has a market capitalization of over US$135 million, as of 2:30 a.m. ET, according to DEXTools.



Azalea claims that her project will donate to curing koalas from chlamydia, a major disease threat to the population of the endangered animal.



Some alleged scammers have taken advantage of the celebrity memecoin boom to launch suspicious projects carrying a celebrity’s name.

Forget 'Sell in May': Investors Double Down on ETFs in Record Numbers


							

ETF investors pour in $58 billion into equity ETFs in May 2024, defying the “Sell in May” adage.



Fixed-income ETFs also surge, attracting $27 billion; their best month in over a year.



Year-to-date ETF inflows hit +$315 billion, signaling an appetite for ETFs.




ETF investors demonstrated confidence in May 2024 by injecting a record $58 billion into equity ETFs. This was a historic capital inflow, particularly in an election year, a period typically characterized by market volatility. This large inflow of funds shows robust investor confidence and a firm stand against the ‘Sell in May’ strategy.



The fixed-income ETFs also saw an inflow of $27 billion in May, the highest in over a year. These figures contributed to the total ETF flows for the year-to-date, which is currently at +$315 billion. The data reflects the growing tendency of ETFs being actively used by investors who look for diversified yet easily tradable instruments.







Investor confidence remains strong despite market volatility, fueled by a growing preference for actively managed ETFs and an expanding market with a wider array of choices. Moreover, with 138 new ETFs launched in the first quarter of 2024, the market is expanding rapidly, providing investors with an array of choices.



In addition, the operational benefits of ETFs over mutual funds, vis-à-vis through lower fees and improved tax efficiency, draw in more investors. Moreover, advancements in trading systems make it easier for investors to trade and manage their ETFs.



The substantial inflows in both equity and fixed-income ETFs demonstrate a balanced approach among investors to keep their portfolio as diversified as possible even when interest rates fluctuate. The ETF inflows of May 2024 signal a strong vote of confidence from the investors who are slanting toward ETFs as their preferred investment.

ETH to $22,000 by 2030: VanEck's Investment Insights | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 5 June 2024, VanEck released an updated analysis forecasting the future of Ethereum (ETH), predicting its price to reach $22,000 by 2030. The report, authored by Matthew Sigel, Patrick Bush, and Denis Zinoviev, delves into the potential growth of ETH and its optimal inclusion in both traditional and crypto-specific portfolios. This analysis comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is maturing and increasingly gaining the attention of institutional investors.



ETH Price Target and Market Dynamics



VanEck’s projection of ETH reaching $22,000 by 2030 is based on the premise of Ethereum maintaining its dominance in the smart contract platform space. The report highlights that Ethereum’s value proposition is particularly compelling to entrepreneurs and large technology companies, suggesting that it will continue to capture significant market share from traditional financial markets and Big Tech. According to VanEck, Ethereum could generate $66 billion in free cash flow, supporting a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion.



The report also mentions the anticipated approval of spot ether ETFs on U.S. stock exchanges, which could provide a secure investment vehicle for institutional investors and financial advisors, enhancing liquidity and pricing advantages.



Optimal Portfolio Allocations



VanEck’s analysis explores the optimal allocation of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) within traditional 60/40 portfolios and crypto-only portfolios. Key findings include:



Traditional 60/40 Portfolios:A modest allocation of up to 6% in cryptocurrencies (3% BTC and 3% ETH) significantly improves the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio with minimal impact on drawdowns.This balanced approach provides enhanced risk-adjusted returns without excessively increasing volatility.Crypto-Only Portfolios:An optimal allocation of 70% BTC and 30% ETH yields the best risk-adjusted returns.This combination leverages BTC’s stability and ETH’s growth potential to maximize returns.



The analysis also indicates that higher allocations of cryptocurrencies can further improve portfolio performance for investors with higher risk tolerance.



Ethereum’s Growth and Revenue Projections







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

VanEck claims that Ethereum’s economic activity and revenue generation are substantial, with the network attracting around 20 million monthly active users and facilitating significant transaction volumes. VanEck’s report projects Ethereum’s total addressable market (TAM) across several sectors, including finance, marketing, infrastructure, and artificial intelligence (AI), estimating a TAM of $15 trillion.



The report also mentions that Ethereum’s revenue, driven by transaction fees, Layer-2 settlements, blockspace ordering, and security services, is expected to grow significantly. VanEck’s model predicts that financial businesses will account for 71% of Ethereum’s revenues by 2030, with the remainder coming from other sectors like marketing, infrastructure, and AI.



Comparative Analysis and Risks



The report draws comparisons between Ethereum and major Web2 companies, noting that Ethereum generates more revenue than platforms like Etsy and Twitch, and has a larger user base than Instacart and Robinhood. 



However, VanEck also acknowledges the risks associated with investing in ETH, including regulatory uncertainties, interest rate fluctuations, market competition, and geopolitical factors. These risks could potentially impact Ethereum’s growth and valuation, highlighting the need for cautious and informed investment decisions.

R. Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin to hit $350k by this date


    As he continues to warn about a financial crisis in the United States and the world, popular investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has predicted that one of his favorite assets to help protect oneself against this economic demise – Bitcoin (BTC) – could hit the price of $350,000 by late August 2024.



Specifically, the author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ expressed his confidence that the maiden cryptocurrency would reach the stellar price of $350,000 by August 25 this year, although acknowledging it is only a prediction, per his X post on June 6.



Furthermore, Kiyosaki pointed out that he continued to buy more Bitcoin but also Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) because he was “quite certain their prices will continue to rise” because of the “incompetence of our leaders, President Biden, Treasury Secretary Yellin, and Fed Chair Powell.”







Indeed, referring to US President Joe Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as the “three stooges in real life,” the finance educator advised his followers to buy more gold, silver, Bitcoin, Solana, and Ethereum,” to protect themselves from them.











As a reminder, Kiyosaki has long recommended stocking up on the above assets to safeguard one’s wealth, alongside warnings about inflation, mounting debt, and potential market instability, as well as that traditional financial products like stocks and bonds were in an ‘everything bubble.’



In terms of Bitcoin’s future, he has also supported a bold prognosis by Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of ARK Invest, which manages several exchange-traded funds (ETFs), who previously said that Bitcoin could hit a staggering price of $2.3 million per wholecoin.



At the moment, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset is trading above the critical psychological level at $70,000, after spending the majority of the past several weeks below it, and in continuation of a bullish year that has witnessed its advance of nearly 70% since the start of 2024.

Turkey Ranks 4th in Crypto Trading, Govt Wave Off Crypto...


                                Turkey Dismisses Plans to Tax Crypto, A Bold Move For Market Growth                                Turkey has chosen not to introduce taxation on stock and cryptocurrency trading profits and has only discussed the introduction of a small transaction tax as a part of its measures to control financial transactions. This development was released by the Minister of Finance and Finance Mehmet Şimşek.What's the news?Recently, Minister Şimşek stated that Turkey will not collect taxes on the profits earned from stocks or cryptocurrencies. However, what the government is contemplating is that there is likelihood of implementing a small tax on dealing in these assets. The details of this proposed transaction tax including the potential amount, have yet to be detailed.This announcement comes against the backdrop of earlier reports that indicated that Turkey was to entirely exempt stock and cryptocurrency trading from taxation. In the course of the meeting, Minister Şimşek pointed to the need to set proper taxation for all types of financial income in order to foster a fair taxation system.In a report from Chainalysis, it was found that Turkey is the fourth biggest country in cryptocurrency trading, outpacing Russia, Canada, Vietnam, Thailand, and Germany. The policy based on no tax on crypto also raises questions that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has recently issued and also seeks to enhance the position of Turkey in the international cryptocurrency market. Currently, Turkey trades an estimated $170 billion by 2023, and it plays a relatively large role in the crypto space.Why Turkey Wave off Taxes on Cryptocurrency Profits?The government of Turkey has withdrawn the decision to tax profits from cryptocurrencies and stocks because of a long-term plan to dominate the global financial markets.Thus, the tax rate on the profits from the stock market in Turkey was cut in half in 2008 from 10% to 0%. It was a daring initiative that opened the doors for investment and businesses in the country. The Turkish government acknowledges the fact that cryptocurrencies play a crucial part in the global economy.By not imposing taxes on cryptocurrency profits, Turkey aims to promote a favorable environment for digital asset trading, thereby attracting more participants to the financial market wellspring.Benefits of Not Levying Taxes on Cryptocurrencies presents several benefits for Turkey's Increased Investment even without the burden of profit taxes, both domestic and international investors are more likely to participate in Turkey's financial markets. Market Growth is also an aspect because the absence of such taxes can stimulate trading activity, leading to higher trading volumes and market liquidity. It could be Innovation Encouragement as by creating a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Turkey can position itself as a hub for blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation.Alternative Options: Transaction TaxHowever, to ensure a fair and balanced taxation system, Turkey is considering the implementation of a "very limited" transaction tax. This alternative option would impose a modest levy on the movement of assets, rather than the gains realized from them. Minister Şimşek underscored the government's commitment to ensuring that no area remains untaxed, in pursuit of justice and effectiveness in taxation.The potential transaction tax would apply to the movement of assets rather than the gains realized from them. This could be a balanced solution, allowing the government to collect revenue while maintaining an attractive environment for investors.ConclusionTurkey is preparing itself for competition in the global financial market by removing taxes from profits earned from cryptocurrencies and stocks. The abolishment of the small transaction tax shows that the government has the best interest of all its citizens in its heart by coming up with fair and acceptable tax measures.Indeed, Turkey has remained steadfast on its path to providing the right environment for the regulated growth of this industry as seen by the new bill that requires companies dealing in cryptocurrencies to acquire a license and adhere to international standards.Also Read: Fake Plugin Drains Binance Account Of User, Loses $1 Million

Bitcoin at $71k: Can it climb higher amid a sell signal? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s price surged by more than 4% in the last seven days. 
Indicators suggested that BTC might reach $87k soon.

Bitcoin [BTC] bulls worked hard this week as the king of cryptos’ price surpassed $70k. This sparked excitement in the community, and several expected the coin’s price to rise further. 
However, a sell signal flashed on BTC’s chart, which could have impacted its price. 
Bitcoin holds above $70k
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that BTC gained bullish momentum on the 3rd of June as its value started to rise. The coin’s price spiked by more than 4% in the last seven days. 
At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $71,091.06 with a market capitalization of over $1.4 trillion.
 In the meantime, Ali, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet highlighting a sell signal. This hinted at a price decline. 
However, the signal didn’t have much impact on Bitcoin’s price action as the coin continued to trade above $71k.
 AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that investors didn’t sell BTC either. The coin’s exchange reserve was dropping, signaling high buying pressure.
 Additionally, buying sentiment remained dominant among US investors as BTC’s Coinbase premium was green.

Will BTC continue to rise?
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Glassnode’s data revealed that BTC might continue its bull rally. As per the coin’s Pi Cycle Top indicator, BTC was yet to reach its market top.
 This meant that BTC’s price might continue to rise to $87k before it witnesses any major price correction.
 For starters, the Pi Cycle indicator is composed of the 111-day moving average and a 2x multiple of the 350-day moving average of Bitcoin’s price. 
Source: Glassnode
BTC’s binary CDD was green, meaning that long-term holders’ movements in the last 7 days were lower than average. They have a motive to hold their coins. 
Additionally, its funding rate also increased. This meant that long-position traders are dominant and are willing to pay short-position traders. These metrics suggested that the chances of BTC continuing to rise were high. 
AMBCrypto then analyzed BTC’s daily chart to better understand which direction its price was headed. The technical indicator MACD displayed a bullish crossover.

On top of that, BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained well above the neutral mark, suggesting a further price hike in the coming days. 
However, while the aforementioned indicators supported the bulls, BTC’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) favored the bears. This seemed to be the case, as the indicator registered a downtick in the recent past.

Is Bitcoin Manipulated? Experts Explain 'Small' ETF Inflow Impact


																The US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have been witnessing a historic run of inflows, marking 17 consecutive days of net additions. On a particularly notable Tuesday, these ETFs observed inflows totaling a staggering $886.6 million, ranking it as the second-highest single-day influx since their introduction.
This was followed by another significant day of inflows yesterday, amounting to $488.1 million, with notable contributions from major financial players like Fidelity ($220.6 million), Blackrock ($155.1 million), and Ark ($71.4 million). Despite these hefty capital injections, the price of Bitcoin has demonstrated a relatively subdued response, inching from $68,000 to $71,000 since the beginning of the week.
The muted price movement in the face of substantial ETF inflows has puzzled many market participants and analysts. Typically, such inflows are expected to exert a stronger upward pressure on Bitcoin prices. However, the observed price dynamics suggest that other counteracting factors might be at play.
Why Is The Bitcoin Price Not Going Higher?
Crypto trading analytics platform The Kingfisher offered an explanation via a post on X, suggesting that a carry trade strategy might be influencing the price dynamics. According to their analysis, “The BTC ETF inflows didn’t affect the price as much as you hoped it would? It might be due to a carry trade being loaded up. Short Futures + Buy Spot/ETF.”

	Related Reading


A carry trade in this context involves shorting Bitcoin futures while simultaneously buying spot Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETF shares. This strategy can hedge against potential price volatility and exploit discrepancies between futures prices and spot prices.
JJ the Janitor (@JLabsJanitor) further elaborated on the strategy’s mechanics. He drew parallels with behaviors visualized on the PANDA Terminal charts, explaining, “When big boys want BTC spot filled they sell futures contracts to bring price into bids. When they’re filled + ready to let it rip they close those shorts, hence the inverse correlation on True Open Interest (OI).”
His remarks hint at strategic market manipulations that, while legal, blur the lines between savvy investment tactics and potential ethical concerns. His follow-up tweet, “Market manipulation or savvy investment strategy….what’s the difference?” challenges the narrative by questioning the ethical implications of such strategies.

The discussion prompted further scrutiny from the crypto community. X user Sahra critiqued the practical implementation of the carry trade, noting, “Carry trade should suppress funding rates naturally. Long spot pressure against the perpetual should in theory cause perpetual rates to drop (all else being equal) as perpetual would begin to lag spot. Everything else makes sense, but these rates are far too low to justify a carry IMO.”
This comment points to the complexities of carry trades, where expected outcomes like suppressed funding rates are not aligning with market observations, suggesting that other forces might be influencing the market.
The Kingfisher responded to Sahra’s skepticism, acknowledging the anomaly: “That’s right, the funding remains fairly positive though. This suggests that while a carry trade could be in play, it’s not the dominant force in the market. Other factors, like bullish sentiment or other buying pressures, might be offsetting the expected downward pressure on funding rates from the carry trade.”
At press time, BTC traded at $70,803.

SEC 'exceeded' authority on fee disclosures, US appeals court rules - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            In a blow to the SEC’s claimed authority over the hedge fund sector, a United States appeals court has struck down a rule that required hedge funds and private equity firms to increase transparency regarding their fees and expenses.The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a unanimous decision on June 5, with a three-judge panel ruling that the SEC exceeded its statutory authority in implementing the measure.The court’s ruling came in response to a challenge brought by six industry groups, who argued that the SEC’s 656-page rule would significantly alter the sector’s operations and increase compliance costs. The rule mandated quarterly performance and fee reports, annual audits, and the elimination of preferential treatment for certain investors.Writing on behalf of the panel, Judge Kurt Engelhardt rejected the SEC’s assertion that the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to reform the financial sector, had expanded its authority to oversee private funds. Engelhardt emphasized that the two sections of the Act cited by the SEC did not grant the Commission such authority, stating:
“The promulgation of the Final Rule was unauthorized, no part of it can stand.”
The court’s decision has resonated with critics of the SEC within the crypto industry, who have raised similar concerns about the regulator’s claimed authority in recent years. In a series of lawsuits against crypto firms, the SEC has argued that many cryptocurrencies qualify as securities under its jurisdiction, relying on the Howey test as a legal framework. However, crypto firms have pushed back, asserting that the SEC lacks the authority to regulate crypto without explicit congressional approval.The SEC now faces potential action from Congress that could alter its claimed authority over the US crypto industry. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which would primarily transfer authority over the crypto industry to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, recently passed the House with strong bipartisan support.Additionally, the SEC narrowly avoided a Congressional resolution aimed at repealing its Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, which prevented banks from owning crypto, thanks to a veto by President Joe Biden.

Shiba Inu's Shytoshi Kusama Indicates 'Massive Plans' For The Crypto Project In Response to Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin - Benzinga

Shytoshi Kusama, the mysterious lead developer of Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, hinted at massive plans for the ecosystem while responding to Ethereum ETH/USD creator Vitalik Buterin's skepticism of projects lacking long-term ambitions.What Happened: Buterin took to social platform X to express displeasure with the mushrooming of celebrity memecoins lately. He questioned the motivations behind such cryptocurrency projects, which he believed were just benefiting celebrities and early adopters. He outlined a list of desirable traits in a celebrity cryptocurrency project that would pique his interest. Among them was the project serving some public-good goal like charity, offering some other dynamics apart from just trading the token, and finally, making something that could last for more than 10 years.Shytoshi Kusama concurred with these remarks, stating that the team had similar goals. "Well, almost exactly—we are thinking much bigger than this and on a massive scale. I’ll show this to the team for validation," Kusama emphasizedWhy It Matters: Kusama's claims come following a cryptic post a day before, which hinted at potential partnerships with Middle East policymakers.Last month, he shared a cryptic ‘EVITA' teaser, which was interpreted by many as a hint towards investments in Argentina.Of late, Shiba Inu has taken impressive strides to rise above the narrow memecoin image. Last month, the ecosystem’s decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, was launched on its layer-2 network, Shibarium, marking a significant step in transitioning towards a self-sufficient decentralized system.Price Action: At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.0000257, trading mostly flat in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Over the last month, the memecoin has grown by 3%.Read Next: Ethereum Could Soar To $22K By 2030, Predicts VanEck — Investment Giant Says Spot ETFs ‘Nearing Approval To Trade’

VanEck: previsione molto positiva sul prezzo di Ethereum

Yesterday VanEck published a very positive forecast on the price of Ethereum.
In fact, they have declared that they have increased the target for 2030 to $22,000, thanks in particular to the news about the ETF on ETH spot, the progress in terms of scaling, and the on-chain data. 


VanEck: The forecast of the price of Ethereum
The current price of ETH is around $3,800, and in fact, it has been oscillating around this level for about three months.
In the last three months, that is after the rise in February that took it from $2,300 to $4,000, it has been above the current level only at the beginning of March, while from mid-March to mid-May it had dropped to $2,800.
The year, however, had started right at the 2,300$ mark, so for now 2024 is to be considered a broadly positive year. 
Despite this, the all-time high of 2021 is still far away, because it was recorded near $4,900, so at this moment the target for the current cycle seems to be $5,000, in the medium term. 
However, it should not be forgotten that before the last great bullrun, that is in October 2020, its price was only $400, so the current price is already practically ten times higher. Furthermore, the peak of the previous cycle, recorded in January 2018, was below $1,500, that is less than half of the current levels. 
All this has allowed some analysts to project the price of ETH even to $10,000 during the current cycle, and this makes VanEck’s forecast less daring than it might appear at first glance. 
The forecast of VanEck on the price of Ethereum
The long analysis on the price of Ethereum shared by VanEck aims not only to hypothesize how the price of ETH might evolve over the next six years, but also and above all to identify the optimal portfolio allocation of investments in this cryptocurrency. 
The analysis was conducted by Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research, Patrick Bush, senior investment analyst in digital assets, and Denis Zinoviev, associate product manager.
The starting point is precisely the spot ETH ETFs, which should be nearing completion at the beginning of July.
This would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold ETH with the security of qualified custodians, and to benefit from the characteristic advantages of ETFs in terms of price and liquidity without having to worry about the custody of the tokens. 
The second key point is the consideration that the Ethereum network will likely continue its rapid growth, particularly with regard to its market share compared to traditional financial market participants and Big Tech.
They even hypothesize that it could attract 66 billion dollars, which consequently should bring its market capitalization by 2030 to 2,200 billion dollars, compared to the current 460, and therefore to an ETH price of 22,000$. 
It is worth noting that at this moment Bitcoin capitalizes about 1.400 billion, and the entire crypto market does not exceed 2.800. 
This is therefore a very optimistic forecast, but it does not refer to the current cycle. 
The cycles of the crypto markets
The crypto markets follow a cycle of about 4 years dictated by the cycle of Bitcoin halving.
Ethereum was born in 2015, during the second cycle of Bitcoin and a little over a year before the second halving of BTC.
What happened in April of this year is only the third halving of BTC experienced by Ethereum, moreover with the first one experienced just over a year after its launch. 
So the first complete four-year cycle for Ethereum was the one that started in 2016 and ended in 2020, and it was precisely within that cycle that it recorded the all-time high at 1,500$ in January 2018. 
Therefore, the almost $4,900 reached in 2021 is the all-time high only of the second complete cycle of the crypto markets experienced by Ethereum. 
Furthermore, between the all-time high of the first complete cycle and that of the second, the price of ETH has marked a x3.2, and this seems to theoretically justify a rise even above $10,000 in this third complete cycle. 
At this point, the prediction of $22,000 as the maximum price for the fourth complete cycle of the crypto markets experienced by Ethereum does not seem so far-fetched, while still remaining decidedly very optimistic. 
The allocation in portfolio
In light of all these considerations, the extensive analysis by VanEck suggests that adding a modest allocation of cryptocurrencies (up to 6%) to a traditional 60/40 portfolio could substantially improve the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio, with a relatively lower impact on the drawdown. 
Within this allocation of crypto to a maximum of 6% of the 60/40 portfolio, they state that 
The allocation that provided the best risk-adjusted returns is 70% BTC and 30% ETH.
It should be noted that the hypothesis of allocating up to 6% in crypto is explicitly given as a probably good hypothesis, while the 70/30 split refers only to past performance. This seems to suggest that the crypto markets could change their general trend in the coming years. 
The analysts at VanEck also add that investors should still consider their personal risk tolerance before making similar decisions, because crypto remains a high-risk investment. 
However, I do not hide that it is precisely the data that suggests that a balanced inclusion of BTC and ETH within investment portfolios can offer enormous advantages in terms of improving returns compared to the incremental risk introduced. 
It is however necessary to highlight both that VanEck has in its portfolio both BTC and ETH, as explicitly stated at the beginning of the analysis, and that it promotes some of its derivative investment products on crypto such as ETFs.

Ethereum: The Next Digital Gold? Inside VanEck's Bullish Thesis


							

VanEck analysts predict ETH would reach $22K by 2030.



Ethereum’s potential to shake up finance and tech drives VanEck’s bullish forecast.



Spot Ether ETFs could open doors for widespread investor access.




Analysts at prominent investment firm VanEck have updated their 2030 price prediction for Ethereum (ETH), setting a new target of $22,000.



The report attributes the updated forecast to a reevaluation of Ethereum’s fundamental investment case, incorporating updated financial models and quantitative analyses on ETH’s interaction with Bitcoin in various portfolios.



Authors Matthew Sigel, Patrick Bush, and Denis Zinoviev highlight growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential, driven by its strong value proposition to entrepreneurs and its potential to disrupt traditional financial markets and Big Tech.



The potential approval of spot Ether ETFs is one factor contributing to VanEck’s bullish outlook. The firm is among several on Wall Street applying to list such ETFs, following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. The SEC approved the 19b-4 filings for spot ether ETFs last month. 



While the approval of S-1 filings is still pending, the potential listing of spot Ether ETFs could further increase accessibility and demand for ETH.



The VanEck analysts believe that spot ether ETFs could provide a significant boost to Ethereum adoption, stating:




“This development would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold this unique asset with the security of qualified custodians and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs.”




The analysts envision a scenario where Ethereum continues to dominate the smart contract platform space, driven by its cost-efficiency, open-source nature, and potential to disrupt traditional industries and Big Tech.









This growth could lead to significant free cash flow for token holders, resulting in a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion, or $22,000 per coin, by 2030. However, the report also acknowledges the risks associated with this projection, including regulatory uncertainties, competition, and the evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market.

Meme Coins in Retreat as Bitcoin (BTC) Struggles to Maintain $71K (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price rise was stopped at just under $72,000 despite the impressive ETF inflows yesterday, and the asset has retraced by around a grand since then.
Most altcoins are also slightly in the red today following yesterday’s substantial gains, but BNB is still above $700, while LINK has dropped by 3%.
BTC Struggles at $71K
Bitcoin had a quiet weekend in which its price stood primarily around $67,500 after recovering from the late Friday dip to $66,600. However, Monday was a lot more eventful and positive for the bulls as the asset jumped by roughly three grand and briefly exceeded the coveted $70,000 mark.
Another minor retracement followed in which the cryptocurrency slipped to $68,700, but the bulls went back on the offensive on Wednesday.
This culminated in a price surge to a 15-day peak of $71,767. Thus, the primary digital asset came less than 3% away from its all-time high registered in mid-March. These gains came amid another day of massive inflows entering the US spot Bitcoin ETFs.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Nevertheless, they weren’t enough to maintain BTC’s run and the cryptocurrency has retraced by around a grand and now stands just below $71,000. Its market cap has slipped below $1.4 trillion and its dominance over the alts is at 50.3% on CG.

Meme Coins in Retreat
After the massive gains registered yesterday, most larger-cap alts have turned red today. This is the case with BNB, SOL, XRP, DOGE, TON, ADA, SHIB, and DOT, but their daily retraces are quite negligible compared to their increases yesterday.
LINK and UNI have dropped slightly more (3% and 4.5%, respectively), but the former is still above $17, while the latter is north of $10.
Some of the most popular meme coins have shed more value. For instance, WIF is down by 6%, FLOKI by 5%< and BONK has dropped by 4.5%.
The total crypto market cap is down by $30 billion since yesterday’s peak but it is still close to $2.8 trillion.

Bitcoin Bull Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital Tokenizes $9M Antique Stradivarius Violin Into NFT For Loan Collateral - Benzinga

Cryptocurrency investment firm Galaxy Digital announced the tokenization of a nearly 300-year-old vintage violin once owned by Russian royalty. The instrument will be used as collateral to back a loan.What Happened: The firm owned by crypto billionaire and Bitcoin BTC/USD bull Michael Novogratz, minted a non-fungible token of "Empress Caterina," an 18th-century Stradivarius violin, valued at roughly $9 million, according to a press release.The NFT was created exclusively for the financing transaction between Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu and Galaxy. Siu purchased the iconic instrument in 2023. The NFT was created on the Ethereum ETH/USD blockchain, and featured on the NFT marketplace OpenSea. Galaxy made it clear that NFT will not be available in the secondary market.Why It Matters: Tokenization of real-world assets is emerging as one of the hottest narratives in Web3. As part of this, off-chain assets like bonds, real estate, commodities, and art can be brought on blockchain rails, unlocking a new set of use cases for both traditional and decentralized finance.In the aforementioned case, the tokenization created an economic value of the precious asset without selling it. At the same time, it helped preserve the legacy by immortalizing it in the form of an NFT.As of this writing, the real-world tokenization industry has more than $4 billion in investments, according to DeFiLlama. Read Next: Shiba Inu’s Shytoshi Kusama Indicates ‘Massive Plans’ For The Crypto Project In Response to Ethereum Creator Vitalik ButerinPhoto via ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Meme Coin Madness: This Trending Coin Explodes to New ATH Following Listing on KuCoin


																TL;DR

One recently-emerged frog-themed meme coin hit a new all-time high of $0.14, with a market capitalization briefly surpassing $1.4 billion.
Meme coins are seeing significant interest, pushing the overall market cap of the sector to almost $70 billion. However, their high volatility poses substantial risk to traders.


The Latest Rally
While the prices of most cryptocurrencies have either consolidated or slightly retraced in the past 24 hours, some assets continue recording substantial increases. One example is the frog-themed meme coin Brett (BRETT), which reached a new all-time high of over $0.14 (per CoinGecko’s data). Its market capitalization briefly surpassed the $1.4 billion mark before settling at its current level of $1.35 billion.

BRETT Price, Source: CoinGecko
The asset’s impressive spike coincided with KuCoin’s decision to introduce the BRETT/USDT trading pair. Additionally, the company offered a 1,200,000 BRETT giveaway to celebrate the initiative. Users will receive a certain amount of tokens as rewards for each invitee they bring on.
Other leading cryptocurrency exchanges that previously allowed services with the asset include Bitget, BitMart, Gate.io, and more. 
Crypto X is full of users envisioning that BRETT’s bull run is nowhere near its end. The cryptocurrency investor using the handle STASHER highlighted the asset’s performance, predicting a further increase to $0.20 “before actually retracing.”




“This looks like THE lower risk memecoin investment that genuinely is giving me DOGE, SHIBA, and PEPE vibes,” the analyst added.
Andrew Kang chipped in, too, claiming that BRETT “is showing strength, and it feels like the magnet to $0.20 is sooner rather than later.”
Last week, Crypto Rover – an X user with over 700,000 followers – revealed he has exposure to the asset, saying its price pump has resulted in substantial profits for him (at least on paper).
The Overall Meme Coin Mania
BRETT is not the only meme coin taking center stage as of late. The realm’s market capitalization nears the $70 billion mark, with Pepe (PEPE), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and many PolitiFi tokens witnessing impressive spikes.
Despite offering traders the chance of making substantial profits in a short period of time, dealing with meme coins can also lead to appalling losses due to the infamous volatility of the asset class.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Resurgence, Binance Coin (BNB) Hits a New ATH, and Meme Coins Fiesta: Bits Recap June 6


																TL;DR

Bitcoin surged to $71,700 amid record inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs.
BNB hit an all-time high of $710, surpassing major companies’ market caps, with forecasts suggesting it could reach $1,000.
Floki Inu’s market capitalization peaked at over $3.2 billion before a slight retracement.


BTC Headed North Again
The price of the primary cryptocurrency has been on an uptrend in the past few days, rising to as high as $71,700 on June 5. Currently, it hovers the $71,000 mark (per CoinGecko’s data), representing an 11% increase on a monthly scale.
The resurgence coincided with record figures related to spot Bitcoin ETFs in the USA. Those products witnessed a total inflow of almost $900 million yesterday, the second-best day since their approval in January. 
Numerous analysts believe BTC could soar even higher in the near future, assuming certain factors are in place. The X user, Captain Faibik, predicted a rise above $90,000 should the asset surpass the “crucial resistance level” of $71,300.
On the other hand, Ali Martinez assumed that a pullback is not out of the cards based on the TD sequential, which presents a sell signal on the four-hour chart. This technical analysis tool identifies potential price exhaustion points in the market and indicates when a trend is likely to reverse. 




Still, the X user thinks a fresh uptrend could eventually follow the potential setback.
BNB’s Success
The native token of Binance—BNB—has been making the headlines recently. Its price exploded to an ATH of $710 on June 5, while its market capitalization touched the $110 billion mark. Thus, BNB surpassed well-known companies such as Airbnb, Starbucks, UBS, and more.
The new peak was met with huge enthusiasm in the crypto community, with many industry participants envisioning a further rally. 
The X users Bluntz and Sheldon The Sniper forecasted a surge toward the $1,000 milestone, while BATMAN revealed that BNB is part of their portfolio. The trader admitted hopping on the bandwagon in 2017 when a single token was worth a mere $0.60.
“Close to 1200x makes it one of my top performers, only being beaten by my RUNE call,” the analyst stated.
FLOKI’s Progress
Another cryptocurrency that recently reached a new peak price is the dog-themed meme coin – Floki Inu (FLOKI). Its market capitalization briefly exceeded the $3.2 billion mark for the first time ever, thus flipping popular altcoins, including Monero (XMR), Arbitrum (ARB), Cronos (CRO), and more.
In the following hours, though, FLOKI’s value slightly retraced, with its market cap plunging below $3 billion. Currently, the token is the 46th biggest cryptocurrency and the fifth-largest in its cohort.

Ripple’s chief technology officer (CTO), David Schwartz, known on the X social media platform (formerly Twitter) as @JoelKatz, has published a tweet to warn the XRP army against falling for a new phishing scam he has encountered on Elon Musk’s X network.Ripple CTO's scam warningDavid Schwartz shared a tweet of X user @3YearLetterman, which contains a screenshot of a direct message he had received on X recently. Schwartz commented, explaining to the XRP community that should anyone receive a DM like this, “it is fake.”The author of the message claims that he/she belongs to the X support team, and they inform the recipient that his/her account is currently “under investigation for copyright violations.” The message requires that the recipient should provide feedback on this accusation within 24 hours. To do that, he/she is required to follow a link provided in the message to complete a form. Failure to do that within the specified period of time would cause the suspension of the X account. According to the screenshot, the sender has more than 210,000 followers and joined X in December 2010 (long before Twitter was acquired by Elon Musk and rebranded as X).Schwartz warned his followers not to follow that link if they receive a similar message. He explained that the link goes to a phishing site, and users will have their X login and personal information collected there."Absolute proof I am not Satoshi": Ripple CTOApproximately a week ago, high-ranking Ripple executive Schwartz published a post to once again refute the rumor about him being the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. The company’s CTO often has to dispel such allegations, but many within the crypto community still seem to be certain that it was Schwartz who blessed the world by creating the very first cryptocurrency.Back on that day, Schwartz published a selfie from the Consensus2024 event that showed himself and a guy wearing a glittering mask of a golden hue and a hood, hinting that this person preferred to stay anonymous - similar to Satoshi Nakamoto. “Finally, absolute proof I am not Satoshi,” Schwartz wrote.Prior to that, Schwartz tweeted that the idea of him being Satoshi was “not true but plausible.”

Cardano's Under-the-Radar Tech: What the Media Isn't Telling You


							

Cardano founder blasts crypto media for the “pathetic” negativity towards Cardano.



Hoskinson highlighted key developments set to occur in the upcoming six months.



Community builder points the media to Cardano newsletter for latest updates.




Cardano (ADA) founder, Charles Hoskinson, posted on X, expressing his disdain for a few in the crypto media, highlighting the “profound disconnect between reality and opinion with the cryptocurrency influencer and media perception of Cardano versus its actual fundamentals.”







Hoskinson pointed out that the Cardano blockchain is rapidly evolving, with several developments in progress. The upcoming hard fork is a new beginning for the blockchain that introduces substantial upgrades. The fork is to be implemented in two phases: Chang Upgrade Number One and Chang Upgrade Number Two. 



Hoskinson said that there has been remarkable growth in the community of dApps on Cardano, and the blockchain is even leading the industry in R&D scaling. He also added that a lot of good things are happening on the blockchain, listing technologies like Hydra, partner chains, Midnight, and Prism, as well as community events, Catalyst, and the constitutional convention in Argentina.









The IOHK founder also highlighted several events that would be huge within Cardano, including Rare Evo, a blockchain convention; Cardano summit, a global blockchain event; and Token 2049, another major event. Hoskinson concluded by stating:




“It’s beyond pathetic and just reflects on the low quality and low effort they put into our ecosystem.  Cardano is here to stay, and it’s a juggernaut that will drag this industry kicking and screaming if it has to towards solving the real-world economic, political, and social issues we all face.”




Hoskinson urged crypto media to rather focus on the following Cardano events:




Major blockchain upgrade: Significant hard fork to enhance features and capabilities.



Booming dApp ecosystem: Rapid growth of decentralized applications on Cardano.



Scaling Innovation: Leading R&D in blockchain scalability.



High-profile events: Participation in Rare Evo, Cardano Summit, and Token 2049.



Hydra scaling solution: Maturing technology to significantly boost transaction speed.



Community-driven initiatives: Events, catalyst projects that focus on real-world impact.




Hoskinson expressed his disappointment within parts of the crypto media, stating that he sees a focus on headlines like “Will Cardano die?” while overlooking the numerous positive developments and blockchain advancements that are due in coming months.

Dora Factory announces gas fee airdrop for Cosmos stakers


    Dora Factory, a decentralized governance technology and public goods funding platform, has announced a new gas fee airdrop of its native token, DORA, to all Cosmos (ATOM) stakers, according to the info disclosed to Finbold on June 6. 



Expected to mobilize over one million eligible addresses, the initiative is set to jumpstart the largest Minimum Anti Collusion Infrastructure (MACI) voting round in history.



Empowering the Cosmos Hub ecosystem



On June 5, ATOM stakers across the Cosmos Hub received DORA tokens, which marked a significant milestone, as the DORA token underpins Dora Vota, a decentralized governance application chain developed with the Cosmos source development kit (SDK). 







However, the new airdrop is not just a distribution of tokens — it’s a call to action for the Cosmos community. 



Known for its commitment to decentralized governance, Cosmos invites the community to partake in a democratic experiment focused on public goods funding. 



Participants can use ATOM to vote for and donate to public goods projects, support early-stage developers, and influence the distribution of an 80,000 ATOM and $200,000 USD Coin (USDC) matching pool across ten rounds of AEZ Quadratic Funding and MACI voting. 



Advancing democratic governance



The campaign is also an experiment aimed at harnessing community power to support public goods and promising nascent developers. 



The quadratic funding mechanism ensures that even small contributions from community members have a significant impact, promoting a more equal distribution of resources.



MACI privacy voting



Dora Factory is introducing MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) privacy voting, enhancing the security and anonymity of voters. 



This allows community members to express their opinions on public goods without revealing their identities. 



Those with more ATOM staked will have more voting power, or Voice Credits. 



A $20,000 USDC prize pool will be awarded to selected teams through this privacy-preserving voting process.



To facilitate widespread participation, Dora Factory will implement Dora Vota’s native Gas Station feature to cover all voting fees for the MACI voting round.

US Investment Firm Declares 'War Against Bitcoin Miners'


								Kerrisdale Capital, a US investment firm, set off a storm of reactions on Wednesday with a series of public communications aggressively targeting Bitcoin mining companies. In a multi-part thread on X, Kerrisdale announced its campaign against what it describes as “snake oil salesmen” in the BTC mining industry, accusing them of being both a financial sinkhole and an environmental hazard.
“Today, we launch a war against Bitcoin miners, an industry of snake oil salesmen that are incinerating both investor capital and the environment and should be banished from America much like the Chinese RTO frauds that we helped kick out a decade ago,” the firm declared.
Kerrisdale also revealed it had begun by sending letters to officials in Texas, including the Navarro City Commission and state senators, outlining their grievances and calling for regulatory action. Additionally, the firm disclosed its financial position, stating, “We’re short RIOT (and long Bitcoin as a hedge).”
Kerrisdale’s critique centers on the business model of RIOT Blockchain, which it argues is inherently flawed: “Like other US listed miners, RIOT’s biz model is a dysfunctional hamster wheel of cash burn, which is why it loots retail shareholders with non-stop ATM issuance to fund operations.” They pointed out that despite BTC’s high market prices, RIOT’s post-halving operations have not been profitable.

Further financial analysis from Kerrisdale highlighted that RIOT has issued $2.3 billion in stock since 2020, which has led to a sixfold increase in shares outstanding to fund $1.6 billion in cash burn. According to Kerrisdale, this has not corresponded with an increase in Bitcoin production per share or BTC holdings per share, leading them to conclude that the only benefit to shareholders would come from rising Bitcoin prices—a strategy they deemed insufficient for investment.
On the environmental front, Kerrisdale criticized Bitcoin mining for its heavy energy use and reliance on incentives that may not align with broader environmental goals. “RIOT’s economics would look even worse without generous grid incentives and tax credits,” the firm argued, noting that such benefits are being questioned by regulators and might not persist.
The Bitcoin Mining Industry And Experts Responds
The industry response was quick, with several prominent figures defending the sector and attacking Kerrisdale’s motives and understanding of the space. Daniel Batten, founder of CH4 Capital and advisory board member at Bitcoin mining giant Marathon, suggested Kerrisdale should focus more on enhancing investor returns rather than attacking industry practices.


Adam O of Upstream Data defended Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact, stating, “Good luck vilifying that which improves all stakeholders, reduces waste, and reduces methane emissions. Dumbest mission of the decade.” Steven Lubka, Head of Private Clients & Family Offices at Swan Bitcoin, criticized Kerrisdale’s strategy and pointed to the failing MicroStrategy (MSTR) short position which they entered two months ago as well as their declining assets under management as a sign of deeper issues within the firm itself.

“Let’s take a look at these absolute losers crying for the government to rescue their MSTR short by FUD’ing mining. […] Now let’s take a look at their AUM. $318m as of this quarter, let’s see where they were a few years ago? $1.3 billion. That’s a big drop in their total AUM/invested amount. In conclusion, they are trying to save their fund because they know MSTR is about to rip higher by appealing to the government.”
The debate also extended to the environmental merits of Bitcoin mining. Simon Dixon, an angel investor, presented facts debunking the myth that Bitcoin mining is predominantly harmful to the environment. He highlighted the role of Bitcoin mining in methane emission mitigation and its synergies with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, as well as the ability to help balance the grid.


Mark Harvey, a Bitcoin educator, just stated, “You will make a higher ROI + more friends by just buying and holding Bitcoin.”
At press time, BTC traded at $70,820.

Bitcoin's Price Surge Fuels Speculation of New Bull Market


							

Bitcoin surged past $71k on Wednesday, awakening the crypto market.



Total 3’s setup suggests altcoins are preparing for a surge, in line with the emerging bull run.



Many altcoins started rallying, with BNB reaching a new ATH at $716.2.




Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $71,700 on Wednesday, and Crypto Banter presenter Sheldon the Sniper believes the crypto market is reawakening with vigor. In a video, Sheldon emphasized how Bitcoin’s price movement triggered a short squeeze across altcoins, leading to strong market performance for many.



The crypto analyst showcased the “Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum (Total 3)” in his analysis, revealing the metric’s potential upward trajectory. Traders use Total 3 chart to gauge altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin, providing insights into investor sentiment and capital flows between BTC and altcoins.



 
 




With Bitcoin nearing its All-Time High (ATH), Sheldon asserted that it would soon enter the “optimism stage,” where the flagship crypto could experience parabolic moves. He compared BTC’s recent price action to the last bull cycle, suggesting a similar scenario could unfold. He encouraged traders/investors to prepare their portfolios for a potential bull run.



Having confirmed Bitcoin’s bullish setup, Sheldon noted that altcoins were poised to follow suit. He cited decreasing Bitcoin dominance and the already-rallying Total 3 as key indicators of an impending altcoin rally.



Meanwhile, many altcoins have already begun displaying bullish signals, as Sheldon demonstrated using the “banter bubbles.” Altcoins like UNI, ORDI, and FLOKI have posted impressive gains. The analyst highlighted Solana’s performance, noting how its token, SOL, has begun to surge. However, he attributed SOL’s rally to the influence of Solana-based tokens, advising those interested to monitor them closely.

Altcoins: Analyzing Key Signs For A Potential Boom - Or Bust


																Altcoins are generating significant buzz among cryptocurrency watchers, as rumors of a potential Bitcoin breakout circulate. After weeks of sluggish trading, a recent surge of capital has revitalized the king of coins. This raises a pressing question: will altcoins ride the wave, or are they doomed to be left behind?

	Related Reading


Whispers Of A Bitcoin Bonanza
Data from Farside Investors reveals a significant shift in investor sentiment. Nearly $890 million flowed into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on June 4th, a clear sign of renewed interest. This surge in buying could act as a catalyst, sparking a wave of speculation and propelling Bitcoin prices upwards.
However, the question remains: how will this newfound focus on Bitcoin impact the broader cryptocurrency market? Historically, strong Bitcoin rallies have often been followed by altcoin seasons, periods where alternative cryptocurrencies experience explosive growth. But is this time different?
Altcoin Season: Just Over The Horizon?
The Altcoin Season Index, a metric that gauges market sentiment towards altcoins, currently sits at a lowly 35. This stands in stark contrast to the readings of 80 observed just six months ago. This suggests that altcoins are not yet basking in the reflected glory of Bitcoin’s potential rise.
Source: BlockchainCentre
Experts believe that even with a Bitcoin surge, only a select few altcoins are likely to outperform the market leader. To truly unleash an altcoin season, the Altcoin Season Index would need to climb above 75, a sign of widespread bullishness across the entire altcoin ecosystem.
Why Altcoins Might Struggle To Shine
The sheer number of altcoins compared to previous cycles also throws a wrench into the altcoin season equation. In 2017 and 2021, for instance, the altcoin market was a much smaller pond. When Bitcoin surged, investor money flowed more readily into a smaller pool of altcoins, leading to significant price increases across the board.
As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com
Today, the landscape is vastly different. With thousands of altcoins vying for investor attention, any gains during an altcoin season might be concentrated in just a handful of high-performing projects, leaving the vast majority behind.
Bitcoin Dominance: A Key Indicator To Watch
Another crucial factor to consider is Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). This metric reflects Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. Historically, a significant decline in BTC.D has coincided with altcoin seasons. In early 2021, for example, the coin’s dominance level plummeted from 70% to 40%, paving the way for a period of explosive altcoin growth.

	Related Reading


Currently, however, BTC.D is on the rise, suggesting that altcoins are not yet the center of attention. Investors looking for altcoin opportunities should keep a close eye on this metric, as a sustained downtrend in the crypto’s dominance could be a harbinger of an approaching altcoin season.

Vitalik Buterin's 3 Pillars for Legitimate Celebrity-Backed Tokens


							

Vitalik Buterin proposes 3 standards for “respectable” celebrity crypto projects.



Projects should prioritize social good and offer interactive features. 



Long-term sustainability is key, not short-term gains.




Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain platform, advocates for greater responsibility in celebrity-backed cryptocurrency ventures. In a tweet, Buterin outlined three key features he believes such projects should possess to be considered “respectable.”







Firstly, Buterin emphasizes the importance of a commitment to a “public good goal.” This means the project should prioritize a charitable or social cause it supports, aiming for a positive impact beyond simply enriching the celebrity and early investors.



Secondly, he proposes “engaging mechanics.” Going beyond just trading a token, the project should offer interactive features. Buterin cites token-based DAOs as an option, though with reservations. DAOs allow communities to govern in a decentralized manner through token ownership.



Finally, Buterin stresses on the importance of “sustainability.” Celebrity crypto projects shouldn’t be short-lived fads. He urges them to be designed for long-term viability, something participants would value even if the token’s value depreciates.









Buterin’s comments come amidst a surge in celebrity involvement with cryptocurrencies. While some ventures aim for social good, others raise concerns about potential profiteering and a lack of long-term vision.



In closing, he alluded to a blog post he’d written a decade ago, published before Ethereum’s launch, which discussed using token issuance to fund important public causes. This suggests he sees a strong link between responsible crypto and positive social impact.

Mantle price outlook: Here’s why MNT is soaring - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Mantle price rose 6% to above $1.04, with gains coming as Bitcoin (BTC) retested the $71k level.
MNT price had struggled to break out of a tight range.
Network developments and the overall crypto market outlook could help MNT price higher.

Mantle (MNT) price currently changes hands around $1.04 after jumping more than 6% in the past 24 hours alongside Bitcoin’s spike to above $71,000. 
The cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume is up 110% to over $13o million in this period as Mantle trends among the best performers in the top 100 coins by market cap.
MNT price surges amid crypto bounce
Today’s gains for MNT price came as Bitcoin price surge to above $71k, with bulls taking advantage as spot BTC ETFs recorded an 11th consecutive trading day of net inflows.
Analysts are bullish on BTC, and projections for ETH amid spot Ethereum ETF approval could also contribute to MNT price going up.
Notably, MNT surged more than 40% in March, breaking above $1 as bullish momentum eventually pushed the token’s value to an all-time high above $1.50 in April.
While MNT benefitted from listing on South Korea’s largest crypto exchange Upbit, the parabolic rise that catapulted BTC to its ATH may also have fueled the upswing. The project’s introduction of the Mantle Rewards Station also added to the positive sentiment.
Mantle price – are bulls ready to run?
While MNT price has struggled since dipping below $1.40 in mid-April, it’s likely a new push in the SocialFi and gaming dApps space has Mantle poised for a fresh rally.
Mantle recently revealed it had deployed a $5 million ecosystem fund to support projects such as MetaCene, Blade Games, Co-Museum and Fingerlabs. The initiative has boosted the network’s protocols across lending, liquid staking, DEX, yield and RWA.
Data from DeFiLlama indicates the Total Value Locked (TVL) across these projects has nearly doubled in the past month. Per the details, Mantle TVL currently stands at around $463 million, up from approximately $252 million in early May.

MNT price on the daily chart is within a key range marked by the Bollinger bands. If bulls break higher, a decisive move above $1.10 may allow for a retest of the resistance line at $1.26.
The RSI and MACD indicators, however, suggest bears are not completely out of the picture. Primary support levels in case of a downward flip would include $0.94 and $0.78.

Memecoin That’s Exploded Over 1,000% in Four Months Set To Skyrocket by Over 3x, According to Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst believes that one red-hot Dogecoin (DOGE) rival is gearing up for more massive gains.
Pseudonymous trader Kaleo tells his 641,600 followers on the social media platform X that Floki (FLOKI)’s market cap could soar to at least $10 billion, more than 3x the current value.










The analyst says Floki could head much after forming a cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish technical indicator.
“Don’t need a fancy chart here. Just look at FLOKI zoomed out. 

Retesting its 2021 all-time high. 
Clean high time frame cup and handle. 
BNB is on the verge of price discovery. 
Memecoin super cycle. 

This sends to $10 billion plus on the next leg up easily.”
Source: Kaleo/X
The analyst compares Floki’s current price pattern to another red-hot memecoin, Pepe (PEPE), before its sudden rise.
He also believes that Floki is benefiting from being based on Binance’s BNB Chain while BNB, the native token of the BNB Chain, is in an uptrend.
“Low timeframe FLOKI does look a lot like PEPE did before its last move higher. It has a similar narrative as well: PEPE being a high ETH beta meme play, FLOKI being a high BNB beta meme play.”
Floki, with a current market cap of $3.1 billion, is trading for $0.0003182 at time of writing, up more than 1,000% since trading for $0.0000269 four months ago on February 5th.

Exploring the Cosmos Network and the Recent Outage

On June 5, the Cosmos Hub blockchain network experienced an outage lasting around four hours due to a bug discovered during the implementation of the v17 upgrade.The Cosmos team stated that the bug was a Liquid Staking Module (LSM) security vulnerability. While developers swiftly identified and resolved the bug, block production on the network did not resume until most validators had implemented the patch. It stated:“The teams at Informalinc and HyphaDoesCosmos have issued a fix for the bug that was found. We’re currently at 55% of validators who have implemented the patch. We encourage any remaining validators who have not yet implemented the patch to do so.”According to information on the firm’s official X handle, the network began producing blocks at around 12:30 A.M. GMT. The firm also mentioned that its developers would release a detailed post-mortem report.Ethan Buchman, the co-founder of Cosmos, explained that downtime for the “Hub is rare, but it happens.” He added:“Bugs will happen. Chains will go down. Chains will come back up. Important thing is to have dedicated devs and validators working to fix issues when they arise.”The Cosmos Hub aims to create thousands of interconnected blockchains within the Cosmos Network. It operates on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, enabling participants to stake their ATOM coins and earn rewards.Interestingly, the network issues had little impact on the ATOM token, which remained stable at $8.65 as of press time, up 0.67%.v17 upgradeThe v17 upgrade was one of the most anticipated updates within the Cosmos ecosystem recently. According to data from Mintscan, over 136 million ATOM tokens, equivalent to 99.8% of the total votes, supported it.The upgrade introduces features from the “partial set security” proposal to the Cosmos ecosystem. Blockhunters, a web3 staking infrastructure provider, stated:“This feature allows new consumer chains to customize validator participation and set various operational parameters, such as voting power caps and opt-in choices for validators.”Moreover, Buchman also described the upgrade as “the biggest in at least a year,” adding that it brings “the long-awaited ICS2.0.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Economist Expecting $350,000 in Bitcoin Announces the Two Altcoins He Bought! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Robert Kiyosaki, an economist and author of the book “Rich Dad Poor Dad”, who has been advising people to buy Bitcoin for a long time, explained his expectations for two major cryptocurrencies other than BTC while maintaining his bullish stance on the BTC price.
At this point, Kiyosaki, who shared from his account


Stating that he also bought Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) besides Bitcoin, the famous name said that he believes that BTC, ETH and SOL will continue their rise.
Stating that the US economy will get worse due to the administration, Kiyosaki thinks that alternative assets such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will protect investors from this situation.





Finally, criticizing US President Joe Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and FED President Jerome Powell, Kiyosaki said:

“It's no lie that Bitcoin will be $350,000 by August 25, 2024. This is a prediction.
I'm sure Bitcoin will reach $350,000 in 2024, but that's just a target.
I continue to buy more Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana because I'm pretty sure their prices will continue to rise.
Why am I so sure? Because I'm sure about BTC, Ethereum and Solana? My answer is no.
What I trust is the incompetence of our leaders, President Biden, Treasury Secretary Yellin, and Fed Chairman Powell. These three are the real-life Stooges and I'm sure I have a lot of confidence in their incompetence. Be careful. Buy more Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, Solana and Ethereum.”

Bahamut Foundation X AMA Session With BeInCrypto


The Bahamut Foundation‘s Blockchain Program Lead, Pavel Aramyan, recently joined BeInCrypto for an exciting AMA session. Aramyan provided an in-depth look into the Bahamut.io project, a groundbreaking Layer 1, permissionless blockchain that forks from Ethereum v2.0 and employs a novel Proof of Stake and Activity (PoSA) consensus. 
This innovative approach rewards validators who actively deploy and engage with smart contracts, enhancing network participation and security. 
Aramyan also highlighted successful DeFi projects launched on Bahamut, including Lolik, Mutuari, and Silkswap, and discussed the foundation’s grants, community meetups, and educational initiatives to foster a knowledgeable and active blockchain community.
AMA Session With Pavel Aramyan of Bahamut Foundation
BeInCrypto: Today we welcome the Blockchain Program Lead at Bahamut Foundation — Pavel Aramyan 🙌
🗣 COMMUNITY
As usual, I’ll have some questions for Pavel. After that, he will answer 5 questions from our members previously chosen 💁🏻‍♀️
Pavel Aramyan: Happy to meet you, everybody! thanks for hosting me today @cryptosoka
BIC: Ok, Pavel, let’s start our AMA with this point: Can you please provide an overview of the Bahamit.io project and its mission in the blockchain space? 👀
Pavel Aramyan: Gladly. So Bahamut is a layer 1, permissionless, public blockchain. It’s a fork of Ethereum v2.0 and utilizes a new consensus called PoSA (Proof of Stake and Activity). The core idea of PoSA is to further reward validators that have active smart contracts on-chain – active as in Gas is being spent to interact with these smart contracts. The more the activity, the higher the chance to be elected as a block producer, and thus, the more rewards can be earned from the network.
BIC: 😯😯😯Could you tell us more about the DeFi projects that were successfully launched on the Bahamut blockchain?
Pavel Aramyan:
Recently, Lolik – liquid staking, Mutuari – lending, and Silkswap – decentralized exchange prototypes have been launched in Bahamut. Lolik is currently boasting close to 15 million staked FTN, which is about $30 million in just a few months of operations. Mutuari is a decentralized lending protocol that allows to stake collateral assets and borrow others – most commonly stable coins like USDT and USDC. Silkswap, as a DEX, makes it easy to navigate between different tokens on-chain and swap one to the other at any point in time.
BIC: And how do the Bahamut Foundation’s grants support new participants? What do you look for in projects applying for these grants?
Pavel Aramyan: So the foundation offers its support in marketing, advice, and of course, FTNs. As a rule of thumb, all projects are welcome to apply regardless of their sphere as the Foundation looks through each single application. Applicants are requested to fill-in some initial/general information and upload a pitch deck of their product/service, and after review, if the initial stage is passed, a video call is organized to get a feel of the team’s experience, review the demo (if available) and to clear further possible questions. At the final stage, the applicants can be accepted as grant-ies, and the distribution is usually split into milestones or paid in full after the product is delivered.
The foundation takes into account the team’s experience and dedication to their work as priorities.
BIC: How does the Bahamut Foundation measure the impact and success of its initiatives in the DeFi, gaming, and NFT sectors? 👀
Pavel Aramyan: These are mostly measured by the number of Bahamut addresses, active players/addresses for deployed games, as well as the number of NFT collections on marketplaces. Also, there are key metrics that are unique for every type of product and should be revised accordingly. For example, liquidity thresholds for various products or continuous updates to the protocol and enhancing services. The global idea is to incentivize the applicants to continuously improve their products and keep it alive.

BIC: Btw, what strategies does the Bahamut Foundation employ to ensure ongoing support and success for the projects that have already been launched??
Pavel Aramyan: If the projects have been grant participants, there are certain criteria – different for each project as I already mentioned – that make them eligible for further funding when met. Also, the PoSA consensus plays its own role – the better applications one creates, the more rewards one earns due to being able to create more blocks and participate in the consensus matters more often, which can be considered as a secondary income flow by some apps. 
As a numbers example, I can say that IF Ethereum was working with PoSA consensus, somebody like uniswap would be earning around 1500 ETH/monthly, just due to their activity in the network, we ran this simulation a while ago. Given the current pricing of Ethereum, that’s nothing to scuff at 😄
BIC: Let’s talk about the meetups organized by the Bahamut Foundation 🔥What has been the community response to them, and how do these events enhance the blockchain community?
Pavel Aramyan: Community meetups have always been well-received since the people are keen to learn, especially when it comes to blockchain. The meetups are first and foremost for educating the community on both technical and business aspects of blockchain and web3. As a result, you get more educated users, which in turn leads them to want to learn more, which leads to wider web3 adoption – which we believe should be a common cause among all web3 products and businesses nowadays.
BIC: And can you share insights on the Bahamut meetups, particularly the ones that happened in Dubai?
Pavel Aramyan: The Dubai community meetup had been a blast. Not only was it the first meetup in the FtNFT store in Dubai, but also the community was genuinely interested and keen to learn about Fastex, Bahamut, and web3 as a whole. We had a number of lectures regarding technology, leadership, and legal aspects in the world of web3, which were wrapped with a cozy networking event right after, as is the custom for all meetups.
BIC: What about other events? How did the Bahamut Foundation’s participation at Paris Blockchain Week contribute to your goals, and what were the key takeaways from this event?
Pavel Aramyan: As a matter of fact, we place a lot of influence on real-time events, which is why you can find us being present in over 50 events annualy. In particular, Paris blockchain week was one of these events that have a very respectable community and as a result, Bahamut aquired numerous grant applicants, partnerships and integrations that are currently being implemented.
BIC: Over 50 events annually 🤯🤯🤯
Pavel Aramyan: mind-boggling I know 😄
BIC: Pavel, I’ve heard about your educational programs. Could you please tell us about it more? Does Bahamut Foundation plan any new collaborations with local or international universities?
Pavel Aramyan: So this has been a new venture for the foundation, and the idea is to establish some kind of an educational portal/session/even semester for Master’s degree and above students, who’re interested in learning about the technology. The collaboration with minor courses (1-2 months long) is already underway with the State University in Yerevan, with more collaborations and semester-long courses to follow in the near future. 
We believe that proper education (even if it’s just the basics) will be a key nail-driver in securing a bright future for blockchain and web3 usage in general, simply since not being alienated to a topic is already a big win in many cases.
the “oh I’ve heard about this before” vs the “well, this sounds too complicated, I’ll pass” can go a long way
BIC: WOW!!! How does Bahamut support outstanding students within these educational programs, and what are the criteria for receiving the scholarships? 👀👀👀 
Pavel Aramyan: Since this is just the start, we haven’t had any students actually complete the course, but the idea is to offer them a job (part-time, full-time, internship) depending on the results and recruit young blood into the space. And as we all know, youngsters are always more keen on the unknown and happy to explore it to its ends, which basically results in an educated community and people who care about web3.
BIC: Now I want to be a student again 😂
Pavel Aramyan: ha! Now, that’s a term I thought I’d never say after I graduated myself, but I would’ve liked that, too 😄
BIC: Finally, could you share any upcoming events or announcements that enthusiasts and potential collaborators should look forward to? 😏

Pavel Aramyan: Sure, so as I said you can find us on many major industry events so expect to see us in Singapore, Dubai, Amsterdam, Hong-kong and other spots in the next few months. 
As for announcements, there are gonna be up to 30 additional grant distributions in the next quarter, as well as numerous integrations and infrastructure additions.
BIC: Great! Now let’s move to my favorite part — questions from our Community 🖤I saw you have chosen the next questions 👇
Pavel Aramyan: lets get to it!
BIC: @AppleChichi: 
How does Bahamut’s new approach to the distribution of block validation rewards differ from traditional blockchain reward mechanisms, and what advantages does it offer to validators and the network as a whole?
Pavel Aramyan: ok, so this is a very good one since it highlights the PoSA advantages. So what we have with Activity is that it’s a parameter in the blockchain code that the consensus is programmed to take into account when distributing the chance to become a block producer in the future. 
Now validators that have active smart contracts deployed on the network have a much higher chance to be elected again and again, versus traditional PoS systems where the chance is the same for everybody. This is a small yet fundamental tweak to the PoS consensus since it sees and recognizes these validators as participants who bring value to others (because others are willing to spend gas to interact with these contracts), thus, they should be rewarded appropriately, in a decentralized manner.
For example, you could choose to deploy an ERC20 (or, in our case BHRC20) token on Bahamut, and with every transfer from wallet A to wallet B, you’ll build up activity as the deployer of this token. As a result, the more transfers happen, the more you’ll be able to earn from the network in the form of fees. And this model can be implemented for any other smart contract application.
BIC: 
The next one is by @VuongKy3:
What specific industries or use cases is Bahamut targeting with its public blockchain solution, and how does its unique reward distribution mechanism benefit these applications?
Pavel Aramyan: So the beauty of PoSA is that it doesn’t care what industry you’re from, as long as you create GOOD smart contracts since this is what people will be willing to use, and in that case, you get activity. And the blockchain recognizes this and rewards everyone accordingly, in proportion to the total activity pool in the chain. 

This is why this can be considered universal, since every type of business will be able to benefit from this type consensus. 
BIC: @JuliusDunham asks:
How does Bahamut handle scalability and transaction throughput? Are there any innovative technologies or protocols implemented to manage high transaction volumes and network congestion?
Pavel Aramyan: So, currently, Bahamut functions exactly like Ethereum in terms of speed and scalability. We’re also implementing second-layer scaling solutions currently and looking into sharding technologies to overcome these issues. Like Ethereum, we value decentralization more than any other factor when it comes to blockchain operations, and this is why we have chosen it as our working platform.
BIC: @wangsu4:
How does Bahamut ensure decentralization and prevent the concentration of power among a small number of validators or stakeholders? What governance mechanisms are in place to support this objective?
Pavel Aramyan: Bahamut currently has over 4400 validators in its network. With decentralization in mind and PoSA, we encourage everyone to become a validator to be able to participate in the activity generation, as a result creating a healthy atmosphere for everyone involved. 

Because you can only benefit from activity if you’re a validator on Bahamut, and every smart contract can be linked to one validator, if you’re looking to create value for yourself, you’ll need to operate a full node on-chain. This results in good spread among validators and secures the chain from countless threats that come with centralization possibilities.
BIC: And the last one — @EzequielMarrero:
In terms of interoperability, how does Bahamut facilitate interactions with other blockchain networks and existing financial systems? Are there any specific protocols or partnerships that enhance cross-chain compatibility?
Pavel Aramyan: Bahamut is very keen on interoperability and creating a vibrant “blockchain-to-blockchain” atmosphere in web3. We’re always looking to integrate existing protocols that have interoperability in their fundamentals as a top priority. Currently, Symbiosis bridge offers the ability to migrate assets from other chains to Bahamut, with 8 more interoperability protocol integrations currently in discussion and/or finalization stages.
BIC: Cool! Pavel, thank you for being here today 🖤Pavel Aramyan: thanks for hosting me @cryptosoka!
Final thoughts
Through the unique PoSA consensus, Bahamut rewards active validators and drives substantial network engagement. The successful launch of DeFi projects like Lolik, Mutuari, and Silkswap showcases the platform’s potential and the foundation’s commitment to supporting innovative projects through grants and community initiatives. 
With a focus on education, ongoing support for projects, and a keen eye on interoperability, Bahamut is poised to make significant contributions to the blockchain industry. As Aramyan hinted, exciting developments and new opportunities are on the horizon, promising a bright future for both Bahamut and its growing community.

Bitcoin in El Salvador: A Three-Year Overview


Three years ago, President Nayib Bukele’s decision to make Bitcoin (BTC) legal tender in El Salvador made headlines around the globe. On September 7, 2021, the “Bitcoin Law” came into effect, making El Salvador the first country to adopt Bitcoin as an official currency.
Since then, the nation has experienced significant economic and social shifts, highlighting the impact and potential of this bold move.
The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin’s Value: Impact on El Salvador

El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin has been mixed with challenges and successes. The country now holds over $411 million in Bitcoin, with a more than 5,772 BTC portfolio.

President Nayib Bukele was recently sworn in for a second term, reinforcing his pro-Bitcoin stance. The country has continued to purchase Bitcoin, acquiring up to 30 BTC per month. As of May, El Salvador had more than $70 million in unrealized profits from its Bitcoin investments.

“Let’s not lose perspective. Here we are not just changing a country, we are changing a paradigm. We have already accomplished more than anyone could have imagined. Other people would like to have what we have now,” Bukele declared during his re-election.

Despite the crypto market’s volatility, El Salvador’s government remains unwavering in its support for Bitcoin. The government has preserved its Bitcoin holdings and consistently invests in them. Moreover, El Salvador continues to integrate the asset into various sectors of the economy.
For instance, Salvadorian citizens can use BTC to pay for goods and services, taxes, and even through the official Chivo Wallet. The government has also implemented policies and incentives to attract crypto investments, including citizenship and mining services passports.

El Salvador has also invested in Bitcoin mining using volcanic energy. The state plant on the Tecapa volcano operates around 300 processors, capitalizing on the country’s geothermal resources. This investment comes when Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has reached an all-time high, highlighting the nation’s innovative approach.
Recent developments have further strengthened El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey. First, the first Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval in January 2024 raised BTC’s price from $41,670 to over $70,000 in just a few months.

Additionally, the fourth Bitcoin halving on April 20 reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, potentially increasing BTC’s price and profitability. Experts predict Bitcoin could rise to $100,000 by the end of the year, with some estimates suggesting it could reach $150,000 by 2025. Such growth could significantly boost El Salvador’s BTC profits.

Hedera (HBAR) Futures Traders Eye Bullish Recovery


Hedera (HBAR) has witnessed a steady decline in its value in the past few weeks. In the past 30 days, its price has decreased by almost 10%. 
However, despite this, the altcoin’s futures traders have maintained a bullish bias toward it as they continue to demand long positions. 
Hedera Futures Traders Bears a Burden

At press time, Hedera (HBAR) traded at $0.1031. During the last month, its price peaked at $0.12 on May 17 and has since declined by 16%.
Despite the fall in altcoins’ prices over the past few weeks, their future market activity has continued to grow. First, their open interest has trended upward since the beginning of the month. At $60 million as of this writing, HBAR’s futures open interest has surged by 18% since June 1.
An asset’s futures open interest measures the total number of its outstanding futures contracts or positions that have not been closed or settled. When it spikes, it signals that more participants are entering the market to open new positions.

In addition to HBAR’s rising open interest, its funding rate across cryptocurrency exchanges has remained positive. This trend has been since May 3, when the altcoin last recorded a negative funding rate.

Funding rates are used in perpetual futures contracts to ensure the contract price stays close to the spot price. 
When an asset’s futures funding rate is positive, there is a strong demand for long positions. It suggests that more traders are buying an asset in anticipation of a price increase than those expecting a dip.
HBAR Price Prediction: Price Trends Within a Range
The bias is different in the token’s spot market. Many buyers and sellers have avoided trading HBAR due to the uncertainty regarding its next price direction.

HBAR’s price traded close to its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at press time, confirming that the market was in consolidation. 
Hedera Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
An asset’s 20-day EMA tracks the average price of an asset over the past 20 days. When price trades close to this key moving average, it signals a period of sideways movement, with no strong uptrend or downtrend.
If buying momentum surges due to the activity of HBAR’s futures traders, its price might rally to $0.105.

However, if bear power grows and selling pressure mounts, HBAR’s price may fall to $0.09

Bitcoin halving fallout: Crypto trading drops 20% in May - AMBCrypto



Crypto trading volumes hit second monthly low post-BTC halving event. 
Derivatives dominated the crypto market at +70% because of ETH ETF speculation.

The typical financial lull associated with summer seems to be playing out in crypto markets. 
In May, crypto trading activity fell by 20%, marking the second month of a drop in trading volume across major exchanges, per a CCData report. 
Part of the report cited the ‘rangebound’ market for the trend and read, 
‘In May, the combined spot and derivatives trading volume on centralised exchanges fell 20.1% to $5.27tn as the prices of major digital assets continued to trend rangebound following the Bitcoin halving event in March.’
A downtrend in crypto trading volume
Source: CCData
The report noted that in the spot market segment, May’s trading volumes across centralized exchanges dropped 21.6% to $1.57 trillion, lower than the +$2 trillion volumes hit in April. 
Based on individual exchanges, Binance was the top contender on the spot market trading volume at $545 trillion in May. In descending order, other exchanges that followed Binance’s lead were Bybit, OKX, Coinbase, and Gate.io. 
However, each exchange recorded key drops in trading volumes in May compared to April. 
On year-to-date performance on the spot market share, Binance saw the most significant gains and ramped up its dominance to 34.6%. 
Bybit, Bitget, and XT.com also surged in market share over the same period. But Coinbase saw a modest decline while Upbit, OKX, and MEXC Global recorded ‘the greatest decline in market share.’
Derivative market dominance surge to 70%
However, money in the crypto market was concentrated mainly in the derivatives market. Per the report,
‘The derivatives market now represents 70.1% of the entire crypto market (vs 69.5% in April).’ 
Source: CCData
Despite the spike in derivative market dominance, overall trading volumes were subdued like the spot market. The report noted that, 
‘Derivatives volumes decreased by 19.4% in May to $3.69tn, recording the second consecutive decline in monthly derivatives volume.’ 
Unlike the typical sluggish financial activity in TradFi during the summer, the report attributed the low volumes to historical patterns associated with low activity after the Bitcoin halving events. 
Amidst the lull, the report noted that traders were still bullish, based on an uptick in funding rates and a surge in Ethereum [ETH] option volumes on US ETH ETFs speculation. 
‘Across the four exchanges analysed, the average funding rates continued to decline, reaching 3.23%. However, the funding rate started trending upwards on May 23rd as traders turned bullish after the SEC’s surprise pivot on the Spot Ethereum ETF applications.’

Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record 17 Straight Inflow Days, Reaching $15.3B Year-To-Date - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued their impressive streak of net inflows on June 5, attracting a total of $488 million. What Happened: This marks the 17th consecutive day of positive inflows for these investment vehicles, according to data from SoSo Value.This brings the historical cumulative net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETFs to $15.338 billion.Individual ETFs such as Grayscale‘s GBTC saw a single-day inflow of $14.5802 million, Fidelity‘s FBTC recorded $221 million, and BlackRock‘s IBIT achieved $155 million in inflows. Ark Invest’s ARKB saw a $71 million inflow.QCP Capital reported that Bitcoin ETFs continue to attract significant investment, with $488.1 million in net inflows recorded on June 5. The firm also observed increased call buying activity, targeting a potential $100,000 strike for July. This optimistic outlook is partly driven by an unexpectedly low jobless claims report and the anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) release next week, which could trigger a new all-time high for Bitcoin BTC/USD.Also Read: Potential Email Vendor Breach Puts Crypto Companies On AlertAdditionally, there is speculation that the market might factor in potential rate cuts, adding further momentum to the rally.However, Ethereum’s performance has lagged behind Bitcoin. SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Wednesday indicated that the approval process for Ethereum spot ETFs “will take some time.”This delay is expected to keep Ethereum‘s ETH/USD short-term performance subdued compared to Bitcoin. Despite this, analysts at QCP Capital suggest that Ethereum will eventually outperform Bitcoin once the ETF starts trading. They recommend accumulating Ethereum at a discount now to benefit from the expected future price appreciation.What’s Next: As the digital asset market continues to evolve, these developments will be a focal point at the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Coinbase Launches Smart Wallets To Simplify Crypto OnboardingImage: Shutterstock

'Bitcoin Jesus' Roger Ver Released on Bail in Spain - Decrypt

Cryptocurrency entrepreneur Roger Ver, also known as "Bitcoin Jesus," has been released on bail in Spain after posting a €150,000 bail.According to a Bloomberg report, Ver was permitted to leave jail May 17, on condition that he hand in his passport and remain in Spain pending a decision on his extradition to the U.S., where he faces $50 million tax evasion charges. Ver must also report to court every two days.Ver was arrested by Spanish authorities in April, after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment alleging that he had evaded paying almost $50 million in taxes, in addition to charges of mail fraud and filing false tax returns.In the indictment, the DOJ alleges that after Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship and obtained citizenship in St. Kitts and Nevis, he failed to report capital gains or pay taxes on his holdings of 131,000 BTC.Ver is accused of providing false or misleading information to the law firm and appraiser who prepared tax returns relating to his expatriation, undervaluing two of his companies that held 73,000 of his BTC holdings and failing to report his personal holdings.In November 2017, Ver sold "tens of thousands" of Bitcoin for around $240 million in cash—sales that he was legally required to report to the IRS, along with his receipt of Bitcoin from the two firms.“In total, Ver is alleged to have caused a loss to the IRS of at least $48 million,” the indictment read.Who is Roger Ver?Ver, an outspoken libertarian, was an early adopter and Bitcoin evangelist, earning his nickname "Bitcoin Jesus" for giving away the cryptocurrency for free.He subsequently shifted his attention to Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork of the original cryptocurrency, which he maintains is the “truest representation of Satoshi’s vision.”Ver has had run-ins with the law before; in 2002, he was sentenced to 10 months in jail for selling explosives on eBay.In a 2019 talk, he argued that, "It’s the law breakers that move society forward," adding that, "If it wasn’t for people who break the law, we’d still have slavery. We’d still have people sitting at the back of the bus. The people who have the courage to break the law, have the ability to make the world a better place."Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

AI sets Ethereum (ETH) price for June 30, 2024


    As many assets in the cryptocurrency market start to resume their price increases, the sector’s largest altcoin – Ethereum (ETH) – has been one of them, and machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are fairly optimistic about its progress for the next several weeks.



Indeed, Ethereum has been riding the current bullish wave in the crypto sphere, heightened by the exceptionally positive prediction by investment giant VanEck, which sees the second largest asset in the cryptoverse by market capitalization, reaching a whopping $22,000 by 2030.



Ethereum price prediction



In terms of its price prognosis for the near future, Ethereum might hit the level at $3,927.66 by as early as June 30, 2024, according to the advanced AI algorithm deployed by the crypto monitoring and forecasting platform PricePredictions retrieved by Finbold on June 6.

Specifically, this would represent an increase of 2.12% from Ethereum’s price at press time provided that the prediction, which takes into consideration technical analysis (TA) indicators, such as relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and others, comes true.



Ethereum price analysis



For now, Ethereum is changing hands at the price of $3,846.08, which represents a 1.42% gain in the last 24 hours, an increase of 2.83% across the previous seven days while adding up to the 24.06% advance accumulated over the past month, as per the latest charts on June 6.

As a reminder, the $90 billion asset manager VanEck raised its 2030 ETH price target to $22,000, influenced by “ether ETF news, scaling progress, and our read of onchain data,” as well as the analysis of how ETH and Bitcoin (BTC) perform in both traditional and crypto-only portfolios for optimal returns.”







In addition to the AI’s positive short-term prognosis, VanEck’s optimism suggests an overall positive sentiment regarding Ethereum’s future. However, it is important to keep in mind that trends in the crypto industry can sometimes shift, so doing one’s own research is critical when investing.

Uniswap Whale Makes Waves, Dumping $7 Million Worth of UNI - Coin Edition


							

UNI crashed by 6% from the intraday high of  $11.26 to a low of $10.63 today.



The decline emerged after a whale dumped UNI worth $7.08 million. 



Another bearish factor for UNI is the upcoming unlock of over $90 million for advisors, teams, and investors




Over the last 24 hours, UNI, the native token of the Uniswap DEX, suffered a significant decline amid the Bitcoin-led crypto market rally. During yesterday’s brief surge, UNI reached a daily high of $11.26. However, UNI dropped to $10.63 earlier today, losing approximately 6% of its value.



Lookonchain, the crypto analytics firm, suggests that large-scale whale activity may have influenced Uniswap’s price crash. Lookonchain revealed that a major UNI investor sold 606,088 tokens, realizing a profit of $7.08 million. According to the firm, this substantial sale triggered UNI’s price drop earlier today.







Additionally, the analytics service reported that the whale had previously withdrawn 1.3 million UNI, valued at $13.7 million, from the Binance exchange. Currently, the whale holds 696,808 UNI, worth $7.46 million, across three wallets. Lookonchain estimated that this investor netted a profit of approximately $800,000 from their recent UNI sale.



Prior to the recent UNI token sale, the market tracker noted that this whale had purchased a total of $28.75 million worth of Ethereum ecosystem tokens from Binance in late May. These purchases included 858,069 UNI worth $8.7 million, 4.04 million LDO worth $9.3 million, 71,190 AAVE worth $7.4 million, 82,041 ENS tokens worth $2 million, and 250,969 FXS worth $1.25 million.While UNI’s price hovers around $10.77 at press time with limited signs of recovery, the asset has retained over 38% of its gains accrued in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, another bearish factor for UNI is the upcoming unlock of 8.33 million tokens, valued at over $90 million, from the Uniswap treasury for advisors, teams, and investors.

Nigel Farage milkshake’d while touring with shady crypto ally


A former aide to Nigel Farage, who was previously convicted of wire fraud and allegedly found to be the owner of an illegal crypto ATM, was apparently filmed alongside the far-right politician when he was ‘milkshake’d’ on Tuesday. 
Financier George Cottrell — also known as ‘Posh George’ — appeared to be among Farage’s entourage at the Reform Party’s campaign launch in Essex when a member of the crowd threw a milkshake at the former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader. This was the second milkshake thrown in the politician’s face.
Cottrell was in his 20s when he took up a position as an unpaid advisor to Farage and began co-directing Brexit-related fundraising for UKIP. However, in July 2016 he was arrested and charged with 21 counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering, wire fraud, blackmail, and extortion.

An FBI sting operation caught Cottrell agreeing to launder £120,000 a month in drug trafficking proceeds. Cottrell allegedly threatened to report the fake drug traffickers to the police in an attempt to blackmail them out of 130 bitcoins, then worth $80,000.   
He subsequently negotiated a plea deal with US prosecutors that saw him plead guilty to one count of wire fraud while another 20 were dropped. He received an eight-month sentence and was released in March 2017.
In 2016 a UKIP spokesperson told the BBC, “George was an unpaid and enthusiastic volunteer for the party over the period of the referendum. 
“We are unaware of the details of the allegations excepting that they date from a time before he was directly involved in the party.”
George Cottrell allegedly owns illegal cryptomat 
In 2023, Montenegro’s finance minister accused the former Farage aide of illegally owning a cryptomat, a physical crypto trading outlet similar to a crypto ATM. In addition, politicians from the country’s ‘Movement for Change’ accused Cottrell of funding the political organization Evropa Now Movement (PES).
According to Montenegrin news outlet Vijesti, the country’s minister of finance said, “We know that there is no legal basis for the trading of cryptocurrencies in Montenegro and that everything related to possible trade through that [cryptomat] is illegal.” Lawyers representing Cottrell deny the accusations. 
Cottrell reportedly founded the ‘Private family office’ in Tivat, Montenegro, in 2020. His time in Montenegro was also hallmarked by his loss of £16 million in a Montenegro casino this year. 
It’s unclear what his role was on Farage’s recent campaign launch. However, Cottrell claims on LinkedIn that he continues to work with “financial institutions, politicians, and political consulting firms.”

Should FET, AGIX, and OCEAN Investors Worry About ASI?


Mergers between two companies in the crypto industry are rare. Still, it is even rarer to see three companies come together as Fetch.ai (FET), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), and SingularityNET (AGIX) plan to.
Whether this will turn out to be a spectacular or a disastrous spectacle is yet to be determined.
The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) Closer to Coming to Life
Earlier this week, SingularityNET announced that it would merge with Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol to form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI). The merger will unify the three networks into one Artificial Intelligence (AI) network.

Currently, these three tokens are worth around $3.2 billion combined. Following the merger, ASI is targeting a market cap of $7.5 billion, which would place the token among the top 20 cryptocurrencies in the world.
The merger is expected to begin on June 11 and be completed by June 13, after which the three tokens cease to exist. Token holders until June 13 will have a chance of swapping their holdings for ASI.
However, with a market cap target of 2x the current valuation of these three assets, the question arises if this is a possibility or a simple fantasy.
FET, AGIX, OCEAN Price Prediction: Where They Are and Where They Could Land
Fetch.ai (FET)
Fetch.ai’s price has been consolidating for the past two months, with every breakout attempt failing so far. FET is changing hands at $2.11, moving within the range of $1.95 and $2.49.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the bearish zone under the neutral line of 50.0. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It currently signals a bearish outcome over the next week, likely keeping FET consolidated.

Read More: How Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Transform Crypto?

SingularityNET (AGIX)
AGIX price has been doing well on the macro time frame. The altcoin has observed a consistent uptrend for the past two months, bringing the trading price to $0.89. AGIX is currently sitting under the critical resistance of $1.00.
If this barrier is breached, the crypto asset would have a shot at rising further towards rallying beyond $1.07.

AGIX Price Analysis. Source: TradingView

However, this could take a while, and the anticipated merger date, June 11, is less than a week away.
Ocean Protocol
OCEAN’s price action has not been too impressive, either. The altcoin has been consolidating between $0.84 and $1.02 for a solid eight weeks. OCEAN nearly breached the upper limit once but failed to sustain the rise, returning to the trading price of $0.89.

The chances of the altcoin dipping to test the support floor of $0.84 are much higher than a breakout.

Thus, given the current market conditions and despite the rise in AI, these three tokens are witnessing slow growth. The potential of these assets combining and skyrocketing from positions 60, 80, and 143 to become a top-20 asset seems a little difficult.

Senate Crypto Bill: Potential Impact on Digital Assets

This week, a bill placed on the Senate calendar introduces several provisions that could impact digital asset protocols and tokens. Although it does not explicitly ban digital asset protocols, its broad scope could allow it to become an attack vector for anti-crypto aspects of the US government.The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence passed the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (IAA) by a unanimous 17-0 vote in May, as Senator Warner’s office reported. The bill, S. 4443, authorizes funding, provides legal authorities, and enhances congressional oversight for the US Intelligence Community (IC).Specifically, Section 423 of the bill allows the Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions prohibiting transactions between any US person and a “foreign digital asset transaction facilitator” who has knowingly facilitated significant transactions with foreign terrorist organizations, specially designated global terrorist organizations, or other sanctioned entities. The definition of “foreign digital asset transaction facilitator” is broad, covering any foreign person or group that “controls, operates, or makes available a digital asset protocol or similar facility, or otherwise materially assists in the purchase, sale, exchange, custody, or other transaction involving an exchange or transfer of value using digital assets.”While this does not constitute an outright ban, even protocols such as Aave, Uniswap, or stablecoins like USDT could potentially be designated as sanctioned “foreign digital asset transaction facilitators” if they are determined to have knowingly facilitated prohibited transactions with sanctioned entities. This could restrict US persons from transacting with them. However, the bill does not ban these protocols or tokens outright solely for being potentially accessible to sanctioned entities. There would need to be a determination that they knowingly facilitated prohibited transactions.“FOREIGN DIGITAL ASSET TRANSACTION FACILITATOR.—The term “foreign digital asset transaction facilitator” means any foreign person or group of foreign persons that, as determined by the Secretary, controls, operates, or makes available a digital asset protocol or similar facility, or otherwise materially assists in the purchase, sale, exchange, custody, or other transaction involving an exchange or transfer of value using digital assets.”Tether has frequently complied with requests to freeze tokens for US-sanctioned entities. Regardless, US institutions have repeatedly targeted it for allegedly allowing such activity, with competitor Circle adding to the rhetoric in front of Congress earlier this year. Aave, Uniswap, and others banned wallets that interacted with TornadoCash to comply with US sanctions in 2022. Still, if the Treasury deems previous interactions as “materially assisting” sanctioned entities, this new legislation could target them, in the worst-case scenario, the crypto industry.Given the bill’s importance and historical context, it is likely that some form of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 will pass. However, the exact provisions, especially those related to digital assets and protocols, may be subject to changes during the legislative process. The bill’s progress and any amendments will need to be monitored to understand its final impact on open-source protocols and decentralized tokens.Per Senator Warner’s office, the bill has cleared a significant hurdle by being reported favorably by the Select Committee on Intelligence and placed on the Senate calendar for further consideration. This indicates strong support and a positive trajectory through the legislative process.Ultimately, the bill aims to enhance oversight and potential sanctions around digital assets but does not constitute an outright ban on major DeFi protocols or stablecoins at this point. Their operations could face restrictions if they are found to have facilitated prohibited transactions with sanctioned entities, necessitating careful compliance and fair treatment by regulatory authorities.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Kanter's Regulatory Response On AI Monopolies


                                U.S. Antitrust Chief to Scrutinize AI Sector for Monopoly Risks                                The United States antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter has declared the need to investigate the AI industry due to the alleged monopolization of the market. To avoid the domination of several companies, Kanter’s analysis will encompass several facets of AI such as computing capacity, data utilization, and hardware access.What’s the News?Jonathan Kanter, the U. S. antitrust enforcer has pointed out the fact that it is high time that regulators focused on the AI industry. During an interview, Kanter stressed the need to look into the competition and find monopoly choke points. These points include computing power for AI, data for training LLMs, cloud providers’ domination, engineering talent, and AI hardware.Kanter said that it is crucial to intervene early to address the problem of large technology companies monopolizing the AI market. He stated that the current status of AI competition is at its highest level and active steps are needed to sustain this level of competition. According to Kanter, if regulators intervene in real-time, they can be less intrusive to the companies as they can manage monopoly threats adequately.Impacts of AI MonopolyThe concentration of the AI industry is another factor that poses numerous questions. Another challenge is the limited availability of graphics processing units (GPUs) necessary for training LLMs. When people want to use these innovative products, they begin to focus on how chipmakers are distributing their chips. This is especially important to discuss as firms such as Nvidia record increased revenues and stock prices because of the high sales of their GPUs. The overall revenues in the first quarter of 2023 were recorded to be 262% higher than the same period of the previous year which took Nvidia’s valuation over $2.5 trillion.Furthermore, monopolies in AI can cause a more significant problem of power consolidation that kills the spirit of innovation and enhances social imparity. Recently Singularity NET’s Chief Operating Officer Janet Adams expressed her concerns about big tech companies taking over artificial general intelligence (AGI). Adams also points out that if the creation of AGI will be in the hands of several large companies the creation will be focused on making money and may not bring a positive impact on society and may lead to a dystopian future.Preventions to avoid the monopoly of AITo avoid monopolistic control in the AI sector the following steps can be taken. Kanter referred to the current government programs that have been put in place to help increase production like the Chips and Science Act of 2022. This legislation provides $39 billion of subsidies for chip manufacturing inside the United States, intending to strengthen the local supply chain and cut dependence on foreign manufacturers.Also, decentralizing the development of Artificial Intelligence through the use of blockchain technology could be a significant move. This would spread the advancements in AI among a larger number of players, and thus, the advantages of AI would be enjoyed by a larger number of people. Thus, regulators can encourage the creation of more open-source AI projects and support less experienced developers.ConclusionThus, constant monitoring of the AI sector and its activities is crucial as the sector grows rapidly. Jonathan Kanter’s approach of being aggressive in identifying potential monopolies in AI is good for ensuring that there is no monopolistic behavior in the market. Thus, the regulators should focus on eliminating the monopoly choke points and encouraging decentralization to guarantee that the AI advantages will be distributed and innovations will be encouraged. As per CoinGabbar, AI’s future is most likely to be shaped by these two poles to avoid monopolistic tendencies while encouraging technological development in the interest of humanity.Also Read: Bots On The Boats With AI, Is It Driving Humans?

How Bitcoin, Ethereum pushed crypto market cap to over $2 trillion - AMBCrypto



The crypto market capitalization has increased slightly in the last 24 hours.
BTC and ETH’s price increase contributed to the increase in the market cap.

The cryptocurrency market recently experienced a slight increase in market capitalization. This growth was largely driven by the prices of Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH], which dominate the market. 
Additionally, both assets have been experiencing significant accumulation volume recently.
Bitcoin, Ethereum contribute to market increase
According to data from CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency market’s market capitalization has increased by over 1% in the last 24 hours. 
Currently, the market cap stands at over $2.6 trillion. The analysis revealed that Bitcoin accounts for over 53% of the market cap, amounting to approximately $1.4 trillion, while Ethereum holds nearly 18%, valued at around $463 billion.
Source: CoinMarketCap
Further analysis revealed that the market capitalization increased by almost $1 trillion from the end of last month to now. 
At the end of May, the market cap was approximately $1.54 trillion. Currently, it stands at around $2.54 trillion, indicating an increase of nearly $1 trillion.
Bitcoin, Ethereum see increased accumulation
Recent analysis indicates an increase in the accumulation of Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past few days. This accumulation coincides with notable price movements, contributing to the rise in market capitalization.
According to data from CryptoQuant, the wallet reserves holding between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoins have been increasing.
These wallets now collectively hold over 3.6 million BTC, indicating substantial accumulation despite recent price fluctuations. 
Further analysis showed that this trend has been ongoing since March. Additionally, the wallets in the 1,000 BTC category now account for about 40% of the total Bitcoin supply.
Additionally, data indicates that Ethereum has been experiencing increased accumulation by large addresses. 
The chart reveals an upward trend in accumulation from wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH. These addresses now hold over 340,000 ETH, valued at more than $1.3 billion.
Ethereum sees more holders than Bitcoin
Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced increased accumulation, but Ethereum currently has more holders. 
According to data from Santiment, the number of Ethereum holders has surged in recent years, reaching nearly 123 million. In contrast, the number of Bitcoin holders stands at around 54.2 million.
Source: Santiment
This indicates that the number of Ethereum holders is more than double that of Bitcoin holders. A major reason for this could be the cost of entry into these assets. 
Currently, Bitcoin’s value has increased again, with predictions of further rises in the future. 
This increase may drive more traders toward alternative assets like Ethereum and others, subsequently impacting the prices of these assets.
How ETH, BTC have trended in the last 24 hours
AMBCrypto’s daily analysis of Ethereum revealed a positive price movement on 5th June, with a 1.48% increase, bringing its price to around $3,866. 
Despite recent struggles, Ethereum has managed to stay within this price range. As of this writing, it is still trading in the $3,800 range, with a decline of less than 1%.
Source: TradingView
Additionally, an analysis of Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated that it remains in a strong bull trend. As of this writing, its RSI is above 65.
Analysis of the Bitcoin price trend showed positive bounces over the past few days. The chart indicated a five-day consecutive rise, taking its price from around $67,700 to over $71,000.

Read Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2024-25

By the end of trading on 5th June, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $71,121, marking an increase of almost 1%. As of this writing, it has slightly declined to the $70,000 region, with a decrease of less than 1%.
According to its RSI, BTC remained in a bull trend despite the recent price decline. The RSI was above 60 as of this writing.

Is Bitcoin (BTC) Attempting to Push to a New All-Time High Next?


Bitcoin (BTC) currently trades within an ascending channel. The rally in the past few days has pushed the leading coin’s price toward the upper line of this channel.
If the coin successfully crosses above this line, it will have breached a key resistance level of $72,690.
Bitcoin “Big Boys” Weigh In
Bitcoin’s recent rally above $70,000 is partly due to the uptick in the coin’s whale activity over the past few weeks. 

On-chain data reveals a significant increase in the number of large daily transactions over the past 30 days. BTC transactions valued between $100,000 and $1 million have surged 9% during this period. 
Even more notable, transactions valued above $10 million have skyrocketed by 165% in the last month.
Bitcoin Whale Activity. Source: IntoTheBlock
Upticks like these in BTC transactions suggest increased participation from institutional investors, such as hedge funds, investment firms, and corporations, during the period under review. 
This attention from this cohort of BTC investors played out on June 4 when the US-based spot BTC ETFs recorded its 15 consecutive days of inflows, Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a post on X.

“The ability to bounce back w/ renewed interest after a couple nasty selloffs is rare for hot sauce type strategies. Shows staying power.” Balchunas added.

However, general market sentiment around the leading crypto continues to be negative. On-chain data showed that despite BTC’s recent price performance, its weighted sentiment has been negative since May 23.

With a weighted sentiment of -0.3 when writing, there was more negative chatter than positive around BTC on social media.
BTC Price Prediction: Is Demand Losing Steam?
At press time, BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was in an uptrend. This indicator measures an asset price momentum. 

It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is used to identify overbought or oversold market conditions. At 64, the indicator’s value showed steady demand for BTC.
However, BTC’s declining Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) forms a bearish divergence that hints at a potential price dip. This indicator measures money flow into and out of an asset’s market.
When it declines when an asset’s price rises, a bearish divergence is formed. This divergence suggests that despite the rising price, buying pressure is decreasing, indicating a potential price decline.
Bitcoin Analysis. Source: TradingView

If this trend continues, and the CMF continues to record lower values, BTC may eventually retrace and slip back to $68,180.

However, if buying pressure regains momentum and spikes, it will push the coin’s price above resistance at $72,690.

Investment Company VanEck Targeted This Figure for Ethereum by 2030! Is it possible? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Global investment firm VanEck has set a new price target for Ethereum (ETH), predicting that the Ethereum network's native token will reach $22,000 by 2030.
VanEck Predicts Ethereum (ETH) to Reach $22,000 by 2030
This ambitious estimate represents a significant increase from current trading levels of approximately $3,850.


VanEck attributed this potential increase to Ethereum's disruptive capabilities and significant cash flow generation for token holders.
The firm emphasized that Ethereum has revolutionized various sectors such as finance, banking, payments, marketing, advertising, social media, gaming, infrastructure and artificial intelligence.





The report emphasized that Ethereum's technology offers lower costs, greater efficiency and greater transparency, which could shift significant market share from traditional financial and technology institutions to blockchain-based solutions.
VanEck estimates that this shift could tap into a total existing market (TAM) of $15 trillion.



Furthermore, VanEck predicts that free cash flows from holding Ethereum will reach $66 billion by 2030, further increasing its valuation to its projected target of $22,000.
The firm, which has filed to list an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), also predicts that these ETFs could surpass Bitcoin ETFs in size.





The report expressed confidence that spot Ethereum ETFs are nearing approval to trade on US exchanges.
Such approval would enable financial advisors and institutional investors to hold ether with the security of qualified custodians and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs.

Robinhood Bets Big on Crypto with $200M Acquisition of Bitstamp


																Popular trading platform, Robinhood, has reached an agreement to acquire cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp. This purchase aims to bolster Robinhood’s presence in the crypto space across the world while simultaneously attracting institutional clients by offering new products.
The all-cash deal is valued at $200 million and is anticipated to be finalized in the first half of 2025.
According to the official press release, the deal’s completion is based on customary closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. The acquisition is estimated to be finalized in the first half of 2025, provided all requirements are met.
Barclays Capital Inc. acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Robinhood throughout this transaction, while Galaxy Digital Partners LLC served as the exclusive financial advisor to Bitstamp.
Commenting on the development, Johann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Crypto, said,
“The acquisition of Bitstamp is a major step in growing our crypto business. Bitstamp’s highly trusted and long standing global exchange has shown resilience through market cycles. By seamlessly coupling customer experience with safety across geographies, the Bitstamp team has established one of the strongest reputations across retail and institutional crypto investors.”
As a result of the acquisition, the teams from Bitstamp and Robinhood will integrate, combining their expertise and resources.
This move is anticipated to facilitate Robinhood’s goal of expanding its global reach beyond the United States and attracting institutional clients to its platform. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells Notice to Robinhood, alleging potential violations of securities laws last month.
Despite the regulatory scrutiny in the country, Robinhood’s crypto revenue soared to $618 million, reflecting a 40% year-over-year increase.
In an effort to expand its crypto offerings, the platform launched crypto trading services for clients within the European Union in December.

Bitcoin and Other Crypto Assets on the Cusp of ‘Significant Move,’ Says Jason Pizzino - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Jason Pizzino is offering his thoughts on the potential trajectory for the digital asset market going forward.
Pizzino tells his 328,000 YouTube subscribers that the Average True Range indicator is suggesting that “another significant move” is imminent for Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets.










The ATR is used to measure the volatility of an asset with higher values indicating higher volatility and lower values indicating lower volatility.
According to Pizzino, Bitcoin recently witnessed a relatively small range and this could portend a bullish move ahead.
“Basically, we’ve seen one of the smallest days since January. So Bitcoin did a $500 range day on the weekend on Saturday… typically when this happens, you see some sort of windup period… you can see in each of these occasions you will see a pretty significant move to the upside.”
Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube
The widely followed analyst says that Bitcoin is “still looking relatively good” and is well-placed for the “next leg to start”. According to Pizzino, Bitcoin needs to first undergo a consolidation phase before it can rise above the all-time high of $73,800 reached on March 14th.
“Does not mean that we’re going to blow up in a matter of days or weeks. But I think we could still take a bit of time here. Bitcoin’s price has got to consolidate above $72,000.”
Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube
Bitcoin is trading at $70,984 at time of writing.
Turning to altcoins, Pizzino says that the combined market cap of this class of crypto assets is currently in a phase similar to other periods that preceded a breakout.
“I see this as a stealth move for the altcoins. And the stronger ones are going to get the gains when this breaks out. So the theory here is we’re in stealth – the stealth is identified here with small average true ranges of the bars.”

Cardano's Growing Adoption Could Fuel Next Bull Run, Analyst Says


							

Dan Gambardello thinks Cardano’s ADA is preparing for a parabolic bull run.



Cardano Foundation partnered with Argentina, and Dubai police started using the technology.



Historical data suggest ADA is set to rally significantly.




Renowned crypto analyst Dan Gambardello believes Cardano’s ADA is gearing up for a parabolic bull run following recent developments in the project’s ecosystem.



In an X post, Gambardello highlighted the Cardano Foundation’s collaboration with Argentina and Dubai police utilizing the technology as significant catalysts for the blockchain project.







In addition to these events, Gambardello noted that the US is exploring the deployment of Cardano in voting processes. He believes these developments will collectively contribute to Cardano’s growth, ushering ADA into the new era of Voltaire, a community-run chain, as charts suggest a potential parabolic bull market.



Meanwhile, Gambardello shared an ADA monthly chart to illustrate how the altcoin’s historical trend supports his projection. The chart reveals that ADA is mirroring its 2019 to 2022 movement when it experienced a parabolic rally.



In 2019, ADA traded sideways for an extended period before breaking above a significant moving average. The surge began after the token retested the moving average ahead of the bull cycle, causing ADA to soar over 5,000% in its most significant rally.









Notably, ADA has replicated this trend, as Gambardello’s post demonstrates. The altcoin traded sideways before breaking above the same moving average. The current price action shows ADA retesting the moving average, prompting the analyst to project a move similar to the 2021 parabolic surge.



Gambardello’s projection isn’t solely based on technical indicators. He also cites the aforementioned efforts by the Cardano Foundation to increase adoption and the project’s expansion into new territories. Such developments, coupled with the favorable technical arrangements, could catalyze a significant surge for ADA in the upcoming bull cycle. ADA was trading at $0.458 at press time, according to TradingView data.

How Ethereum ETF Inflows Will Impact Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Prices - Benzinga

Benzinga has investigated the impact of spot Ethereum ETFs on Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD prices and potential size of inflows to provide investors with a better understanding of future market dynamics.Expected Inflows and Market DynamicsThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs has already begun to shift investor sentiment positively. Data indicates that Ethereum saw a turnaround with net inflows following the SEC approval, breaking a 10-week streak of outflows that totaled $200 million.Inflows for Ethereum reached approximately $36 million recently, underscoring renewed investor interest​​.Will It Be New Capital?The influx of capital into Ethereum ETFs is expected to attract both retail and institutional investors, providing a regulated and secure means to invest in Ethereum. Analysts predict significant new capital flowing into these ETFs. For instance, Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts that the new Hong Kong crypto products, including Ethereum ETFs, could see about $1 billion in net inflows in their first year or two.Given the larger scale of the U.S. ETF market, the inflows for U.S.-based Ethereum ETFs could be substantially higher​.Also Read: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $887M Inflow On Wednesday, Second-Highest EverPotential Impact On BitcoinThere is a concern that the new capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs might cannibalize the inflows that would otherwise go into Bitcoin ETFs. However, the data suggests a more nuanced picture. Bitcoin ETFs have also seen strong inflows, with products like BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT leading the way with $720 million in net inflows recently.This indicates robust investor appetite for both cryptocurrencies​.Price ImplicationsThe impact on prices will depend on the balance between new capital inflows and the potential shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum investments. If the inflows are primarily new capital, we could see upward pressure on both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Conversely, if there is significant cannibalization, Bitcoin might experience slower price appreciation relative to Ethereum.The upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will be a key forum to discuss these developments.Industry leaders will offer their insights on the evolving dynamics of digital assets, providing valuable perspectives on how these ETF inflows might shape the market in the coming months.Read Next: Mike Novogratz Predicts Bitcoin To $100K By The End Of 2024Image: Shutterstock

G-III Apparel Group Beats Q1 Expectations with $0.12 EPS - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (NASDAQ: GIII) reported a robust performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended April 30, 2024. The company’s net sales were $609.7 million, a slight increase from $606.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net income significantly rose to $5.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $3.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the prior year’s quarter.



The company’s non-GAAP net income per diluted share remained steady at $0.12, as there were no non-GAAP adjustments during this period. Morris Goldfarb, G-III’s Chairman and CEO, attributed the strong start to fiscal 2025 to double-digit increases in DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld and a successful relaunch of Donna Karan. Goldfarb highlighted the company’s strategic investment in All We Wear Group (AWWG) to accelerate its European expansion.



Additionally, the amendment and extension of their ABL credit facility to $700 million, extending the maturity to 2029, further solidifies G-III’s financial position. With approximately $1 billion in cash and availability, the company is well-positioned to continue investing in its brands and infrastructure.



G-III Apparel Group Reports $0.12 EPS Against -$0.03 Expected



When comparing the current performance against expectations, G-III Apparel Group exceeded its earnings per share (EPS) projections. The expectations for the quarter were an EPS of -0.03, but the company delivered an EPS of $0.12 per diluted share. This notable performance was driven by strategic investments and a strong market response to their owned brands. Revenue expectations were set at $614.35 million. While the actual revenue of $609.7 million fell slightly short, the company’s overall financial health and strategic moves overshadowed this minor shortfall.



The increase in net income and EPS indicates effective cost management and successful brand investments. Despite the marginal miss on revenue expectations, the company’s ability to surpass EPS forecasts by a significant margin demonstrates strong operational efficiency. 





G-III Apparel Group Updates Full Year Outlook, Expects Net Sales of Approx. $3.2 Billion, EPS between $3.58 and $3.68



G-III Apparel Group has updated its fiscal 2025 outlook with cautious optimism. The company expects net sales of approximately $3.20 billion and net income between $170.0 million and $175.0 million, or between $3.58 and $3.68 per diluted share. This forecast compares to net sales of $3.10 billion and net income of $176.2 million, or $3.75 per diluted share, for fiscal 2024. The guidance reflects a balanced approach, considering incremental expenses associated with new product launches and marketing initiatives. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, G-III anticipates net sales of approximately $650.0 million, compared to $659.8 million in the same period last year. Net income is expected to range between $10.0 million and $15.0 million, or $0.22 and $0.32 per share, compared to $16.4 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the previous year’s second quarter. The guidance takes into account the ongoing investments in marketing and technology to support brand expansion and operational capabilities.

The GAAP net loss for the quarter was $(16.8) million, or $(0.12) per diluted common share, compared to a net income of $57.7 million, or $0.38 per diluted common share, in the fiscal second quarter of 2023. Adjusted (non-GAAP) net income was $39.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted common share, down from $110.4 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share, in the previous year.



The company saw a decline in various segments, with the Networking Platforms segment experiencing a significant revenue drop from $914.9 million in Q2 FY 2023 to $676.3 million in Q2 FY 2024. Despite the challenging environment, Ciena’s Global Services segment grew, increasing revenue from $127.8 million to $134.7 million year-over-year. CEO Gary Smith emphasized the company’s focus on extending its leadership in optical networking to meet the growing demand for bandwidth.



Ciena’s Adjusted EPS Drops Significantly Y/Y But Outperforms Expectations at $0.27 per Share



When comparing Ciena’s current performance against market expectations, the company slightly exceeded revenue expectations but fell short on earnings per share (EPS). Analysts had projected revenue of $895.5 million and an EPS of $0.14. Ciena reported actual revenue of $910.8 million, surpassing the revenue forecast by approximately $15.3 million. However, the adjusted EPS of $0.27 was significantly higher than the expected $0.14, indicating better-than-expected cost management and operational efficiency.



Despite the revenue beat, the year-over-year revenue and profitability decline highlights Ciena’s ongoing challenges. The gross margin slightly decreased from 43.1% to 42.7% on a GAAP basis, and the operating margin turned negative at (0.4%) compared to 9.1% in the previous year. The adjusted operating margin also declined from 13.8% to 6.8%, reflecting the impact of lower sales and higher operating expenses.





Ciena Repurchased Approximately 1.1 Million Shares for $57 Million



Ciena provided guidance for the upcoming quarters, emphasizing a cautious yet optimistic outlook. The company expects continued robust growth in bandwidth demand, which it plans to leverage by focusing on its core strengths in optical networking. Management highlighted that service providers are still working through existing inventory, which has impacted short-term sales but is expected to normalize over time.



The company also noted several key metrics expected to influence future performance. Cash and investments totaled $1.42 billion, and cash flow from operations was $58.5 million for the quarter. These strong liquidity positions provide Ciena with the financial flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and navigate market uncertainties. Additionally, the company repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $57.0 million, reflecting confidence in its long-term prospects.

Crypto expert PlanB drops bombshell Bitcoin prediction for June 2024


    After Bitcoin (BTC) has retaken the important psychological level at $71,000, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset seems to be moving towards the exceptionally bullish price target set by a renowned cryptocurrency analyst, who believes it might reach sooner rather than later.



Specifically, Bitcoin could hit the target price of “at least the $100,000 level we should see any time soon,” according to the analysis by pseudonymous crypto trading expert PlanB, who has shared his insights on the maiden crypto asset in a video streamed on his YouTube channel on June 1.

PlanB’s Bitcoin price prediction



Indeed, according to the crypto expert’s 200-week moving average (MA) chart, Bitcoin is looking at a price of $100,000 shortly, which coincides with his earlier shared stock-to-flow (S2F) model, which also sees the largest asset in the crypto sector by market capitalization rushing towards this high price mark.

Earlier in mid-May, PlanB argued that Bitcoin miner revenue tended to recover in two to five months after the halving, and after that, the price of Bitcoin “goes vertical.” As it happens, June 19 will mark two months since the last Bitcoin halving, so the vertical price action could occur shortly after that date.



Bitcoin price analysis



Currently, Bitcoin is changing hands at the price of $71,030, which suggests a modest increase of 0.12% in the last 24 hours while making more significant progress of 4.60% across the previous seven days, adding up to the advance of 11.50% over the past month, as per the latest chart data on June 6.

All things considered, Bitcoin could, indeed, hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $100,000 in the following weeks, as the crypto analyst has opined. However, things in the crypto market can sometimes change entirely, so doing one’s own research when investing is critical.

Vitalik Buterin slams celebrity memecoins, calls for "better direction" - AMBCrypto



Celebrities like Iggy Azalea launched memecoins, showcasing widespread crypto adoption among public figures.
Vitalik Buterin critiques celebrity memecoins, but community support remains strong.

In the year 2024, the trend of memecoins has gained considerable traction, with celebrities like Iggy Azalea, the American rapper, joining the fray by launching their own tokens, such as MOTHER IGGY on Solana [SOL]. 
Caitlyn Jenner, rappers Soul Ja Boy and Rich The Kid have also recently released their crypto tokens.
Buterin voices dissatisfaction!
However, Ethereum [ETH] co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed discontent with the surge of celebrity-endorsed memecoins and emphasized the necessity for more relevant projects in the crypto sphere. 
In his recent X post, Buterin noted, 
“I’m feeling quite unhappy about with ‘this cycle’s celebrity experimentation’ so far. ‘Financialization as a means toward an end’, I can respect if the end is worthy (healthcare, open source software, art, etc).’” 
He further added, 
“Ashton and Mila’s Stoner Cats was vastly more honorable than anything we’ve seen from this 2024 celebrity memecoin era – at least there was an actual show being funded. How do we push things in a better direction?” 
Here, Buterin discusses “Stoner Cats,” a webcomic by Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, lauded for its remarkable success in 2023. The SEC then charged the creators for an unregistered offering of NFTs. As per an SEC filling,  
“Stoner Cats sold its entire supply of NFTs in just 35 minutes, generating proceeds of over $8 million, most of which were then resold – not held as collectibles — in the secondary market within months.”
Buterin’s concerns regarding celebrities’ growing interest in memecoins raise a critical question: Is the future of cryptocurrency misdirected?
Buterin’s advice to scale celebrity-backed memecoins
In response, the Ethereum co-founder recommended various strategies to enhance celebrity-backed crypto ventures, focusing on public benefit, engaging content, and project sustainability. He suggested,

Memecoin craze despite crictsism
On the community front, reactions appear largely supportive of memecoins, as observed by researcher Gumshoe in their recent X post. 
“Iggy went from being called a scammer to having Vitalik and Ethereum OGs discussing the celebrity memecoin meta in a week. Pretty amazing if you ask me.” 
Despite Buterin’s expressed concerns about memecoins, which stemmed from a tweet by Chris Burniske, Mother Iggy experienced a notable 40% surge in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum saw a more modest increase of 1.16% at the time of writing.
All in all, ‘Aden | The Wolf of X’ put it best when he said, 
“#Memecoin season 2024 unstoppable.”

Shiba Inu's 2024 Roadmap: Team Member Outlines Key Developments So Far | Bitcoinist.com


								In a detailed update, Lucie, a well-known member of the Shiba Inu team and marketing head has outlined several key developments and achievements for the project in 2024. The successful introduction of Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s ground-breaking layer-2 blockchain solution intended to improve scalability and transaction efficiency, was one of Lucie’s many highlights of the noteworthy progress accomplished thus far.
These advancements highlight Shiba Inu’s continuous dedication to expansion and innovation, setting the project up for long-term success in the rapidly changing cryptocurrency market.
Major Developments For Shiba Inu In 2024
Shiba Inu team member, Lucie started with the Shibarium blockchain solution. Lucie noted that since the solution was introduced it has advanced significantly, improving the scalability and efficiency of the Shiba ecosystem.

Launched in August 2023, the blockchain marked a significant step for the project’s ecosystem, attracting millions of users during its first few weeks. Shibarium aims at tackling scalability, which was one of the main issues facing the Shiba Inu ecosystem. 
With a sharp reduction in transaction prices, Shibarium seeks to ease customers’ long-standing complaints about Ethereum’s high gas expenses. This presents a positive image, suggesting that Shibarium may establish Shiba Inu as a strong challenger for DeFi.
SHIBdentity is the next development pointed out by the marketing lead. The team introduced the initiative to usher in a new era of digital identity. It aims at giving users full control of their digital identity by employing valid credentials that can be verified and trustworthy authentification. 
Moreover, it provides real-time communication, spam reduction, and private peer-to-peer chat. In order to provide human-readable names and foster friendly messaging, SHIBdentity will need to communicate with Shib Name Service (SNS).
The next key development is the introduction of Shiba Inu’s SHEboshis Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) collections. For those interested in NFTs, these collections pave the way for the development of hybrid tokens that provide shared ownership and uniqueness.
SHEboshi collections consist of 20,000 unique arts, launched as a DN404/ERC-404 token on the Ethereum network. It is important to note that SHEboshis, which embodies creativity, art, and the spirit of the SHIB community, marks a bold step into the future.
Upcoming Layer 3 Blockchain
Lucie also underscored the project’s much-anticipated Privacy-Focused Layer 3 Blockchain Development. This layer 3 blockchain intends to improve user privacy by enabling computations on encrypted data without the need for decryption.

So far, the team has managed to raise $12 million in funding to develop the blockchain. As part of the investment round, the yet-to-be-released TREAT was sold to a group of venture capital firms that included Animoca Brands, Polygon Ventures, Big Brain Holdings, and Shima Capital, among others.
Lucie further emphasized that Shiba Inu’s attendance at the Token2049 conference in Dubai was another significant achievement for the project this year. Midway through April, Shiba Inu took part in the event as a gold sponsor.
Lastly, the marketing lead underlined the integration of ShibaSwap, the native decentralized exchange (DEX) of the Shiba Inu ecosystem on the Shibarium blockchain. A key component of this integration is to improve the capacity of users to directly impact the ecosystem of the solution by generating new liquidity pools for the tokens they desire.

Avalanche strengthens the security of its native wallet

The cryptographic ecosystem of Avalanche is looking to increase the security of its infrastructure by implementing external web3 solutions.
Today Core, the native wallet of Avalanche developed by Ava Labs, announced a strategic partnership with the provider Blockaid, which provides a suite of tools to simulate transactions before their actual execution and avoid cyber scams such as phishing and hack.
Security is a very important topic within the crypto sector, where from 2017 to today hacking activities have been carried out for a total damage of 8.2 billion dollars.
Let’s see everything in detail below.

Avalanche Core forms a partnership with Blockaid to prevent phishing and hacks within its ecosystem
Today Core, the famous Avalanche cryptocurrency wallet developed by the parent company Ava Labs, revealed an integration with the Israeli provider of web3 security solutions Blockaid, with the aim of making its infrastructures impenetrable and offering users a convenient tool that highlights the presence of danger factors.
In detail, Blockaid uses highly sophisticated technology that allows transactions to be simulated before being executed by the user, enabling the identification and prevention of potential fraudulent activities such as phishing attacks, address poisoning, and hacks.
One of the biggest current limitations of decentralized non-custodial wallets is that when performing any operation (signature, approve spending, execution, etc.), it is not intuitively clear what is being confirmed, unless the underlying code is examined.
It often happens that several individuals are scammed precisely because they end up on malicious sites that invite them to connect their wallet and approve seemingly legitimate transactions, but which then end up emptying all the funds contained within: see case Ledger Connect Kit.
Blockaid solves this problem thanks to its warning interface that allows examining each step in real-time by leveraging the extensive database of web3 threats possessed by the Israeli security company.
This service has been integrated in the past also by other similar web3 providers to Avalanche Core like Coinbase wallet and Metamask, helping various communities to keep up with the advancement and refinement of cyber scams.
The integration of Blockaid with one of the main infrastructures of Avalanche addresses the needs of the DeFi sector, which from 20217 to today has seen 8.2 billion dollars lost due to hacks and exploits. More recently, in April 2023, about 53 million dollars were stolen from various types of attacks.
The solution just integrated on Avalanche Core, in the past has helped other ecosystems to protect approximately 7.1 billion dollars, warning of potentially malicious operations for 500 million dollars.
Source: https://www.blockaid.io/
Regarding the excellent news, Akash Gupta, Head of Consumer Products at Ava Labs, the company that oversees the development of the Avalanche ecosystem, stated the following:
“This collaboration with Blockaid represents a significant step forward in providing users with security and control without compromising speed and ease of use. By integrating advanced security solutions into the Core suite, we ensure that users can explore the Avalanche ecosystem and beyond with complete peace of mind.”
Promoting high security and privacy standards within the decentralized finance industry is essential in order to move on to new onboarding challenges and truly aim for mass adoption. 
Avalanche is doing it the right way.
Other web3 tools focused on security and privacy
In addition to Blockaid, there are many other tools focused on the security and privacy of web3 transactions, which can be used by users of Avalanche and other ecosystems.
The most well-known is definitely Wallet Guard, an open-source extension for Chrome, iOS, and Brave that guides the end user through all cryptographic operations, providing pop-ups that explain what is being authorized when confirming a smart contract.
Wallet Guard, which also features a convenient security dashboard, has protected over 40 million dollars from scam activities, thanks to its timely alerts regarding potential frauds and hack.

Another very interesting service is that of Blowfish, available on Solana and on 14 EVM networks like Avalanche, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, which thanks to its interface warns users who are visiting fraudulent web3 sites.
Blowfish also warns if it perceives that the content of a tx being signed appears dangerous and explains what is being authorized when signing each smart contract and which funds will be used.

In order to safeguard one’s digital finances, the website Revoke.Cash is a must, which allows users to simply remove, through a unified dashboard, all previously signed token spending approvals, avoiding potential complications in case of a platform hack.
It often happens that when using a DEX and you have to approve the spending of a token, the authorization is not canceled at the end of the operation, leaving an attack vector for scammers and hackers.
Revoke works on over 80 decentralized networks, including Avalanche.

Among the other useful services in terms of web3 security, capable of preventing cyber attacks and saving our finances, we find Stelo, TrustCheck, Fire, Pocket Universe, AegisWeb3, and Web3 Antivirus.

Cardano’s (ADA) Future: Investors’ Decisions Are Crucial


Cardano’s (ADA) price is not reaping the benefits of the broader market cues as it remains sideways bound.
The reason is that no one other than the ADA whales opted to sell, creating a bearish atmosphere.
Cardano Whales Selling Sends Bearish Ripples

Cardano’s price has been influenced by its investors in the past, and this influence has only grown stronger now. The best example is the recent move from ADA whales, which the altcoin can still not recover from.
Addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA sold over 290 million ADA in a single day at the end of May. This $130 million worth of supply could likely have been to either secure gains or prevent further losses.
Regardless, since such large wallet holders’ selling and buying affect the direction of the price action, it wasn’t surprising that ADA consolidated following the selling.

However, this could change, and the investors who caused the dip also have the power to do so. At the time of writing, the addresses conducting transactions on the network have registered a surge.
Cardano’s growing participation is a positive sign for the asset, which translates to increased demand and higher liquidity. However, the mixed cues generated could lead to consolidation. Plus, rising participation combined with falling prices or slow growth creates a deviation between the two.

This deviation tends to flash a sell single, which causes further issues with the price action.
ADA Price Prediction: Breakout Will Be a While Away
Cardano’s price moved within a symmetrical triangle for two months. A symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern characterized by converging trendlines connecting a series of sequential peaks and troughs. 

This pattern typically indicates a period of consolidation before the price breaks out in the direction of the existing trend. While the outcome is likely bullish, this would warrant further sideways movement before something substantial. This would require ADA first to secure the $0.46 as a support floor.

Considering the aforementioned factors, bearish-neutral price action will likely continue its sideways movement.
However, if $0.46 is tested as a support floor, the bearish thesis could be invalidated. As a result, ADA could also rise to $0.50 and above, effectively eliminating all recent losses.

It’s time to end the SEC's war on crypto - Blockworks


The American government is badly damaged — we need public servants who care more about right or wrong, especially when it comes to the crypto industry.
I’m not denying that there are reasonable questions about how crypto firms should be regulated. Many policy questions still require legislation to resolve. But, our current system is broken.
The Securities and Exchange Commission traditionally does not expose itself and its credibility to an appellate beatdown. But this SEC is different. This SEC and Chair Gary Gensler have an extra-regulatory anti-crypto agenda. And they are using their power to obstruct and delay the industry — imposing their own preferences where they can. 
Gensler may not like bitcoin. But whether you decide to invest in bitcoin is up to you, not the SEC. 
What’s going on with Gensler at the SEC is clearly a culture of bad faith against crypto.  
Take January’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, which only came after years of good-faith applications from crypto industry participants. The SEC was helpless to explain or defend its decision to reject past spot bitcoin ETFs — not a leg to stand on, it was truly an embarrassment. The court then ruled that the SEC position was “arbitrary and capricious.” And ultimately, Chair Gensler was forced to vote to approve a bitcoin ETF he was hell-bent to obstruct.  
Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton provide a safe and easy way for US investors to buy bitcoin. They easily satisfy the SEC’s investor protection standards; they are in the best interest of the investors the SEC is sworn to protect. And three months after their launch, bitcoin ETFs hold $61 billion in assets.  
Or, take the recent SEC vs DEBT Box fiasco. Two SEC lawyers leading an anti-crypto action were forced to resign after a federal judge sanctioned the agency for “gross abuse of power.”
The SEC misled the court to get a temporary restraining order against crypto firm DEBT Box. This action was ex parte — without any notice to DEBT Box. They violated the court’s trust.
Forced to resign? After that debacle, the SEC should have turned off the lawyers’ key cards before they got back to the office. But maybe they were following marching orders. 
Where do we go from here?
This lack of communication between regulators and crypto participants has been going on for years, and needs to change. Many other issues in crypto could be navigated in good faith if regulators simply engaged with the industry. 
Back in 2021, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong found that the SEC was the only government branch unwilling to meet with the firm. Coinbase is a public company. And it is now in litigation with the SEC relating to questions that could have been discussed and resolved in good faith back in 2021. 
But good faith left the building when Gary Gensler walked in. 
For example, take now the public spectacle of Gensler in front of Congress in April 2023, when he evaded the fundamental question of whether crypto’s second largest asset, ETH, is a security. Documents in the Consensys lawsuit against the SEC describe how the agency was pursuing an investigation into the nature of ETH days before Gensler testified.
Frustrating.  
“Chair Gensler refused to answer questions regarding the SEC’s classification of ether,” Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) said on X. “New court filings show this was an intentional attempt to misrepresent the commission’s position.”  
Ethereum, established in 2015, has a market value of $457 billion. We should have a public statement from the SEC on this one. And to add to the federal regulatory charade, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission went to court this year claiming Ethereum is a commodity and not a security for the purpose of federal regulation. Do these guys talk to each other? 
If the SEC thinks Ethereum is a security, why not just say it? That’s an important question. If you are not steeped in crypto, you may struggle to answer it. But regulatory clarity unlocks the potential of the industry. And Gensler does not want that to happen. He has an agenda unrelated to his job as a regulator, and he is backed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, founder of the “anti-crypto army,” the world’s smallest and most unpopular political unit. 
Why should we care about crypto? 
Here’s why: Crypto is a disruptive transition of the kind this country normally leads and dominates. Capital and talent are gravitating to the industry. 
Crypto orchestrates the deployment of capital to overcome seemingly insurmountable barriers to entry. Look at how the US dollar stablecoin — the digital version of the US dollar with over $140 billion in circulation — is disrupting banking and payments. And incidentally, fostering the globalization of the dollar to the benefit of all Americans. 
We need a good faith regulator to get in the room with the adults in the crypto industry. We need to move past untethered regulatory obstruction. Goodbye Gary Gensler, hello honest reform.

Apart from Mastercard, the Binance-branded Visa card has also resumed functionality on the exchange, in addition to allowing payments using Mastercard.”

Mastercard and Visa ended their card partnership with Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, last August.
While it was stated that Binance's problems with regulators around the world were behind these moves by Mastercard and Visa, a Binance spokesperson told Bloomberg that Visa stopped issuing new cards co-branded with Binance in Europe as of July.

Roger Ver released on $160K bail as US seeks extradition


Roger Ver, a.k.a. ‘Bitcoin Jesus,’ was ordered to give up his passport and released on bail by Spanish authorities as the US seeks his extradition over tax fraud charges.  
That’s according to documents seen by Bloomberg that reveal his €150,000 ($163,000) bail, which began on May 17, was granted on the condition that he stay in Spain. 
Ver is also required to visit a Spanish court every two days. Prosecutors attempted to appeal his release but this was rejected. 
The bitcoin investor was arrested in late April after the US accused him of defrauding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) out of more than $48 million. Just days before his arrest, Ver published his new book Hijacking Bitcoin, which is his own version of Bitcoin’s 2015-2017 blocksize wars.

Ver, who owned companies MemoryDealers.com Inc. and Agilestar.com Inc., started buying up bitcoin for himself and his firms, publicizing the purchases and earning his famous nickname.
The IRS alleges, that he ‘concealed and provided false information to his various advisors regarding the number and value of bitcoins he owned and controlled both personally and through his companies.’
Bloomberg reports that Ver’s lawyer, Jaime Campaner, claimed he “is not a fugitive at all, since he has been in touch with the US authorities through his Californian lawyers.” 
“Therefore, he was aware of the investigation and, in my opinion, his arrest didn’t make sense,” he said.

Prison Sentence for the Student Who Issued Altcoins from the Chinese Court! Here's Why! - Bitcoin Sistemi

A 24-year-old university student in China, known for its bans on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, published a token on BNBChain.
This token was the subject of a lawsuit and the court sentenced the Chinese student for fraud.


According to local news agency Thepaper, Chinese university student Yang Qichao launched an altcoin called BFF on BNBChain.
Qichao, who added liquidity to the altcoin named BFF and then withdrew it, caused the price of the altcoin he issued to drop suddenly.





The court sentenced Qichao to 4 years and 6 months in prison on the grounds that he caused an investor to lose 50,000 USDT by withdrawing liquidity.
While the court imposed a fine of 30,000 yuan in addition to the prison sentence, Yang Qichao and his lawyers argued that he did not commit fraud.


Yang and his lawyers argued that the investors who bought the crypto called BFF were experienced and had been trading crypto money for a long time.
Lawyers also stated that investors clearly know the risks inherent in the BFF token and said:






“This investor is an experienced cryptocurrency investor and knows the risks.
Additionally, this investor still holds BFF tokens. At this point, the BFF tokens he held gained value due to the increased liquidity after the event. Therefore, there is no harm to the victim.
“There is no fraud involved.”

Hoskinson: Cardano Will Propel the Industry Towards Solving Real-World Issues | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 5 June 2024, Charles Hoskinson, the visionary behind Cardano, took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to address the ongoing disconnect between the perception and reality of Cardano within the cryptocurrency community. His detailed post not only highlighted the significant advancements and upcoming milestones for Cardano but also criticized the negative media narratives that often overshadow the project’s true potential. 



Charles Hoskinson is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency world, known for his significant contributions to blockchain technology. He co-founded Ethereum and later founded Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), which later got rebranded to Input Output Global (IOG), one of the three main companies supporting Cardano and its ecosystem.



Hoskinson studied mathematics and cryptography at Metropolitan State University of Denver and the University of Colorado Boulder, though he did not complete his Ph.D. He became involved in the blockchain industry early on, contributing to the development of BitShares and Ethereum. At Ethereum, Hoskinson played a crucial role in its early development and the creation of its initial coin offering (ICO)​​​​.



In 2015, Hoskinson co-founded IOHK with Jeremy Wood, aiming to build a blockchain platform grounded in rigorous scientific research and secure programming practices. This led to the creation of Cardano, launched in 2017. Cardano distinguishes itself from other blockchains by using the Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol, which enhances its security and scalability​.



Hoskinson’s post began with a poignant observation about the stark contrast between the cryptocurrency media’s portrayal of Cardano and the project’s actual fundamentals. Despite numerous advancements and a robust roadmap, media coverage often questions the viability of Cardano. This disconnect, according to Hoskinson, is not only misleading but also undermines the genuine progress made by the Cardano community.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

One of the central highlights of Hoskinson’s post was the announcement of the Chang hard fork, which he described as the most significant in Cardano’s history. Scheduled for the second quarter of 2024, this upgrade is set to usher in the Voltaire era, a phase focused on decentralized governance. The Chang hard fork will enable on-chain community consensus, allowing ADA holders to use their tokens to vote on proposals. This shift towards community-run governance is a pivotal step towards full decentralization, positioning Cardano as a leader in blockchain governance.



Hoskinson underscored the rapid growth of community-driven decentralized applications (DApps) and the strides made in scaling research and development. Technologies like Hydra, which aims to enhance Cardano’s scalability, were mentioned as key developments that are maturing and contributing to the network’s robustness. Hydra’s potential to significantly improve transaction throughput while maintaining decentralization is crucial for Cardano’s scalability.



Moreover, the introduction of partner chains (such as Midnight) and Atala PRISM were highlighted as significant advancements. These technologies are expected to bolster Cardano’s infrastructure, providing more efficient and secure solutions for various blockchain applications.



In addition to technological advancements, Hoskinson pointed to several major events that are poised to further strengthen the Cardano community. These include taking part in Rare EVO event, a blockchain conference that is being held August 15-17, 2024, in Las Vegas, and Token 2049, a leading crypto conference being held September 18-19, 2024 in Singapore. Such events not only foster community engagement but also provide a platform for showcasing Cardano’s progress and future plans.



A significant portion of Hoskinson’s post was dedicated to addressing the negative media coverage that often surrounds Cardano. He criticized the media for focusing on sensationalist headlines like “Will Cardano die?” instead of acknowledging the substantial progress made by the project. According to Hoskinson, this kind of coverage reflects a low-quality, low-effort approach that fails to recognize the real advancements within the Cardano ecosystem.

Popular Metaverse Altcoin Received Large Institutional Investment! There is an increase in price! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Popular metaverse altcoin The Sandbox has raised $20 million to expand its creator economy in the open metaverse.

Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu said the following about the investment:

“McKinsey estimates that metadata could add $5 trillion to the global economy by 2030.
Today, games like Minecraft and Roblox are some of the most popular games in the world, but they do not provide digital property rights to their users. Sandbox represents the evolution of UGC gaming for the age of digital ownership.”

ETH Heading to Zero Against Bitcoin - Max Keiser Gives Key Reasons

Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser has again poured harsh criticism on the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization value, Ethereum, giving the community reasons why he believes that ETH is a loser compared to Bitcoin.He stated that ultimately Ethereum will crash to zero against BTC.Max Keiser's arguments against EthereumFormer financial commentator and Wall Street trader Max Keiser has published a tweet in which he once again slammed Ethereum. Keiser has done the same before, not only with ETH but also with XRP, ADA, SOL and other altcoins since he as a Bitcoin maxi considers any crypto except Bitcoin to be centralized and an unregistered security.This time, however, the rigorous Bitcoiner strengthened his BTC advocacy against ETH with several key reasons why he believes ETH is “heading to zero against Bitcoin.”Keiser stated that Ethereum is not a commodity (like Bitcoin is), and it does not run on the proof-of-work algorithm as Bitcoin does, and which ensures its decentralized aspects. Keiser also revealed that in El Salvador, where he currently lives and works as Bitcoin adviser to president Nayib Bukele, Ethereum, along with all other altcoins, is classified as an unregistered security. Bitcoin was classified by the SEC as a commodity due to its decentralized nature, as was Ethereum later. However, recently, debates are again increasing on this subject, and it is unclear whether ETH will keep its beneficial status as a commodity.Recently, the SEC regulator gave preliminary approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, but to achieve this, issuers had to remove the staking option from their filings. This is because, recently, the SEC filed legal charges against U.S. exchanges Coinbase and Kraken for their staking offerings to clients, and ETH was included on that list among other altcoins.Samson Mow ridicules VanEck's $22,000 ETH predictionAnother prominent Bitcoin maximalist, Samson Mow, has published a tweet in which he shared his take on the recent Ethereum prediction made by VanEck.@vaneck_us tweeted that they have increased their ETH price target to $22,000 by 2030. This decision was influenced by the news of the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, the progress that Ethereum developers have been making with scaling the blockchain and also based on VanEck’s reading of on-chain data.Samson Mow, finding that highly unlikely, reacted just with one word: “LMAO.”

“Send Crypto” Is Red Alert For Remote Workers, FBI Highli...


                                FBI Warns of Rising Work-From-Home Scams: Protect Your Crypto                                The FBI has recently warned the public about a new trend of employment fraud particularly for work-from-home positions to con people out of their cryptocurrency. Since the COVID-19 pandemic forced many individuals to start working from home, fraudsters have become more active and promised people big money for small tasks, such as rating restaurants or clicking buttons.What's the News?On June 4, the FBI noted that a new trend is the use of fake job offers for remote workers. These Crypto scams work in a way that the fraudster initiates the contact through a call or a message and offers simple and legal-looking tasks. This is because victims are made to think that they are earning some money through other interfaces, which are never accessible.The deception escalates when the scammers demand money in the form of cryptocurrency from the victims to ‘access’ more work from their employers. Such payments reach the scammers directly. The FBI's warning is clear: if a job post involves sending cryptocurrency as part of the job, then the job is most certainly a scam.Impacts of the ScamThe effect of these scams is not only measured in monetary terms but also terms of psychological well-being. This is because most people are attracted to remote work. After all, they believe that it will help them balance their work and personal life. This desire is manipulated by the scammers, and the victims end up dedicating their time and resources to what seems to be a genuine business venture.The global remote workforce statistics reveal that the percentage was 28% by the end of 2023 as stated by Statista. This growing trend means that there are more targets for these scammers to prey on, and that is a good thing. The FBI's recent data paints a grim picture where cryptocurrency investment losses significantly increased from $2.57 billion in the year 2022 to approximately $3.94 billion in the year 2023 with an increase of 53%. This surge is a clear indication that the public should be more cautious especially those who are seeking jobs.Prevention TipsTo avoid falling victim to these scams, the FBI recommends looking out for several red flags. Beware of job descriptions that frequently use the term "optimization" without clear context and positions that don't require references or a thorough recruitment process. Genuine employers typically follow standard hiring procedures, including interviews and background checks.Always verify job offers by researching the company and confirming job listings on official websites. Also, be Skeptical of upfront payments, Check Contact Information whether the company is legitimate or will provide verifiable contact details. The most important thing is to report Suspicious Activity if you encounter a potential scam, report it to authorities immediately.ConclusionAs the concept of remote work becomes increasingly popular, the imagination of fraudsters does not remain idle either. The FBI’s warning is a timely call for everyone to be alert all the time. In this way, job seekers can prevent their hard-earned money from falling prey to these scams and become a statistic for the rising cases of cryptocurrency fraud.Work-from-home scams are a part of a general increase in the cybercrime rate, based on the progress in technology and people’s behavior. The best form of protection against such elaborate scams is to remain informed and to be wary. With the new normal of working from home now a reality, it is crucial to safeguard one’s assets, especially in the emerging cryptocurrency market.Also Read: US Antitrust Chief’s Vision For Preventing AI Monopoly

Ethereum Whale Moves $33.55 Million in ETH to Coinbase: Details

An Ethereum (ETH) whale has transferred 8,710 ETH, valued at approximately $33.55 million, to Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges. The transaction was highlighted by Whale Alert, a service that tracks large crypto transactions. The transfer has sparked speculation that this whale might be preparing to sell a large portion of their holdings.Such moves are closely watched by the crypto community, as they can significantly impact market dynamics. Given the recent rally in Ethereum’s price, it is plausible that the whale intends to capitalize on the gains. Over the last 30 days, the ETH price has surged by 22.15%, and it is currently trading at $3,849, up 1.20% in the past 24 hours.Market context and implicationsEthereum’s recent price performance has been robust, driven by a confluence of factors, including market optimism and broader adoption trends. The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds) has been a major catalyst. These ETFs are expected to begin trading in the coming weeks, and many analysts believe that their introduction will further fuel Ethereum’s price appreciation.The approval of these ETFs marks a significant milestone for the leading altcoin, providing traditional investors with a new avenue to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. This could potentially lead to increased demand and higher prices. Analysts are bullish on Ethereum’s outlook, predicting that the price could surge as these ETFs launch and attract more institutional and retail investment.Whale transactions, particularly those involving large amounts of cryptocurrency being moved to exchanges, are often seen as precursors to market volatility. Historically, large sell-offs have sometimes led to short-term dips in price, but the overall upward trajectory is driven by strong fundamentals, and increasing adoption tends to mitigate long-term concerns.As the crypto community closely monitors this whale’s next moves, the broader market focus remains on the upcoming trading of Ethereum ETFs. The anticipation is high, and many believe that Ethereum is on the cusp of another significant rally. For now, Ethereum stands strong, backed by positive market sentiment and strategic developments that promise to enhance its market position even further.

The CEO of Tether challenges the MiCA rules on stablecoins and crypto

Paolo Ardoino, CEO di Tether, has recently expressed criticism towards the MiCA regulations of the EU, arguing that the rules on risky bank deposits compromise the security of stablecoins and limit access to the crypto market. 
Let’s see all the details below. 

The new MiCA regulations hinder crypto and stablecoin: the opinion of the CEO of Tether
As anticipated, the CEO of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, has criticized the upcoming regulation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), particularly the rule that requires stablecoin issuers to hold reserves in bank deposits.
This criticism comes as the cryptocurrency industry prepares for the implementation of these regulations on June 30, with many platforms like Binance moving their operations to Europe. 
Ardoino expressed concern that the MiCA provision, which requires that 60% of stablecoin reserves be bank deposits, could complicate and make riskier the operations of stablecoins. 
He also noted that the European Central Bank only insures bank deposits up to 100,000 euros. An amount therefore negligible compared to the market capitalization of stablecoins like Tether’s USDt, which stands at about 110 billion dollars.
Furthermore, Ardoino raised concerns based on recent events, such as the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank, which demonstrated the vulnerability of large uninsured bank deposits. 
He indeed highlighted the risks for stablecoins like Tether’s USDT, primarily supported by US Treasury bills compared to bank deposits, extending the focus on this aspect.
According to Ardoino, in the event of a bank failure, bank deposits are protected by bankruptcy laws, which could be harmful to stablecoin issuers. 
However, Tether currently invests the majority of its reserves in short-term U.S. government bonds, which are cash equivalents and can be sold immediately. 
Questa strategia offre maggiore sicurezza in caso di fallimento di una banca, permettendo il recupero rapido dei titoli.
MiCA Regulation: the adaptation of the main crypto exchanges 
As the deadline approaches, major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Kraken are ready to review their products in Europe. 
For example, Binance announced that from June 30 it will limit the use of “unauthorized” stablecoins, in line with the implementation of MiCA regulations.
This move reflects the general trend in the crypto sector, with the exchanges preparing for the new rules by trying to minimize the impact on their European customers. 
The decision of Binance to limit certain functionalities rather than completely delist some coins shows the flexibility of the exchange in responding to the changing regulatory environment.
In an interview, the CEO of Tether emphasized that the bank deposit requirement stipulated by MiCA could affect European stablecoin users. 
Ardoino observed that this new regime could make stablecoins less available to European users, who are generally more sophisticated and liquid, thus threatening their stability and reliability. 
According to him, it is a step backward for Europe, as it could have a negative impact on the availability and security of stablecoins for European investors and users.

The Value Locked in the Decentralized Finance Protocol Reached 20 Billion Dollars! It Became the Second Largest DeFi! - Bitcoin Sistemi

EigenLayer, a leading restructuring protocol, reached a major milestone as its total value locked (TVL) exceeded $20.09 billion.
EigenLayer's Total Locked Value Exceeds $20 Billion, Becoming the Second Largest DeFi Protocol
This success positions EigenLayer as the second largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol behind Lido.


Since the beginning of the year, EigenLayer's TVL has experienced significant growth, rising from $1.4 billion to over $20 billion, or approximately 5.21 million Ethereum.
At the beginning of March, EigenLayer's TVL was valued at $10 billion, equivalent to 2.93 million Ethereum. The recent increase in TVL can be attributed to increased inflows and the increase in Ethereum price.





EigenLayer's mainnet launched in April, and the protocol allows users to deposit Ethereum and various liquid staking tokens to secure third-party networks.
Following its launch, the protocol saw a significant increase in deposits, driven by its token distribution plan.



However, this period also witnessed significant outflows due to low individual airdrop allocations and community dissatisfaction with the token's non-transferability.
In response, the Eigen Foundation expanded airdrop allocations for all users and clarified the timeline for token unlocking and transferability.





These adjustments helped ease concerns and were followed by a renewed increase in inflows.
The Eigen Foundation has reserved 15% of its 1.6 billion token supply for user distribution across multiple stakedrop seasons, with 5% allocated as of March 2024. The protocol is currently in its second stakedrop season.

The Shiba Inu community is being urged to exercise caution following a crucial warning about an increasing number of scams on Telegram.Fraudsters are impersonating official Shiba Inu ecosystem Twitter accounts on Telegram, particularly those related to Shibarium and Treat, in an attempt to deceive and defraud users.Scammers are exploiting the popularity of the Shiba Inu ecosystem by creating fake Telegram accounts that mimic the official Shiba Inu X (Twitter) handles.These fraudulent accounts have identical names to the official Shiba Inu X accounts and are intended to mislead users into believing they are engaging with legitimate Shiba Inu projects, thereby gaining their trust and potentially stealing their assets.In this light, Shibarmy Scam Alerts, or @susbarium, an X account dedicated to exposing scams, has issued a safety warning for the Shiba Inu community to beware of fake Telegram accounts as scammers impersonate official Shiba Inu ecosystem accounts. According to the Shiba Inu-focused X account, the Shiba Inu tea runs the @Shibariumnet and @Treatsforshib accounts on X. The story is different on Telegram as these accounts are run by scammers.The Shiba Inu community is urged to stay vigilant and cautious when interacting with Telegram accounts. They should always verify identities as well as any announcements or offers against the official Shiba Inu website and X accounts. They should also never disclose personal information, private keys or wallet seed phrases to anyone purporting to represent Shiba Inu. This is because official representatives would never ask for such sensitive information.As reported, the Shiba Inu team is not conducting token airdrops, nor are any giveaways planned for the immediate future; thus, the SHIB community is urged to remain skeptical of such claims.Overall, the key message is to stay safe, never to click on suspicious links and to refrain from sharing wallet keys or personal information with anyone.

Bitcoin investors unimpressed with Kerrisdale Capital report on Riot Platforms


Kerrisdale Capital’s Sahm Adrangi, who has been earning something of a reputation in the crypto industry, has short-sold Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT). RIOT was trading at $9.85 per share when Adrangi tweeted a couple minutes prior to NASDAQ’s 9:30am open. Within an hour, it had dropped 10% to $8.84. 
The move seemed to vindicate the privileged, Miami Beach-based fund manager, whose aggressive media appearances have given the crypto community little reason to support him. Indeed, until now, he’s perhaps best known for making a few million dollars flipping a mansion and getting arrested at 3am in the Hamptons on charges of driving while drunk and high on cocaine.
Adrangi’s initial capital came mostly from his family, with a New York Magazine profile revealing that he started in 2009 with “$300,000 of his and his parents’ money.”
On Wednesday, he equated his unremarkable stock trade to “a war against bitcoin miners” and called the workers who secure the world’s most important blockchain “an industry of snake oil salesmen that are incinerating both investor capital and the environment.”

Critics respond to Kerrisdale Capital report on Riot Platforms
Critics have labeled Adrangi a Karen and laughed at his fund’s underperformance. They highlighted his losing trades, such as his short-sale of Uranium Energy Corporation on March 23, 2023, which has doubled in price since he bet against the company.
In his report, Adrangi wrote that “Riot incinerates cash” and correctly noted that it has “increased its shares outstanding 6-fold” via dilutive share offerings. Because Riot has diluted its shares, its price has declined 43% year-to-date despite bitcoin itself rallying 60%. Adrangi predicts that Riot will continue to dilute shareholders indefinitely.

Bitcoin miners responded to some of the allegations in Kerrisdale Capital’s report. A miner who worked inside Riot’s Rockdale mine debunked Adrangi’s safety concerns around fluid flammability and arc flashes and called Adrangi’s complaints about the company’s receipt of Texan government subsidies via ERCOT ​​naïve. Overall, the miner predicted Kerrisdale would lose money on its short-sale.
After the first hour of trading down in response to the report, Riot shares steadily recovered. As of pre-market trading on Friday, the stock was back to $9.49 — barely changed from the initial report and well within the range of the past 30 days.

Kiyosaki's $350K Bitcoin price prediction: Too far-fetched? - AMBCrypto



BTC could hit $350K in two months per Kiyosaki. 
However, the level is way too bold to be achieved statistically in 2024. 

Industry titans and market analysts expect Bitcoin [BTC] to breach its current $60K – $71K price consolidation range before end-year. For Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz, the end-2024 target was $100K if the $73K ATH was cleared. 
Another crypto analyst, PlanB, saw $500K per BTC as a possible fete in the current market bull run. 
However, Rober Kiyosaki, an entrepreneur and author of ‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad,’ has made a bold prediction – $350K per BTC in the next two months. 
‘BITCOIN will be $350,000 by August 25, 2024, is not a lie. It’s a prediction. It’s speculation, it’s an opinion, but it’s not a lie.’
Kiyosaki added that the prediction was possible because of ‘the incompetence of our leaders, President Biden, Treasury Secretary Yellin and Fed Chair Powell.’
Is $350K per BTC too optimistic?
However, another renowned crypto analyst, Willy Woo, deemed Kiyosaki’s projection too bold to be achieved within such a short timeframe. The move to $350K per BTC would mean 5X in two months. 
Maybe in 2025, Woo noted, 
‘Statistically possible in 2025 if monetary debasement resumes. Next to no chance in 2024 outside of a bullish black swan.’ 
Interestingly, the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model confirmed Woo’s argument and forecasted that $350K per BTC was only possible in March 2025. 
Source: Look Into Bitcoin
The S2F model, based on BTC’s supply schedule, has fairly predicted BTC’s future price prospects in the past. Given that mined BTC reduce with time, BTC supply also declines and the S2F ratio value increases with time. 
That’s why, according to the model, BTC’s value is expected to rise as supply reduces in the future. Based on the model, BTC could hit $80K – $85K in August 2024, as opposed to the $350K projected by Kiyosaki. 
Source: BTC/USDT, TradingView
In the meantime, BTC could ease back to the short-term demand, which was a previous supply of around $70K, before going higher to the $72K mark. 
The Coinglass liquidity data supported the scenario, showing key magnetic levels for price action at $70K and $72.3K, as shown by the orange levels.

Argentina Says Yes To Cardano: Wil ADA Hit $0.50 From Blockchain Allliance?


								This week marked a significant advancement in Argentina’s embrace of blockchain technology as the Cardano Foundation partnered with Entre Ríos, a central province.

Argentina’s Crypto Potential
This strategic alliance marks a turning point for both parties, with Cardano aiming to tango its way into the vibrant Argentine crypto scene and Entre Ríos seeking a skilled partner to lead the way in blockchain adoption.
The official signing ceremony between Governor Rogelio Frigerio and Cardano’s Rafael Fraga caused a stir in the South American nation. Although the details of the partnership are undisclosed, there is widespread speculation.
Industry insiders believe it could involve educational programs, fostering a developer ecosystem, or even exploring pilot projects for government services on the Cardano blockchain.


This move fits perfectly with Argentina’s recent crypto-friendly turn. President Javier Milei, a vocal advocate for digital assets, has championed initiatives like legalizing cryptocurrency use in contracts and collaborating with El Salvador to understand Bitcoin adoption.
The Cardano partnership aligns with this vision, potentially providing Argentina with the technical expertise to establish itself as a regional blockchain hub.
For Cardano, the allure of Argentina is undeniable. The nation boasts a tech-savvy population and a government actively embracing crypto. This fertile ground presents a golden opportunity for Cardano to expand its footprint in Latin America, a region experiencing explosive blockchain growth.
ADA is currently trading at $0.45. Chart: TradingView
ADA’s Tango And Risks
With its native token, ADA, currently trading lower than its competitors, a successful partnership could restore investor confidence and drive ADA to reach new peaks. As of now, ADA has risen by a mere 1.7% in the past week to $0.45, with anticipation of reaching the $0.5 milestone in the near future.
However, the tango isn’t without its potential missteps. Regulatory frameworks for crypto in Argentina are still being crafted, and how these will impact Cardano’s operations remains to be seen. Additionally, the success of the partnership hinges on its specific projects.
Despite these uncertainties, the Cardano-Entre Ríos collaboration signifies a promising development for both parties. Argentina takes a confident stride towards a blockchain-powered future, while Cardano secures a strategic foothold in a growing market.

As the partnership evolves, it will be fascinating to witness the innovative applications of blockchain technology that emerge from this South American alliance.

VanEck Revises Ethereum Prediction To Put Price At $22,000, Here's Why


																Asset manager VanEck recently revised its prediction for Ethereum (ETH), revealing what price it believes the second-largest crypto token could reach by 2030. The firm also did well to outline what could drive Ethereum’s price to this revised price. 
Ethereum To Reach $22,000 By 2030
In a recent blog post, VanEck predicted that Ethereum could reach $22,000 by 2030. Before now, the asset manager had predicted that the crypto token would hit $11,800 by 2030. However, VanEck suggested they had become more bullish on ETH in anticipation of the Spot Ethereum ETFs, which could begin trading soon. 

	Related Reading


They noted that these Spot Ethereum ETFs have caused them to revise their earlier prediction since these funds will allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold the crypto token. They believe this category of investors could bring new money into the Ethereum ecosystem, further driving up the crypto token’s price. 
VanEck projects that the Ethereum network will likely continue to enjoy rapid share market growth thanks to interest from traditional investors and Big Tech. They believe this, along with EETH’s dominance among smart contract platforms, could lead to a “create path to $66 billion in free cash flows” for the network. 
They base their projection of ETH’s valuation by 2030 on this, stating that these cash flows will accrue to Ethereum’s native token. A rise to $22,000 represents a return of around 487% from Ethereum’s current price and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.8%. Meanwhile, Ethereum reaching $22,000 will give it a market cap of around $2.2 trillion. 
Highlighting Ethereum’s Potential
VanEck sounded very bullish on the Ethereum ecosystem as it claimed that the network could disrupt existing financial businesses and the largest tech companies, including Google and Apple. Given that Ethereum has earned a reputation as the platform for decentralized applications (dApps), they factored in the market size of business sectors that blockchain technology will disrupt while determining ETH’s future valuation. 

	Related Reading


The asset manager also highlighted how ETH benefits massively from ETH’s potential since no action can be taken on the network without the native token. Additionally, they noted how 80% of the revenues earned on the network are used to buy back and burn Ethereum tokens in circulation. 
Meanwhile, VanEck believes that ETH is “a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world.” They referred to it as “Digita Oil” since it is consumed by those transacting on the Ethereum network. 
The asset manager also called it “Programmable Money” and “Yield Bearing Commodity” because of how automated the Ethereum network is and that validators earn yields on the crypto token when they stake their ETH. Lastly, it was referred to as the “Internet Reserve Currency” since it serves as the “base asset” for all activity and most digital assets with the ETH ecosystem worth over $1 trillion.

Words of Praise About Bitcoin (BTC) from the CEO of Hong Kong SEC! "He Proved Himself!" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Approving spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs after the USA, Hong Kong is on its way to becoming the cryptocurrency center of the region.
Julia Leung, CEO of Hong Kong SFC, which approves spot Bitcoin ETFs, talked about Bitcoin.


Speaking at the Hong Kong Greenwich Economic Forum, Hong Kong SFC CEO Julia Leung said Bitcoin clearly demonstrates its staying power as an alternative asset.

“Most central bankers and economists say virtual assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum do not have any intrinsic value.
However, I do not agree with this view.
While the intrinsic value debate will continue, 15 years later Bitcoin has emerged solid and strong from numerous boom and bust cycles, clearly demonstrating its enduring power as an alternative asset.
“More clearly, Bitcoin and its underlying technology, DLT, are here to stay.”

The CEO of the Hong Kong SFC warned investors that digital assets such as BTC are highly speculative in nature, saying that the SFC has ensured and will continue to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to protect investors.





SFC CEO Leung recently stated that SFC is also working to regulate stablecoins and said, “Preparations for a new regime that will regulate fiat money-fixed stablecoins are ongoing.”

Bitcoiner Michael Saylor's Call to Action as Bitcoin (BTC) Trades Above $71,100

Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of the MicroStrategy behemoth, has taken to the X social media network (formerly known as Twitter) to send a Bitcoin-themed message to the global BTC community.He published his tweet as the world’s leading cryptocurrency strives to hold above the $71,000 level, which it has lost and then regained over the past couple of days.Michael Saylor's bullish Bitcoin callMicroStrategy is the only company that has been regularly buying Bitcoin since the August of 2020 and speaking publicly about it. Besides, over the past couple of years, it has been raising investor funds to purchase even more BTC. As of now, the company holds 214,400 Bitcoins on its balance sheet, and this amount is valued at roughly $7.538 billion. Saylor’s enterprise continues to accumulate more BTC.As his company adopted this Bitcoin purchasing strategy, Saylor started to publish several daily short tweets about BTC accompanied with AI-generated images. The tweet posted by Saylor today contained just one word, but it did look like a bullish call to the Bitcoin community: “HODL.” At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at close to $71,500.Robert Kiyosaki: Bitcoin will hit $350,000 in AugustEarlier today, prominent investor and author of the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” book Robert Kiyosaki tweeted a mega-bullish Bitcoin price prediction. The investor and entrepreneur stated in his post that he expects Bitcoin to skyrocket as high as the $350,000 level by Aug. 25 this year.He underscored, though, that he wants this prediction to be true, and that it is “only a prediction,” further clarifying that he indeed expects Bitcoin to hit $350,000 - if not in August then just at some point this year. He also revealed that he continues to hold not only more Bitcoin but also more Ethereum and Solana.The reason for him buying those altcoins is not because he believes in their massive potential, he said, but because he has no trust in the U.S. government, the Fed and their fiscal policies. Crypto trader and analyst Willy Woo found that target unlikely to happen this year. He wrote: “I suppose if you happen to have a spare 2.2 trillion dollars lying around to buy BTC before 25th August, I guess you could make it happen.”

New ‘Glimmers of Speculative Activity’ Appearing for Bitcoin After False Alarm of Mt. Gox Sell-Off: Glassnode - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) has flashed “glimmers of speculative activity” after consolidating for a couple of months, according to the crypto analytics firm Glassnode.
In a new analysis, Glassnode notes that new buyers and investors who have held BTC between six months and three years are holding unrealized profits.










“This observation is bolstered by the fact that only 0.03% of the Long-Term Holders are in a position of loss, which is typical of the early euphoric phase of a bull market.
Over the last 2-months, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio for both Long and Short-Term Holders has reset and returned to an equilibrium. This suggests that a majority of profit and loss which was likely to be taken in this price range, has been, and hints to an increased risk of substantial volatility in the near future.”
The sell-side risk ratio takes the sum of all profits and losses realized on-chain and divides that by the realized cap, which represents the value of each Bitcoin when it last moved rather than its current market value.
Source: Glassnode/X
Glassnode also notes that the market reacted to a “false alarm” last month after the news broke that bankrupt crypto exchange Mt. Gox rearranged nearly $10 billion in BTC.
Mt. Gox moved roughly $9.66 billion worth of BTC to three newly created wallets in four batches per address.
While there was initial worry that the exchange was considering liquidating its coins, former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpelès clarified on the social media platform X that the coin movements were only preparations for a distribution likely to happen later this year.

Ethereum ETFs To Attract Over $4 Billion In Inflows, Says K33 Analyst - Benzinga

In late May 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved the spot Ethereum ETF applications into the next stage of deliberation, opening the door for the funds to begin trading as soon as this Summer. The approvals surprised many, as the SEC had not addressed the issue much after approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. With the approvals, many are speculating on what the ETFs could look like once they begin trading. Some predict they could be wildly successful. Don't Miss:Many consider net inflows a key metric for determining an ETF’s success. This figure provides a strong indication of the ETF's performance and sustainability over the long term. According to market analytics and brokerage firm K33 Research, Ethereum ETFs could gain up to $4.8 billion in net inflows in the first five months after launching. The firm made the prediction using current figures on futures-linked Ethereum ETFs and comparing them to Bitcoin products. Additionally, K33 Research believes Ethereum will begin to outperform Bitcoin and the broader crypto market after the ETFs launch. This would align with Bitcoin’s performance following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs when BTC's price increased more than 60% and reached all-time highs. J.P. Morgan also predicted the ETFs would bring in $3 billion in inflows in the first five months.The spot Bitcoin ETFs have set a high bar for ETF launches. The 11 ETFs were the most successful in history, accumulating more than $12 billion in net inflows in just over two months. The funds hold over $30 billion in total inflows, netting around $15 billion after accounting for outflows from Grayscale. Many believe the Ethereum ETFs will be successful, albeit less so than the Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin is considered the safest bet among crypto investments due to its size and longevity. While Ethereum has similar characteristics, Bitcoin's greater degree of these attributes makes institutions more open to Bitcoin investments. Despite Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto market, Ethereum has established itself as a solid #2 token, emphasizing decentralized finance and community-built applications. In the long run, these use cases could potentially elevate Ethereum over Bitcoin, as Ethereum may have more room to adapt to changing market conditions. However, as it stands, Ethereum is still behind Bitcoin, which is expected to be reflected in ETF trading figures. Read Next:Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Ethereum ETFs May Not Receive As Much Interest as Bitcoin, According to Analysts! Here's Why! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The launch of US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, could face significantly less demand compared to spot Bitcoin products, casting a shadow on Ethereum's outlook, according to analysts.
Doubts Over US Ethereum ETF Demand Pose Challenge for Second-Largest Cryptocurrency
BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments are among the issuers seeking to list Ethereum ETFs pending final approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).


But JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists predict that net inflows into Ethereum ETFs will be much smaller than the $15.3 billion flowing into Bitcoin ETFs this year.
Five-month-old Bitcoin ETFs have capitalized on a narrative that positions Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a concept that Ethereum lacks.





Additionally, Ethereum ETFs will not offer staking rewards for blockchain maintenance, a return that can be achieved by holding the token directly.
“Ether does not have the profile of Bitcoin,” said Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets Pty. Bitcoin's $1.4 trillion market cap is three times larger than Ethereum's. “It won't have the same impact,” he said.



Last month, the SEC unexpectedly pivoted to approving spot Ethereum ETFs after allowing Bitcoin funds following a court reversal in 2023.
This decision briefly boosted the price of Ethereum, but the token's 109% rise last year fell short of Bitcoin's 169% rise, which reached a record high in March.





JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou estimate that prospective Ether ETFs would attract a “modest” $1 billion to $3 billion in net inflows over the remainder of the year.
These products may struggle to reach the 20% of Bitcoin ETF assets in the U.S., which now total $62.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas.

Shiba Inu, Cardano Seeing Explosive Whale Activity, Santiment Reveals


																The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed how Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) are among the altcoins seeing high whale activity recently.
Shiba Inu & Cardano Have Seen High Interest From Whales Recently
In a new post on X, Santiment has talked about how some altcoins have been seeing a high Whale Transaction Count recently. The “Whale Transaction Count” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the number of transactions happening on any cryptocurrency network that are valued at $100,000 or more.
Generally, only the whale entities are capable of moving such a large amount of capital with single transfers, so transactions of this scale are associated to movements related to them.

	Related Reading


When the value of the indicator is high, it means the whales are making a large number of moves on the network right now. Such a trend could imply these humongous investors have an active interest in trading the coin.
On the other hand, the metric being low could imply the big money investors may not be paying much attention to the asset currently as they aren’t making too many transactions.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Whale Transaction Count for three altcoins: Shiba Inu, Cardano, and JasmyCoin (JASMY).
The value of the metric appears to have been high for these assets in recent days | Source: Santiment on X
As displayed in the above graph, all three of Shiba Inu, Cardano, and JasmyCoin have seen the metric spike for them recently. Naturally, this means that the whales are actively trading these assets right now.
As for what this could mean for the prices of these cryptocurrencies, a high whale transaction count can be a predictor for volatility. The indicator doesn’t contain any information about whether the transfers are tending towards buying or selling moves, though, so it can usually be hard to say about where exactly such volatility could take the asset.
Since the transfers have started, however, all three of these coins have seen some level of price appreciation, hinting that the whale activity so far may have been leaning towards accumulation after all.
The analytics firm also appears to believe that buying could be the goal behind these transactions. “The amount of $100K+ transactions on each of these networks have all more than doubled this week compared to usual 2024 averages, signaling accumulation,” notes Santiment.

	Related Reading


Whatever the case be, if the high value of the Whale Transaction Count persists for Shiba Inu and company, it’s likely that their prices would continue to see some sort of fluctuations in the coming days.
SHIB Price
While JasmyCoin has seen a considerable amount of profits following the spike in whale interest, Shiba Inu has only been able to see a relatively minor surge. Following this latest rise, the SHIB price has so far been able to recover to $0.00002570.
Looks like the price of the coin has been going up over the last few days | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView

Core Scientific rejects CoreWeave buyout bid after big HPC deal - Blockworks


Though Core Scientific was willing to ink a deal with CoreWeave, the bitcoin miner has turned down the cloud provider’s offer to buy the company. 
CoreWeave and Core Scientific on Tuesday entered into various 12-year contracts whereby the bitcoin miner will offer roughly 200 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure to host CoreWeave’s high-performance computing (HPC) services.
CoreWeave followed that deal up by offering to buy all outstanding Core Scientific shares in cash for $5.75 per share.   
Core Scientific’s stock price was $7.30 Thursday morning after jumping 40% on Tuesday on the back of the HPC contract.
The company’s board of directors determined the CoreWeave proposal “significantly undervalues the company and is not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders,” Core Scientific said in a Thursday press statement.
It is unclear if CoreWeave will make another offer. A spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.
Just getting started
The rejection comes as Core Scientific has touted the value of its infrastructure. 
Read more: Rival miners Marathon, Core Scientific each think they have an edge over peers
The Texas-based miner’s latest deal with CoreWeave proves it seeks to lock in long-term projected revenues through that business line.
But the company is just getting started, as supporting artificial intelligence (AI) applications will continue to be a key part of its strategy, CEO Adam Sullivan told Blockworks this week. 
Of Core Scientific’s 1.2 gigawatts of contracted power capacity, the company can provide about 500 MW of HPC power tailored for alternative compute workloads, he noted.
Cloud provider CoreWeave is set to use about 40% of that 500 MW. 
Core Scientific is in discussions with other potential clients about the remaining 300 MW or so of capacity.
“Our new HPC contracts transform and expand our hosting business and earnings power with stable, predictable, high-margin and long-term revenue that will provide balance to our bitcoin mining business and the more volatile nature of bitcoin pricing,” Sullivan said. 
Modifications to the miner’s sites are set to start in the second half of 2024 and be operational in early 2025.
Core Scientific estimates the 12-year contract to drive average annual revenue of $290 million.

Capital unlock could be coming after stock soars
Investors clearly view the growth of a seemingly stable, cash-flowing business line super attractive.
Spurred by the CoreWeave deal, Core Scientific’s stock price rose roughly 40% Tuesday and went up nearly 5% on Wednesday. 
The share price rally is especially significant given that the company needed shares to hit $6.81 to convert its so-called Tranche 1 warrants and unlock $670 million in cash.
That was a condition of the bitcoin miner’s reorganization plan when it emerged from bankruptcy in January. The plan reduced Core Scientific’s net debt to $571 million by converting equipment lender and convertible note holder debt to equity. 
It appears Core Scientific’s stock price will need to remain at that $6.81 volume-weighted average price over 20 straight trading days, according to company filings.
A Core Scientific spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment on the process of exercising those warrants and how the company would use the capital. 
Compass Point Research and Trading analysts Chase White and Joe Flynn said in a January research note that they expected 100% of the Tranche 1 warrants to be exercised by the fourth quarter, “allowing [Core Scientific] to pay down additional debt.”
Sullivan noted the importance of hitting certain share price levels — such as the $6.81 mark — in a March interview with Blockworks.

He added at the time: ​​“All of those things would provide us an opportunity here to really outpace our competitors in a way that everyone saw us do for multiple years as we ramped up through 2022.”

XRP has remained relatively stagnant this month, despite ambitions to curb the negative growth trends June has been known for over the past decade. While the reality is glaring, XRP bulls are eyeing what analysts labeled as a long-due price rebound that might help the coin retest its highest level over the past year, pegged at $0.8875.What is XRP doing differently?While pressing for price growth, fundamentals are typically associated with imminent price growth moves. In the case of XRP, most of the efforts of XRP Ledger developers have yielded little to no major price jumps.Despite the release of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) engine and the emergence of several functioning pools on the Ledger, the price of XRP remains bound between the $0.4879 and $0.5561 price range over the past month. The impact of the Ripple escrow lockup has also not impacted the price of XRP in the most preferred ways. With millions of XRP locked up and released from escrow monthly, there is an optimal level of dilution that has helped keep XRP in tune with meeting liquidity demands.Overall, market observers are concerned about XRP's growth trajectory, especially with the lingering lawsuit between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its associated blockchain payments firm, Ripple Labs. More innovators are suing for more decentralized applications (dApps) on the XRP Ledger that can help drive the demand for XRP and ultimately its price.Whale influenceMany analysts considered the slow growth in the price of XRP as its latent period. This is because the coin is highly favored by whale transactions that generally see billions of XRP traded daily.When these fundamentals converge, analysts are optimistic that the price of XRP will not only breach the $1 price level, but it might retest its ATH of $3.84.

Animoca Brands and Sandbox invest in the future of the metaverse

The Sandbox, a division of Animoca Brands, has announced an investment of $20 million, reaching a maximum valuation of $1 billion, with the goal of further developing the creator economy within an open metaverse. 
This division of Animoca Brands is creating a decentralized virtual world where culture merges with the playful element, with more than 1,000 user-generated experiences and a community of over 5.7 million members.
Let’s see all the details below. 

Animoca Brands, operatore di The Sandbox, invests in the future of the metaverse 
Animoca Brands, un’azienda impegnata nella promozione dei diritti di proprietà digitale nel metaverso aperto operatrice di The Sandbox, una piattaforma di metaverso, ha annunciato oggi la raccolta di $20 million tramite cambiali convertibili, con un tetto di valutazione di $1 billion. 
This strategic funding was led by Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands, with the participation of LG Tech Ventures and True Global Ventures. 
I possessori delle note hanno la possibilità di convertirle in azioni di Bacasable Global Limited alle stesse condizioni delle azioni privilegiate esistenti.
Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, commented as follows: 
“We are extremely honored by the continued support for The Sandbox’s vision and excited about the future of UGC games.”
McKinsey has predicted that by 2030 the metaverse could contribute 5 trillion dollars to the global economy. Today, games like Minecraft and Roblox are among the most popular, but they do not offer their users digital property rights. 
Sandbox represents the evolution of UGC games in the era of digital ownership.
The financing will be used to continue developing The Sandbox’s vision of a decentralized virtual world, where culture merges with gaming and the community can actively participate in growth and benefit from it. 
In line with this vision, The Sandbox will continue to improve earning opportunities for creators on its platform. 
This through the update of the Game Maker and VoxEdit 3D editor tools, the introduction of new social interactions and skills for the avatars. 
Furthermore, also through the expansion of gaming possibilities via a new multiplayer rules system, expected in Beta by the end of this year and to the public in 2025. 
Guide to the metaverse with the power of fandom and global partnerships
The Sandbox is also developing a version of its decentralized metaverse for mobile devices, scheduled for 2025.
Recently, The Sandbox has reached the milestone of 1,000 user-generated experiences, published on its virtual map, with over 5.7 million user accounts linked to the criptovalute wallet.
The Sandbox has consolidated its position as one of the leading flagship applications in Web3, attracting new users thanks to the support of fans and pushing the audience to explore the metaverse. 
With over 400 global partnerships, including Lionsgate, Hellboy, Magnificent Century, Habbo and many others, the platform is currently working on over a hundred experiences with global brands, scheduled for 2024.
In the last 12 months, more than 330,000 unique creators have adopted The Sandbox’s no-code Game Maker. The platform is now ramping up its efforts to engage emerging creators through educational initiatives, bootcamps, and game jams.
So far, over 60,000 NFT avatars have been sold and used to play in the virtual world of The Sandbox, including NFT from 19 official collections such as Hellboy, Magnificent Century, Rabbids, and others. 
Arthur Madrid, CEO e co-fondatore di The Sandbox, ha sottolineato: 
“The open metaverse offers everyone the possibility to express themselves and discover new cultures. Our mission is to promote equity and opportunities for creators in all aspects of culture in the metaverse.”

Florida man admits to US$8.4 mln crypto fraud scheme


Juan Tacuri, a 46-year-old from Florida, confessed to orchestrating an US$8.4 million Ponzi scheme involving cryptocurrency.



Tacuri, a principal promoter for the now-defunct Forcount operation, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, the United States Attorney’s Office said on Wednesday.



This crime has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.



As part of his plea, Tacuri will surrender nearly US$4 million in profits and property obtained through the scheme, which targeted Spanish-speaking investors. 



Tacuri’s admission of guilt is a development in the legal proceedings against Forcount, later rebranded as Weltsys.



From 2017 to 2021, the operation defrauded investors of approximately US$8.4 million, falsely promising high returns on crypto investments.



Tacuri recruited victims at various expos and events across the U.S., including in the Southern District of New York, where Judge Analisa Torres will determine his sentence.



Investors were promised that their money would double within six months through Forcount’s supposed crypto trading and mining ventures. 



In reality, these operations did not exist, and funds from new investors were used to pay earlier participants and finance the lifestyles of Tacuri and his associates, said the Department of Justice.



The online platform provided to investors tracked their “profits,” but most victims lost their entire investments as they could not withdraw any supposed earnings.



Legal actions against Tacuri’s co-promoters, Francisley Da Silva and Antonia Perez Hernandez, are ongoing, with neither having entered a plea or been found guilty. 



Tacuri’s sentencing is scheduled for late September 2024.

Hot: One of the World's Largest Cryptocurrency Exchanges is Said to be Preparing for an IPO - Will History Repeat Itself? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Kraken, the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the USA, is preparing for an IPO and is negotiating pre-IPO financing, according to Bloomberg.
Previously, Coinbase went public and this coincided with the last period of the cryptocurrency bull at that time.


The exchange is likely to seek more than $100 million in funding in this round. With cryptocurrencies on the verge of reaching new all-time highs and regulatory pressure on digital assets easing in the US, companies in the sector have begun to attract renewed interest from investors and revive talks to go public.
The fundraising is expected to be completed by the end of the year, possibly in what is called a pre-IPO round, according to the sources, who asked not to be named due to the private nature of the discussions. “We are always exploring strategic paths towards Kraken's Mission of accelerating the global adoption of crypto,” Kraken said in a statement, declining to comment specifically on the fundraising or IPO.





Kraken is reportedly looking for a “significant” company to join its board to help it achieve a successful IPO early next year.

Sushi goes live on Bitcoin sidechain Rootstock - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Sushi is now live on Bitcoin (BTC) sidechain Rootstock
Rootstock’s integration with the decentralised exchange (DEX) will expand DeFi on Bitcoin.
Users can now leverage Sushi’s advanced trading functionalities and other features while tapping into Bitcoin’s security and decentralisation.

SushiSwap, a decentralised exchange (DEX) deployed across over 30 blockchains, is now live on Rootstock, a pioneering Bitcoin (BTC) sidechain.
The Sushi team announced the integration with Rootstock, which seeks to bring decentralised finance (DeFi) to the Bitcoin ecosystem, on Thursday. 
SUSHI price rose slightly after the news, increasing by about 3% to reach $1.23.
Major news as Sushi integrates with Bitcoin sidechain Rootstock
Rootstock is the first EVM-compatible Bitcoin (BTC) sidechain, having launched in 2018 as the crypto industry experienced exponential growth across smart contracts projects.
With security enhanced via Bitcoin’s mining mechanism, Rootstock aims to expand the world of DeFi on Bitcoin through Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. The network provides for the critical features of high scalability, fast transactions and interoperability.
Sushi’s integration will allow SUSHI holders to trade and provide liquidity on the Bitcoin sidechain, with users able to tap into Bitcoin’s security and decentralisation.
The integration will allow for the expansion of SushiSwap’s trading functionalities to Rootstock’s DeFi ecosystem.
“This collaboration marks a significant expansion into the DeFi sector for Rootstock, enhancing its ecosystem with Sushi’s advanced trading functionalities. It also strengthens Sushi’s multi-chain expansion by adding Rootstock to the network, offering users diverse options for including Bitcoin in DeFi,” the Sushi team said in an announcement.
Sushi is therefore helping to bridge Bitcoin-Fi and DeFi, giving the community access to new opportunities that leverage BTC assets.
Some of the features Sushi brings to Rootstock are token swaps and liquidity provision. Users can leverage these via Sushi’s V2 and V3 Automated Market Maker (AMM), a DEX aggregator, and Route Processor 4 (RP4). The latter provides for efficiency and optimised trading.
Rootstock users can access DeFi protocols and other dApps using RBTC, a native token pegged 1:1 to BTC.

Donald Trump Vets Vice Presidential Candidates: GOP's Top Contenders, Betting Odds - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump is one of the leading candidates in the 2024 presidential election.After a falling out with former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump is set to select a new vice-presidential candidate to join his campaign for the 2024 election.What Happened: Trump remains the betting favorite to win the 2024 presidential election after being found guilty on 34 federal counts in a highly publicized criminal trial alleging falsified business records.While Trump awaits sentencing and an appeal in the legal process, attention on the 2024 election campaign for the former president is turning to who he will select as his running mate.Trump's campaign team has begun vetting top contenders as reported by the Associated Press.The list of vice president candidates who received vetting requests from Trump's campaign team include:North Dakota Gov. Doug BurgumSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)  Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio)Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.)Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.)Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.)Ben CarsonSources said that candidates have been asked for various levels of paperwork as part of the vetting process.The vetting process could signal a vice-presidential pick coming sooner than later, but Trump's campaign team cautioned that the process is still early."Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump," Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement shared by the Associated Press.The Republican National Convention in July could serve as one potential event to announce a running mate according to a report.Several of the candidates who have been vetted recently were among the key people who showed up at Trump's hush money trial to show support for the former president and in some cases to criticize the legal process and individuals involved as a way for Trump to get around a gag order.Related Link: Trump Found Guilty On All 34 Counts In Hush Money Criminal Trial: Here’s What Happens NextBetting Odds: With the recent list of candidates being vetted, the betting odds on prediction market Polymarket have changed.Calling itself the world's largest prediction market, Polymarket offers betting on items in categories such as politics, sports, cryptocurrency, pop culture and more.On Polymarket, users deposit to Polygon MATIC/USD using USDC USDC/USD and can deposit with Ethereum ETH/USD. Winning wagers cash out at $1.Over $31 million has been bet on the site for the market of who Trump will choose for his vice president candidate, up from $17 million at the end of April.Here are the current odds for Trump's vice president on Polymarket, with odds from May 9 in parentheses:Tim Scott: 25% (19%)Other Man: 17% (20%)Marco Rubio: 11% (9%)JD Vance: 10% (13%)Ben Carson: 8% (4%)Sarah Huckabee Sanders: 7% (2%)Other Woman: 6% (8%)Elise Stefanik: 5% (5%)Vivek Ramaswamy: 5% (1%)Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: 4% (3%)Scott has jumped to the top of the leaderboard on Polymarket as the current betting favorite. In early May, the Other Man option was the favorite. With Burgum not listed individually, the North Dakota governor falls into this category.Burgum has been spending increased time with the former president and viewed by some political experts as a frontrunner.Back in January, Stefanik and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem were the betting favorites on Polymarket. Controversy may have sent Noem off the shortlist and Stefanik was the only female candidate on the reported list of seven candidates being vetted.Time will tell who Trump selects as his running mate. With a close election predicted for the head-to-head rematch against President Joe Biden, Trump’s vice presidential candidate could prove increasingly important to win over certain demographics and independent voters.Read Next: Trump Vs.

Magnetic X's Farming Protocol Drives Liquidity to XRP Ledger


							

Magnetic X’s DeFi platform on XRP Ledger fuels yield farming rewards for users.



Total value locked in XRP Ledger AMM pools surpasses $5.3 million.



High APRs drive growing interest in yield farming on the XRP Ledger.




Magnetic X, a protocol facilitating applications on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has reported significant growth in its DeFi ecosystem.



Over 37 days, 703 users (“farmers”) have collectively earned over 50,000 XRP through Magnetic X’s platform, showcasing its potential for generating rewards.







The protocol’s total liquidity now stands at 1.9 million XRP, bolstering its MAG token, currently priced at 2,240 XRP. This growth coincides with the recent surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) in XRPL AMM pools, surpassing 10 million XRP as of June 3rd.



While the recent introduction of AMM functionality to XRPL faced initial challenges with low fees, “farming” has emerged as a potential solution. By offering higher income opportunities, farming incentivizes users to provide liquidity, thereby revitalizing the AMM ecosystem.









It is to be noted that on April 30, Magnetic X had introduced XRPL farming, which quickly became popular within the community.



Notable farming pools, such as the MAG/XRP pool and a pool with a 68,000 XRP TVL and 63.56% APR, have attracted significant attention due to their high returns. The 666/XRP pool, with a TVL of 108,000 XRP and an impressive APR of 180.45%, further demonstrates the growing interest in XRPL farming.







This surge in activity aligns with a broader trend of increasing TVL in XRPL AMM pools, which has grown from 7.4 million XRP six weeks ago to over $5.3 million as of today.

GameStop finished Wednesday at a price of $31.57, and now has pushed its five-day gain to 49% as of this writing.Shares in the video game retailer began climbing again this week after Roaring Kitty—whose posts and livestreams helped prompt the meme stock trading craze and GameStop short squeeze back in 2021—tweeted after two weeks of inactivity.

Mike Dudas, Managing Partner at 6MV, described the acquisition as a significant milestone in the fintech sector. “First all-in fintech domino to fall. Global financial markets will be crypto-fixed over the next decade-plus,” Dudas tweeted, underscoring the long-term implications of the move.He praised Robinhood’s decisive step, stating, “Massive.

'The Sandbox' Ethereum Game Valued at $1 Billion With New Funding - Decrypt

The Sandbox, an Ethereum metaverse game platform, announced Wednesday that it has raised $20 million in convertible promissory notes at a $1 billion valuation. That makes the long-running project the latest crypto “unicorn,” based on the billion-dollar valuation.The latest funding round was led by Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands; Animoca, a prominent metaverse investment firm, is also the parent of The Sandbox’s operating company, Bacasable Global Limited. LG Tech Ventures and True Global Ventures also participated in the round."We are deeply honored by the continuing commitment to the vision of The Sandbox, and we're incredibly excited about the future of composable user-generated content games," said Animoca co-founder and executive chairman Yat Siu, in a statement.With the new funding in tow, The Sandbox’s development team said that its key priorities include improving creator tools, adding new social and gameplay features, and developing a mobile version scheduled for 2025.The Sandbox is one of the most prominent blockchain games, thanks to partnerships with over 400 celebrities and brands—including Snoop Dogg, Gucci, and Paris Hilton—and previously immense demand for in-game land plots sold via NFTs. In fact, someone paid $450,000 worth of crypto for a land plot near Snoop Dogg’s metaverse mansion in 2021.The game’s SAND token on Ethereum remains one of the 100 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world based on market cap, per data from CoinGecko. However, the price of its NFT land plots has fallen sharply since metaverse hype peaked in early 2022—from 3.9 ETH ($11,700) to 0.08 ETH ($300) today."Our mission at The Sandbox is to develop creative tools and technologies that bring fairness and new opportunities for all types of creators in the open metaverse," said The Sandbox co-founder and CEO Arthur Madrid, in a release.Editor’s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

Ethereum’s Prospects for Hitting New All-Time High a ‘Certainty,’ Says Crypto Trader - But There’s a Catch - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst believes Ethereum (ETH) is heading to new all-time highs (ATHs).
Pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,900 followers on the social media platform X that ETH will likely have a massive breakout against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC).










However, the trader warns that the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) continues to act as resistance for the ETH/BTC pair and there may be more downside before a breakout.
“ETH: ETH/BTC has underperformed for a while now, interesting to see that the 200-week exponential moving average is still bearish (last time it was bearish like this was March 2021). To be determined if this recent price action is ‘the bottom.’ ETH to ATH is still a certainty, but I think that this is still disturbing to watch.”



Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X



ETH/BTC is trading for 0.05384 BTC ($3,841) at time of writing, up nearly 1% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum reached an all-time high of about $4,900 in November 2021.
The analyst also believes that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), which tracks the percentage of the total market cap that belongs to Bitcoin, will continue to be bullish until the fourth quarter of this year, meaning altcoins could lag behind BTC until then.
“You should probably accumulate shitcoins from now until late Q4. Hard to say what the particular timing is but most alt/BTC pairs are going to continue to go down in my opinion. But once Q4 rolls around, expecting BTC.D to come down and for there to be some alt action.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests BTC.D will reach a peak level at around 64%, about 10% higher than the current level.

Bitcoin Miner Selling Intensifies, BTC Reserves Fall To 3-Year Lows | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin miners’ reserves have seen a steady decline over the past few months since the halving event in April. The latest figures indicate a massive decline to 3-year lows, signaling intense selling pressure from miners amidst fluctuating BTC prices and market volatility.
Bitcoin Miner Holdings Drop To New Lows
Before the Bitcoin halving event on April 20, market experts foresaw potential challenges for Bitcoin miners as block rewards become reduced by half. This prediction is showing true, as BTC miner holdings have witnessed a severe decline over the past few months. 

According to the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin miners’ reserves have fallen from 1.84 million BTC in the previous year to about 1.80 million BTC presently. This drop suggests that BTC miner holdings are currently at their lowest levels since Bitcoin’s Satoshi era days, which was approximately 14 years ago. 
CryptoQuant also disclosed that BTC miner reserves are down 50% from previous highs, indicating an increased selling volume from miners. This selling pressure is likely induced by the increased mining operational costs as investors continue selling off their Bitcoin holdings to acquire better mining equipment to remain financially stable. 
The cost of BTC mining is escalating as electricity prices rise and mining rewards reduce. The need for more efficient hardware has also become increasingly urgent in order to keep up with the complexities associated with BTC mining.  
Moreover, Bloomberg reported that BTC miners stand to lose $10 billion in revenue annually, spurred on by the far-reaching effects of the Bitcoin halving cycle. This pessimistic outlook is also magnified as BTC mining hash rates reach 3-year lows after witnessing its largest crash since 2021. 
Excluding miner reserves, the price of Bitcoin witnessed massive declines after the halving event in April. At the time, its trading volume plummeted significantly, suggesting a decline in investor demand and interest in the cryptocurrency. 
Currently, BTC seems to be steadily approaching its all-time high, surging past the $71,000 mark earlier this week. The unexpected momentum has been partly attributed to the increased inflows from investors into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs has also had a positive impact on the price of BTC, indicating investors increasing interest in the cryptocurrency. 
BTC Miners Turn To AI
Amidst Bitcoin miners dwindling reserves, many are now turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a way to generate more revenue. Recently Core Scientific, a BTC mining titan, announced a 12-year collaboration with Core Weave, a specialized cloud provider and AI hyperscaler. 

Core Scientific has revealed plans to support CoreWeave, expanding the relationship between the two companies in the hopes of generating more than $3.5 million in revenue over the next 12 years.

BNB's Impossible Pump | Bankless


Sudden Surge. Binance founder CZ just started his 4-month prison sentence, but that hasn’t stopped the native token of his exchange’s closely affiliated BNB Chain from achieving its highest price ever! Why is BNB outperforming this week?BNB has gained over 20% off Monday’s lows, breaking out above $700 for the first time in history. It has not given back a rally since shortly after Binance’s November settlement announcement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.Although BNB is exhibiting outsized strength at the moment, it is not alone in the pump. This move up comes at the same time as many cryptos, stocks, and commodities have gained on investor optimism as major Western central banks commence their rate cut processes.Source: TradingViewMany onchain BNB metrics have ticked steadily upwards this week, with daily transaction fees and DEX volumes seeing the greatest impacts from the surging speculative activity that has resulted from BNB’s gains; both metrics have more than doubled from Monday!While the majority of blockchains – from Solana to Sei and Arbitrum to Optimism – have seen on-chain usage statistics slide lower this week, BNB Chain has been one of the few holdouts to experience increases in daily active addresses and transaction counts.Unfortunately, these recent increases are merely blips from a longer-term time perspective, and every major onchain BNB metric remains well below its March 2024 local highs set after BTC obtained new all-time highs.Indicating that this rally has largely been driven by speculation, open interest on BNB perpetual swaps has exploded by 50% during this week's move up to reach $1.05B, the highest level on record, suggesting that leverage traders (who will eventually need to close their positions) heavily contributed to the gains.Source: CoinGlassShould crypto prices continue to rise in the coming months as global central banks lower their interest rate targets, BNB likely ascends alongside, and is a prime candidate for outperformance among the majors.BNB’s relative strength has increased by a respective 29% and 35% against BTC and ETH during 2024, and despite the fact that there is zero possibility this token receives a spot ETF at any time in the future like these two alternatives, its holders could be positioned for enhanced upside if recent performance holds.

Top Crypto Analyst Shuffles Altcoin Portfolio Before Ethereum ETF: Here's What He Rotated Into - Benzinga

Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe shared insights about recent adjustments to his altcoin portfolio in a new podcast episode.What Happened: Van de Poppe remains optimistic about altcoins, focusing on higher ROI prospects, influenced by the pending approval of the Ethereum ETH/USD ETF. He detailed that around four weeks ago, he went all-in on altcoins but has since adjusted their specific holdings."Altcoins are going to do really well," he said, attributing recent underperformance to Bitcoin ETF impacts. He noted his high-risk appetite, quoting, "That’s how I made a lot of money and that’s how I lost a lot of money."He adds that the reason for markets to trade sideways is due to the Ether ETF has not been entirely approved, with only the 19B-4 filings greenlit but not the S-1 filings. He predicted, "Once that kicks in, the interest starts to come into the markets and into the ETF."Altcoin Rotation StrategyHe emphasized targeting altcoins with higher potential returns, specifically those affected by Binance’s recent focus on low floating high FDV coins. Coins like Celestia TIA/USD saw significant runs after listing on Binance, illustrating the exchange's market-moving power.Focusing on market movers like Binance and BlackRock is crucial as BTC price surge was led by BlackRock’s ETF involvement. He stressed the importance of shifting from older altcoins like Atom ATOM/USD and Curve CRV/USD which have underperformed, to newer projects with better upside potential. Some examples include:
Renzo RENZO/USD: This one dropped around 70% since and is showing an opportunity.



Portal PORTAL/USD: A gaming coin with a relatively higher floating supply. It has seen a drop of 70 to 80% and starts to grind up.

ECB rate cut could spur Bitcoin and stablecoin growth in Eurozone, experts highlight - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates by 0.25% today, making it the first cut in five years and reducing it to 3.75%. Crypto industry experts shared with Crypto Briefing that this movement is important for different reasons, as it raises important questions about stablecoins in the European Union and the demand for Bitcoin in the Eurozone.Aurelie Barthere, Principal Research analyst at Nansen, explained that the ECB’s rate cut was already priced in by the markets, so investors shouldn’t have surprises. 
“In general, the ECB has less influence than the Fed on crypto markets, and the ECB follows the Fed, not the other way around. The reason why the ECB cut earlier than the Fed is the weakness of growth in the Eurozone vs the US,” Barthere added.
As reported by BBC, Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB said the outlook for inflation had improved “markedly”, paving the way for the rate cut. Yet, Lagarde warned investors to keep their hopes in check, as inflation might average 2.5% in 2024, and the ECB would keep interest rate policy “sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary.”Nevertheless, the ECB decision might benefit the crypto market indirectly, highlighted Eneko Knörr, CEO of Stabolut. “While European economic policies might not have a direct influence on global crypto trends, lower interest rates generally drive investors toward higher-risk, higher-return assets,” he explained.As a result, crypto might become more attractive as investors seek better yields. Therefore, the rate cut could boost interest in crypto as part of a broader search for higher returns.Moreover, Bitfinex analysts assessed that this move aims to stimulate economic growth amid signs of a slowdown in the Eurozone, although this might weaken the euro. This is good news for crypto, as investors in the European Union could ramp up their demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin. “The increased liquidity from this monetary easing could also support risk assets, including crypto.”Kevin de Patoul, CEO of Keyrock, is also keen to believe that the rate cuts are a bullish signal for markets with higher risks and potential returns. Additionally, the stablecoin sector in the Eurozone might witness a significant impact. 
“This move raises important questions about the future of EURO stablecoins, especially in light of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation coming into effect in June. The rate cut could significantly impact the financial outlook for EURO stablecoin issuers.”
Weighing if this decision affects the FOMC meeting next week in the US, Knörr stated that the Fed decisions are largely irrelevant to ECB actions, and vice-versa. However, the ECB’s rate cut might signal to markets that inflation concerns may be easing.

Jim Cramer is right: Dog coin ETFs are this bull market’s missing spark - Blockworks


All things considered, there probably won’t be a BONK ETF anytime soon.
But the notion that cryptocurrencies might one day invade the stodgy stock market via ETFs is seriously compelling. 
Mad Money host Jim Cramer was on the right track during his CNBC appearance yesterday. “Why shouldn’t there be a BONK ETF?” Cramer asked SEC Chair Gary Gensler.
However, the real trick to getting SEC approval has turned out to be courting CME, which is regulated by the CFTC — and not Gensler’s agency. Bitcoin and ether both had futures markets for years before spot ETFs were approved.
Perhaps a dog coin fund might be an easier sell. Coinbase Derivatives, which is also regulated by the CFTC, launched its own dogecoin futures markets not long ago.
CME Group denied it had any plans for dogecoin futures when rumors circulated in 2021. What better time to revisit that decision than now?
CNBC talks memecoins — a bull signal?
It wasn’t even just a BONK ETF that was floated on CNBC yesterday. Cramer also made the case for ETFs backed by sushiswap, polkadot, cardano (he called it “cordano”), immutable, ronin and osmosis and myneighbouralice.
“[They have] all traded millions — I’m talking millions of dollars this very morning… I would think that BONK is a natural, and osmosis… shouldn’t we have some sort of product?”
Gensler sidestepped by redirecting the question to the matter of disclosure. Today is the SEC’s 90th birthday, he said, and reminded the audience (talking into the camera) that President Roosevelt created the Commission to ensure sellers of securities openly inform prospective investors so they can make better decisions.
The moment Gensler found out about $CRAMER, which spiked up to 500% following the segment (Source: CNBC Television)
Gensler’s point was that those disclosures supposedly aren’t happening across crypto. If you ask lobbyists, industry lawyers and founders, this is because issuers and protocol stewards simply don’t consider the tokens securities or investment contracts — so there’s no disclosure required. And in many cases, there’s no centralized entity through which to disclose.

Then Gensler came for the crypto exchanges. 
“These crypto exchanges, Jim, are doing things we would never allow this New York Stock Exchange to do,” Gensler said. “Our laws don’t allow you to trade against your customers.”
But the previous questions were awkward for Gensler, even before Cramer brought up memecoins that borrow likenesses of celebrities and other media personalities, including himself and the SEC chair.
(Gensler said those should be registered as securities, but it’s unclear whether he fully grokked the concept of memecoins about public figures that weren’t issued by the actual person.)
Cramer may not have remembered, but the SEC already labeled cardano a security in both Coinbase and Binance lawsuits filed last June, alongside a dozen others including solana, polygon, BNB, internet computer, filecoin and Axie Infinity. 
So far, the companies and entities working to build out those ecosystems haven’t been sued — just crypto exchanges found listing them. Tron founder Justin Sun was sued separately months before over TRX and bittorrent (BTT), while the SEC stung Ripple Labs for XRP in December 2020 and sent Uniswap Labs a Wells notice in April.


The colorful band of lines beneath the cross pulls downward following the lawsuits — but few have recovered
Still, the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits coincided with a severe drop in the bitcoin ratios for the tokens singled out by the SEC. 
Most had fallen more than 10% against bitcoin in the three days following the suits, with those losses doubling over the next two weeks or so. Bitcoin itself dropped around 7% over the same period.
To date, only bitcoin ratios for solana and near have made it back out of the 13 tokens named by the SEC, followed by ICP, which is only just short. Ironically, near and ICP have been largely invigorated by the AI narrative, of which Gensler is a huge fan.
However, beating bitcoin (and thus growing the bitcoin ratio) has been tough this bull market, and tons of cryptocurrencies that haven’t been named as securities by the SEC have underperformed. 
This bull market has been lacking a true altcoin season. Perhaps a few filings for dogecoin ETFs will be the catalyst.

Stablecoin bill may pass before the election, says JPMorgan

Photo: Mike Segar (Reuters)The stablecoin bill is likely to be approved before the presidential election and poses a threat to Tether’s dominance, according to JPMorgan, as reported by CoinDesk. Moreover, the Federal Reserve is now less likely to issue a central bank digital currency after a House bill last month banned the central bank from doing so, per the report.Softening jobs market could actually be good news, says strategistIn light of the current state of crypto regulations in the U.S., JPMorgan shared its report on what is likely to happen in the near future. Analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team have reported that new regulatory measures seem to oppose the Federal Reserve’s development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), per CoinDesk. According to the investment bank, regulators may favor U.S.-compliant stablecoins, potentially reducing the dominance of non-compliant stablecoins, such as Tether— the biggest stablecoin, as reported by CoinDesk. Notably, stablecoins – the type of cryptocurrencies pegged to assets or fiat currencies – have faced scrutiny from regulators over their functionality. The analysts said the stablecoin bill, named “Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act,” has the potential to be passed before the 2024 presidential election. Moreover, the bank stated that U.S. banks would be discouraged from involvement in cryptocurrencies, per the report. JP Morgan did not immediately respond to a Quartz request for comment on the reported analysis.Last month, the House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which now has to be approved by the Senate and by the president. It is unlikely to happen before the election, according to the bank.

What Lower Interest Rates Mean for Crypto Investors


The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BoC) have cut interest rates, marking a pivotal shift in monetary policy. 
The ECB reduced its key rate to 3.75% from 4%, a move anticipated by markets despite ongoing inflationary pressures in the eurozone. Meanwhile, the BoC lowered its key policy rate to 4.75% from 5%, becoming the first G7 nation to do so in the current cycle.
ECB, BoC Slash Interest Rates

The ECB’s decision, influenced by an updated inflation outlook, reflects the need to moderate monetary policy after a period of steady rates. The ECB’s latest projections show a slight increase in inflation expectations for 2024 and 2025, with 2026 remaining stable at 1.9%. 

“Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady,” Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, said in a statement.

This cut is the first since September 2019 and follows a series of hikes that began later than other central banks but now places the ECB ahead in reducing rates.
On the other hand, the BoC’s rate cut aims to ease the burden on highly indebted consumers. Governor Tiff Macklem emphasized that future cuts would depend on continued downward inflation trends. 

“Governing Council is closely watching the evolution of core inflation and remains particularly focused on the balance between demand and supply in the economy, inflation expectations, wage growth, and corporate pricing behaviour,” the BoC Governing Council said in a statement.

These rate cuts have several implications for the crypto market. Lower interest rates typically reduce borrowing costs, encouraging both consumer spending and business investment. This increased liquidity can boost investments in higher-yielding assets, including cryptocurrencies. Additionally, lower returns on traditional savings can drive investors toward riskier assets like crypto.
Furthermore, the rate cuts might lead to higher prices for crypto. With safer investments offering lower returns, investors often seek higher returns in the crypto market. This shift can increase demand for digital assets, potentially driving up their value.

However, the moves by the ECB and BoC come with caution. Both institutions indicate that future cuts will be data-dependent, highlighting a cautious approach amid uncertain economic conditions. Economists suggest that the ECB may wait until September for another cut, while the BoC might move again in July.

European Central Bank Cuts Rates-What It Means for the Fed and Bitcoin - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its three key interest rates by 25 basis points each on Thursday—and crypto bulls are anticipating a potential boost to Bitcoin's price, particularly amid speculation that the Fed could follow suit.The organization’s new rate for its main refinancing operations is now 4.25%. Meanwhile, the rates for its marginal lending facility and deposit facility are now 4.5% and 3.75%, respectively. This marks the central bank’s first rate cut in nearly five years.“Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly,” wrote the ECB in a Thursday press release. “It is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady.”The ECB’s decision proves that a global central bank pivot is now well underway, after monetary authorities across the globe raised rates to address surging inflation during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Swiss Central Bank already announced its first 25 basis point cut in March, while the Bank of Canada confirmed its first cut in four years on Wednesday.The question now is whether the United States Federal Reserve will soon follow suit. A similar move could prove bullish for stocks and crypto alike, which historically perform well during periods of cheap borrowing and money supply growth.However, unlike other regions, inflation in the United States remains stubbornly above 3%, while Fed officials refuse to accept any result less than its 2% target.In a Monday interview, Neel Kashkari—president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis—argued that citizens would rather put up with a shrinking economy than with persistently high inflation.Combined with continued resilience in wage growth and the labor market, he expects rates to remain high for some time.“If I look at this resilience and economic activity, that does not look like an economy that is under pressure of very high, very tight monetary policy," he saidAccording to CME FedWatch, the consensus view is that rate cuts will arrive later this year—possibly in September, and almost certainly by November. June, however, is considered to be almost certainly a write-off.“The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” wrote the Federal Reserve in a statement following its last meeting in May.Interest rate cuts are historically positive for Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, with some analysts pegging BTC's recent price uptick on bets that the Fed and others will indeed trim down rates.Even so, prominent BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has theorized that money supply growth—and hence, new highs for Bitcoin—will happen regardless of whether the Fed cuts rates or not.The U.S. Treasury, for example, must continue making high interest rate payments to bondholders while rates are elevated, putting money in people’s pockets and counteracting the intended effect of higher rates.“When you combine Fed and Treasury activities, the net is an injection of $21 billion per month,” Hayes wrote to Twitter in February. “This is one reason why tech/AI [and] crypto are pumping and will continue to pump.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum ETF Approval Sparks Altcoin Frenzy, Meme Coin Mania: What Investors Need To Know - Benzinga

The approval of Ethereum ETFs stirred the competition between Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD for dominance in the smart contract arena. Should Solana also receive ETF approval, the rivalry is expected to escalate, potentially influencing both platforms’ market dynamics. Analysts suggest that Layer 1 blockchains such as Avalanche AVAX/USD and Cardano ADA/USD might benefit from a broader market surge despite the initial focus on Ethereum.Altcoins: A Mixed BagAccording to analysts, the influx of new investors through the Ethereum ETF might create a "rising tide lifting all boats" effect. Established altcoins such as Cardano and Polkadot DOT/USD, known for their strong utility functions and established developer communities, could see substantial price increases. These altcoins, offering real-world solutions, may attract investors seeking broader blockchain ecosystem exposure beyond Ethereum.However, a "flight to quality" scenario might emerge. New investors, prioritizing perceived stability, could favor Ethereum over riskier altcoins, potentially causing a temporary decline in prices of smaller altcoins, especially those grappling with scalability or unclear roadmaps.Meme Coins: A Speculative PlayDue to increased crypto market attention, meme coins like Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD could experience a surge in interest. Platforms such as Binance Square anticipate a meme coin frenzy. However, this spike might be short-lived. Many meme coins lack strong utility and rely heavily on social media hype.Projects with long-term value propositions and proven technologies may become more attractive to investors as the market matures, possibly leading to a "meme coin top" where only the strongest meme coins with real-world applications or unique features survive.Ethereum vs. Solana: The Battle for SupremacyThe Ethereum ETF could see Ethereum's price reach new heights due to increased investor interest. However, Solana’s potential ETF approval might balance the competition in the long term. The success of both platforms depends on addressing scalability issues. Ethereum's transition to Ethereum 2.0 promises improved transaction speeds and reduced fees, while Solana offers high speed and low fees but faces challenges like network congestion and potential centralization. The platform that balances speed, security and scalability will likely dominate the smart contracts space.Layer 1 Blockchains: Potential ResurgenceDespite recent challenges, Layer 1 blockchains such as Avalanche and Cardano could benefit from a broader market surge. Avalanche is known for its high transaction speeds and low fees, while Cardano focuses on security and a research-driven approach. These projects must attract developers and build robust decentralized ecosystems to thrive. Layer 1s offering genuine alternatives to Ethereum are more likely to experience a resurgence.Navigating a Fiery MarketThe Ethereum ETF marks a pivotal shift in the cryptocurrency market, bringing opportunities and challenges for different sectors. Investors should focus on specific use cases, technological advancements, development roadmaps and community engagement of various projects.Staying informed about regulatory developments and technological innovations is crucial for navigating the evolving Web3 space. While meme coins may offer short-term excitement, established altcoins and Layer 1s with strong development teams and clear value propositions are likely better bets for long-term gains.Where To Learn MoreAs Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event approaches, the insights on Ethereum and its impact on the broader cryptocurrency market are particularly relevant. Scheduled for Nov. 19, 2024, at Convene, 225 Liberty St. in New York City, this one-day event promises a comprehensive exploration of digital asset innovation. Attendees can look forward to networking opportunities and discussions with industry leaders, making it a must-attend for anyone interested in the future of digital assets.Photo: Courtesy Shutterstock

Bitcoin Open Interest Sets New All-Time High: Is Price Next?


								Data shows the Bitcoin derivatives Open Interest has shot up to a new all-time high (ATH) recently. Here’s what this could mean for the asset’s price.
Bitcoin Open Interest Has Registered A Steep Rise Recently
In a post on X, CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn has discussed about the latest trend in the Open Interest for Bitcoin. The “Open Interest” here refers to the total amount of derivatives positions related to the cryptocurrency that are currently open on all exchanges.

When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market right now. Generally, the total amount of leverage in the sector goes up when this trend forms, so it may lead to the asset’s price registering a higher degree of volatility.
On the other hand, a decrease in the indicator suggests the derivatives users are either closing up positions of their own violation or getting forcibly liquidated by their platforms. Either way, the coin could become more stable following such a drop, due to the decreased leverage.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past few years:

The value of the metric seems to have been climbing up over the last few days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest had sharply risen earlier in the year when the cryptocurrency’s price had witnessed its rally towards the new ATH.
In this surge, the indicator had surpassed its record value set during the peak of the 2021 bull run. As the price fell to consolidation following the mid-March ATH, though, the metric also observed a cooldown.
With the latest recovery run for Bitcoin, however, the trend has once again seen a reversal for the Open Interest, as investors have rapidly started opening new positions. The indicator’s value has now surpassed the high seen earlier in the year, and by a margin at that.
It would appear that speculation has made a return in the market in full force and as it has often happened historically, these extreme levels of Open Interest could once again result in some sharp price action for the cryptocurrency. The direction of these fluctuations, of course, can be in either direction.
As mentioned earlier, the reason volatility goes up after an increase in the Open Interest is due to a rise in the leverage. When leverage increases, mass liquidations become more probable to take place in the market. It’s these high amount of liquidations that can trigger chaos in the market.

In an earlier X post, Maartunn had shared how the the aggregated Open Interest in the cryptocurrency sector as a whole had been approaching an ATH. Therefore, it would appear that Bitcoin isn’t the only coin that has been witnessing an increased appetite for speculative activity recently.

Robert Kiyosaki Confident Bitcoin Will Hit $350K By August 2024, Here's How


																Robert Kiyosaki, financial guru and author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has made a staggering prediction for bitcoin’s (BTC) price in the next two months.
In a recent tweet, Kiyosaki said he is confident that BTC will be worth $350,000 by August 25.
BTC to Tap $350K in August
Kiyosaki said while his prediction may be “suckers bait,” speculation, and an opinion, it is not a lie because any forecast about the future is not false. Nevertheless, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author revealed that he wanted the BTC at $350,000 prediction to come true.
As a years-long Bitcoin supporter and proponent, Kiyosaki has touted the cryptocurrency, alongside gold and silver, as a must-have asset for individuals and entities who want to survive the impending crash of the United States dollar.
Earlier this year, he predicted that BTC would tap $100,000 in June 2024 and $300,000 by the end of the year. At the time of writing, BTC had yet to surpass its all-time high of $73,700 and hovered around $71,000. However, all hope is not lost as the crypto market is known for its extreme pumps and could pull a surprise that would see BTC surge past the predicted price within hours or days.




Kiyosaki’s latest prediction is a step up from its previous forecast of BTC at $300,000 by year-end. The absence of a major Bitcoin event or upgrade that could trigger a rally strong enough to push BTC past $300,000 in the next two months raises the question of the source of Kiyosaki’s confidence in such a prediction.
The financial guru attributed his confidence to the incompetence of U.S. leaders, including President Joe Biden, Fed chair Jerome Powell, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Although Kiyosaki’s BTC prediction remains a wish, he said he is certain about the incompetence of the American leaders, who he tagged stooges.
Kiyosaki Endorses ETH and SOL
Interestingly, Kiyosaki has added Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) to his list of safe-haven assets, along with gold, BTC, and silver. He urged his followers to buy more of the cryptocurrencies and precious metals to protect themselves from the three stooges.
“I am confident Bitcoin will hit $350,000 sometime in 2024 but for it’s only a target, a dream, and a wish.  I keep buying more Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, because quite certain their prices will continue to rise,” Kiyosaki stated.

Congress Considers Benefits of Tokenizing Real World Assets - The Defiant

“Tokenization can leverage the efficiency and transparency of blockchains to help modernize U.S. markets,” said Congressman French Hill.On June 5, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing titled "Next Generation Infrastructure: How Tokenization of Real-World Assets Will Facilitate Efficient Markets."The discussion focused on tokenization, the process by which real-world assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate are represented digitally on a blockchain.“With the help of blockchain, tokenization can automate some of [the] critical processes within a financial transaction, bringing along streamlined settlement and lower costs,” said committee Chairman Rep. French Hill of Arizona in his opening remarks.One of the examples discussed was BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has distributed $1.7 million in dividends to date using the Ethereum blockchain, highlighting the technology’s ability to streamline and automate aspects of asset management and financial transactions. BUIDL has grown to a $462 million market capitalization in less than three months.BUIDL Market CapU.S. lawmakers heard testimony from several industry experts, including Nadine Chakar, the global head of DTCC Digital Assets, who emphasized the transformative potential of tokenization for established markets such as U.S. equities and Treasuries.The DTCC is no stranger to the technology, having recently conducted a ‘Smart NAV’ pilot to evaluate the feasibility of distributing mutual fund Net Asset Value (NAV) data on blockchain networks.Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, shared insights into his company's efforts in creating regulated platforms for tokenizing and trading financial assets on public blockchains."This technology can improve how money flows from companies to investors so investors can redeploy their assets and get better returns," he said.Robert Morgan, CEO of the USDF Consortium, discussed tokenization's potential to improve financing options for consumers and small businesses. By offering more efficient payment solutions and reducing credit costs, tokenized mechanisms like bank-minted deposit tokens could enhance financial inclusion, according to Morgan.Chairman Hill also criticized the anti-crypto stance of U.S. financial regulators, such as the SEC and Federal Reserve.“The private sector should not have to pursue a financial regulator’s endorsement prior to exploring the latest innovation in technologies for a possible way to save the company and consumers money and have a more effective product,” he noted.

Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Responds To Celebrity Memecoins: 'How Do We Push Things In A Better Direction?' - Benzinga

When Vitalik Buterin helped found Ethereum in 2013, he envisioned using the platform and blockchain technology as a force for good. He envisioned the network as a means to increase social welfare and provide users access to valuable projects. It makes sense, then, that Buterin has criticized the meme coin craze overtaking the crypto community in 2024. Buterin stated he is not a fan of the meme coin frenzy and prefers the community push "things in a better direction."Don't Miss:Buterin's comments were in response to a post on X regarding the Mother Iggy (MOTHER) token, a project centered on rapper Iggy Azalea. "If $MOTHER breaks into sustainable value creation, it'll also be the mother of this cycle's celebrity experimentation," said Chris Burniske on X. The Ethereum co-founder responded, stating he is "feeling quite unhappy about with [sic] ‘this cycle's celebrity experimentation' so far," and that he can respect the means "if the end is worthy (health care, open source software, art, etc)."Buterin argues that the creators of these tokens use celebrities' names to attract investors while providing little value in return. He contends this practice detracts funds from more useful projects and contradicts his original vision for Ethereum. Celebrity memecoins have recently become popular among crypto investors. Tokens centered around celebrities like Donald Trump, Caitlyn Jenner, and Elon Musk have attracted billions in investment without providing much value. While most of these meme projects are antithetical to Buterin's grand vision for Ethereum, he mentioned one project that used its funds to add value, though not to the scale he hoped for."Ashton and Mila’s Stoner Cats was vastly more honorable than anything we’ve seen from this 2024 celebrity memecoin era — at least there was an actual show being funded," Buterin noted. The Stoner Cats project featured an NFT collection, which funded an animated show. The project raised enough to hire Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Chris Rock, and Buterin himself as voice actors. Stoner Cats is an example of how crypto project funds can create valuable content. However, the SEC sued Stoner Cats over its NFT offering, resulting in a $1 million civil penalty.With many projects aiming to drive up token prices or make quick money, Buterin asks, "How do we push things in a better direction?" It will be interesting to see how projects respond to his call-out. Read Next:

How Many Users Does Farcaster Actually Have? - The Defiant

A Dune dashboard says 55,000 daily active users (DAU) , but their API says it may be a tenth of that.Farcaster is the blockchain-based social media darling of this cycle, enjoying parabolic growth and a billion-dollar valuation, but data show active users may be a fraction of the most widely-cited numbers.Farcaster has a public API endpoint, which fetches “Power Badge” users, defined as users “who are active, interesting to others and not spammy,” according to the app’s documentation. As social media is overrun by bots, Farcaster’s Power Badge users offer a more reliable way to gauge actual daily active users (DAU).The Defiant ran the numbers and found there are 4,360 daily Power Badge users, compared with the 55,000 daily active users shown on the most popular Dune Analytics dashboard for the app. The dashboard measures DAUs by users performing some action on the platform, and is often cited by Farcaster co-founder Dan Romero."It's Just Bots"The findings signal crypto-based social media adoption is still a niche use-case, even by crypto standards. For reference, exchanges Coinbase and Uniswap boast about 300,000 DAUs. Activity on crypto-based social media, also known as SocialFi, is negligible compared with web2 social media. X has 250 million DAUs.The discrepancy between a superficial reading of Farcaster’s user data and the power-user numbers also signal how untrustworthy web3 activity metrics are as bots muddle the data.“It's quite painful that I see a lot of those decentralized social projects, they try to say, ‘hey, we have this much DAU,’ – No, it's not real.The data is all open,” Suji Yan, the founder of Mask Network, one of the earliest blockchain-based social media networks, said in an interview. “It's an elephant in the room. Everyone should know that it's just bots.”Entrepreneur Liron Shapira pointed to the relatively low Farcaster DAUs the public API was fetching in a May 23 X post. “I now believe Farcaster has between 50 and 5k DAUs, not 45k as a naive reading of Dune Analytics would suggest,” he wrote. He told The Defiant that the reason is that Dune “counts bots.”Romero did not publicly reply to Shapira’s claims or to a request for comment from The Defiant.Activity SlidesBut even using Dune Analytics’ data, activity on Farcaster’s has been sliding lately. Reactions and casts–the equivalent of X’s posts or likes– have more than halved to 3.1 million from 6.1 million a month ago.Farcaster DAUs - Dune AnalyticsFarcaster isn’t alone. In recent months, SocialFi has dipped towards its all-time low in activity, with most networks trending downwards with haste. BitClout, which launched in 2021 and is backed by big-name investors including Winklevoss Capital has all but faded out.Another formerly popular SocialFi app, Friend Tech, showcases a meager 230 DAUs, down 97% from its peak.Farcaster launched in 2020 with its founding team composed of Dan Romero and Varun Srinivasan. In June the protocol announced its most recent funding round, a $150 million Series A at a valuation of $1 billion, led by Paradigm Capital, a16z, and Huan Ventures among others. Srinivasan said Farcaster is “sufficiently decentralized.”White-Listed AccountsOther analysts say Farcaster’s active users may be even lower than what the Power Badge user numbers suggest. Geoff Golberg, founder of Social Forensics, which specializes in social media analytics, said of the 4,344 accounts he found using the API on May 9, roughly 21% or 918 accounts didn’t register any activity.Farcaster documentation shows accounts must be active to earn a Power Badge, which leads to an unsettling implication: A large number of accounts appear to have been white-listed to have Power Badges, Golberg said.Golberg said he came to this conclusion after digging into the data when he found he had lost his Power Badge after criticizing Farcaster for inflating its metrics.“It certainly feels as though the Farcaster team is attempting to silence my voice by reducing the visibility of my account,” he wrote in a May 9 post. “Web2 social’s shadowban has evolved to Web3 social’s shadowban.”Walking the Web3 TalkThe implication that Farcaster is unilaterally and opaquely white-listing or shadow-banning accounts goes directly against the ethos of blockchain-based social media. Web3 proponents say SocialFi will offer users permissionless access to open source social networks. The web3 ideal is that users will control their data and assets, and share the upside of the platforms’ growth.Golberg’s analysis is likely not enough to prove that Farcaster is manipulating user engagement in a centralized way.But the platform’s API does show that so far, a small subset of crypto users are walking the talk when it comes to using SocialFi.

Tether (USDT) Report from JPMorgan - Here is the Bank's Assessment - Bitcoin Sistemi


JPMorgan noted in a recent research report that U.S. crypto regulations are moving in a direction that favors the launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), looks negatively on crypto adoption by local banks, and non-compliant stablecoins.
The bank notes that regulatory initiatives have increased in the US in recent months, raising questions about the direction of crypto regulation ahead of the presidential elections later this year.


Analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a report on Wednesday: “They are against a coin tied to the Fed, against U.S. banks dealing with cryptocurrency, against non-compliant stablecoins like Tether (USDT), and against all tokens other than Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) being securities.” “They are against being classified as such,” he wrote.

The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), passed by the House of Representatives last month, still needs to be approved by the Senate and ultimately the President. The bank said this was unlikely to happen before the election.





JPMorgan noted that Congress passed a resolution overturning the SAB 121 accounting rule that made it harder for banks to store crypto assets, but the resolution was vetoed by President Joe Biden.
The report said the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Anti-Surveillance Act is an attempt to block a U.S. CBDC, preventing Fed banks from offering certain products to consumers and using a central bank digital currency for monetary policy. The bill banning the FED from issuing CBDC was passed by the House of Representatives last month, but it is unclear whether it will be accepted in the Senate.

The Sandbox Raises at $1B Valuation | Bankless


Crypto gaming startup The Sandbox has raised $20M at a $1B valuation. Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands led the investment, which was supported by LG Tech Ventures and True Global Ventures.What's the scoop?Token Reaction: Following the funding announcement, the SAND token increased by 4.5%, though this new round speaks to the broader challenges in the NFT and gaming spaces. The company’s private valuation went from a targeted $4B in 2022 to an actualized $1B today.Future Plans: The capital will go towards enhancing features and developing a decentralized metaverse for mobile devices, which is expected to launch in 2025. Updates to some of its other tools are also planned.Bankless Take:While the “metaverse” stood out as a central narrative last cycle, we have yet to see it return to those heights this time around. That being said, the ability to build one’s own metaverse for friends or a community remains an intriguing prospect, evident from the reported 5.7M users and >1K unique experiences developed via The Sandbox since its Alpha release last November. With projections that the metaverse may add $5T to the global economy by 2030, this forever sought-after virtual land continues to draw investment, especially from the Web3 angle that believes digital ownership via blockchains would be a way for users, not just providers like Minecraft or Roblox, to share these riches.

Terraforms Explained: ETH's Best Onchain Art? | Bankless


My two favorite NFT projects are Nouns and Terraforms. Nouns, I intend to join. Terraforms, I intend to keep collecting. Full disclosure: I hold a few Terraforms right now! I’d like to have a lot more, and honestly, the driving motivation isn’t financial. I find these digital artifacts mesmerizing and likely to age like fine wine in various senses atop Ethereum. The magic here is due in no small part to the creator duo, Mathcastles, being new masters who have used Ethereum as an artistic medium, a computational creative engine, to an extent we haven’t seen before. That said, I feel confident that in 100 years, the art world will look back on Terraforms as important, a major first mover in runtime art because they will see what I see now: a series that broke new ground in a way that expanded the possibilities of art itself. This is high praise, of course, but Terraforms is also hard to explain. It has many nuances and transcends genres. For this post, let’s catch you up on the basics of this unique collection and why, in my humble opinion, it’s one of the best examples of onchain art on Ethereum today! First, What Is Runtime Art?Runtime art is a burgeoning genre within the digital art world that leverages the unique capabilities of blockchain tech, e.g. Ethereum, to create dynamic and evolving artworks. Unlike traditional digital art, which is typically static and stored offchain, runtime art is generated and maintained entirely on the blockchain. This means that the artwork is not just a stored image but an active, living entity that evolves over time based on the underlying smart contract code.At its core, runtime art is about creating art that is dynamically computed at the smart contract level. When I say "runtime," I’m referring to the period during which a program is running. In the context of Ethereum, this means that the art is continuously generated and updated by the smart contract moment by moment, every time it is interacted with. The art can change and adapt in response to various inputs, in other words, such as time, blockchain data (like gas prices or block hashes), or user interactions.While runtime art is still a young genre, several projects have already made significant impacts here. Among these, Terraforms by Mathcastles stands out as one of the prime examples. 
That’s because the Terraforms collection takes full advantage of Ethereum's capabilities to create a series of artworks that are not only visually stunning but also dynamically generated and continuously evolving. This makes Terraforms a trailblazer in the realm of runtime art, pushing the boundaries of what digital art can be and setting a high standard for future projects in this genre.What Are Terraforms?VIDEOLaunched on the Ethereum blockchain in December 2021, Terraforms is the brainchild of the anonymous duo known as Mathcastles, comprised of 0x113d and xaltgeist. At its core, Terraforms is a generative art project that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to create dynamic, interactive, and fully onchain artworks. Each NFT in the Terraforms collection represents a "parcel" of land within a conceptual 20-level virtual "Hypercastle." These parcels are not mere static images but are living pieces of art that evolve over time, driven by the underlying smart contract code.via the Unofficial Terraforms Community FAQ The Terraforms Hypercastle is a complex, multi-layered virtual structure. Each of the 11,104 parcels within the Hypercastle is a 32x32 grid of Unicode characters, creating a visually striking and symbolically rich piece of art. These parcels are categorized by several traits, including:Zones: 75 distinct color palettes.Biomes: 92 sets of glyphs used for animation.Chroma: The pace of animation akin to a heartbeat.Topography: The heightmap of each parcel, introducing a temporal dimension as the height fluctuates over time.Additionally, Terraforms offers a unique system of “modes” that enhance the interactivity and dynamism of the series. Each parcel within the Terraforms collection can exist in different modes, each with its own characteristics and functionalities. Here's a brief overview:Terrain ModeTerrain mode is the default state of a Terraforms parcel. In this mode, the parcel displays a pulsing ASCII design that resembles a topographical map.This mode showcases the initial generative art created by the smart contract. It is static in terms of user modification, but the visuals are dynamic and continuously evolving.Daydream ModeWhen a parcel is switched to Daydream mode, it becomes a blank slate that the owner can use to create custom ASCII art.Owners can activate Daydream mode by entering a command directly into the contract via Etherscan. They can then use community-built tools to draw on their parcel.Once a parcel is switched from Terrain to Daydream mode, this change is irreversible. However, modifications within Daydream mode can be reversed.Terraform ModeTerraform mode is activated when the custom drawings made in Daydream mode are saved back to the blockchain.Parcels can switch between Daydream and Terraform modes indefinitely. This flexibility allows owners to continuously refine and update their designs.In Terraform mode, the custom ASCII art becomes a permanent part of the parcel's blockchain record, viewable by others.Antenna ModeAntenna mode is a new feature introduced with the Terraforms 2.0 upgrade. It allows parcels in Daydream or Terraform modes to receive broadcasts and updates from new artwork programs, i.e., new smart contracts.To activate Antenna mode, owners need to interact with the contract on Etherscan, providing their parcel IDs and enabling the feature.Antenna mode can be turned on or off, offering flexibility and control over the parcel's interaction with new broadcasts.The contract tracks when a parcel enters Antenna mode, with timestamps used for seasonal updates. For instance, parcels activated during "Season 0" can receive special broadcasts and participate in unique events.5 Reasons Why Terraforms Are Great Onchain Art on Ethereumvia On-Chain Checker 1. Fully Onchain and ImmutableTerraforms is among the minority of NFT projects that are fully onchain. Unlike many NFTs that store images offchain and only use the blockchain for ownership records, Terraforms stores all its data directly on the Ethereum blockchain. This includes the code that generates the art, ensuring it is immutable and will last as long as Ethereum exists. This full onchain approach guarantees the permanence and integrity of the artwork. It cannot be altered or lost due to external factors, providing an unprecedented level of artistic authenticity and reliability.2. Dynamic and Runtime ArtTerraforms is a prime example of runtime art, meaning the artwork is dynamically generated at the moment of viewing through the underlying smart contract. The visuals are not static images but are created in real-time based on the code.This approach introduces a new dimension to digital art, where each interaction with the artwork can be unique. It leverages Ethereum as an "always on" computer, continuously generating art that evolves over time, reflecting the blockchain's state.3. Composability and InteractivityTerraforms, thanks to being fully on Ethereum, is highly composable, allowing new artwork programs and features to interact with existing parcels. The introduction of the Antenna mode in Terraforms 2.0 exemplifies this, enabling parcels to receive broadcasts and updates, thereby integrating new artistic elements over time.Zooming out, composability allows Terraforms to continuously evolve, making it more than just a static collection of NFTs. It fosters a dynamic environment where community members can develop new tools, create derivative works, and build on top of the existing infrastructure, enhancing the project's longevity and relevance.I’ve lurked in the Terraforms Discord for years. I can’t lie, it’s one of the smartest and most sincere online groups I’ve ever seen, filled with onchain builders and creatives par excellence constantly sharing their works and thoughts. These aren’t posers; these are the people art schools will be studying in a century. And I don’t say that lightly, it’s not true for most NFT-centric projects today. In a word, Terraforms via Mathcastles has cultivated a robust community that actively and meaningfully contributes to its development. This includes creating visualizers, tools for interaction, and other enhancements. The community engagement is evident in the rich ecosystem of resources that have emerged around Terraforms, like terrafans.xyz, erraformexplorer.xyz, and jaydenkur.com/terra/.Community-driven projects tend to have greater resilience and innovation, as they benefit from the collective creativity and effort of their members. This collaborative spirit is a cornerstone of Terraforms' success and sustainability.5. Designed for LongevityAlong with being fully onchain, which makes it time-resistant, Terraforms includes a built-in decay mechanism that can cause its terrain to collapse over a long period, potentially spanning thousands of years. This decay is a deliberate feature, symbolizing the passage of time and the ephemeral nature of digital art.However, this collapse is not inevitable. Holders can prevent their parcels from decaying by actively switching between modes. Transitioning a parcel to Daydream or Terraform mode helps prevent the decay process, allowing the wider series to persist in its current state.Currently, enough parcels have entered Daydream mode to prevent this collapse from ever occurring. With that said, Terraforms is still one of the few projects on Ethereum today that has been hard-coded with instructions designed to span centuries. What to Watch Going Forward?“[It’s] this notion of a Culture Settlement Layer, which is how I see Ethereum, and one lens of how I've come to see Terraforms and Project 2 as art pieces. The bundle of described patterns / protocols / technologies described above … they treat Ethereum as a way to bootload and sustain new networks.” — 0x113d, Terraforms co-creatorThe more you dig into Terraforms, the more you realize that it poses more questions than answers when it comes to art and the role of computers in our lives. Even in this article, I know I’ve failed to capture the full magic of this collection as I and others see it. Like I said before, it defies straightforward explanation. Some of the magic is intangible. But in some senses, Terraforms is a gateway. It’s enough to learn about it and then explore for yourself from there, and if it resonates, you’ll never not find it interesting. It’s a new kind of artwork that functions as a cultural settlement layer, and toward that end, it’s one of the greatest expressions of onchain art on Ethereum today.All in all, then, I honestly believe Terraforms stands out as a beacon of innovation, creativity, and longevity in the 21st century art scene. If you’re an art enthusiast, or a tech aficionado, or simply curious about the intersection of these worlds, Terraforms offers a glimpse into the future of onchain creativity. Study it!

Firm Attacks US Miners, Bitcoin Network Growing Stronger


								Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm, has launched a scathing attack on the Bitcoin mining industry in the United States, branding it a haven for “snake oil salesmen” that devour investor capital and harm the environment. 
Investment Firm Attacks Bitcoin, Claims Mining Model Flawed
In a post on X, the management firm announced that it had started its war on the burgeoning industry by drafting two letters to Texas authorities.
One is addressed to the Navarro City Commission, where Riot Blockchain has set up its base. Another letter was sent to the Texas state senators.

The investment firm is urging them to crack down on Bitcoin mining in the state, comparing it to the fraudulent Chinese schemes exposed a decade ago. 
What stands out is that their fight will be centered on Bitcoin mining operations in Texas. Considering its low energy costs, the state is a major hub for Bitcoin mining in the United States.

If anything, their opposition to Bitcoin mining has led Kerrisdale Capital to disclose that they are actively shorting Riot Blockchain’s stock. The investment firm thinks the mining farm is a “prime example of a dysfunctional Bitcoin mining business model” trapped in “a vicious cycle of cash burn.”
In their assessment, these public mining firms mostly rely on continuously issuing new shares to fund operations, even when Bitcoin is at or near all-time highs. The investment firm argues this is a sign of a flawed business model.
Kerrisdale Capital also pointed out profitability issuers for these Bitcoin mining operations, even when prices are at record levels. In these cycles, they claim that Riot Blockchain has struggled to be in green. Beyond this, they cite environmental concerns and increasing regulatory scrutiny surrounding mining. 
Additionally, they think the availability of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) means owning shares of mining farms is an unnecessary risk. Over the last six months, spot ETF issuers in the United States have bought billions worth of BTC on behalf of their clients.
Miner Fights Back, Network Strong
As expected, the attack has sparked outrage. Bob Burnett, the founder of Barefoot Mining, has vehemently rejected the “snake oil salesman” label, emphasizing the dedication and hard work of securing the network. 

Of note, the founder points to the resilience of many mining companies during challenging market conditions and their role in maintaining the integrity of the broader ecosystem.

Even with the criticism, Mempool.Space data shows that the total hash rate remains high and steady at over 500 EH/s when writing. At the same time, even after Halving, Foundry USA remains the largest mining farm in the world by hash rate.

Bitcoin over BTC miner shares? Hedge fund makes this prediction! - AMBCrypto



Hedge fund predicts that Bitcoin miners’ shares will go to zero. 
BTC and MSTR have performed better than overall BTC miner shares on a YTD basis. 

After going short on MicroStrategy’s MSTR stock in March, TradFi hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital is back with another short strategy, this time targeting Bitcoin miner Riot Platform’s RIOT share. 
So, what’s the beef with RIOT? Kerrisdale Capital’s CIO Sahm Andrangi told Yahoo Finance that, 
“Our investment thesis is that this sector is not going to be around in five years,’
On X (formerly Twitter), the hedge fund slammed Riot further and called it a ‘dysfunctional hamster’ and ill-equipped to offer better rewards to shareholders. 
‘Like other US-listed miners, $RIOT’s biz model is a dysfunctional hamster wheel of cash burn, which is why it loots retail shareholders with non-stop ATM issuance to fund operations. Even with $BTC near all-time highs, post-halving $RIOT’s mining ops aren’t profitable.’
Interestingly, Andrangi was against the whole Bitcoin mining sector, termed it the ‘stupidest business model’, and predicted that it would ‘ultimately go to zero.’
Bitcoin as a hedge against BTC miners
In such a bearish scenario, the hedge fund maintained that BTC would always perform better against BTC miner shares. So, it would be used as a hedge against BTC miner shares – long BTC, short BTC miners. 
However, since Kerrisdale Capital’s last short strategy against MSTR in March, the stock has soared 37%. 
This tipped some market watchers to adopt a contrarian approach and ‘thank’ the fund for calling BTC miners’ shares ‘bottom’ for the rest of 2024. 
Another X user outrightly wondered how flawed the fund’s strategy was. 
‘This genius is shorting #Bitcoin miners and $MSTR heading into the greatest crypto bull market in history.’
However, the fund was right on BTC outperforming miner shares. On a YTD (year-to-date) basis, MSTR was up 147%, and BTC had 67% gains as of press time. 
However, RIOT was down 37%, while overall BTC miner shares tracker, based on Valkryie Bitcoin Miner ETFs (WGMI), was modestly up only 6% over the same period.

That said, the WGMI has been trending higher as BTC rises. But, it remains to be seen whether the hedge fund’s ‘BTC miners going to zero’ projection will turn out.

$1,500,000,000 Liquidation Cascade Waiting for Bitcoin at $72,000, According To Willy Woo - The Daily Hodl


								On-chain analyst Willy Woo says there’s a “cascade” of liquidation that’s primed to begin when Bitcoin (BTC) hits $72,000.
Woon tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that $1.5 billion worth of short positions are “ready to be liquidated all the way up to $75,000 and a new all-time high.”










Source: Willy Woo/X
Woo also looks at the Bitcoin Macro Oscillator (BMO), which is a composite of four signals: the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator, volume-weighted average price (VWAP) ratio, cumulative value-days destroyed (CVDD) and the Sharpe Ratio.
MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all BTC at the price they were bought at) and is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued.
VWAP represents the average traded price of an asset throughout the day, taking into account both volume and price. Traders use the VWAP to help them determine whether an asset is trading underbought or overbought based on its intraday price action.
The coin days destroyed metric looks at the value of each Bitcoin transaction while giving weight to the number of days since the coins were last moved. The CVDD tracks the cumulative sum of the coin days destroyed metric as a ratio to the market age.
The Sharpe Ratio aims to compare the return of an investment with its risk by dividing a portfolio’s excess returns by a measure of its volatility.
Explains Woo,
“This 2.5 months of consolidation under bullish demand has been very good for Bitcoin, it means price has more room to run before topping out.
Chart: BMO moves 1 level down, now has 2-3 levels to climb before a macro market top.”

Altcoins Are Ready for Their Big Run, According to Crypto Analyst Michaël van de Poppe - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that altcoins are poised to spark a massive rally starting at the end of June.
In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 719,600 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins are gearing up for a ride “back to normal values.”










“The altcoins are ready for their upwards run. I think we’ll be seeing a lot of momentum from late June until September – October. A repricing back to their normal values after the big cascade of the first period of the year.”
Van de Poppe goes on to say that a trio of cryptocurrencies are also showing strength. According to the trader, Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing signs of upward momentum, noting that if the crypto king can hold the $70,000 price level, it could reach new all-time highs.
“The upwards momentum [of] Bitcoin continues to happen. $70,000 broke upwards, through which the important level is to hold $70,000 now for continuation to the all-time high.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Bitcoin is trading for $71,595 at time of writing.
Moving on to Ethereum (ETH), Van de Poppe says the leading smart contract platform by volume would benefit from financial institutions getting their S-1 filings for ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
“Ethereum focusing on generating that higher low. I think certainty regarding the S-1 approvals is going to lead to a strong upwards move and the higher low. Just a matter of patience.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Ethereum is valued at $3,847 at time of writing.
Concluding his analysis with layer-2 scaling solution Polkadot (DOT), the analyst says there’s still time to accumulate despite its price slowly moving upwards.
 “DOT is doing great in fundamental growth. They are focusing on RWA (real-world assets) and have multiple great projects within the ecosystem (Centrifuge and Energy Web). Right now, the price starts to crawl upwards and I think it’s still a great time to accumulate a position.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
DOT is trading for $7.28 at time of writing.

Will Bitcoin ETFs Soar on Sooner-Than-Expected Fed Rate Cut? - ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF Common Shares of Beneficial Interests (BATS:ARKB) - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD surpassed the $71,000 mark, indicating increased market confidence in potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This streak of daily increases is the longest in three months, just 4% below its all-time high of $73,798 set in mid-March, per Bloomberg.Investors should also note that the short-term correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 Index is at its highest since early 2023, indicating that further gains in the tech-heavy index may coincide with a rise in the crypto market leader.ETFs like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITO, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust BITB should now be in focus.Will Fed Cut Rates Soon?Traders are increasingly pricing in the likelihood of a Fed rate cut as early as September following data indicating a slowdown in U.S. inflation and a softer job market. Inflation, which resumed its climb in the first quarter of 2024, is finally showing signs of cooling. Also, the manufacturing sector slowed further in May. Job openings also dropped to new 3-year low. There is now 55.3% probability of a 25-bp Fed rate cut in September, as per the CME Fedwatch Tool, up from 51.3% recorded on Jun 3, 2024. This has led to a decrease in Treasury yields lately, easing financial conditions and benefiting speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Notably, benchmark US treasury yield dropped to 4.33% on Jun 4 from 4.61% recorded on May 29, 2024.Tom Couture, Vice President of Digital Asset Strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, noted that crypto assets are responding positively to the decline in rates. Despite recent struggles to maintain levels above $70,000, optimism persists due to inflows into U.S. ETFs and progress in Washington towards crypto regulatory frameworks.Bullish Prospect Ahead for Bitcoin?Michael Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, expressed optimism about a more favorable U.S. political environment for digital assets, predicting that Bitcoin could reach a record $100,000 or higher by the end of the year, as quoted on Bloomberg.To read this article on Zacks.com click here.

Humane AI Pin Implosion? Poor Sales, Fire Risk, and Potential Acquisition - Decrypt

The Humane AI pin is hot—in all the wrong ways.After heavy launch hype, Humane AI’s $700 AI Pin was met with a wave of harsh reviews. Amid poor sales, the device is now struggling with a faulty accessory. On Wednesday, Humane AI warned users to “immediately stop using and charging” the AI Pin’s optional charging case because of “a fire safety risk.”“Upon receiving a single report of a charging issue while using a third-party USB-C cable and third-party power source, we identified a quality issue with the battery cell supplied by a third-party vendor used in your Charge Case Accessory,” the company said.Humane noted that not all battery cells were affected but that they were telling all users to stop using the case “out of an abundance of caution.” The company also noted that the AI Pin itself—as well as add-on battery and charging pad—were unaffected.Humane declined to provide additional comment to Decrypt.What is the Humane AI Pin?The world got an early preview of the Humane AI pin when it was worn by iconic supermodel Naomi Campbell on the runway during Fashion Week in Paris in September.Designed to be pinned to a lapel or other article of clothing, the AI Pin includes a generative AI model that can answer questions, recall schedules, and search online with the push of a button.“Anything you would search the web for or even use ChatGPT for, you can use on your pin,” Humane AI said during a demonstration in March.From hype to fizzleThe Humane AI pin got lots of buzz, in part due to backers that included Qualcomm, OpenAI, Microsoft, T-Mobile, and TIDAL, and the fact that the Humane AI’s team included veterans from Apple, Samsung, Google, and Amazon.Reviewers delivered a harsh reality check, most notably top technology YouTuber Marques Brownlee. Complaints included its price tag, required monthly subscription, and poor usability—it was declared “too bare bones” and “clunky” by Wired Magazine. “It is an expensive product and expensive subscription for a device that does less,” Mac Rumors writer Steve Moser said on Twitter. “You can only have one expensive aspect for a successful gadget.”The long-term prospects for the company dimmed even before the latest charging case debacle. Humane AI is in the process of looking for a buyer—courting legacy technology company Hewlett-Packard (HP)—according to a report by the New York Times.According to the Times, the Humane AI pin only received 10,000 orders, compared to the 100,000 orders the company reportedly hoped to receive.Humane AI began shopping itself around a week after reviews of the product began coming out, valuing itself at $1 billion after a new fund round, according to the Times report.While the company may be in dire straits, Brownlee did acknowledge a good use case for the fashionable device—which was pitched as a way to leave your smartphone behind.”You’ll have a new phone number, you’ll have to charge another device… but you’ll have less screen time,” he said.A new niche marketWearable technology is not new—smart glasses and watches are well-represented on the market. However, since the launch of OpenAI’s flagship product ChatGPT in November 2022, there has been a race to bring generative AI to the masses in form factors besides smartphones.In September, Facebook's parent company, Meta, announced the launch of its new augmented reality (AR) glasses that include a connection to the company's new MetaAI chatbot.While not a “wearable” the Rabbit R1 offered a personal AI assistant at a more reasonable $200 and does not require a subscription to use. The Rabbit R1 demo in January at CES was so impressive Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella compared it to the reveal of the iPhone.“I thought the demo of the Rabbit OS and the device was fantastic,” Nadella told Bloomberg. “I think I must say, after Jobs and the launch of iPhone, probably one of the most impressive presentations I've seen.”“Overall I’m impressed with this device and I think the R1 is really a standout product,” tech reviewer Justine “iJustine” Ezarik said in her review. “It combines solid hardware with smart adaptive software and it’s really user-focused designed."While the reviews for the Rabbit R1 were notably more kind than the reception, the Rabbit R1 still drew some criticism, from being dismissed as a dressed up Android app to being declared “barely reviewable” by Brownlee.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

VanEck Analysts See Ethereum Price Hitting $22,000 By 2030 ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp
Analysts at global investment firm VanEck said on June 5 that they had raised their 2030 price forecast for Ethereum to $22,000 — up from just $11,800 last year. That would represent a massive jump from Ether’s current market price.



Ethereum’s Unique Value Proposition



Asset manager VanEck, which has filed paperwork to list an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), predicts that ETH ETFs will be much bigger than their Bitcoin peers owing to Ether’s disruptive power and cash flow generated for token holders.







While Ethereum has yielded $3.4 billion in revenue in the last year, VanEck sees that figure hitting $51 billion by 2030.



“We believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world. ETH can be thought of as ‘Digital Oil’ because it is consumed by engaging in activity on Ethereum,” the Wednesday report authored by Matthew Sigel, Patrick Bush, and Denis Zinoviev stated. “The Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech.”



VanEck portrayed Ethereum as the heart of its financial ecosystem. Its network currently secures more than $90 billion in stablecoins, roughly $7 billion in tokenized assets, and $308 billion in digital assets.

“Compared to Web2 applications, Ethereum ($3.4B) generates more revenue than Etsy ($2.7B), Twitch ($2.6B), and Roblox ($2.7B) […] Ethereum is a vibrant economic platform that can be considered a “Digital Mall” whose usership has grown ~1500%, and revenue has surged at a 161% CAGR since 2019,” the report added.



$2 Trillion Market Cap



VanEck also recognizes Ethereum’s potential to disrupt the infrastructure, artificial intelligence, marketing, advertising, social, and gaming industries.



“Should it do so while maintaining its dominant position among smart contract platforms, we see a credible path to $66 billion in fresh cash flow to token holders supporting a $2.2.trillion asset or $22,000 per coin, by 2030.”



$22,000 by 2030 would mark a 487% increase from the current price of $3,845.64. Notably, $22K is VanEck’s base case price estimate. The most optimistic and bearish price projections were $154K and $360, respectively.



Spot Ether ETFs In The Works



The prognostication is also based on the expectation that spot ether ETFs will soon be greenlighted for trading. These new products will boost Ethereum’s appeal among more conservative institutional investors, just as the recently launched spot BTC ETFs drew strong investor demand, amassing a total net inflow of $15 billion since their inception.



“We anticipate that spot ether ETFs are nearing approval to trade on U.S. stock exchanges,” according to the report. “This development would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold this unique asset with the security of qualified custodians and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs.”



After clearing BTC ETFs in January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission failed to engage much with applicants on ether ETFs. However, that changed when the regulator gave the nod to 19b-4 forms tied to the ETFs. The SEC, however, must first approve S-1 filings before investors can buy the spot ETH products.

FTX creditor group files objection against bankruptcy reorganization plan

A group of FTX creditors led by Sunil Kavuri has objected to the reorganization plan filed by the defunct exchange’s bankruptcy managers.According to a June 5 court filing, the creditors argued that the plan failed the best interest test. Justifying the objection, Sunil noted that it is unconfirmable as a matter of law as it includes releases not in the interest of the estate. He added that the plan also ignores property rights issues.Notably, the creditors argued that FTX’s cash repayment would force a taxable event that could be avoided through in-kind repayment. As such, creditors would be forced to pay tax on declared gains upon the cash receipts. They wrote:“Because the Debtors state that they will take the position that this ‘forced exchange’ is a taxable event, it will inflict additional hardships on customers through forced taxation that could be avoided by making an ‘in kind’ distribution.”Kavuri made reference to the current lawsuit against the estate’s law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, over its ties to the exchange prior to its collapse. He claimed that the plan included an exculpation clause “so they and no one involved [can be] sued for misconduct.”The creditors further stated that FTX must update the disclosure statement for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settlement and include the examiner report. The objection follows a recent agreement to settle tax claims with the IRS.The settlement plan will see the IRS receive a $200 million priority claim within 60 days after the approval. Additionally, they also receive another $685 million lower-priority claim paid after customers have been fully paid.On May 7, FTX bankruptcy managers announced a reorganization plan that would see creditors gain full cash repayment. Per the plan, creditors with claims below $50,000 would be eligible for a 118% recovery within 60 days of the court approval.Similarly, other non-governmental creditors would also receive their total claims with up to 9% interest as compensation.Mentioned in this articlePosted In: FTX, BankruptcyLatest Alpha Market Report

How to Sell ETH to Wall Street | Bankless


Ethereum’s spot ETFs could begin trading any day now! One big question remains: how will we sell ETH to Wall Street?It's a question that has perplexed the industry at many times. While Bitcoiners have solidly clung to the easy-to-understand narrative of “digital gold,” Ethereum’s fans have often had a tougher time landing on a shared, succinct narrative that sparks external interest in the ecosystem.Today, we’re evaluating six of the most prominent narrative contenders that encapsulate the essence of Ethereum. We then explain the thought process behind why each could be potent in onboarding the next generation of investors to Ethereum, and assign each one a narrative grade ranking based on how successful we think they will be in courting adoption among prospective ETF buyers👇"It's a Tokenization Platform"Tokenization has already been touted by financial luminaries, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, as representing a paradigm shift for financial markets for its promises to drastically decrease friction and cost while improving accessibility and liquidity. Additionally, it aims to unlock unprecedented levels of transparency and composability!Explaining Ethereum as the world’s leading tokenized asset platform spells out why the Network is important in terms that TradFi participants can understand.Although tokenization does not delve into the positive relationship between increasing onchain activity and ETH price, it demonstrates the central role Ethereum could play in modernizing the financial system; achievement of this goal alone would make ETH the most valuable crypto asset in existence.The narrative captures Ethereum’s role as a global settlement layer for real world assets, making it easier for TradFi to rationalize Ethereum’s role as the global settlement layer for an interconnected network of chains and its pursuit of modular scaling.Narrative Grade: BDespite stated excitement for tokenization from numerous financial institutions, the narrative is hampered by some regulatory uncertainty, but fortunately, investor excitement for tokenization could catalyze needed legislative action to provide regulatory clarity on digital assets and their role within financial markets.
"Ethereum is the Onchain App Store"Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum offers highly expressive smart contracts that unlock financial programmability for developers, enabling the network to become an onchain equivalent of Apple’s App Store.Those who download and fund an Ethereum-compatible crypto wallet receive unfettered access to a litany of consumer applications that facilitate a wide variety of financial, gaming, and cultural interactions. In this digital economy, ETH must be used to pay for gas fees, inciting demand for ETH the asset, and transaction fees payments become revenue for Ethereum, which then trickles down to holders via the Burn – a crypto-native version of stock buybacks!An investment in ETH is akin to buying direct ownership in the App Store, a purchase many investors would be willing to make given its lucrative cash flow generation capabilities and its strong network effects – both qualities which Ethereum possesses.Narrative Grade: C While this narrative has gained traction in recent weeks as the best way to present ETH to TradFi and draws similarities to familiar products, it is unclear if external participants have a good understanding of the types of interactions that can be performed onchain, potentially leading them to ascribe little value to such activities.
"It's an Internet Bond"Parallels can easily be drawn between crypto-native staking schemes and fixed income instruments in TradFi.In exchange for providing 32 ETH as validator collateral (principal), stakers accrue rewards (interest). Unlike in TradFi, this relationship does not depend on any party’s ability to repay the loan, and is instead backed by immutable code and the future economic activity of Ethereum – in the form of block fee revenue and inflationary block rewards.Investors of all kinds love earning passive income off their assets, leading many to assume this would be a slam dunk narrative for Ethereum, particularly in comparison to the only TradFi traded alternative: non-productive BTC.Narrative Grade: CUnfortunately, spot ETH ETFs will not be launching with staking, and while crypto natives can continue to generate yield via this avenue, it is unlikely that the “Internet Bond” narrative will be compelling among investors who can not access this feature, at least until staking-enabled ETFs are launched. ETH: The Internet Finance Bond on BanklessRead our analysis of Ethereum’s internet finance bond with the launch of Ethereum 2.0"ETH is Ultra Sound Money"Bitcoin maximalists have long espoused their chosen digital currency’s “sound money” principles, emphasizing that the network’s programmatic block reward issuance schedule is resistant to debasement, giving BTC its store of value status.“Ultra Sound Money” was created by the Ethereum ecosystem to meaningfully differentiate it as an investment against Bitcoin, and was was first popularized by Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake in September 2020 immediately prior to last cycle’s boom.Although Ethereum does not presently have a guaranteed emissions schedule, ETH supply can turn deflationary as block demand increases thanks to EIP-1559, reducing the number of tokens in circulation over time to theoretically imbue the token with superior store of value qualities, thus creating an “ultra sound money.”Narrative Grade: DSurging prices throughout 2021 made the idea of a deflationary token highly attractive, but this narrative become decidedly less attractive alongside the sharp drop off in inflation; should policy makers resort to debasement to stimulate a global economy in decline, Ultra Sound Money could emerge as as premier narrative. Then again, it may be too degen of a descriptor for Wall Street.
"It's Digital Oil"Bitcoin may have already taken the moniker of “digital gold,” but who cares about a shiny rock when you can own an alternative decentralized commodity that fuels the global economy?When making transactions on the Ethereum L1 and many of its L2s, users must pay for their transaction fees using Ether to get execution; due to the widespread prevalence of onchain transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem, many see ETH as the digital corollary for oil.Like oil, which derives intrinsic value for its usage as a key commodity input, Ether benefits from usage of the applications on Ethereum that require the payment of gas to access.Narrative Grade: DIncreasing usage of Ethereum’s onchain applications should have positive implications for Ether by showcasing the close connection between activity and price, but this narrative seems difficult to sell to traditional market participants who have displayed resilience in making onchain interactions and do not fully grasp what the onchain economy is.
"It's Internet Money"By virtue of Ethereum’s expressive smart contracts, developers can create applications on the blockchain as discussed in the case above for representing Ethereum to TradFi as the next generation equivalent of the App Store.Within this ecosystem, ETH is the native “internet money,” serving as the medium which many store their value in and use for payments. Further, the existence of these smart contracts makes this money programmable, enabling its automated usage by applications.Among earlier generations of crypto users who sought out utility for their assets, the ability to use Ether as money was an attractive use case that drove many to adopt crypto technology, however, it is probably far-fetched to assume that the narrative can produce any excitement for remaining TradFi hold outs.Narrative Grade: FTo start off, the concept of internet money may not be taken seriously by the types of sophisticated/older investors that ETFs are meant to attract. Moreover, people do not typically invest in monies due to their inherent inflationary properties and propensity to lose purchasing power over time, an association which could make it difficult for investors to see value in an asset categorized as such.
🧐 Wait, why no “A” grades?Keen-eyed readers may have noticed that none of the above narratives received an “A” grade! While each narrative certainly comes with its own attractive features, none in isolation are the silver bullet solution required to onboard the next generation of investors to Ethereum.All are either stale or unproven, and while narratives help investors understand aspects of Ethereum, an understanding of the network in its entirety is necessary to fully grasp the revolutionary impacts this technology could yield…For the non-crypto natives that spot ETFs are intended to attract, it will likely be the concept of tokenization that allows them to recognize that importance of block space, the acknowledgement of which is a prerequisite to grasping the notion of Ethereum is the onchain equivalent of the App Store and unlocks their ability to appreciate Ether as digital oil and a new form of money!Regulatory clarity is required for Ethereum’s tokenization and internet bond narratives to truly gain traction, but in the meantime, the ecosystem can always fall back to Ultra Sound Money should policy makers resort to debasement to kickstart the faltering global economy.Ethereum may be too complex to distill down to a single narrative, but efforts to do so present the ecosystem in an approachable format to external investors that could potentially pique their excitement and lead them to dive deeper down the crypto rabbit hole!

Biden Vetoes Bipartisan Bill To Overturn SEC's Crypto Custody Rules - Benzinga

On Monday, President Joe Biden has vetoed a bipartisan resolution aimed at overturning the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) crypto custody guidance. The resolution passed both the House and the Senate and sought to invalidate the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121.Presidential Veto ExplainedIn a letter to the House of Representatives, Biden stressed the importance of the SEC's guidance in safeguarding investors. “SAB 121 reflects considered technical SEC staff views regarding the accounting obligations of certain firms that safeguard crypto-assets,” Biden stated. He emphasized that the resolution would “inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to set forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues.”Biden further clarified, "This reversal of the considered judgment of SEC staff in this way risks undercutting the SEC’s broader authorities regarding accounting practices. My Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors."Legislative BackgroundThe Republican-led legislation garnered notable bipartisan support. It passed the House with a 228 to 182 vote, including backing from 21 Democrats. The Senate approved the bill with a 60 to 38 vote, with eleven Democrats supporting the measure.Political and Regulatory ContextThis veto arrives amid heightened scrutiny of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD. The Biden administration's stance on digital assets is closely watched, especially with the 2024 election on the horizon. Voters have been increasingly considering candidates’ positions on cryptocurrency regulation.Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump, Biden’s anticipated Republican challenger, strongly supports the crypto industry. Recently, Trump began accepting crypto donations and pledged to uphold investors’ rights to self-custody their assets. Benzinga’s Future of Digital AssetsAmid this regulatory backdrop, the upcoming Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event in New York City on Nov. 19, 2024, is poised to be a crucial gathering.
