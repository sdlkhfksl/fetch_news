                        ETFGI, an independent research firm, reports assets invested in cryptocurrency exchange traded funds (ETFs) and exchange traded products (ETPs) listed globally have reached a major new milestone of $69.39 billion at the end of February seeing a 358.9% from $15.12 billion at end of 2023. Crypto ETFs and ETPs listed globally have gathered net inflows of $9.20 billion during the month of February, bringing year-to-date net inflows to $36.76 billion, which is much higher than $179.02 million in net inflows at this point last year.According to research firm ETFGI which was launched in 2012 by Deborah Fuhr who previously served as a managing director at BlackRock, this is the fifth month crypto ETFs and ETPs have seen net inflows.SEC Approves Spot Bitcoin ETFs January
On January 11, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications, from BlackRock, Ark Investments and 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco and VanEck — this in turn has caused a trading frenzy and triggered a bull market.  Bitcoin BlackRock’s IBIT Sees $320M in Inflows
The BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to gain traction in the cryptocurrency market, with recent data revealing a significant influx of $320 million in new investments.  This surge in inflows comes as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has praised IBIT as the “fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs.”In a recent interview with Fox Business, Fink expressed his surprise and satisfaction with IBIT’s performance. Fink emphasized that the trust’s success has surpassed his expectations, particularly during its first 11 weeks of trading.Rise in Number of Issuers Launching Crypto ETFs and ETPs
In 2022, ETFGI reported assets of $12.4 billion were invested in 100 crypto ETFs or ETPs listed globally at the end of January, as previously reported. There has been a huge increase in the number of issuers launching cryptocurrency ETPs as more investors are doing due diligence on investing in cryptocurrency and some are starting to add some Bitcoin and other crypto exposures to their portfolios.

Ethereum Being Designated a Security Won’t Hurt Chances of Spot ETH ETFs Approval, Says BlackRock CEO Larry Fink - The Daily Hodl


								BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink believes approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could still occur even if the top altcoin is deemed a security.
In a new interview on FOX Business, Fink says that the chances of approval for pending applications to launch spot ETH ETFs would not be adversely impacted if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) designates Ethereum as a security.










“I don’t think that [security] designation is going to be that deleterious.” 
BlackRock is among several companies with pending applications before the SEC to launch a spot ETH ETF following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January.
The SEC considers Bitcoin a commodity, not a security. Gary Gensler, SEC chair, has not said whether he believes ETH is a security, but he has suggested many digital assets besides Bitcoin could be deemed securities.
The SEC is reportedly moving to designate ETH as a security. Meanwhile, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has indicated ETH is a commodity.
Asked if BlackRock could still launch a spot ETH ETF even if Ethereum is deemed a security, Fink says they could.
He also says that the demand for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) spot BTC ETF product is exceeding his expectations.
“I’m very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin. We’re creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency. And I’m pleasantly surprised, and I would never have predicted it before we filed it, that we were going to see this type of retail demand… 
IBIT is the fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs. Nothing has gained assets as fast as IBIT in the history of ETFs.”

El Salvador’s Bitcoin Vault Hits ATH on Piggy Bank Rebalance - DailyCoin


        
El Salvador’s ‘Digital Gold’ vault has surpassed $400 million in market value.



Earlier this month, Mr. Bukele posted the public address of El Salvador’s BTC.



Two weeks after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high, El Salvador continues to DCA.
El Salvador’s recently re-elected President, Nayib Bukele, is making good on the Latin American country’s promise to acquire one Bitcoin (BTC) a day. In a message on X, Bukele revealed that the country’s stash has reached 5,700.A few weeks ago, El Salvador shocked the cryptosphere by presenting a physical vault with a built-in hardware wallet to store the country’s BTC reserves. In addition, the lump sum in the cryptocurrency address that’s publicly available for tracking indicated a far larger amount than previously expected.El Salvador’s Bitcoin Stash RevealedEarlier this month, El Salvador’s estimated BTC stash was said to have nurtured a $85 million profit, according to data from NayibTracker. On March 15, 2024, Bukele revealed there was a physical BTC vault inside El Salvador. This location is unknown to the public, but the vault’s crypto address has been publicized on X, as Bukele showcased a 5,689 balance in a cryptic tweet, inspiring crypto aficionados to contribute with numerous digital relicts being sent there.El Salvador’s Bitcoin address shows 11 BTC added in the past 11 days by Bitfinex, the official partner of El Salvador in their Bitcoin program. This totals El Salvador’s holdings to 5,702 Bitcoins at the time of this publication, worth $402 883 744.How El Salvador Benefits From Pioneering BitcoinEl Salvador pledged to buy one Bitcoin a day, based on the Dollar Cost Average (DCA) strategy. Bukele even declared that the country will keep topping up on its BTC stash until it becomes “unaffordable with fiat currencies.”Popular YouTuber Wealthy Expat named the available citizenship for a $1 million investment via BTC as one of the strong points for El Salvador to become a leading cryptocurrency hub in the next decade.
Finally, the erased tax on all IT startups and the recently implemented 0% tax for foreign-sourced income play a key part in this prediction, as El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office continues to recruit visitors and investors through the Freedom Visa Program.On the Flipside
Many of El Salvador’s foreign investors, including Wall Street, are awaiting the highly-anticipated issuance of El Salvador’s Volcano bonds.



These Bitcoin-backed Volcano bonds were due for an early 2024 release but were postponed numerous times until further notice.
Why This MattersEl Salvador declared Bitcoin a legal tender in 2021, paving the way for other countries to embrace blockchain technology and adapt it for everyday use.

Vitalik Buterin pushes for anti-correlation incentives in Ethereum staking - Crypto Briefing




Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new framework to incentivize Ethereum decentralization by penalizing correlated failures among validators.According to the research proposal submitted by Buterin, large-scale staking groups, and organizations have an undue advantage over smaller players, creating an imbalance in the decentralized staking sector.“The theory is that if you are a single large actor, any mistakes that you make would be more likely to be replicated across all “identities” that you control, even if you split your coins up among many nominally-separate accounts,” the Ethereum co-founder said.Buterin suggests that validators controlled by the same entity should receive a higher penalty if they fail together, compared to failing independently. The theory behind this approach is that mistakes made by a single large actor are more likely to be replicated across all the “identities” they control.Staking pools and liquid staking services such as Lido remain popular among users, given how their platform allows for the participation of more stakers due to the lower amount of entry (in ETH). To date, Lido currently has an estimated $34 billion worth of ETH staked, representing around 30% of the total supply. Advocates and developers pushing for Ethereum decentralization have previously cautioned against Lido’s dominance and the potential for “cartelization,” where outsized profits can be extracted compared to non-pooled capital.Buterin’s analysis of recent attestation data revealed that validators within the same cluster, such as a staking pool, are more likely to experience correlated failures, likely due to shared infrastructure. To address this issue, he proposed penalizing validators proportionally to the deviation from the average failure rate. If many validators fail in a given slot, the penalty for each failure would be higher.Based on simulations of this scenario, such a system could reduce the advantage of large Ethereum stakers over smaller ones, as large entities are more likely to cause spikes in the failure rate due to correlated failures.The proposal’s potential benefits include incentivizing Ethereum decentralization by encouraging separate infrastructure for each validator and making solo staking more economically competitive relative to staking pools. Buterin notes that other options could be subjected to further analysis. This includes variations on the penalty schemes in order to minimize the average “big” validator’s advantage over smaller validators.According to Buterin, it’s also worth examining the impact of such a framework in terms of geographic and client decentralization. However, he did not mention the possibility of reducing the solo staking amount from the current 32 Ether (ETH) or approximately $111,000 based on Ether’s current price at roughly $3,500.

Glassnode Data Shows Bitcoin at Crossroads: Time to Hold or Take Profit?


								According to on-chain data analysis by Glassnode, Bitcoin is at a critical juncture. When BTC soared to $73,800 in March 2024, printing new all-time highs, the Bitcoin market reached a statistically significant level regarding on-chain unrealized profits, according to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.
Bitcoin MVRV Ratio At Historically Significant Level: Time To Hold Or Take Profit?
The analytics platform notes that, historically, such levels have coincided with periods of market resistance. Therein, some holders often choose to take profits by exiting their positions. 

It remains to be seen whether the same will be replicated, and prices fall as holders make a profit. However, according to MVRV, this will likely happen if past performance guides.
BTC MVRV Bands | Source: Glassnode on X
Simply put, the MVRV ratio shows how expensive the coin is relative to historical prices. It is a tool for gauging whether Bitcoin, as it is at spot rates, is under or overvalued. When the ratio is above 1, it suggests that it is overvalued.
When BTC rose to approximately $74,000, the MVRV ratio rose above 3. However, it should be noted that it was way lower than historical levels when Bitcoin registered new all-time highs. When BTC rose to $69,000 in 2021, the MVRV ratio was over 5. At the 2017 peak, this value was over 4.8, which is the highest it has been.
BTC Has Been Under Pressure, Will Prices Recover?
Recently, Bitcoin has struggled to edge higher, looking at price action in the daily chart. The coin remains below all-time highs of $73,800. Even though bulls shook off selling pressure over the weekend, pushing strongly above resistance levels, the follow-through has not been impressive.

Any breakout above $74,000 from the candlestick arrangement will thrust the coin into new territory. Some analysts speculate the coin might float to as high as $100,000 in 2024, especially after the network halves its miner rewards in April 2024.

Despite the recent sell-off pushing prices to around $62,000, the overall market sentiment remains bullish. The CoinStats Fear and Greed Index, a gauge of investor sentiment, still reads “Extreme Greed” at 80.

Additionally, interest is back after days of outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). By March 27, Lookonchain data shows that Fidelity added added 4,001 BTC. In total, and factoring in GBTC’s outflow, all spot Bitcoin ETF issuers added 3,469 BTC.

AGIX Token Surges on AltSignals Merger News, Hits $1.39


							

AGIX’s price hits a 7-day high at $1.39, up 28% over the month amid merger news.



AGIX volume surges by 97.27%, and the market cap reaches $1.78 billion.



Bollinger bands widen on the AGIX chart, signaling increased volatility.




Since the news of a merger of SingularityNET (AGIX), Fetch.ai (FET), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) into AltSignals (ASI) Token, which would have a diluted valuation of $7.5 billion, AGIX has been on a positive surge. As a result, the AGIX bullish momentum regained strength, sending the price to a 7-day high of $1.39 after finding support at an intra-day low of $1.20. At press time, AGIX was trading at $1.39, up 7.98% in the prior 24 hours and 28% in the previous month.



If the positive momentum breaks over the $1.39 resistance, the next resistance levels to watch for are $1.50 and $1.60, as investors continue to believe in the potential of AltSignals (ASI) Token. However, if the price fails to break over $1.39, there may be a brief pullback down to the $1.20 support level before trying another positive rise.



AGIX/USD 24-hour price chart (source: CoinStats)



During the rise, AGIX’s market capitalization and 24-hour trading volume increased by 7.595% and 97.27%, respectively, to $1,775,791,076 and $544,730,216. This jump reflects increased interest and investment in the AGIX token, with the potential for more gains if the bullish trend continues.



AGIX/USD Technical Analysis



On the AGIXUSD 4-hour price chart, the Bollinger bands are widening, with the upper and lower bands touching $1.3686 and $1.07931, respectively.  This trend points to heightened volatility in the near future, with the upper and lower bands possibly serving as resistance and support levels for price moves.



However, as the bullishly engulfed candlestick has breached the upper Bollinger band, the upward trend may continue in the short term. Conversely, this might suggest an overbought position, which could result in a price downturn.



AGIX/USD 4-hour price chart (source: TradingView)



The Money Flow Index (MFI) rating of 78 lends validity to the overbought circumstances, indicating that the asset’s present upward momentum may be reaching its limit. As a result, traders should take care and constantly monitor market movement for indications of a reversal or correction. However, with the stochastic RSI moving above its signal line at 42.89, there is still room for more upward movement before a correction happens.



Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which is now in the negative area with a rating of -0.06, is rising, indicating that selling pressure may be diminishing and purchasers may soon reclaim control of the asset’s price movement. This suggests that, while prudence is advised, there is potential for more positive momentum soon.

United States Treasury’s tokenized assets hit over $1 billion

The tokenization of United States Treasurys and other real-world assets on blockchain platforms has gained significant traction, with over $1 billion worth of U.S. Treasurys now existing across Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and other blockchains. This surge has been fueled in part by the launch of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which has quickly become a prominent player in the market.United States tokenized treasury asset hits a milestone figureBUIDL, launched on Ethereum on March 20, has rapidly grown to a market cap of $244.8 million. Recent transactions totaling $95 million have further boosted the fund, making it the second largest tokenized government securities fund, trailing only Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX), which holds $360.2 million in United States Treasurys.The appeal of tokenized government treasures lies in their 1:1 peg with the United States dollar and the daily accrued dividends they pay directly to investors each month. This model, facilitated via the Securitize protocol, is seen as more attractive from both a risk and return perspective compared to stablecoin yields, particularly in the current high-interest rate environment.Real-world asset tokenization firms like Ondo Finance have also contributed significantly to BUIDL’s growth. Ondo Finance recently deposited $79.3 million into BlackRock’s fund, totaling $95 million across four transactions. This move allows instant settlements for Ondo Finance’s own U.S. Treasury-backed token, OUSG, and has earned the firm a 38% share in BUIDL.Growing trends and the impact of tokenized assetsThe broader landscape of tokenized assets includes not just U.S. Treasurys but also stocks, real estate, and various other assets that can be tokenized on blockchain platforms. Ethereum, for instance, accounts for $700 million of all real-world assets (RWA) tokenized on-chain, highlighting the platform’s significance in this space.BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s support for blockchain tokenization reflects a broader trend in the financial industry, with Boston Consulting Group estimating that the tokenization market could reach $16 trillion by 2030. This trend is not limited to traditional asset management firms like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton.Blockchain-native firms such as Ondo Finance, Backed Finance, Matrixdock, Maple Finance, and Swarm are also active participants in tokenizing real-world assets. Overall, the rapid growth of tokenized U.S. Treasurys and other assets on blockchain platforms underscores the increasing acceptance and adoption of blockchain technology in the financial sector, paving the way for more efficient and accessible capital markets in the future.

Sanctioned crypto exchange Garantex probed over $20B USDT transfers


A dual probe by US and UK investigators is investigating the movement of 20 billion tether (USDT) through crypto exchange Garantex after both countries instituted sanctions against the exchange.
According to Bloomberg sources, the transactions involved in the probe may constitute one of the biggest breaches of wartime sanctions since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.
The investigation into the possible violation of wartime sanctions doesn’t necessarily indicate wrongdoing by Tether Holdings or its affiliated companies. A Tether Holdings spokesperson reiterated that the firm remains committed to working with law enforcement to catch and prevent criminal misconduct.
According to an Estonian newspaper, Garantex has ties to a convicted gang member, a violent debt collection agency, and a state-backed oil company in Russia. With support from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), that newspaper published details of the misbehavior of people connected to Garantex.

According to the US Treasury, Garantex has willfully disregarded anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) obligations and has allowed its systems to be abused by illicit actors. Crypto wallets controlled by Garantex are listed on the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s Specially Designated Nationals List.
In December 2023, Russian bank InDeFi Bank launched a tether trading project in collaboration with Russian company Exved. An executive at that bank is the founder of Garantex.

Bitcoin Ordinals Creator Unveils 'Rune' Documentation, Here's What You Need To Know



Runes’ functionality is based on the concept of runestones, which are protocol messages saved in Bitcoin transaction outputs.

Casey Rodarmor, creator of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol has unveiled Runes documentation, indicating a new phase for BTC transactions.
The Characteristics of Bitcoin Runes
The documentation describes the basic characteristics of Runes, such as their names, amount, Cap, minting, burning, and divisibility.




Runes introduces an innovative concept to Bitcoin transactions that permits the etching, minting, and transfer of Bitcoin-native digital commodities on the blockchain. Notably, Runes come into existence through etching. Etching generates a Rune and assigns its properties. Once set, these properties are immutable, even by the etcher.
Every unit of Rune is the same, unlike unique Inscriptions. This feature makes Rune an interchangeable token fit for use in a variety of crypto applications. Runes are identifiable by IDs, which are textually written as BLOCK:TX and comprise the block in which the Bitcoin Rune was etched as well as the index of the etching transaction within that block.
Runes’ functionality is based on the concept of runestones, which are protocol messages saved in Bitcoin transaction outputs. Runestones facilitate smooth transactions within the Bitcoin network by encoding crucial information about Rune production, minting, and transfer.
Another key feature introduced by Runes is the concept of minting, which involves the generation of new units. Mints can be open or closed, with certain rules governing their operations. This approach allows for the controlled issuing of Runes, maintaining transparency and fairness throughout the ecosystem.
As indicated in the documentation, names, represented by letters A through Z, are assigned during the etching process, with spacers included for reading. However, the uniqueness of a name is not determined by spacers. Therefore, a Rune may not be carved with the same letter sequence as an existing version, even if the spacers are different.
Furthermore, the documentation also describes the Rune burning and transfer procedure, which involves exchanging the assets between transaction inputs and outputs. While burnt Runes are removed permanently from circulation, transfers are facilitated through runestone edicts.
The Growing Prominence of Bitcoin Ordinals
Bitcoin Ordinals can be described as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain that use satoshis, the chain’s smallest denomination to encode their data. Every satoshi is assigned a serial number based on the sequence it was mined. These numbers are known as ordinals, and they assist the blockchain to keep track of where each satoshi is and who owns them.
The demand for Bitcoin Ordinals has increased drastically over the past year. Due to this demand, it has grown to become a major contributor to the Bitcoin blockchain’s gas fees. In May, the total number of ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain surpassed 10 million.
Consequently, reputable firms including MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR) have stated intentions to incorporate Bitcoin Ordinals into their platform. Michael Saylor, the co-founder of MicroStrategy, revealed at the time that he was interested in assessing the application development potential of Bitcoin Ordinals.
In a similar move, Donald Trump recently launched an NFT on the Bitcoin network, valued at $9,900.

                        Investment manager Kerrisdale Capital said on March 28 that shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) – the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder – are currently trading at an “unjustifiable” premium to MicroStrategy’s actual Bitcoin holdings.MSTR shares have exploded in price over the past two months, but many analysts think the stock is due for a major pullback.The MicroStrategy Bitcoin Premium
“We are long bitcoin and short shares of MicroStrategy… Shares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of bitcoin but, as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away,” the firm wrote.At the time the report was published, MSTR’s price was over $1900 per share. Based on the company’s BTC holdings per share, Kerrisdale said this would imply a current Bitcoin price of $177,000 per coin – a spot price two and a half times higher than where it trades today.Since MicroStrategy’s balance sheet is almost entirely comprised of Bitcoin (BTC), investors have often valued the firm like it were a Bitcoin spot ETF. The company’s executive chairman, Michael Saylor, has called the firm a Bitcoin ETF with perks including moderate leverage and no management fees.Starting in January, the company faced an influx of competition from several asset managers that launched the United States’ first actual Bitcoin spot ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, IBIT, has already accumulated more Bitcoin than MicroStrategy.“The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to Bitcoin are long over,” wrote Kerrisdale.Any advantages the firm has over regular ETFs – such as diluting shares to acquire more BTC – are outweighed by the sheer size of the premium.“Assuming the current premium of 2.6x contracts to a more historically consistent 1.3x represents 50% downside in MSTR relative to bitcoin,” the firm said.MSTR Price Tanks
Shortly after Kerrisdale’s report was published, MSTR shares plummeted by 8% on the day to $1,761. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trades 1.7% higher at $70,600, and Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital trades 4% higher at $24.04.MSTR continues to vastly outperform BTC year-to-date, with both assets boasting gains of 158% and 66% respectively.According to saylortracker.com, MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings are currently worth over $15 billion, having more than doubled in value from their average purchase price.

Crypto Community Reacts To Sam Bankman-Fried's 25-Year Sentence: 'Will His Parents Ever Be Implicated?' - Benzinga

The Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Thursday, prompting a host of reactions from the cryptocurrency community on X (formerly Twitter).What Happened: Many users, like NickyD, expressed outrage at the perceived leniency of the sentence. Comparisons were drawn to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, who is serving multiple life sentences for facilitating illegal online transactions. NickyD tweeted, “Guess the scales of justice tip nicely for the well-connected,” highlighting a sentiment of unequal punishment. NewsWars.AI took a more partisan approach, labeling Bankman-Fried a “Democrat Donor” convicted of a “massive financial fraud.”CrusaderPepe offered a stark perspective, highlighting the sheer amount of money stolen by Bankman-Fried: “This is equivalent to the lifetime earnings of 4,000 people,” they commented.Matthew Sabia took a more lighthearted, albeit insensitive, approach, referencing the potential impact on Democratic Party finances with a tweet suggesting donations have been “crippled by inflation.”Several users questioned Bankman-Fried’s ability to survive a 25-year sentence. Dgen’s tweet, “Not sure he’s going to make it…” reflects a degree of disbelief about the length of the sentence. JC60176 took aim at politicians who received campaign contributions from Bankman-Fried, asking, “Those Dem politicians who took campaign donations…are strangely silent…”Carol Roth raised a critical question: “Sam Bankman Fried gets 25 years– next q–will his parents ever be implicated?” Also Read: Bitcoin ETFs Inflows Soar, Ethereum ETF Race Heats Up: What Does it Mean For Investors?This points to a desire for a wider investigation into the FTX collapse and potential involvement of others.Angela, perhaps reflecting the broader sentiment, believed the sentence wasn’t harsh enough, tweeting, “He deserves more than 100 years for crazy behaviour!” The Bankman-Fried saga serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with cryptocurrency and the need for robust regulations.What’s Next: As the dust settles on the Bankman-Fried case, the cryptocurrency industry grapples with its future. Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event, taking place on Nov. 19, promises to be a crucial platform to discuss these issues and explore the path towards responsible innovation within the crypto space.Read Next: Sam Bankman-Fried Sentencing Update: Defense Says He’s Not A ‘Ruthless Financial Serial Killer’Image: Shutterstock

Crypto users react to Sam Bankman-Fried’s 25-year sentence

More than 500 days after the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, users have an answer for the number of years former CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried will face in prison: 25.In a March 28 hearing, Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced the former FTX CEO to 300 months in prison for his conviction related to misusing customer funds. Prosecutors had suggested up to 50 years in prison for SBF, while his defense attorneys requested the judge be lenient and only impose up to 6.5 years. The judge added the former CEO had committed perjury and intimidated witnesses.Immediately following the announcement in the New York courtroom, crypto users jumped onto social media to express their thoughts. Many suggested that 25 years wasn’t enough time given longer sentences handed down for seemingly less serious crimes.“[The judge] gave him less than Chelsea Manning (35 years) for a waaaaay worse crime,” said Edward Snowden on X, referring to Manning’s 2013 conviction for violations of the Espionage Act.Source: MandrikThough the sentencing guidelines allowed Judge Kaplan to put SBF in prison for more than 100 years, many pointed out before the hearing that this outcome was unlikely. Several legal experts speculated Bankman-Fried would serve between 10 and 30 years, and others suggested it may be an effective deterrent for figures in the crypto space.“Judge Kaplan weighed all of the sentencing factors, including the magnitude of the crime, his conclusion that SBF lied on the witness stand and tampered with a witness, and handed down a serious sentence,” Mark Bini, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York, told Cointelegraph. “While less than the prosecutors’ request for 40-50 years, it is a very significant sentence and sends a message that people convicted of crimes in the crypto space will face serious consequences.”Source: U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New YorkSwan Bitcoin Managing Director Terrence Yang largely disagreed, telling Cointelegraph “justice is not served” and 25 years was “too light” based on the number of suicides in the wake of the collapse of FTX, SBF’s perjury, and the misuse of user funds.“The damage SBF did was permanent and severe,” said Yang. “He ruined a lot of families and lives with his felonious acts and put salt in the deep wounds with his total lack of remorse. I get that he has ADHD and ADHD families filed a statement with the court asking for leniency but SBF is the only person with ADHD in the world who stole billions of dollars in customer funds and destroyed or hurt millions of lives.”Related: What to expect at Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearingBankman-Fried was taken out of court on March 28 to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he has been since Judge Kaplan revoked his bail in August 2023. Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, will likely be the next figure in the case to face sentencing on May 1. Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison and Nishad Singh — other former executives associated with FTX and Alameda Research — have already pleaded guilty and accepted deals.Magazine: ‘Less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: Inner City Press, X Hall of FlameUpdate (March 28 at 6:20 pm UTC): This article has been updated to include a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

The XRP Ledger has addressed a critical bug in its payment engine, specifically impacting interaction with AMMs.



The amendment has been submitted for approval by trusted validators, requiring an 80% approval rate.



XRP Ledger has looked to expand its support for Ether and popular stablecoins.
The XRP Ledger community is taking a significant step forward with the rollout of version 2.1.1 of Rippled, the core software powering the digital asset ledger. This update marks a crucial moment in the XRP Ledger’s ongoing development by addressing a critical bug and streamlining transaction processing.Critical Update for XRP LedgerThe centerpiece of version 2.1.1 is the introduction of the fixAMMOverflowOffer amendment. This amendment resolves a bug that previously impacted the ledger’s payment engine, particularly in its interactions with Automated Market Makers (AMMs). AMMs are vital in facilitating secure and efficient cryptocurrency trading, and a robust payment engine is essential for seamless integration. The fixAMMOverflowOffer amendment directly addresses this need by enhancing the overall security and efficiency of transactions on the XRP Ledger.The importance of robust security measures in the digital asset space cannot be overstated. Recent estimates suggest that a staggering $140 billion worth of Bitcoin has been lost due to misplaced keys and other security vulnerabilities. The fixAMMOverflowOffer amendment is a proactive measure to mitigate such risks and bolster the integrity of the XRP Ledger.For the amendment to be implemented, it requires the support of over 80% of the ledger’s trusted validators. The voting process is currently underway, with the source code itself configured to default to a “YES” vote, highlighting the critical nature of this update. Server operators are strongly encouraged to actively participate in the voting process and upgrade their validators to version 2.1.1 by the deadline of April 8, 2024. Upgrading ensures continued service and contributes to the collective security and efficiency of the decentralized XRP Ledger network.New XRP Ledger Update Expands Crypto CompatibilityThe XRP Ledger community recognizes the importance of user-friendliness and accessibility. Comprehensive instructions and support are readily available for those installing or upgrading to version 2.1.1 to facilitate a smooth transition. 
The update is compatible with various platforms, ensuring a wide range of users can easily implement the new version. This aligns perfectly with the XRP Ledger’s mission of fostering an inclusive digital asset management and transactions environment.
Looking ahead, the XRP Ledger is set to expand its support for Ether and popular stablecoins like USDT and USDC. This commitment to continuous evolution and adaptation to user needs further reinforces the XRP Ledger’s position as a leading blockchain platform dedicated to innovation and security.On the Flipside
The success of the update hinges on over 80% validator approval, which is not guaranteed and could potentially delay implementation.



While the fixAMMOverflowOffer amendment addresses a critical bug, it’s important to note that software updates can introduce unforeseen issues.
Why This MattersBy addressing a critical vulnerability and enhancing transaction efficiency, this update strengthens the XRP Ledger’s core infrastructure, potentially making it a more attractive platform for developers and users in the broader cryptocurrency market seeking secure and reliable digital asset transactions.While Automated Market Makers (AMMs) were designed to improve liquidity and trading on the XRP Ledger, technical concerns exist.

Why BlackRock Could Bet On This RWA Token: Crypto Analyst


                            In an era where the boundaries between traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto continue to blur, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) stands out as one of the hottest trends. This trend, which allows tangible assets like vehicles and real estate to be bought and sold as tokens on a blockchain, promises to revolutionize the efficiency and speed of asset transactions.
Just last week, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has positioned itself at the forefront of this movement with the launch of a $100 million tokenization fund, which has already attracted over $240 million in investment within its first week.
Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has been vocal about the potential of tokenization, stating that RWAs “could revolutionize, again, finance.” This comment has contributed to a notable surge in the valuation of several RWA crypto tokens in recent weeks. In light of these developments, crypto analysts from Layergg have identified a specific crypto project that they believe could garner significant interest from BlackRock.
Why BlackRock Could Choose Aptos
The project in question is Aptos, which has been earmarked for its potential in the RWA space. According to Layergg’s analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), the narrative surrounding RWA and tokenization, bolstered by BlackRock’s involvement, suggests a nascent yet rapidly growing interest in this sector.
They highlight that mid to low cap RWA projects listed on Binance have performed exceptionally well, indicating a broader market interest spurred by narrative-driven investment strategies. However, the favorite crypto project for BlackRock could be Aptos.

A closer look at Aptos reveals several factors that might make it an attractive partner for BlackRock. Firstly, Aptos is poised to make a significant announcement related to RWA in April, coinciding with the Aptos DeFi DAYS event from April 2 to 5.
Aptos DeFi Days | Source: X @layerggofficial
This announcement is speculated to involve a partnership with a global asset management firm, potentially BlackRock. “A partnership with a global asset management firm is expected to be announced. It is speculated that this may include BlackRock,” the analysts remarked.
The basis for this speculation includes Aptos CEO Mo Shaikh’s previous tenure at BlackRock, suggesting pre-existing industry connections that could facilitate such a partnership.
Aptos founder Mo Shaikh | Source: X
Moreover, Aptos founder Mo Shaikh & head of ecosystem at Aptos Labs Neil H hinted at this early on. In mid-February Shaikh revealed via X: “I sat down with three of the world’s largest asset managers this week A little preview…while the year started with ETFs, it will conclude with RWA on-chain en masse, growth in Asia and all using parallelisation on Aptos See you in Hong Kong.”

On February 21, Shaikh also commented on a post on X by Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner at Pantera Capital. Morehead stated, “Tomorrow I’ll be speaking at BlackRock’s Institutional Digital Assets Summit. […] The existence of that Summit **IS** the massive change. Really excited about this.” Mo Shaikh mysteriously commented, “There’s Summit to this.”
Clues from the Aptos founder | Source: X @layerggofficial
Besides that, Adam Cader, founder of Thala Labs recently stated via X that “something is cooking for Aptos. I’m a co-founder of the largest application on the network, and here’s my list of upcoming significant ecosystem wide catalysts.” Cader referenced Shaikh’s statement and added that Blackrock, Vanguard, and Fidelity are the three largest asset managers in the world.
“If I had to guess this refers to either them using the chain in some way / integrating it into one of their products which has precedent in the TradFi world. Also note Blackrock is the most crypto-aligned of the bunch,” he said via X.
Crypto Revolution: Will APT Follow AVAX?
But that’s not all. Aptos has been hinted to explore partnerships with other major asset management firms, including Franklin Templeton, which has previously invested in Aptos (tier 3) and planned to utilize its blockchain for money market funds.
Such strategic alliances could position Aptos similarly to how Avalanche benefited from its partnerships in the Project Guardian initiative (JPMorgan and Wisdomtree), experiencing a substantial price increase post-announcement. “Avalanche saw a price increase of more than 4x following the ‘Project Guardian’ news,” Layergg noted.
They concluded, “If a partnership with BlackRock proceeds, more ‘Big partnerships’ will naturally follow.”
At press time, APT traded at $17.59, up 87% over the past five weeks.

Top 3 Meme Coins That Can Give A 1,000% Return In The Bull Market | Bitcoinist.com


								The rave around meme coins and their popularity has proven that they will be a driving force in the upcoming bull market. As such, it is important for investors looking to make money in the market to position in good meme coins before the bull run commences. So, here are the top 3 coins that have the potential for a 1,000% return in the bull market.
Myro (MYRO) Leads Undervalued Meme Coins
The Myro (MYRO) meme coin has been around for a number of months now and has yet to fade from the limelight. It comes as a second chance for investors who missed the run with DogWifHat (WIF), and has followed a similar pattern to WIF as well.

Just like WIF, Myro has been initially listed by Binance on its futures platform but not on its spot platform. Again, similar to WIF, Myro’s price had surged to a new all-time high following this listing before dropping back down. If it continues to follow this trend, then the meme coin’s price could see a rapid surge to $1 billion on its next leg up.
Myro is currently in the cycle that WIF was about a month ago before it rallied. From here, a rally to a $2.5 billion market cap would mean a 1,000% increase for the meme coin, which is a feasible target for Myro.

ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE)
ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) is one of the leading meme coins on the Arbitrum network, but what sets it apart is the fact that it has lasted this long in the market. Currently, ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) seems suppressed by the lack of action on the Arbitrum network. However, once adoption picks up on the network, it is expected to spill over to AIDOGE similar to what happened to Solana-based BONK.
AIDOGE is trading at less than half the market of Myro at $100 million, which gives it a lot of room to run. So far, AIDOGE is the only coin that has shown potential to be the first meme coin to cross the $1 billion market cap milestone on the Arbitrum network.
Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) Can Reach $2 Billion
Another meme coin that has the capacity for a 1,000% return is Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), which is part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. One thing that sets the BONE coin apart from other meme coins is the fact that it is also a utility token.

The Ethereum Layer 2 network, Shibarium, developed by the Shiba Inu team, uses the BONE token as its fee token. This means that demand is created for BONE every time the Shibarium network is used as users need BONE to pay gas fees.
As the adoption of the Shibarium network continues to rise, so will the demand for the BONE token. This sort of demand is the driver for coins like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), and at only a $209 million market cap, BONE still has a long way to go, given its utility.

BNB's 10% price surge - Is it still on track for its April predictions? - AMBCrypto



BNB’s price movement and Chaikin Money Flow have created a bearish divergence.
Other key technical indicators have hinted at the possibility of a price decline.

The past week’s surge in the price of Binance Coin [BNB], coupled with the downtrend of its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), has created a bearish divergence, suggesting a potential price reversal.
At press time, BNB traded at $586. According to CoinMarketCap, the altcoin’s value rallied by almost 10% in the last week. 
During the same period, its CMF indicator assessed on a 24-hour chart initiated a downtrend. This indicator measures money flow into and out of an asset over a specified period. 
A bearish divergence occurs when an asset’s price increases while its CMF craters. The discrepancy indicates that despite the price increase, buying pressure is weak. Weakened buying pressure is often followed by a downward correction once buyers in the market are unable to sustain any further price rally. 
Source: TradingView
Should BNB holders expect a pullback?
A look at some of BNB’s technical indicators on a daily chart revealed that it may shed some of last week’s gains in the short term.
According to readings from its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, its MACD line crossed below its signal line on 19th March.
A downward intersection of the MACD line with the signal line is considered a bearish sign, suggesting that an asset’s shorter-term moving average is losing strength relative to its longer-term moving average. 
When traders spot this intersection, they take it as a confirmation that market sentiment has shifted from bullish to bearish and that the growth in selling pressure could potentially drive down an asset’s value. 
Although BNB’s price has grown by 10% since this intersection, this merely mirrors general market performance. Its price rally has not been backed by any significant demand.
Its Money Flow Index (MFI) indicator, which returned a value of 48.18 and trended downward at press time, showed that selling pressure outpaced buying activity amongst market participants.

No cause for alarm
While BNB may appear poised to lose some of its gains, volatility markers showed a low possibility of significant price swings in either direction. 
The gap between the upper and lower bands of the coin’s Bollinger Bands (BB) indicator was considerably narrow. This means that price volatility is relatively low. Confirming this, the coin’s Bollinger BandWidth (BBW) trended downward at press time.

Ethereum validator count passes one million


The Ethereum network reached a milestone of one million validators Thursday, staking about 32 million Ether, worth an estimated US$114 billion. 
This number accounts for roughly 26% of Ethereum’s total supply.
The transition of the Ethereum blockchain to a proof-of-stake system in September 2022 has been instrumental in attracting this large number of validators, who are rewarded for their contributions to the network’s security. 
Lido, a leading staking pool, has emerged as a preferred platform, holding about 30% of all staked ETH and allowing individuals with smaller holdings to participate in staking. 



However, the growing validator count has sparked debate within the Ethereum community, with some expressing concerns over the possibility of over-staking and the potential rise in transaction failures.
In the regulatory area, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly been issuing subpoenas to entities associated with the Ethereum Foundation. 
According to Fortune, these legal actions are part of an investigation targeting the foundation’s dealings, with a focus on the non-profit organization headquartered in Switzerland. 
The Ethereum Foundation is known for its role in the development and governance of the Ethereum blockchain. 



Some firms reportedly received subpoenas shortly after Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake from the previous proof-of-work model. 
The regulatory body’s steps have sparked discussions around its potential implications for the classification of Ether as a security.
The regulatory authority has been postponing decisions on several applications for such Ether ETFs and is expected to make a decision on May 23.
According to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, one of the Ether ETF applicants, such a financial product can be possible even if the digital asset is classified as a security.

Citing on-chain data, ZachXBT says the North Korean developer that the Munchables team hired is likely behind the exploit.
“This is what happens when a North Korean dev is hired.
Four different devs hired by the Munchables team and linked to the exploiter are likely all the same person as they: 
>recommended each other for the job
 >regularly transferred payments to the same two exchange deposit addresses 
>funded each other’s wallets.”

The hacker fortunately decided to return the assets. Munchables says it now has access to the compromised funds.
“The Munchables developer has shared all private keys involved to assist in recovering the user funds. Specifically, the key which holds $62,535,441.24, the key which holds 73 WETH, and the owner key which contains the rest of the funds.
All user funds are safe, lockdrops will not be enforced, all Blast-related rewards will be distributed as well. Updates to follow in the coming days.”

Will Elon Musk's X Payments System Include Dogecoin and Other Cryptocurrencies? Here is the Latest Clear Information - Bitcoin Sistemi


There has been a new development regarding the payment company X Payments, which will be included in the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and whose name was changed to X after Elon Musk's acquisition.
According to the latest information, X Payments will most likely not support cryptocurrency payments at launch. The company has not yet applied for the necessary virtual currency licenses that would allow its products to include virtual assets.


Today, X Payments was granted a Check Sales and Money Transmitters license for Louisiana. However, Louisiana also requires a Virtual Currency Business License for products involving crypto assets, such as those offered by Robinhood, PayPal, Coinbase, and eToro. All of these companies have this operating license in addition to the Money Transmitter license.
It appears that X Payments has not applied for these operating licenses. If they had applied, this license would have been granted to them along with the Money Transmitter License granted today.






The situation is similar in New York state, which requires two different licenses for companies. The New York State Department of Financial Services confirmed in an email that X Payments has not yet applied for a virtual currency license.
Elon Musk has previously stated that New York and California are the most difficult states to obtain approval. It is hoped that X Payments has already applied for Money Transmitter Licenses for New York, but they may not have pursued the virtual license as they likely would not support it initially.

How ETH ETF Works with Security Label According to Larry Fink - DailyCoin


        
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggests that an ETH security label will not be a deal breaker for Ethereum ETFs.



This outcome would, however, require a seismic shift in the crypto industry.



According to one expert, this would be the ideal outcome for the SEC.
After over a decade of trying, the crypto industry finally saw spot Bitcoin ETFs over the line in January 2024. With this success, attention has shifted to getting the same green light for similar products backed by Ethereum.However, just like the former, getting Ethereum ETFs over the line does not look like a cakewalk amid whispers of reluctance from the SEC. Growing uncertainty has been further heightened by reports that the market regulator is probing the Ethereum Foundation to label the asset as a security.But as some fear this probe to be the final nail in the coffin for pending Ethereum ETF applications, a statement from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has offered a different perspective. According to the BlackRock chief, an ETH security label would not stop ETFs. But how will that work?An Ethereum Security Label Not A Deal Breaker?On Wednesday, March 27, BlackRock’s Larry Fink spoke with Fox Business on various topics, including spot Ethereum ETFs. When Fox Business’ Charles Gasparino asked how a potential Ethereum security classification could affect pending ETF applications, Fink asserted that it would not be “deleterious.”When asked whether applicants like BlackRock could still get the green light if the SEC classified Ethereum as a security, the BlackRock chief added, “I think so.”Fink’s sentiments contradict the prevailing sentiment in crypto circles that an ETH security label could mark the end of Ethereum ETF discussions. As highlighted by the BlackRock chief, the SEC can and does approve ETFs backed by securities. However, these securities will have to meet the SEC’s regulatory requirements.
In this case, a body like the Ethereum Foundation, which oversees the blockchain’s development, will likely have to register with the SEC and file regular disclosures, all of which the crypto community maintains remains impractical for most blockchain projects.This hypothetical, therefore, hinges on the ability of the SEC to compel Ethereum to register as a security.The Ideal Outcome for the SEC?Commenting on Larry Fink’s statements, The ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci suggested that getting the security label on Ethereum before approving spot ETFs would be the ideal outcome for the agency.
“This actually makes some sense & could allow SEC to thread needle given they already approved eth futures ETFs… If SEC can pull off, they get what they want (eth = security) w/out facing Grayscale-esque lawsuit,” he wrote.One of the biggest arguments the SEC has had against spot crypto ETFs is the claim that crypto assets are unregistered securities lacking proper disclosures and, as such, are unsafe for the investing public.However, as Geraci alluded to, the SEC’s approval of futures ETFs tracking these assets is antithetical to its stance against spot ETFs, as successfully argued by Grayscale in its appeal of the SEC’s decision to initially reject its spot Bitcoin ETF application.This successful Grayscale appeal, in many ways, may have forced the SEC’s hands to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, as SEC Chair Gary Gensler cited the ruling in his deciding vote. The agency would no doubt prefer to avoid similar lawsuits from Ethereum ETF applicants. Regardless of these considerations, most experts maintain that the chances of an Ethereum ETF approval remain significantly low, citing a lack of engagement between the SEC and applicants.Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm has tried to downplay these sentiments, suggesting that most of the heavy lifting was already done with spot Bitcoin ETFs.Amid the back and forth, all eyes remain fixed on the final deadline for an SEC decision on pending applications in May 2024.On the Flipside
With barely two months to go, it is unclear how the SEC will label Ethereum a security and compel the Ethereum Foundation to comply with disclosure requirements before the May deadline.



The details of the SEC probe of the Ethereum Foundation remain unclear.
Why This MattersBlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, with over $10 trillion in assets under management (AuM). The firm’s near-excellent track record of gaining ETF approvals put a lot of weight behind Larry Fink’s statements.Read this for more on the Ethereum ETF drama:Ethereum ETF Approval Odds Dim to 25% Due to SEC’s InactionStay up to date with the latest from the SEC case against Coinbase:Coinbase Loses SEC Case Dismissal Bid: How Big Is the Blow?

Bitcoin snatches daily NFT throne from Ethereum


Bitcoin has topped the non-fungible token (NFT) market in sales performance on Thursday, with a slight decrease of 0.06% in sales. 
The blockchain registered US$11.89 million in sales, with a negligible change in its all-time sales volume, maintaining a steady market presence.
JIGO BRC-20 NFTs, a Bitcoin-based collection, led Thursday’s NFT collection rankings with almost US$2 million.
Bitcoin now has US$2.989 billion in all-time NFT sales. The blockchain is on pace to close the trading week by joining the US$3 billion club.



Ethereum and Solana followed, ranking second and third respectively, but with more notable fluctuations in their sales figures.
Ethereum fell out of the top spot on Thursday after a sales decrease of 13.72% to US$10.16 million. 
Solana’s 24.45% sales increase was not enough to overtake the slumping Ethereum, as it came in third with US$8.18 million.
Polygon continued raising its daily total with US$1.5 million, the second consecutive day of at least US$1 million in sales. 



Mythos Chain failed to follow Polygon’s lead as it fell below the US$1 million mark it reached yesterday.

                        YouTuber Logan Paul addressed accusations regarding his infamous CryptoZoo non-fungible token (NFT) in a March 27 documentary titled “5 Months with Logan Paul,” stating that the project was not a scam. The documentary sheds light on Paul’s perspective on the project.This documentary featured journalist Graham Besinger, detailing the demise of the NFT project and the backlash and allegations that sprung up.Logan Paul Admits Allegations Has “Element of Truth”
Besinger had alleged in the documentary that Logan Paul’s CryptoZoo NFT was a mess that caused huge losses for people, leading to a spate of allegations and threats against the YouTuber.VIDEOPaul admitted that while the allegations had an element of truth, the NFT project was not a scam.“Everything you just said has an element of truth to it,” he said. “Here’s the problem. What you just described isn’t a scam. I took on a project that I was simply incapable of handling at the time.”He further disclosed that he didn’t profit from the project but suffered a loss of “half a million dollars.”Meanwhile, the YouTuber noted that the failure of CryptoZoo led him to have suicidal thoughts.“For the first time in my life I was having suicidal thoughts,” he stated. “I was just spiraling, Graham. Spiraling. I was crying, like sobbing … I felt weak, which is uncommon for me. I’m supposed to be the leader.”It could be recalled that Logan Paul first announced the CryptoZoo NFT project on his YouTube podcast in August 2021.VIDEOThe project was inspired by Pokémon but was designed as a fun game where collectors could purchase eggs and breed them to produce rare NFTs.And while the project generated a lot of excitement, it never really took off. This was after collectors had purchased the initial 10,000 collectibles (priced at 0.1 ETH at the team). The dev team found it difficult to bring the game to fruition, as they announced multiple delays till time passed.Shortly after CryptoZoo’s collapse, Coffeezilla, a popular YouTube journalist, published a three-part docuseries to expose issues with the game alongside a series of investors who suffered financial losses.VIDEOCoffeezilla’s exposè revealed that Logan Paul employed multiple con men to work on the project, including a developer known as “Z,” who held the CryptoZoo source code hostage for $1M.A class-action lawsuit was filed against Logan Paul in February 2023 based on the allegations that CryptoZoo was a “fraudulent venture.”Despite the lawsuit, Paul announced a $2.3M buyback program in January 2024, pledging to purchase all NFTs at their original prices. The tokens are down 99% from their all-time high of $0.0004963 in August 2021.Crypto Scams Continue to Soar High
While the CryptoZoo NFT fiasco may have taken center stage, crypto scams continue to increase, with the growing number of traders and investors interested in digital assets.According to BBB Scam Tracker annual data, over 67,000 scams were reported in 2023, alongside huge financial losses.Chainalysis 2024 crypto crime trends report also showed that illicit addresses received $39.6B and $24.2B worth of cryptocurrency in 2022 and 2023, respectively.Chainalysis crime trend report shows $24.2B was received by fraudulent addresses in 2023.Another report by Scam Sniffer revealed that hackers used a phishing crypto scam to drain $300M from 320K traders and investors in 2023. The web3 anti-scam solution company also reported that $46.86 million worth of crypto was stolen from scams in February 2024.

Shiba Inu's Price Surges 7% Amid Bullish Market Recovery, Dogecoin20 Set for Explosive Launch Following $10 Million Presale



                    
The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency experienced a 7% increase in its value over the last 24 hours, with its price reaching $0.00002995 at 03:51 a.m. EST, based on a trading volume that saw a 42% rise to $2.2 billion. 



This surge comes as SHIB successfully breached the $0.00003 price mark, boasting a 211% rise within just 30 days, hinting at a potential rebound to its annual peak of $0.00004563, recorded on March 5.




March was a significant month for Shiba Inu, marked by considerable gains and a stark increase to a resistance level at $0.00004568. 



However, facing resistance led to a correction, mirroring a broader market downtrend. 



Despite this, SHIB supporters have rallied from lower support levels, notably around $0.000020, propelling the cryptocurrency above a declining wedge pattern. 




This movement is backed by a broader market recovery, fueling bullish momentum.



Technical indicators underscore the bullish outlook, with Shiba Inu standing above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating sustained upward momentum. 



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reflects this optimism, showing a rebound from the 50-midline level at 56, aligning with SHIB’s breakout above the falling wedge pattern’s upper boundary.



The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) presents a bullish narrative as well, with a blue line crossover above the orange signal line, further affirmed by rising green bars on the histogram indicating positive momentum.

These indicators suggest a strong bullish bias, with targets set beyond the immediate resistance towards $0.000040.



However, there remains a risk of bearish pressure that could see prices retract to support levels if current momentum wanes. 



Amidst this climate, Dogecoin20 emerges as a noteworthy mention, with its launch scheduled for April 20, following a highly successful presale phase that quickly raised $10 million.



Dogecoin20, viewed as an evolution of the DOGE meme coin, is anticipated to outperform predecessors like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin itself. 



The project aims for environmental friendliness and introduces on-chain staking with a compelling 98% annual percentage yield (APY), allocating 15% of its 140 billion total token supply for staking rewards over two years.



Marking April 20 as International Doge Day, the Dogecoin20 team aligns its launch with a day celebrated by enthusiasts, offering a strategic investment window for those eager to participate. 



The presale’s extension provides a final opportunity to purchase DOGE20 tokens at $0.00022 each, with transactions facilitated through ETH, USDT, or bank cards, urging quick action from interested investors before the close.

JIGO BRC-20 NFTs surge in daily sales


Bitcoin’s JIGO BRC-20 NFTs topped the non-fungible token market with a sales increase of 46.81% in the 24 hours to 1 p.m. ET to reach US$1.96 million. 
The collection witnessed substantial growth in market activity, with the number of transactions rising by 60.20% to 157 on Thursday, according to CryptoSlam data 
JIGO helped Bitcoin retake the top spot from Ethereum as the daily sales leader for NFTs.
Other notable movements in the NFT market include Solana’s Mad Lads, which experienced a 54.94% increase in sales to US$1.92 million and a 65.85% jump in transactions to rake in the second-highest volume of the day. 



Next, Ethereum’s Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) saw a decline, with sales dropping by 14.98% to US$1.16 million and transactions decreasing by 17.24%. 
BAYC has the second-highest in all-time NFT collection sales with a volume of US$3.11 billion.
Solana’s Froganas also made some waves with a 74.42% increase in sales, totaling US$1.01 million, and a 52.39% rise in transactions. 
Froganas secured Thursday’s fourth position after barely hanging onto the 10th spot on Wednesday.



On the downside, Bitcoin’s NodeMonkes faced a downturn, with sales falling by 18.46% and transactions by 17.86%.
Azuki, yesterday’s second-ranked collection, dropped out of the top 10 following a 66% sales drop to US$418,401.

Vitalik Buterin discusses what is next for Ethereum, following Dencun hard fork - Blockworks


Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that following the Dencun hard fork, scaling on Ethereum is no longer a “zero-to-one” problem but rather a “one-to-N” problem.
Initially, Ethereum’s development was centered around building its foundational infrastructure, effectively going from non-existence (zero) to establishing the baseline of a functional ecosystem (one). This phase was marked by significant challenges, like limited scalability and high transaction fees. These issues constrained Ethereum’s ability to support widespread adoption of dapps and maintain operational efficiency.
Following the Dencun update, Ethereum has pivoted to a more scalable infrastructure, highlighted by innovations such as proto-danksharding and, importantly, “blobs” for more efficient data handling and notably lower transaction costs. These advancements mark a transition from laying down the network’s foundational framework to enhancing and broadening its capabilities. Developers will now work to scale from a solid baseline (one) to new, undefined heights (represented as N; an indefinite, but foreseeably large number).
Read more: What does EIP 4844 mean for Ethereum rollups?
The Dencun upgrade went live on Ethereum on March 13. It featured EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, which introduced “blob” transactions or sharded data. These transactions are designed to place data into “blobs” and guarantee data availability, subsequently reducing transaction costs on rollups.
Following the upgrade, Buterin notes that important scaling work still needs to be done, like improving rollups’ ability to optimize each blob, though the fundamental problems around scaling have already been addressed. 
Additionally, Ethereum has been slowly shifting from becoming a layer-1 ecosystem to a layer-2-centric ecosystem, with many applications moving towards building on layer-2s.
With this in mind, Buterin remarks that the next stage of Ethereum development will likely focus on bringing data availability sampling (DAS) to life, specifically PeerDAS.
PeerDAS is designed to reuse battle-tested peer-to-peer components to enhance Ethereum data availability scaling beyond EIP-4844 while minimizing the amount of work that honest nodes need to do. 
Read more: Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won’t scale blockchains alone
“In PeerDAS, each node stores a significant fraction (e.g. 1/8) of all blob data, and nodes maintain connections to many peers in the p2p network. When a node needs to sample for a particular piece of data, it asks one of the peers that it knows is responsible for storing that piece,” Buterin wrote.
Using PeerDAS, more solo stakers can also participate in securing the network. They can download 1/8th of the data instead of a full blob, which helps decentralize the network. 
Besides DAS, Buterin also highlights four key areas of improvement for layer-2s. First, he notes that layer-2s can explore data compression techniques to decrease byte size for transactions. Secondly, it is worthwhile exploring Plasma as a technique, which will mean that data is only posted on layer-1s in exceptional circumstances.
Read more: What is Plasma and why is Vitalik Buterin into it all over again?
Additionally, he remarks that layer-2s should investigate improving execution-related constraints and security as well as code reliability, noting that existing ecosystem standards are too lenient. 
“Ethereum is no longer just a financial ecosystem. It’s a full-stack replacement for large parts of ‘centralized tech,’ and even provides some things that centralized tech does not. And we need to build with this broader ecosystem in mind,” Buterin wrote.

Blob base fee surges, Ethereum misses slots as ‘BlobScriptions’ go viral - Blockworks


On Wednesday morning, the website Ethscriptions created a way to mint inscriptions on EIP-4844 blobs, which are cost-saving packets of data introduced in Ethereum’s recent Dencun upgrade.
As with other blockchains that have received the inscription treatment, so-called BlobScriptions have heavily driven up the price of blockspace — or in this case, blobspace. 
Since Dencun, the base fee for a blob, or the minimum gas price needed for a blob to be included in the next Ethereum block, has been one wei, an Ethereum-denominated price that is equivalent to a fraction of $0.01. 
Read more: The biggest Ethereum upgrade ever goes live
Today, the blob base fee climbed above 500 gwei, according to ultrasound.money. One gwei is worth a billion wei.
At the time of writing, the blob fee was roughly 6 gwei, marking a 60 trillion percent increase over the one wei blobs cost in the two weeks since Dencun. Six gwei is equal to around $0.20, according to CoinBrain. 
Notably, the much-increased blob fee is still lower than the price of gas on Ethereum’s layer-1, which stands at around 37 gwei, per Etherscan.
Nevertheless, at a price of one wei, blob space was effectively “free,” Blocknative CEO Matt Cutler told Blockworks in a text. “But the current Blob Base Fee is measured in Gwei and that’s far from free.”
Inscriptions — which have seen a resurgence in popularity on Bitcoin in recent months — create an inexpensive means of embedding art or would-be tokens onto a blockchain. In the case of BlobScriptions, a host of pictures and tokens are now being inscribed on blobs.
What’s important to note, however, is that blob data is only kept by Ethereum nodes for roughly 18 days to let layer-2s verify transactions. So after 18 days, BlobScriptions will disappear from Ethereum. But BlobScriptions will still be stored in the indexer for creator protocol Ethscriptions, co-founder Tom Lehman said on X.
Read more: What does EIP 4844 mean for Ethereum rollups?
In the four hours before press time, 41% of created blobs were inscription mints, according to a Dune dashboard. By way of comparison, popular layer-2s Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism each accounted for roughly 9% of blobs in the same time span. 
Lehman told Blockworks his goal in using blobs for inscriptions was to let people get around using expensive smart contracts for data storage. 
“We created Blobscriptions to enable ordinary people — not just giant layer-2s — to benefit from EIP-4844 blobs,” Lehman said in a direct message.
Ethereum also saw an increase in missed slots Wednesday afternoon, though there was disagreement among researchers as to whether the slots were being missed due to blob inscriptions or something else.
Either way, blob inscriptions could impede the low-fee promised land layer-2s have lived in for the past two weeks.
“[Is] this an ephemeral fad or a behavior that is here to stay? Time will tell,” Cutler wrote.

U.S. Treasury Department Targets 13 Russian Firms Allegedly Offering Crypto-Related Services To Avoid Sanctions - The Daily Hodl


								The US Government has named entities and individuals allegedly responsible for providing crypto products and services that aided in the evasion of sanctions on Russia.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) says that it has “sanctioned thirteen entities and two individuals for operating in the financial services and technology sectors of the Russian Federation economy.”










According to the agency, many of the designated individuals and entities “facilitated transactions or offered other services that helped OFAC-designated entities evade sanctions.”
Among the designated entities include the Moscow-based fintech firm B-Crypto, which OFAC accuses of partnering with Rosbank to enable Russian exporters to make cross-border payments using crypto assets. Rosbank is a Russian commercial bank that is also under US sanctions.
Other designated entities are Moscow-based fintech firms Masterchain, Laitkhaus, and Atomaiz. Peer-to-peer crypto exchange Bitpapa and centralized digit asset exchange Crypto Explorer were also sanctioned.
Firms based outside Russia that were sanctioned include Eastern European companies such as the Cyprus-based Tokentrust Holdings and the Estonia-based Bitfingroup.
Blockchain technology firms Veb3 Integrator and Veb3 Tekhnologii as well as fintech firm TOEP which operates a crypto exchange were also placed on the list of entities supporting the evasion of sanctions by Russian firms and individuals. The two firms are based in Moscow.
The two sanctioned individuals are Igor Veniaminovich Kaigorodov, the majority shareholder of Veb3 Integrator and Veb3 Tekhnologii and Timur Evgenyevich Bukanov, the owner and director of TOEP.
While some of America’s economic and trade sanctions on Russia have existed for decades, some of the most severe ones were placed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.
Last year in May, it was reported that the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance was being investigated by US authorities over possible violation of sanctions on Russia.

HSBC rolls out tokenized gold for Hong Kong retail investors 1

Renowned financial institution HSBC has entered the blockchain technology industry by making tokenized gold available for retail investors in Hong Kong. This initiative makes HSBC the first bank to provide retail investors with a tokenized real-world asset (RWAs) on a blockchain platform.HSBC rolls out its gold token for retail investorsAccording to its announcement, the HSBC Gold token is now available on its HSBC Online Banking and the HSBC HK Mobile App. In addition, the gold token can be minted on the Orion digital asset platform owned by the bank. This move reflects a bigger shift towards tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) in the financial and banking industry.Tokenization is simply representing real-world assets as digital assets on a blockchain. This process, which usually offers enhanced security, transparency, and accessibility to users is either on private ledgers or on public blockchains like Ethereum. The firm’s decision to enter the tokenized gold market shows a growing demand for blockchain-based solutions in the financial industry.The firm had previously made hints towards offering tokenized gold as part of its digital asset custody platform when it announced a collaboration with Switzerland-based safekeeping platform Metaco. The successful launch of its gold token shows the bank’s commitment to offering innovative financial products by leveraging distributed ledger technology.HSBC’s Hong Kong’s head of wealth and personal banking Maggie Ng expressed pride in the HSBC Gold Token. The executive highlighted its status as the first retail product in Hong Kong based on distributed ledger technology authorized by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). This approval also adds credibility to the blockchain-based offering of the bank, setting a precedent for similar products in the region.Advantages of tokenized gold for investorsHolding tokenized gold has several advantages for retail investors. Due to the conversation from physical gold to digital tokens, investors can hold a fraction of gold. Aside from that, HSBC also eliminates the need to store gold in physical form while aiding seamless transactions. Moreso, using the blockchain enhances trust while ensuring the immutability and traceability of the tokenized assets.This recent move by HSBC mirrors the trend in the broader financial industry, where financial institutions are looking into blockchain-bass solutions for tokenization among other things like custody and transactions. The integration of blockchain technology into traditional banking shows a shift towards the digital ecosystem and innovation in the financial sector.With blockchain technology gaining momentum across various industries, HSBC’s move underscores the potential of distributed ledger technology. Also, by tokenizing gold and making it available to investors, the firm is opening up new opportunities for investment and financial inclusion in Hong Kong’s market landscape.The launch of the tokenized gold by HABC on its Orion digital assets platform is a landmark milestone in the adoption of blockchain technology in the financial sector. Aside from providing investors with tokenized gold, it also showcases HSBC as a flag bearer in leveraging blockchain for financial products.

Dormant Bitcoins on the Move: An Unexpected Boon for BTC? - DailyCoin


        
Old Bitcoin holdings have been consolidated and moved, sparking talks of strategic asset repositioning.



The Bitcoin halving event is approaching and has historically been linked to price increases.



This recent Bitcoin movement has followed prior instances of dormant BTC being awakened.
The Bitcoin market has witnessed a flurry of activity recently, with large sums of the cryptocurrency changing hands. These movements have sparked discussions among analysts about a potential “sell-side liquidity crisis” brewing in the digital asset space.Bitcoin Consolidation Sparks Talk of Sell-OffOne particularly noteworthy transaction involved the consolidation of 2,000 Bitcoin, mined in 2010, into a single wallet. Developer Mononautical identified this activity, suggesting the coins may have been sold via an over-the-counter (OTC) trade. Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, believes this movement signifies a “sell-side liquidity crisis waking up old Bitcoin.”A sell-side liquidity crisis occurs when there’s a shortage of sellers willing to part with their assets. This scarcity can make it difficult for buyers to find sellers at their desired price points, potentially leading to price volatility.The recent consolidation comes amidst heightened anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected around 21 April 2024. This pre-programmed mechanism in Bitcoin’s code reduces the block reward for miners by half, effectively limiting the new Bitcoin entering circulation. This event historically coincides with price appreciation for Bitcoin.Recent Activity Has Analysts DividedAdding to the intrigue, another significant transfer occurred over the weekend. The fifth-wealthiest Bitcoin address, which held 94,500 since 2019, fragmented its holdings and sent them to three separate addresses. The purpose and plans for these transferred Bitcoins remain unclear.These large-scale movements follow an incident in January where an individual seemingly sent 26.9 Bitcoin to the irretrievable Bitcoin Genesis wallet, the first-ever wallet on the network. Additionally, in July 2023, a dormant wallet containing over 1,000 Bitcoin, inactive for eleven years, suddenly transferred its entire holdings.



While the exact motivations behind these recent Bitcoin movements remain to be seen, they collectively paint a picture of increased activity within the long-dormant segments of the cryptocurrency market. Whether this signifies a coming sell-off or a strategic repositioning of assets in anticipation of the halving event remains a topic of debate among analysts.On the Flipside
The consolidation of old Bitcoins could indicate renewed interest from early adopters, potentially bringing fresh investment to the market.



A sell-side liquidity crisis, if it occurs, can lead to price volatility as buyers might have to offer more to entice sellers or struggle to find sellers at all.
Why This MattersThe awakening of long-dormant Bitcoins and the upcoming halving injects uncertainty into the market. This uncertainty could trigger price volatility as analysts debate whether these movements foreshadow a potential sell-off or a pre-halving strategic play, impacting not just Bitcoin but potentially the broader cryptocurrency market.Curious about a large Bitcoin wallet that recently moved for the first time in four years?

KuCoin plans $10M airdrop of BTC, KCS as Justice Dept., CFTC circle

Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin will hold an airdrop of Bitcoin (BTC) and its native KuCoin (KCS) token worth $10 million, according to a letter from CEO Johnny Lyu posted on the exchange’s blog on March 27. The news comes a day after the United States Justice Department announced charges against the exchange and two of  its founders.Lyu did not mention the federal charges, although he alluded to them in the first sentence of his letter:“I would like to express my gratitude to all KuCoin users, for your support, trust and companionship during the past few days.”Comparing the airdrop to the exchange’s reimbursement of its investors who lost money in the Confido rug pull, Lyu continued:“Recently, on March 26th and 27th, some users experienced longer-than-expected wait times during the withdrawal process. […] To express our profound gratitude for your support and patience KuCoin will launch a special airdrop event totaling 10 million USD in KCS and BTC.”Rules for the airdrop will be released in three days, Lyu wrote. The recent delays in withdrawals were possibly caused by the high volume as wary customers abandoned the exchange. The airdrop thus rewards users who remained loyal to the exchange in its time of crisis.Related: KuCoin agrees to ban New York residents and pay $22 million settlementThe timing of the airdrop is noteworthy since KuCoin was hit with a barrage of legal actions one day earlier. The Justice Department unsealed an indictment for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act for lacking an Anti-Money Laundering program by the two founders and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Simultaneously, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) initiated a civil case against the exchange for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.Source: Wu BlockchainKuCoin hastened to assure users that their assets were safe after the charges were filed and KCS fell 12% in 24 hours. Airdrops come with risks, not the least of which is the possibility of regulatory action. The SEC wrote in its document “Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets”: “The lack of monetary consideration for digital assets, such as those distributed via a so-called ‘air drop,’ does not mean that the investment of money prong [of the Howey test] is not satisfied; therefore, an airdrop may constitute a sale or distribution of securities.” The DeFi Education Fund teamed up with a small Texas clothing company sued for a declaratory judgment against the SEC to prevent the agency from prosecuting the company for holding an airdrop.Magazine: Cool green mayor giving a grand in Bitcoin to each resident

KuCoin Witnesses $1B In Withdrawals As Exchange Is Accused Of Money Laundering: 'SEC Trying To Protect Us From Making Money?' Questions Trader - Benzinga

Leading cryptocurrency exchange, KuCoin saw a massive $1 billion in crypto withdrawals over the past 24 hours, coinciding with a notable decrease in the exchange’s assets.What Happened: Arkham Intelligence data highlighted KuCoin exchange balance at $4.7 billion, down from more than $6 billion the prior day. This decline was attributed to a substantial amount of assets being withdrawn by investors amid allegations of money laundering against the exchange by the U.S. Department of Justice. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams stated, "KuCoin allegedly deliberately chose not to implement even basic anti-money laundering policies."The accused crypto exchange KuCoin witnessed around $1 billion in crypto withdrawals over the past 24 hours and assets under management plunged 20% amid the exchange facing charges from U.S. authorities, as reported by CoinDesk citing Nansen and Arkham Intelligence data.  Amidst many loopholes in the functioning of cryptocurrency exchange, Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference, scheduled for Nov. 19, will bring industry leaders and investors together to discuss the future of digital asset investments.Also Read: Philippines Blocks Binance Over Unlicensed Operations, Citing Investor ProtectionWhy It Matters: The U.S. Department of Justice noted KuCoin purposely failed to comply with anti-money laundering laws to grow its platform. The indictment further detailed KuCoin's alleged attempts to conceal its activities from U.S. regulators, including not requiring customer identification and falsely claiming to have no U.S. customers, said a Benzinga article.A crypto trader, Doncrypto questioned, "What ever Kucoin did wrong? They even made it KYC mandatory to comply with regulations?”, adding “Why is SEC trying to protect us from making money?Notable NFT and crypto expert, Foster Hilt tweeted about KuCoin joining the list of exchanges facing scrutiny, alongside Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Hilt emphasized the current lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. cryptocurrency landscape.  Hilt’s tweet concluded with a reminder: “This is yet another reminder that regardless of how big or reputable an exchange appears to be, the best practice is to always self-custody your crypto.”The allegations against KuCoin, especially in the lead-up to the Bitcoin halving event, have broader implications for the crypto market and its operations as a whole. These topics are expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Coinbase’s Diverse Growth Path, From Trading Volumes to Blockchain Innovations: AnalystPhoto: Shutterstock

BOOK OF MEME Advances Rapidly In Trading Volume - BOME Bulls Look To Outperform Shiba Inu ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
In the crypto world, new projects frequently emerge and battle for attention and market share. One newcomer making waves in the market is Book Of Meme (BOME), a cryptocurrency that has recently captured the spotlight with its impressive increase in trading volume and price. BOME has even gotten close to the trading volume of Shiba Inu. With BOME’s rapid pump, everyone is eager to know what lies ahead for this memecoin.



BOME’s Recent Rise



In the last 24 hours, BOME experienced a remarkable pump in its price and trading volume, showing increased interest from traders and investors. BOME increased by 6.4% in price and 13.4% in trading volume, totalling an impressive $1.5 billion. This surge in trading activity has put BOME ahead of Shiba Inu, a cryptocurrency often dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” which recorded a trading volume of $1.2 billion over the same period.



This buzz surrounding BOME is happening due to several factors, such as listings on major crypto exchanges.



In addition to the listings, BOME’s derivatives data shows further optimism among investors. A notable 30% rise in volume and open interest reaching $143.4 million suggest strong demand for the memecoin. Specifically, over the last 24 hours, traders have been even more active as the number of liquidations has risen, mostly coming from long positions.



What’s Next for BOME?



Prominent crypto technical analyst Kyledoops has also weighed in on BOME’s potential, suggesting that the coin’s breakout from resistance levels has settled at a good support level. This move and its strength in testing these levels hint at a possible sustained pump. The analyst’s sentiments reflect the optimism around BOME as it continues to climb through the crypto rankings.

&nbsp



As BOME continues to challenge established players in the crypto space, there are still questions about its long-term stability. Will BOME emerge as a powerful contender, maintaining its momentum and gaining substantial market share, or will it become a victim of volatility and fall off like most meme coins?

'Call of Duty' Players Have Their Bitcoin Swiped Thanks to Malware - Decrypt

Call of Duty players seeking out third-party “cheat” software to manipulate the popular first-person shooter game were among the victims of a targeted phishing attack, cybersecurity firm VX Underground said on Wednesday.The attack also targeted players seeking “pay-to-cheat” software for use on Activision Blizzard’s Battle.net, the PC platform for games like World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo. The cheat software installed crypto-drainer malware onto the user’s computer, and could be used to gain access to information to swipe coins from their Bitcoin wallets.“Over the past couple of days, we have become aware of malware targeting gamers!” VX Underground said on Twitter. “More specifically, a currently unidentified threat actor is utilizing an "info stealer" to target individuals who cheat (pay-to-cheat) in video games.”According to VX Underground, the crypto-draining malware potentially impacted more than 4.9 million accounts in total, including nearly 3.7 million Battle.net accounts, over 560,000 Activision accounts, and about 117,000 ElitePVPers accounts.Crypto wallet drainers refer to malware that, once installed, targets a user's hot wallet, either installed as an application on their computer or browser extension. In January, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky warned Mac users of an exploit targeting Bitcoin and Exodus Wallets.VX Underground said the drainer in this case targeted Electrum Bitcoin wallets, but acknowledged that the exact amount stolen is unknown.“The scope of the impact is so large, and in a bizarre twist of fate, Activision Blizzard is coordinating with cheat providers to aid users impacted by the massive info stealer campaign,” they said.Also included in the malware attack were cheat providers UnknownCheats and PhantomOverlay, which had 572,831 and 1,365 compromised accounts, respectively. As VX Underground explained, PhantomOverlay was alerted to the attack by users who reported unauthorized purchases.“When Elite PVPers was approached by PhantomOverlay administrative staff about the compromised accounts, Elite PVPers confirmed they have identified 40,000+ valid user accounts compromised,” VX Underground said.VX Underground did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.A spokesperson for Activision Blizzard emphasized that the attack was not just related to their games and platforms, and is not directly related to their own servers.“There have been claims that some player credentials across the broader industry could be compromised from malware from downloading or using unauthorized software. Activision Blizzard servers remain secure and uncompromised,” the spokesperson told Decrypt in an email.“Our priority is always player account security,” the Activision statement continues. “If players believe they may have clicked on a suspicious link or if they want to ensure their account is protected, they can change their password and follow recommended best practices here, such as adding [two-factor authentication].”At the time of writing, VX Underground still did not know how hackers delivered the malware, but traditionally, malware comes through malicious websites, phishing emails, or messages that install programs on the victim's computer after being clicked.Other forms of malware—for example, cloned websites—drain wallets after the victim signs a transaction in their browser wallet, unwittingly giving the hackers access to their funds and NFTs.On Tuesday, the founder of Bitcoin Ordinals project Ordinal Rugs said they were the victim of a wallet drainer phishing attack targeting the Bitcoin Rock Discord server. Thieves stole $1.47 BTC, around $103,003, and 4 BTC, around $208,196, worth of Ordinal inscriptions from the wallet of pseudonymous founder, Archon.“No funds/accounts/logins related to [Ordinal Rugs] were affected... this was just my own personal wallet and I only have myself to blame here,” Archon said on Twitter. “Needless to say, I will not allow this to happen again.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Will Dogecoin Surge Catalyze Explosive Altseason? - DailyCoin


        
The Dogecoin price is riding an uptrend this week. 



Some observers posit DOGE’s uptrend will trigger altseason.



Bitcoin dominance has leveled off at present.
This week, Elon Musk fueled speculation around integrating crypto payments on his X social media platform. Dogecoin, known as Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, rallied in response to the speculation, culminating in a 17% gain to lead the top 100 on Thursday. This surge triggered theories that a Dogecoin frenzy may be the catalyst to kick off a broader altcoin season across the market.Dogecoin to Lead Altseason?With Dogecoin soaring this week, crypto YouTuber Scott Melker retweeted a post from a few weeks ago theorizing the connection between DOGE’s movement higher and altcoin season. In this post, Melker posited that mainstream FOMO will return to crypto once Dogecoin makes a new all-time high. In support of this theory, the YouTuber stated that the previous bull cycle was kicked off “mainstream fervor,” as characterized by users facing multi-month waitlists to open exchange accounts to buy memecoins like Dogecoin, as well as the prevalence of NFT mania.Adding further credence to Melker’s theory, trader Donovan Jolley mentioned that Dogecoin’s biggest rallies and subsequent altseasons have tended to come shortly after Bitcoin dominance dips. With BTC.D wavering recently, Jolley sees this as a potential trigger for altseason. The crypto markets broadly oscillate between “Bitcoin season,” when BTC outperforms, and “altcoin season,” when alternative cryptocurrencies capture greater investor interest as Bitcoin’s dominance wanes. However, Blockchain Center believes the market is firmly in Bitcoin season. Far From Altseason Data from Blockchain Center indicated the market is currently firmly entrenched in Bitcoin season. The platform’s “Alt-Season Index,” which measures the percentage of the top 50 cryptocurrencies outperforming Bitcoin over 90 days, registered a current score of just 47%. The threshold for altseason is once this index crosses 75% of the top 50 tokens, outperforming BTC over the last 90 days.Alt-Season Index per Blockchain Center While there was a brief two-week altseason in mid-to-late January and again for one day on March 6, according to Blockchain Center metrics, we must go back to August 2022 for the last sustained period of altcoin outperformance. That altseason lasted roughly six weeks before fading by mid-September 2022. On the Flipside
Correlation is not causation, and waning Bitcoin dominance cannot be directly attributed to DOGE price rallies.



Altcoin gains during altseason are generally orders of magnitude greater than large caps, as it takes more capital to increase the market cap of established tokens.



While Dogecoin has been soaring lately, DOGE is still 70% below its ATH.
Why This MattersWhile there has been no shortage of Dogecoin clones lately, the original memecoin’s continued dominance of that niche sector and its potential to catalyze an altseason, underscores DOGE’s remarkable staying power after all these years.Read more on Dogecoin outperforming the rest of the market here:

Canadian Authorities Probe $169M QuadrigaCX Crypto Scam In New Wealth Investigation | Bitcoinist.com


								In a significant development, the Canadian province of British Columbia seeks to employ an unexplained wealth order (UWO) against Michael Patryn, co-founder of the Quadriga Coin Exchange (QuadrigaCX). 
The UWO is a newly introduced court order that compels individuals to disclose the source of their assets. The Minister of Public Safety and Attorney General of Canada, Mike Farnworth, said that the filing of the UWO demonstrates the government’s commitment to taking decisive action against criminals and organized crime.
Government’s Pursuit Of QuadrigaCX Extends
The Quadriga Coin Exchange, founded in Canada by Gerald Cotten and Michael Patryn and the focus of British Columbia’s UWO, gained international notoriety for its criminal activities that caused substantial financial losses to numerous individuals. 

Farnworth highlights QuadrigaCX’s connection to a high-profile cryptocurrency fraud documentary on Netflix as illustrative of the nature of such crimes. The government emphasizes that “robust” enforcement measures that undermine criminal organizations’ profit motives are essential to effectively combating these crimes.
In addition, the Attorney General notes that the case received further attention when it was featured in an episode of Law and Order Toronto entitled “The Key to the Castle: Criminal Intent” in February 2024. 
According to Farnworth’s statement, if successful, the motion would result in the forfeiture of various assets, including $250,200 in cash, 45 gold bars, four luxury watches, and valuable jewelry. The Attorney General’s statement concluded:
We will continue to take the assets from unlawful activity and redirect the proceeds of crime to much-needed victim services programs and crime prevention initiatives, such as the anti-hate grants to communities announced on Feb. 15, 2024.
Allegations Of Personal Gain From Customer Assets
While a 2020 report from the Ontario Securities Commission did not result in charges, it concluded that only Gerald Cotten had engaged in fraudulent activities. The report stated that Patryn had ceased associating with QuadrigaCX in 2016, and most client funds were deposited after his departure.
However, in the civil forfeiture case filed in British Columbia’s court last year, the province alleged that an investigation revealed Patryn and Cotten had misappropriated customer assets for personal use and financial gain. The province’s claim mentions Patryn’s involvement in purchasing and maintaining a safety deposit box and its contents.
Lovie Horner, Patryn’s common-law spouse, was identified as one of the individuals who deposited money into the bank account between 2014 and 2020, according to the forfeiture case.

In 2005, Michael Patryn, then known as Omar Dhanani, was convicted in the United States for his involvement in a conspiracy to transfer identification documents related to an online money-laundering service.
Meanwhile, in December 2018, Gerald Cotten, the co-founder of QuadrigaCX, embarked on a trip to India with his newlywed wife, Jennifer Robertson. During the trip, Cotten, who suffers from Crohn’s disease, became seriously ill. 
Despite medical attention, his health deteriorated, leading to his untimely death shortly after his hospitalization. About a month later, QuadrigaCX officially announced Cotten’s death in a statement attributed to Jennifer Robertson.

Crypto community mixed reactions to SBF's 25-year sentence

In a historic sentence on SBF enabling the crash of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange,  Judge Lewis Kaplan, who supervised the extreme case, sentenced the former FTX chief SBF  to 25 years in prison. On March 28th, the court convicted the defendant on bank robbery charges and fraudulent currency issuance. Amid the concerns about the case, its significance to the crypto community and beyond has drawn wide attention.25 years behind barsJudge Kaplan meted a sentence to Bankman-Fried on 28 March after the trial, deliberating over the magnitude of punishment for Bankman-Fried’s conviction. Initially, prosecutors had argued for a maximum sentence of 50 years, while the defense team had petitioned for leniency, saying that a sentence of up to 6 and a half years would be more appropriate. On the other hand, the judge did not see Bankman-Fried’s act as lenient, and the sentence was 25 years, considering witness intimidation and perjury aggravating factors.Crypto community reaction and legality perspectiveUnlike major crimes, suicide is not a death penalty-eligible offense, and that does not necessarily mean longer sentences. After the statement, many people expressed mixed feelings about their opportunities on social networks. This point was made clear by some people who believe this sentence was too short and insufficient because it reflected the gravity of the crime committed. These people used longer sentences for lesser crimes as their arguments. What is even more remarkable is Edward Snowden contrasting Bankman Fred’s crime to that of Chelsea Manning, who had gotten 35 years of jail for leaking classified information violation. To him, Bankman Fred did the ‘way worse’ than what Manning had done.Legal specialists talked about this judgment, suggesting that. In contrast, it is understandable that the prison terms do not exceed 100 years based on the existing sentencing guidelines; the sentence handed down was quite significant and was a good sign that accountability exists in the crypto space. Mark Bini, former Assistant U.S. Attorney, pointed out that the judge emphasized the multiple sentencing factors making the ruling commensurable and the real consequences for anyone convicted of crypto crimes.Discussion concerning justice and accuracyIn addition to certain individuals trying to rest as the ball was going in the right direction, others were unhappy with the result. Terrence Yang, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said “too lightly,” Bankman-Fried definitely cannot be given only 1 year in jail because many people have been financially broken because of his behavior. Yang mentioned the pain and destruction in those families and their lives, as well as the coldness of the former CEO, during the following session. Regardless of the requests for Proposition to be less ruthless due to Ber Jake’s diagnosis, Yang stated that the gravity of crime deserved to be punished harder.Bankman Fried was then directly marched out of the courtroom to the metropolitan detention center in Brooklyn, where he has been detained since the revocation of his bail in August of 2023. The story is still developing: Ryan Salem, the former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO, will be sentenced on May 1st. Other Alameda Research and FTX directors have already admitted their guilt and taken the deals, raising the expectations for the following court hearings.

What Will Happen to FTX's $7.5 Billion Solana (SOL) Token? Will It Be Sold? Here's What's Known - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to sources close to the discussions on the subject, the sale of 41 million locked Solana tokens worth $ 7.5 billion by the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX company attracted great attention.
Galaxy Asset Management was selected by FTX company to broker the token sales in September 2023, as the company believed it would provide these services in a cost-effective and confidential manner.


Neptune Digital became the first company to publicly announce that it purchased the locked Solana token from FTX. The firm purchased 26,964 SOL at $64 per token. 20% of these tokens will be unlocked in March 2025, while the rest will be unlocked monthly until 2028.
Galaxy Trading is among the funds raising capital from investors to bid for part of the locked-up Solana. Investors can participate at $64 per token. The fund will charge a management fee of 1%. While BitGo will be the custodian of the tokens and the fund will distribute staking rewards in parallel with purchases, the rewards are currently planned to be locked together with the underlying tokens.






While some of the deals have now been completed, some of the tokens are still pending. Although not yet confirmed, these are expected to be available late next month.
According to Bloomberg, Pantera was raising money from investors to create a fund to buy Solana from FTX, which was valued at $250 million. Phoenix Digital was also aiming to raise funds for a similar strategy, but the proposal did not materialize, according to two sources. FalconX was also raising funds to make a large offer for FTX.


In addition to Solana tokens, Galaxy Asset Management is selling 42 more tokens primarily based on Solana and Ethereum, with a total value of approximately $211 million. These include $29.4 million GT, $23 million ATLAS, $23 million Shadow Token, and $20 million Bitfinex token UNUS SED LEO.

What is Dogecoin? Explaining Elon Musk's favorite cryptocurrency

Whether you’re interested in crypto or not, you’ve probably heard of Dogecoin. This meme-based cryptocurrency — Elon Musk’s favorite — is making headlines again. Why Amazon stock gains are changing employee compensationThe cryptocurrency soared nearly 50% in a week to $0.22 on rumors that Musk would add it to X as a payment method.It all started with Musk’s cryptic post on March 25, in which he shared an image linking X’s logo with a payment company, calling it an “everything app.” In the caption, he wrote, “The circle will be complete.”Musk had once mentioned that the everything app would replace YouTube, LinkedIn, dating apps, and even banks. The post has raised the hopes of Dogecoin lovers who are waiting for X to accept it as a payment method. Musk and Doge have a long-standing relationship. Let’s recap their affair.Who created Dogecoin? Created as a joke by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013, Dogecoin features the likeness of the Shiba Inu dog popularized in the Doge meme.But what initially began as a joke would transform into one of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrencies.How did Dogecoin get overnight success? The credit for Doge’s success goes to the GameStop saga that began in January 2021. The meme stock reached its peak when a group of small investors, encouraged by the Reddit community WallStreetBets and helped along by an Elon Musk tweet, skyrocketed GameStop shares to $86.88 in January 2021.On Reddit, investors later discussed what cryptocurrency is equivalent to meme stock GameStop — and the answer was Dogecoin. That’s how Dogecoin came into the limelight, and just as GameStop reached its peak, Dogecoin started to gain traction, peaking in May 2021 at $0.74 per coin.When Musk became a proud DogefatherAfter the GameStop saga, another event sent Dogecoin to the moon. One fine day, Elon Musk tweeted a word on Twitter: Doge. The price surged dramatically as media attention was garnered, and crypto enthusiasts suddenly became interested in Dogecoin.Later in the year, Musk hosted NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and called himself a Dogefather. He continued promoting Dogecoin on various platforms, leading to its inclusion in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.Musk’s obsession with Dogecoin continued. Once, he said Doge is his favorite cryptocurrency because “it has the best humor and it has dogs.”Doge has the back of Tesla and SpaceXMusk also made sure to incorporate Dogecoin into his electric vehicle and space mission. At Tesla, Dogecoin can be used to purchase select merchandise, like Cyberquad for Kids, Giga Texas Belt Buckle, and Cyberwhistle.Musk hinted recently that Dogecoin could be accepted as a payment method at Tesla in the future.Moreover, SpaceX has also accepted Dogecoin as payment for the rescheduling of the DOGE-1 lunar mission.Will X accept Doge as a payment method?When X was still Twitter in 2021, it already accepted Bitcoin as a payment method for tipping. This was regarded as the first experiment in which cryptocurrency was used as a payment method on any social media.So, the acceptance of Doge as a payment method on X won’t come as a complete surprise. If and when X accepts Doge, it could just send Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies to the moon once again.

Crypto Trader Breaks Down Bitcoin’s Break Out, Says Altcoins Will Soon Wake Up - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is keeping an eye on altcoins as Bitcoin (BTC) leads the markets with its latest break out.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 708,300 followers on the social media platform X that BTC just needs to stay above $67,000 to retest its all-time high (ATH).










“Bitcoin holds above crucial levels. 
As long as it stays above $67,000, we’ll be good to have another ATH test.
Overall, upwards returns seem relatively skewed for Bitcoin pre-halving.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is worth $71,169 at time of writing, just shy of its ATH of $73,737 earlier this month.
According to Van de Poppe, retail traders aren’t taking much interest in BTC at the moment.
“Bitcoin is at an all-time high, but retail doesn’t seem to have interest.
Altcoins are still at rock bottom levels, and yet, no interest.
While this is the time to have interest in them, as these opportunities don’t come that often.”
Van de Poppe also says that trading altcoins successfully comes with a “narrow window.”
“In my opinion; the key to success is to hold your positions for a mid-long period, but also being able to compound your positions.
Altcoins have a narrow window of success in which those profits should be swapped to BTC.”
Looking specifically at Cosmos (ATOM), the analyst says the altcoin’s movements could be indicative of the entire altcoin market.
“I’m pleased to see strength in ATOM. 
Slowly, but surely, altcoins will wake up.”
ATOM is worth $12.45 at time of writing, up 5% in the last week.

Bitwise files for a spot ether ETF - Blockworks


Bitwise filed for a spot ethereum ETF on Thursday. 
The company, which launched a spot bitcoin ETF back in January, also has an ethereum futures ETF, known as the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH). 
The potential issuer dropped its 19b-4 and S-1 documents side-by-side Thursday, following Fidelity, which filed its S-1 for its proposed fund earlier this week.
Unlike some of its potential competitors, the Bitwise S-1 lacks any language around staking. Ark 21Shares, Fidelity and a few others included such language in earlier filings. 
Read more: Ark 21Shares amends spot ether ETF proposal to include staking language
Bitwise would list the ETF on the NYSE, similarly to its bitcoin ETF. The S-1 didn’t include a ticker or fee. 
The 19b-4 did, however, include a correlation analysis designed to “replicate the specific methodology used by the [Securities and Exchange Commission].”

“We believe the results show strong correlation between the ETH spot market and CME ETH futures market, at a level substantially similar to the findings of the SEC’s analysis in the spot bitcoin ETF approval order,” Bitwise wrote in a post on X.
Read more: Fidelity takes another step toward spot ether ETF, but hurdles likely remain
Hope around a May approval for the proposed ether ETFs has dwindled in the last month, as Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart noted that the SEC has yet to engage with potential issuers. Within a few months of the spot bitcoin ETF approval — which happened in January — the SEC was engaged with issuers to hash out key details.
Grayscale’s Craig Salm said that he doesn’t think the “perceived lack of engagement from regulators should be indicative of one outcome or another.”

“Spot Ethereum ETFs will gather more assets if they launch in December vs. if they launch in May. [Traditional finance] needs more time to digest the bitcoin ETFs,” Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer, said at the Digital Assets Summit earlier this month. 
The SEC has delayed multiple decisions on the spot ETH ETFs, as expected, until late May.

Controversial Taiwanese Singer Raises $39M for Memecoin - DailyCoin


        
Taiwanese celebrity Jeffrey Huang gets $39 million for a new project.



Bobaoppa Memecoin is launching on the Solana blockchain. 



Huang has a history with crypto, including involvement in several ICOs
The memecoin mania on Solana has attracted notable interest, with many of the major tokens surging since their launch. Now, celebrities are rushing into the fray. Most recently, Taiwanese singer Jeffrey Huang has launched his own crypto project, Bobaoppa.However, the project has drawn controversy, as Huang is no stranger to crypto. He was involved in multiple initial coin offerings (ICOs), which saw varied results. Moreover, he was recently threatened with legal action against an investigator who looked into his past crypto ventures. Closer Look at Jeffrey Huang’s Bobaoppa MemecoinTaiwanese singer Jeffrey Huang, alias “Machi Big Brother,” has recently unveiled his new project, the Solana-based Bobaoppa memecoin. According to Solscan, by Thursday, March 28, he managed to raise approximately 213,000 SOL, translating to around $39.5 million. However, as Jeffrey Huang’s involvement in the crypto space is not new, concerns arose. He has been linked to several initial coin offerings (ICOs), including Mithril, Formosa, Machi X, Cream Finance, and Mith Cash, with varied success. These projects, highlighted by crypto investigator ZachXBT in 2022, have faced scrutiny for their management and outcomes. Allegations from the crypto investigator ranged from poor governance to financial impropriety. The concerns raised by ZachXBT led to a public and legal confrontation, culminating in Huang initiating and then withdrawing a defamation lawsuit. In turn, ZachXBT amended certain sections of the accusatory article.Huang’s Past Crypto VenturesZachXBT’s article still paints a worrying picture of Huang’s crypto ventures despite the amendments. The central accusation against Huang involves mismanagement of the projects he’s been associated with. This includes the rapid depletion of funds raised from ICOs, questionable financial transactions, and the abrupt abandonment of projects.
For instance, ZachXBT claims that Formosa Financial saw two large withdrawals totaling 22,000 ETH each shortly after raising funds. A recurring theme in ZachXBT’s investigations is the sudden abandonment of projects. Projects like Swag Finance and Mith Cash experienced rapid growth and a sharp decline, leading to their abandonment.
ZachXBT has also made allegations of insider benefits and unrealistic promises to investors. He claims that Investors were sold on the premise of fast-track listings on top-tier cryptocurrency exchanges, which frequently did not materialize. On the Flipside
Huang is far from the only celebrity promoting questionable crypto projects. Notably, Logan Paul has launched and promoted several failed crypto ventures, most recently CryptoZoo. 



In March 2023, celebrities Linsday Logan, Jake Paul, and others were fined $400,000 by US regulators for promoting Tron. 
Why This MattersCelebrity endorsements in crypto have been mired in controversies. For that reason, investors should be careful before jumping on the celebrity-led hype. Read more about Logan Paul’s failed crypto venture CryptoZoo: Logan Paul Counters CryptoZoo Scam Claims in New DocumentaryRead more about one of the emerging apps on the Solana’s ecosystem: Can Solana’s Decaf App Bring the Unbanked to Crypto?

In wake of its latest price pump, profit-taking Dogecoin community members are targeting a new green AI ICO as they search for 100x gains in 2024 / Source: Cryptonews
                        As the Dogecoin (DOGE) price pumps to fresh highs for the year above $0.20 per token, profit-taking members of the Dogecoin community are targeting a new green AI ICO in the search for 100x gains in 2024.Dogecoin pumped more than 15% on Thursday, rising above $0.22 for the first time since December 2021.Speculation that Elon Musk-owned social media platform X will integrate the meme coin into its future payments system was cited.In a cryptic tweet, Dogecoin influencer Mishaboar tweeted an update about X securing new payment licenses in the USA.Elon Musk is a long-time supporter and promoter of Dogecoin.In the wake of its latest rally, the meme coin’s market cap has surged to around $32 billion.Many believe that integrating Dogecoin into X’s future payment platform will substantially bolster Dogecoin’s demand and adoption.How High Can the Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Pump?
With Dogecoin breaking out to new highs ahead of the end of the quarter, bullish bets are rising.One Dogecoin trader tweeted on X that DOGE could hit $1 as soon as next quarter.The trader cited a technical analysis of DOGE’s long-term price action history.Indeed, Dogecoin appears to have repeated a pattern formed in 2017-2020 ahead of a huge higher price run.Integration into an X payments system could be the catalyst for this next run higher.If Dogecoin can hit $1, that would mark a rally nearly 5x higher than the current level.While those are impressive gains, many investors would prefer much higher upside potential when entering the highly risky meme coin markets.Unsurprisingly, some Dogecoin community members are targeting a new green AI ICO called eTukTuk as they search for gains in excess of 100x in 2024.New Green AI ICO With 100x Gains Potential in 2024 – eTukTuk ($TUK)
Analysts at Cryptonews keep a close eye on new and up-and-coming ICOs.One such coin they think has at least 100x gain potential in 2024 is an exciting new green AI ICO called eTukTuk.eTukTuk is a new eco-friendly DePIN crypto project that seeks to accelerate the adoption of electric TukTuks in emerging countries.Investors have been piling into the green crypto’s $TUK token ICO. The transportation-focused web3 start-up has now raised over $2.5 million.Each new stage of the eTukTuk presale brings an incremental price increase of 3%, baking in pre-listing gains for early backers (up to a total of 31% across the presale).Potential investors are advised to move quickly, as the next price rise is fast approaching when eTukTuk hits $2.679 million.Visit eTukTuk HereHere’s How eTukTuk Will Change Urban Transport in Developing Nations
Given how small and cheap they run, tuk-tuks are a key mode of transport for developing nations.Tuk-tuks are notorious for their high levels of pollution, however.For example, a tiny tuk-tuk typically has higher CO2 emissions than a conventional automobile.This hurts city residents in developing countries like Sri Lanka and contributes to global warming.“270 million internal combustion engine (ICE) Tuk-Tuks and other two- and three-wheeler vehicles are having a detrimental impact on developing nations across the globe,” points out the eTukTuk white paper.eTukTuk will manufacture and distribute its own newly developed electric tuk-tuk.But the startup isn’t just replacing traditional tuk-tuks with electric variants.It’s also redefining urban mobility with a slew of AI and blockchain solutions:
AI-Driven Efficiency: The $TUK token will fuel AI advancements to optimize routes, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce fuel consumption.
Eco-Friendly Innovations: $TUK aligns token presale efforts with environmental goals, supporting green transportation research.
Smart Infrastructure: $TUK tokens will lead intelligent transport systems through AI-enhanced blockchain technology.
Predictive Maintenance: AI integration in eTukTuks will allow timely maintenance, prolong vehicle life, and ensure reliability.

$TUK will be the native currency across breakout crypto eTukTuk’s EV ecosystem and blockchain.The token will be used for rides, charging, payments to drivers and territory partners, and staking rewards.The token design incentivizes participation and growth of the network.eTukTuk is also introducing a play-to-earn game that will let players drive virtual tuk-tuks through cities in Sri Lanka to pick up customers and earn $TUK token rewards.This gamification will further expand the $TUK token’s utility.Early presale investors also get the option to stake their newly acquired tokens for yields as high as 102%.For instance, a $10,000 USD investment in $TUK tokens during the presale would fetch over 380,000 tokens. Staking those tokens would earn holders nearly $1,000 per month in passive income at current APY!So, not only is $TUK one of web3’s most promising green AI cryptos, but it’s also a secret passive income gem.Crypto Experts Are Accumulating Green AI Crypto $TUK
Popular British presale analyst Jacob Crypto Bury thinks that, with its strong green AI credentials, $TUK has the prospect of posting at least 10x gains versus its presale price when it launches across exchanges later in the year.VIDEOMichael Wrubel is also bullish on $TUK, which he thinks could be the future of electric transportation.VIDEOClinix Crypto thinks $TUK has a lot of long-term potential as well.VIDEOWith strong tokenomics and near-term income potential through staking, the $TUK presale offers a way to gain exposure to eTukTuk early on while the project is still taking shape.eTukTuk’s token presale could be one of 2024’s best.$TUK is a BEP-20 standard token on the Binance Smart Chain network, with a total supply capped at 2 billion tokens.Get TUK Here

Solana's high throughput puts pressure on Ethereum's leading position | Cryptopolitan

Against the background of an Evolving Digital vista, where Blockchain technology redefines the limits in finance and technology, the rivalry between Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) has warranted much attention from industry experts and enthusiasts. This fiercely competitive environment and the analyst’s forecast imply that someday Solana might outnumber Ethereum’s market share for hosting the decentralized applications.Ethereum’s Blockchain was the undisputed leader in the field, but now the emerging Solana aspires to make a name for itself and prove its worth. For a long time, Ethereum has been the most instrumental and prime crypto asset, which forms the basis of decentralized apps and smart contracts, providing an active development community and growing adoption rate. Although scalability issues have opened doors for some competitors, such as Solana, which is famous for its outstanding high throughput and reduced transaction costs, the solution remains.Analysts characterized Solana as “the new Ethereum” and uttered high the possible power of Solana to lead the blockchain world through his achievements in the past.Though the Solana system is quite similar to Ethereum’s in terms of how blocks are loaded, the blocks of Solana can fill up at a speed nearly as high as Ethereum’s despite their much bigger size.The fact that such success comes when a growing need for use in DeFi and other applications acts as rock-solid proof of the platform’s growing popularity. The challenge Solana faces is the same that Ethereum has had in the past: the growing trend of being compared to Solana due to its achievements and the challenge of staying in power amidst the growing competition.Beyond speed, Ethereum and Solana redefine technology’s coreThe Battle of Blockchains: In conclusion, comparing local folktales with fairytales across cultures shows the universality of folklore as they take on different forms.The debate between Solana and Ethereum is not merely about transaction speed or costs; it touches upon the core of what blockchain technology aims to achieve: soccer, however, features individual skills, teamwork, and mental and physical strength. Besides, it stimulated the improvement of Ethereum’s scalability and energy efficiency, which was of great essence with the shift in processing mechanisms through the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.Similarly, its novel approach of Proof-of-History, which was implemented with the PoS consensus mechanism, addresses the blockchain trilemma by having outstanding transaction throughput without harming the security and decentralization of the ecosystem.This competition urges both platforms to jump-jacked and create fresh products and services that extend the limits of blockchain technology. With each platform improving technical capabilities, weighing the choices often comes through whether some developer(s) and user(s) need more speed and lower cost or higher robustness, the quality of the ecosystem, and the level of security.Why are Ethereum and Solana at the tip of the Blockchain evolution iceberg?While predictions about Solana surpassing Ethereum are speculative, they underscore an important trend in the blockchain sector: the time-varying environment and interchange of platforms is where no player takes a long-term dominant position. The activities of Ethereum and Solana are carried out fairly strongly, and the process allows new firms to enter the industry, creating a healthy environment for innovation.The effect of Solana and Ethereum on the entirety of the crypto world shall be determined by various factors like technological growth, network support, and the ability to build up the app ecosystem.In the development of the blockchain industry, brands will differ from each other and move to interoperability and integration in different industries with different platforms specialized in different kinds of businesses.The remark that Solana poses a threat to Ethereum concerning its adoption rate illustrates that the field of blockchain is developing quickly.Even though Ethereum and Solana have been competing for the top spot in blockchain technology, their rivalry has improved digital currencies’ technological growth and efficiency. Thus, users, in turn, have more options to choose from. As the sector changes constantly, both platforms will surely remain at the forefront of the application of DLT and decentralized finance.

Sam Bankman-Fried's prison sentence draws criticism as too light

Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency executive who was convicted of fraud in the spectacular collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Thursday.Why Amazon stock gains are changing employee compensationBesides the prison sentence, Judge Lewis Kaplan also ordered a forfeiture of $11.2 billion in assets.Here’s what people are saying about the sentence.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams“Sam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history — a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the King of Crypto – but while the cryptocurrency industry might be new and the players like Sam Bankman-Fried might be new, this kind of corruption is as old as time,” U.S. Attorney Damiana Williams said in a statement.He added: “This case has always been about lying, cheating, and stealing, and we have no patience for it.” Sam Bankman-Fried“A lot of people feel really let down, and they were very let down, and I am sorry about that,” Bankman-Fried said before he was sentenced. “I am sorry about what happened at every stage. And there are things I should’ve done and things I shouldn’t have.”“My useful life is probably over,” he added. “It’s been over for a while now.”Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of Tezos“Sam’s performance solidified my belief that he’s unlikely to be rehabilitated by any measures the state can perform to punish him,” Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of the blockchain network Tezos, said in an email.She called the sentence inadequate for the scope and extent of his crimes.“At the end of the day, SBF was a political animal trying to influence U.S. regulators to create a moat around FTX,” Breitman said.“The best hope for some sort of justice, at this point, might be for the people SBF was trying to influence — through media campaigns, lobbying, and political donations — to reflect on creating guidance that will be resilient against the next awkwardly charming entrepreneur they meet,” she added.Terrence Yang, managing director at Swan Bitcoin“Twenty-five years is too light,” said Terrence Yang, managing director of the Bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin. “What Kaplan is missing is the victim statements from at least three people who committed suicide as a result of SBF’s crimes. This doesn’t count his perjury, lying on the stand and evasiveness.”“Justice is not served,” he added. “The damage SBF did was permanent and severe. He ruined a lot of families and lives with his felonious acts and put salt in the deep wounds with his total lack of remorse.”And Yang dismissed how Bankman-Fried’s lawyers cited his health in arguing for leniency.“I get that he has ADHD & ADHD families filed a statement with the court asking for leniency, but SBF is the only person with ADHD in the world who stole billions of dollars in customer funds and destroyed or hurt millions of lives,” he said. “Not just financially, but emotionally and spiritually.”Moe Vela, former senior adviser to President Joe Biden Moe Vela, a senior adviser to tech startup Unicoin and former senior adviser to President Biden, downplayed connections between Bankman-Fried and the Biden administration. Bankman-Fried was emerging as an increasingly influential Democratic donor at the time of FTX’s collapse.“I am very well aware of SBF’s donations to Democrats and I am hopeful most or all of them will return those donations or donate them to charity if they have not already,” Vela said.“In my many years of involvement on the national level in politics and elections, it is a story as old as time that candidates in BOTH parties receive political contributions from someone who one day becomes a criminal,” he added. “Ironically, [Donald] Trump’s contributors are contributing to a candidate who has been indicted over 90 times. We shall see if they all become contributors to a convicted criminal in the near future.”Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents“We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son,” Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried said in a statement after leaving the courtroom.

KuCoin launches US$10 mln airdrop campaign amid legal woes


Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has announced a US$10 million airdrop for its users, featuring Bitcoin and its native KuCoin Token (KCS), amidst allegations of illegal operations and money laundering.
The platform claims that the initiative is intended as a token of gratitude to the platform’s users during a tumultuous phase of legal challenges. 
The U.S. Department of Justice charged KuCoin and its two founders with running an unlicensed money transmission business and breaching anti-money laundering statutes earlier this week. 
According to the DOJ, founders Chun Gan and Ke Tang face a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each charge.



Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has accused the exchange of unauthorized commodity transactions. 
Since the charges became public, KuCoin told investors that the exchange will continue its operation and that customer assets are safe.
KuCoin’s legal predicaments come as major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, face legal issues of their own.
On Thursday, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud charges related to the FTX collapse.

Binance executives launch legal battle against Nigerian authorities

Nigeria, high position officials of Binance, the global cryptocurrency exchange, are facing a court case with the security forces in the country. Tigran Gambaryan, the detained Binance executive, and Nadeem Anjarwalla, the African manager of the company, have both brought lawsuits against the National Security Adviser (NSA) Nigeria and the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), which accuse these institutions of violating their fundamental human rights.Binance executives sue Nigerian authorities over the detentionGambaryan’s detention and following the suit he then made against Nuhu Ribadu, the EFCC’s Director, was taken through the Aluko and Oyebode Law Firm Law Firm. A U.S. citizen who holds a financial crime compliance role with Binance and has been detained, and his passport was also taken, is the executive. He says that his arrest and passport confiscation violated the Nigerian Constitution, and thus, he was denied his right to freedom and liberty.Mirroring this, Jok Katua, through an escape from the prison on the 22nd of March, filed the second petition, which compelled the court to respect his rights. In the end, through a divergent trajectory from the detention, both executives are pointing out the actions of the ONSA and EFCC, which are factors for the increasing divide between the Nigerian authorities and the cryptocurrency giant.Gambaryan asks for several things, including release from custody, the back of his passport, a restraining order that will not allow further detention over to Binance trivia investigations, and a public apology and compensation for legal costs in his petition. He lays out his argument by pinpointing that his detention has ensued merely because Binance, in turn, refused to provide information to the Nigerian government, which acted within legal boundaries during his visit to the country.The initial proceedings for the opposing side’s case fell through because lawyers did not represent them. The next court sessions have, therefore, been set for April 8th. Consequently, people feel low self-esteem, and the dependency is reinforced. Consequently, the individuals involved affect legal representation and due process issues.Tax evasion allegationsNot only this but up next, looming in the wings are the much-anticipated tax avoidance charges that the Abuja federal court is expected to hear. Allegations against Binance and its executives include that they have not been registered with the local regulatory bodies, that they have evaded tax liabilities, that they care for their clients who would like to evade the tax, and that they have not been compliant with the Value Added Tax invoicing and deduction requirements. These levies tend to crystalize the theoretical perception of the governance matter that crypto traders in Nigeria are facing from the state, thus keeping up with the policy trends. The recent legal battles between the citizens of Binance and Nigerian authorities regarding cryptocurrency in the country determine the sector’s future. The considered cases would highlight the complicated problems of the certification and functioning of transnational platforms in a jurisdiction where the legal and tax scene is undergoing a turning point. Impact on Global Crypto Compliance StrategiesFilippo Lancieri, the head of the legal team at Binance, the first global cryptocurrency trading platform, explained that the result of these legal battles will shape the tactics that crypto companies will use worldwide to achieve compliance and government engagement in emerging markets.On the other hand, the issue evokes significant demands regarding the relationship between the growth of financial technology and the need to satisfy legal procedures and tax obligations. Amidst the proceedings, cryptocurrency entities, legal professionals on the global level, and regulators worldwide will be closely trying to grasp the future of cryptocurrency regulation and the way to defend the fundamental rights available in the fast-growing cryptocurrency industry.

                        U.S. Attorney Damian Williams wrote in an official statement following Judge Lewis A. Kaplan’s Thursday morning ruling that FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s 25-year prison sentence will send “an important message” to potential fraudsters everywhere.In addition to a quarter of a century in prison, Kaplan has ordered Bankman-Fried to forfeit over $11 billion.A Message To Future Fraudsters, U.S. Attorney Says
Bankman-Fried’s sentencing follows his November 2023 trial for his nearly $8 billion digital asset fraud scheme through crypto exchange FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, with Williams calling the FTX founder’s theft “unprecedented.”“Today’s sentence will prevent the defendant from ever again committing fraud and is an important message to others who might be tempted to engage in financial crimes that justice will be swift, and the consequences will be severe,” Williams said.Sam Bankman-Fried Apologizes
Slightly thinner and wearing a beige jumpsuit, Bankman-Fried spoke in court during the ruling, apologizing to colleagues, family, friends, and customers for the crypto exchange’s collapse.“I know a lot of people feel let down,” Bankman-Fried told the court. “I’m sorry about that. I’m sorry about everything that happened at every stage.”He went on to state that he feels “excruciating guilt” over his role in the crypto exchange’s implosion, claiming the damage it caused “haunts” him every day.The FTX founder’s new lawyer, Marc Muskasey, likened the fraudster to a “beautiful puzzle” who was “socially awkward.”“SBF doesn’t make decisions with malice in his heart,” Mukasey said. “He makes decisions with math in his head.”SBF Motivated By Power And Influence, U.S. Attorney Says
Kaplan, however, did not subscribe to the defense’s logic, calling their argument “misleading, logically flawed, and speculative.”“He knew it was wrong,” Kaplan continued. “He knew it was criminal. He regrets making a bad bet against the likelihood of getting caught – and he’s not going to admit a thing.”“His deliberate and ongoing lies demonstrated a brazen disregard for customers’ expectations and disrespect for the rule of law, all so that he could secretly use his customers’ money to expand his own power and influence,” Williams continued. “The scale of his crimes is measured not just by the amount of money that was stolen, but by the extraordinary harm caused to victims, who in some cases had their life savings wiped out overnight.”Bankman-Fried will spend his sentence in a medium-security prison.  He is currently at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, NY.

These AI Tokens Are All Up Over 30% This Week Amid Plans to Merge - Decrypt

A day after a merger announcement, AI tokens connected to Fetch.AI, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol are up 30% for the week, according to CoinGecko.On Wednesday, the three projects announced plans to combine into a single entity. If approved by their respective communities, the merger would effectively create a massive decentralized AI ecosystem called the Superintelligence Alliance.A day after news of the merger broke, Fetch.AI’s FET token is $3.41, up 33%, SingularityNET’s AGIX is $1.43, up 36.2%, and Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN is $1.50, up 32.5%.The news of the merger comes as generative AI becomes more ubiquitous, and AI hallucinations continue to be a problem in the industry. In December, Fetch.AI and SingularityNET announced a partnership to curb the problem.According to Fetch.AI, the alliance will bring together Fetch.AI’s autonomous AI agents and blockchain infrastructure, SingularityNET’s research and development, and Ocean Protocol’s data sharing and monetization.While AI tokens have been on the market for many years, the rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude AI has seen new interest in artificial intelligence-themed cryptocurrencies.On Tuesday, other AI tokens surged after news that the IOTA Foundation—the group supporting the Internet of Things Application (IOTA) cryptocurrency—will launch a $10 million investment fund at this year's Investopia event in Abu Dhabi. Launched in 2016, IOTA is currently $0.35, up 11.2% for the week.On Thursday, SingularityNET invited its community members to vote on the proposed Superintelligence Alliance.“We are excited to invite AGIX token holders on the Ethereum and Cardano networks to participate in a community governance vote about the formation of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance,” SingularityNET said on Twitter, adding that the vote would run from April 2nd to April 16th. “Your participation is crucial in shaping the future of decentralized AI!”“It is imperative, as the AI revolution intensifies, to ensure that AGI and ASI as they develop are not owned and controlled by any particular party with its biased interests. They should be rolled out in an open, democratic, and decentralized way,” SingularityNET founder and CEO Dr. Ben Goertzel said in a statement.“This has been the joint vision of SingularityNET, Fetch.AI, and Ocean Protocol from their inception,” Goertzel continued. “For this reason, it makes total sense that our three projects come together to form a tokenomic network that has greater power to take on Big Tech and shift the center of gravity of the AI world into the decentralized ecosystem.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

SHIB Burn Sets New Benchmark With 17,197% Daily Burn Hike - DailyCoin


        
Shibburn’s daily rate blasts off 17,197% upon manual burns by the community.



Shiba Inu’s price tacks on an 8% surge to tackle the $0.000032 price range.



Veteran SHIB holder shares the next target for SHIB on new ATH hopes.
Shiba Inu’s official burning tracker has registered 56,325,488 SHIB tokens set ablaze over the past 24 hours. This has boosted Shibburn’s daily burn rate by 17,197%, a remarkable achievement for Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) community. In five transactions, SHIB Army members have incinerated an equivalent of $1,786.Shiba Inu witnessed a price milestone two days ago, scorching past the $0.00003 key resistance level. Inclined to repeat the monthly high of $0.000044, SHIB’s way up highly depends on the burning rate and the intricate developments within Shibarium’s Ecosystem.A few days back, Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Layer-2 public blockchain soared to a new all-time high of $3.8M in Shibarium’s total value locked (TVL). Ultimately, this solidifies the chain’s liquidity, which tripled after onboarding WoofSwap DEX. The dApp contributed $2.34 million to Shibarium’s TVL upon launch on March 22, 2024.Shiba Inu Custodians Calculate Next SHIB Price TargetFollowing the 200% monthly surge for SHIB, veteran crypto chart analyst SHIB Knight shared a diagram that measured Shiba Inu’s price growth potential if the canine coin sustains above $0.00003 on the daily close. If the aforementioned resistance level acts as support, Shiba Inu’s boost up to $0.000034 is on the cards, according to SHIB Knight.Many SHIB investors expect to see a bull rally topping SHIB’s all-time high. SHIB’s technical pattern currently suggests a 63% distance from its all-time high of $0.00008616, recorded on October 28, 2021.While other popular canine coins like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk (BONK) recently hit new heights, Shiba Inu’s upward trajectory is tested by a strong resistance wall due to the piling sell pressure.
According to the combined liquidity book on Spot markets, SHIB’s spending sells outweigh the bids by $18 million despite increased demand. Shiba Inu is currently exchanging hands at $0.0000321, according to the independent price aggregator CoinGecko.On the Flipside
An automated Shiba Inu (SHIB) burning system will be installed on SHIB’s Layer-2 scaling solution, Shibarium.



Currently only launched on Shibarium’s ‘Puppynet’ testnet, this mechanism is set to speed up SHIB notably burns.
Why This MattersCryptocurrency burning benefits the coin’s dynamics, as it reduces the supply to potentially propel the market value.

Shiba Inu Lead Dev Tells Ethereum Founder, ‘It’s Just The Start’, Here’s Why | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, recently told Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin that he should expect more improvement from the SHIB ecosystem soon. This comes in response to Vitalik’s comment in which he praised the meme coin. 
More To Come From SHIB
Kusama responded to Vitalik in an X (formerly Twitter) post, in which he shared a GIF that read, “… it’s just the start.” The developer was reacting to Vitalik’s comment that SHIB has “massively outperformed” his expectations. Vitalik had specifically donated SHIB to the Future of Life Institute (FLI) and looked to be impressed with how fast the transaction was processed. 

However, Kusama’s response is a bold statement to the crypto community about how SHIB has yet to reach its full potential and that more growth should be expected from the crypto token and its ecosystem. Meanwhile, Kusama wasn’t the only member of the Shiba Inu team that reacted to Vitalik’s statement. 
Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead, Lucie, stated that Vitalik’s praise for SHIB is a great reminder not to underestimate the meme coin and its community. She also used the opportunity to urge members of the SHIB community to utilize the layer-2 network Shibarium so that everyone in the crypto space can see how strong the community is. 
Indeed, the SHIB community, commonly referred to as the ‘SHIB Army,’ has played an integral role in helping SHIB experience such exponential growth since it launched in 2020. In his response to Vitalik, Kusama also reaffirmed this fact by using the hashtag ‘#SHIBARMYSTRONG’ in his post. 
What To Expect From The Shiba Inu Ecosystem
Last year, Shiba Inu revealed plans to acquire a Top-Level Domain (TLD). This forms part of the Shiba Inu team’s plan to use the crypto token to bridge the gap between the Web3 and Web2 space. Back then, Shiba Inu’s partner, D3Inc, noted that this move would be a game-changer as the proposed ‘.shib’ TLD would natively support Web2 and Web3 tools. 

Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya added that this was part of their aim to decentralize the internet and make SHIB the “operating system of the future internet.” Interestingly, this move is part of a long list of plans the team had outlined at the beginning of the year, which they planned to accomplish. 
Although ambitious, the community also launched a petition in February for Grayscale to consider offering a Shiba Inu ETF. 
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00003122, up almost 5% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin Becomes Preferred Asset for Diversification Among Fund Managers ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
In the mainstream space, one asset has been steadily gaining traction among fund managers worldwide: Bitcoin. Recognized for its potential to diversify portfolios and offer unique opportunities, Bitcoin is increasingly becoming the go-to asset for strategic allocation.



The Report from QCP Capital



A recent report from QCP Capital sheds light on this growing trend, suggesting that fund managers are adding Bitcoin to their clients’ portfolios for more diversification. Beyond adding Bitcoin to their investment mix, fund managers are exploring structured products such as Accumulators and FCNs, indicating a strong desire to incorporate Bitcoin into traditional investment strategies.



What’s particularly interesting is the rise in requests for spot BTC ETFs, as noted by wealth desks at major banks. This demand from clients shows a significant shift in investor opinion towards Bitcoin, with more institutional and retail investors recognizing its value proposition.



Increased Institutional Demand



Bitcoin’s recent price surge of over $70,000 has created more hype around the asset. The London Stock Exchange has revealed its plans to introduce Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) for Bitcoin and Ethereum in May. This event adds even more fuel to the fire and may contribute to Bitcoin’s bullish momentum.



Despite the volatility of the crypto market, fund managers remain bullish on Bitcoin. QCP Capital predicts Bitcoin to maintain its trajectory, with the potential to surpass the $100,000 level in the near future. Since Bitcoin offers better returns than traditional assets, it becomes an attractive option for investors looking to diversify.

&nbsp



Fund managers are experimenting with various strategies to profit from Bitcoin. Leveraging the heightened BTC Spot-Forward Basis might be a viable option in the market. Additionally, launching Accumulators allows participants to buy Bitcoin at a lower price, leaving more room for profits.



Bitcoin – Becoming a Mainstream Asset



The upcoming debut of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs on the London Stock Exchange marks a significant moment for the mainstream adoption of crypto. While these ETNs will be limited to professional investors due to regulatory constraints, their introduction highlights the growing acceptance of crypto in the mainstream markets.



Bitcoin’s rise as the preferred asset for diversification among fund managers reflects a major shift in the investing space. With its ability to offer better diversification and higher potential returns independent of traditional assets, Bitcoin continues to solidify its position as a strategic allocation in investment portfolios worldwide.

Shiba Inu Going To $0.0001: Crypto Analyst Reveals What Will Drive The Rally


                            Shiba Inu has gone on various price spikes in the past few months amidst a surge in activity and interest in the meme coin. This price movement has prompted traders and analysts to ponder on when SHIB can reach the much coveted $0.0001 mark, a price level which it has largely failed to reach despite the impressive price action. 
Micheal_EWPro, a crypto analyst, posted an analysis on when SHIB could potentially reach the $0.0001 price level. According to him, the current dynamics could push SHIB above $0.0001 in June. Interestingly, his price prediction is based on the Elliott Wave Theory.
Analyst Reveals SHIB Is Going To $0.0001
According to the SHIB chart shared by Michael on the 3-day candlestick formation, the meme coin’s price formation since 2022 has largely followed the Elliott Wave count. The Elliot Wave Theory is basically a technical analysis method that analyses price movement traditionally in terms of a 5-wave move in the direction of the larger trend and a 3-wave correction in the opposite trend.

Each of these Elliott Wave can be further subdivided into various patterns of smaller degree impulses based on their formations. However, all the subdivisions add up to one larger wave impulse.
Using this knowledge of Elliot Wave Theory, the analyst noted that SHIB has started the formation of the third of five larger degree waves since October 2023 albeit with smaller degree impulses which he labelled as i, ii, iii, iv, and v. Traditionally, the third Elliot Wave is usually the largest and most powerful wave in a trend where most of the price action takes place. As a result, his analysis points to the third wave ending at a price just above $0.0001 in the first week of June.
The analyst did implore a take-profit at $0.00008854 and a final price target of $0.00010191, while also noting that the bulls still have some work to do before this price point can come to a reality. 

What’s Next For Shiba Inu?
Shiba Inu has reversed since reaching $0.00004456 and has majorly traded between $0.000030 and $0.0000275 since the beginning of the week. However, analysts and SHIB enthusiasts remain positive, especially with SHIB securing a listing on an Australian-based crypto exchange.

This positive sentiment recently pushed SHIB to second place in crypto searches. At the same time, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 platform, Shibarium, has seen its TVL surging to a new high of $3.9 million.
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00003097, up by 14% in the past seven days.

SBF’s ambitions went too far, judge says when handing down 25-year sentence - Blockworks


In his parting words to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried on Thursday, the judge overseeing his criminal case said the former darling of the cryptocurrency industry, although “exceptionally ambitious,” was ultimately a reckless gambler. 
Bankman-Fried is “a man willing to flip a coin as to the continued existence of life and civilization on Earth if the chances were imperceptibly greater that it would come out without that catastrophic outcome,” Judge Lewis Kaplan said during Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearing.  
Kaplan ordered Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison, a sentence that falls between the defense’s requested 6.5 years and the government’s proposed 40 to 50 years. Bankman-Fried was also ordered to pay a $11 billion forfeiture. 
Kaplan’s comments followed what may have been Bankman-Fried’s final statement in open court, unless his case moves forward in the appellate process, which his team said they will pursue.

In a meandering address that lasted 15 minutes, Bankman-Fried hailed his former employees, who he ultimately “failed.” 
“They all built something really beautiful,” Bankman-Fried said. “They threw themselves into it. And then I threw all of that away. It haunts me every day.”
The hearing, which lasted just over two hours, included statements from FTX victim and self-proclaimed “creditor champion” Sunil Kavuri, and Adam Moskowitz, the attorney heading up the FTX class action lawsuit. 
Kavuri used the majority of his time to criticize Sullivan & Cromwell, the firm representing FTX in its bankruptcy proceedings. Victims should be compensated with gains earned on their stolen funds, Kavuri said.

“I appreciate the points you’re making, but I’m here to sentence Mr. Bankman-Fried, not assess what the bankruptcy [estate] should or shouldn’t have done,” Kaplan told Kavuri. 
“I think it would be helpful if you could bring your remarks to a close,” Kaplan added several minutes later after Kavuri once again drifted off topic. 
Kavuri was just one of more than 115 victims that wrote impact statements to the court, making up nearly half of the 1,929 pages of sentence-related submissions to the court.

Moskowitz kept his remarks brief. He told the court that Bankman-Fried “has been very helpful” to the class action team. 
“There should be some consideration for that,” Moskowitz said. “I can’t tell you how much or I can’t tell you what, but I do like the fact that people know if they help the class action find recovery, there may be something in it for them.” 
Bankman-Fried’s parents, Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, who were present throughout the trial last fall, appeared sullen on Thursday. While the two looked away during much of the hearing and held their heads down when Kaplan handed down the sentence, they watched Bankman-Fried closely as he addressed the court. 
Kaplan requested that Bankman-Fried serve his time in a minimal or medium-security facility, ideally close to San Francisco, CA, so he can be near his family.

SEC Case Against Ripple Weakens: Can SEC Prove XRP Caused Harm? - DailyCoin


        
Disgorgement, a key factor in the SEC’s financial attack on Ripple, has faced new legal hurdles.



The SEC may struggle to prove individual investor losses, potentially reducing Ripple’s penalty.



Even if XRP gets deemed a security, the SEC’s ability to financially cripple Ripple has come into question.
The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has entered a critical phase. While the core issue of whether XRP is a security remains central, a recent court ruling could significantly impact the SEC’s ability to secure a major victory.SEC’s Disgorgement Case Against Ripple Faces HurdleThe crux of the SEC’s case against Ripple hinges on disgorgement, a legal remedy that forces a party to return allegedly ill-gotten gains. The SEC is seeking a hefty $1.95 billion from Ripple, comprising $876 million in disgorgement, the same in civil penalty, and $200 million in interest. However, a recent court decision has cast doubt on the SEC’s ability to achieve this hefty sum.According to legal experts, a recent ruling established a stricter standard for disgorgement. The SEC is now required to demonstrate concrete financial losses individual investors suffer. The SEC’s argument that some XRP buyers were financially harmed because they bought at a lower price than others might not meet this new standard.Without clear evidence of individual investor losses, the court may find it difficult to justify the sizeable disgorgement amount sought by the SEC. This could drastically reduce the final penalty imposed on Ripple Labs, even if the court rules that XRP is a security.No Clear Investor Harm?The recent ruling weakens the SEC’s case by highlighting the lack of identifiable victims. This further weakens the SEC’s claim of over $200 million in interest, as interest typically accrues on disgorgement amounts.While the SEC could still pursue a financial penalty against Ripple, the absence of clear evidence of investor harm significantly weakens its position. 
This unexpected development adds another layer of complexity to the already intricate legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. The outcome of the case will undoubtedly significantly impact the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.On the Flipside
The SEC may argue that the new disgorgement standard shouldn’t apply in this case, setting a legal precedent for future crypto security offerings.



Even if the SEC fails to secure disgorgement, Ripple could still face a significant civil penalty if the court finds XRP to be a security.
Why This MattersThe SEC’s struggle to prove individual investor losses in Ripple’s XRP sale throws a wrench into their disgorgement strategy, potentially reducing the financial blow to Ripple even if the court deems XRP a security. This sets a potentially stricter precedent for future SEC enforcement actions within the cryptocurrency industry.

BlackRock's tokenized fund registers over $240 million in inflows within a week - Crypto Briefing




BlackRock’s tokenized fund BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity) has captured over $240 million in deposits since its debut a week ago, as reported by Bloomberg. Each of the funds’ shares is worth $1, and it generates daily accrued dividends to qualified investors by investing in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. The yield is paid in new tokens each month.The BUIDL token is offered by Securitize Markets, an alternative trading system registered under the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and has a broker-dealer license under the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. This makes it possible for investors to transfer the tokens to other validated addresses.“It’s very institutional, it is managed by the largest asset manager in the world,” said Carlos Domingo, founder and CEOof Securitize, to Bloomberg. “There’s no counterparty risk to any crypto company.”Moreover, crypto startup Ondo Finance has invested a total amount of $95 million in BlackRock’s BUIDL, Ondo’s founder Nathan Allman told Bloomberg.According to real-world asset (RWA) data aggregator RWA.xyz, the BUIDL launch also propelled the total size of the tokenized US Treasuries to almost $1 billion, with a rise of over 35% since BlackRock’s tokenized fund came live.This industry is dominated by the first US-registered tokenized money market fund, Franklin Templeton’s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund. BENJI, the token representing the shares of Franklin Templeton’s fund, represents over 36% of the tokenized US Treasuries.However, this dominance might shift soon, as BUIDL already represents 24,6% of this market within one week after its launch, and it also offers the possibility of transferring tokenized shares between fund investors.

Ethereum whale cashes out 17,000 ETH - Here's what it means for you - AMBCrypto



An Ethereum whale that has been holding ETH for a long period of time sells its holdings.
Price of ETH remains unaffected, however, activity on Ethereum’s ecosystem poses concerns.

After seeing a massive rally over the last week, the price of Ethereum[ETH] started to get stagnant around the $3500 price level. Due to this stagnancy, many holders decided to indulge in profit-taking.
Whale takes profit
According to recent data, an initial holder of ETH exchanged 17,770 ETH for 62.24 million DAI at a rate of $3,503 per ETH.
This individual amassed 14,280 ETH, valued at approximately $2.6 million, at an average price of only around $182, spanning purchases made from Gemini and Bittrex between March 2017 and April 2021.
With a staggering gain of 23 times their initial investment, the profit amounts to $59 million.
This whale’s sale of 17,770 ETH injects a large amount of the currency into the market. This can cause downward pressure on the price in the short term, especially if there aren’t enough buyers to absorb all the ETH being sold.
However, the overall impact depends on market sentiment. If the sale triggers panic selling, the price could drop further. But, if the market views it as a healthy correction or the whale is simply taking profits, the price could stabilize or even rebound as others see a buying opportunity.
ETH remains resilient
At press time, ETH was trading at $3,571.59,  marking a 27% difference from its all-time high. The price of ETH had tested the $3674.23 levels twice over the last few weeks.
If ETH manages to break past this level, it will put an end to the bearish trend that was observed after its price fell from $4081.55. ETH could also possibly head in the direction of the $4081.55 resistance yet again.
However, the coin’s CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) declined in the last few days, indicating that the money flow for ETH had fallen. This suggests that the price of ETH could see a period of sideways or downward movement before it starts to rally.

State of the Ethereum network
The popularity of the Ethereum ecosystem will also aid ETH positively in the future. The gas usage on the Ethereum network remained consistent over the past month, suggesting a highly active ecosystem.
However, the overall number of NFTs being traded on the network fell significantly over the last few days, indicating that the interest in NFTs on the Ethereum ecosystem fell. This could hurt the activity on the Ethereum network in the long run.

Institutional Investment Shifts Bitcoin Mining Landscape, Challenging Decentralization and Network Dynamics



                    
Institutional investment in Bitcoin mining by large public companies has notably impacted the landscape for individual and small-scale miners, with significant consequences for the network’s dynamics, according to a Bitfinex report on the cryptocurrency mining ecosystem ahead of the Bitcoin halving. 



The study reveals a shift from the decentralized vision of Bitcoin, where individuals contributed to network security, to a scenario dominated by corporate entities. 




These entities prioritize shareholder returns, operating on a much larger scale with different priorities than smaller miners. 



The report emphasizes their focus on profitability and managing investor expectations, often sidelining the community’s more altruistic values such as network security, egalitarian access, and censorship resistance.



The entry of Wall Street funding into Bitcoin mining has professionalized the sector, leading to increased hashing power that could theoretically enhance network security and stability. 



However, concerns arise about centralization and corporate influence, which could diverge from Bitcoin’s original ethos of being open, borderless, and resistant to control by any single entity. 



The Bitfinex analysis notes that the consolidation of mining operations by these large companies could potentially threaten Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, as they are able to scale operations more effectively, secure cheaper energy, and invest in the latest technologies, making it difficult for smaller miners to compete.



The infusion of institutional capital has altered the incentive structure within the network, favoring those who can operate on a large scale.

This shift raises questions about the future of Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos and whether the increased centralization could impact network security and the distribution of mining rewards. 



The survival of independent and hobbyist miners now depends on their ability to innovate and collaborate. 




Mining pools are suggested as a solution, allowing for the pooling of resources to stay competitive. 



Moreover, the sustainability of hobby mining is contingent on the development of more efficient mining technologies and the utilization of renewable energy.



Geographical diversification of mining operations is also highlighted as vital for maintaining the network’s decentralization. 



Emerging markets with renewable or untapped energy sources are seen as promising locations for new mining ventures. 



The report concludes that, while the landscape is evolving, the core community values and decentralized nature of Bitcoin must be preserved to ensure the network’s integrity and resilience.

Hedge Fund Goes Long Bitcoin, Short MicroStrategy: Details


								Kerrisdale Capital, a hedge fund, today disclosed a nuanced investment thesis: going long on Bitcoin while concurrently taking a short position on MicroStrategy shares. This move is predicated on the assessment that MicroStrategy, which has positioned itself as a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle, is trading at a significantly unjustified premium to the underlying cryptocurrency that primarily constitutes its value.
Long Bitcoin, Short MSTR
The hedge fund’s analysis articulates, “Shares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of Bitcoin but, as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away.” Kerrisdale highlights a critical discrepancy, noting that MicroStrategy’s stock price implies a BTC value of “over $177k, i.e., two and a half times the spot price of Bitcoin.”

Delving into the reasoning behind the premium on MicroStrategy’s shares, Kerrisdale debunks several arguments that have been made in favor of the company’s market valuation. The report categorically states, “None of the reasons commonly provided for MicroStrategy’s relative attractiveness justify paying well over double for the same coin.” This statement underscores the hedge fund’s stance on the overvaluation of MicroStrategy in relation to direct BTC exposure.
MicroStrategy, under CEO Michael Saylor’s leadership since 1989, has aggressively pursued BTC accumulation, making it a central pillar of its investment strategy. From August 2020 to 2023, the company made significant financial maneuvers to increase its holdings, which now exceed 214,000 BTC.
Kerrisdale’s valuation approach considers MicroStrategy’s enterprise software business and its BTC reserves. The analysis concludes that the software business, while still operational, “no longer contributes meaningful value to the overall enterprise,” spotlighting the overwhelming influence of Bitcoin on the company’s valuation.
A key aspect of Kerrisdale’s critique focuses on the inflated premium over Net Asset Value (NAV) attributed to MicroStrategy’s shares. “At 2.6x, MicroStrategy’s equity premium is exceptionally high,” the report states, suggesting an unsustainable market position relative to historical data. Kerrisdale argues that a correction towards a more historically consistent premium would imply a substantial downside for MicroStrategy’s stock relative to Bitcoin’s performance.

The report thoroughly examines the potential implications of MicroStrategy’s financial strategy, including its reliance on leverage and the dilutive effects of its financing mechanisms. Kerrisdale’s analysis suggests that while MicroStrategy’s aggressive capital market activities have succeeded in increasing its Bitcoin holdings, they have simultaneously led to a stagnation in the amount of Bitcoin per share, due to the dilutive impact of debt financing and equity offerings.
Concluding, Kerrisdale Capital estimates that “assuming the current premium of 2.6x contracts to a more historically consistent 1.3x represents 50% downside in MSTR relative to bitcoin.” This conclusion is drawn from an examination of the interplay between MicroStrategy’s stock premium, its Bitcoin holdings, and the broader market dynamics.
The reactions from the community were rather critical. Bit Paine (@BitPaine) commented, “Are you selling advance tickets to your funeral?”. Another crypto analyst, Trey Sellers (@ts_hodl), stated, “Seems like a logical position to me, although markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent, as they say.”
OSF (@osf_rekt) added, “There is probably nothing more dumb than publishing your mid-curve trade idea to an army of irrational degens who will make it their life mission to liquidate you.”
At press time, BTC traded at $71,519.

BlackRock's BTC AUM Challenges Grayscale with 250K Milestone - DailyCoin


        
Blackrock’s BTC ETF takes the lead as issuers’ assets under management soar.



The firm’s CEO has lauded the growth of Bitcoin ETFs since its launch.



Bitcoin ETFs currently hold a significant percentage of the entire BTC market supply.
Following the SEC’s regulatory nod on January 11, 2024, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs got off to a great start, taking the financial world by storm and outperforming traditional commodities with unprecedented milestones. Leading the charge is BlackRock, which has experienced remarkable growth along with the other nine issuers, marked by surging daily inflows and a growing BTC supply stash.Further solidifying its position, the leading asset management firm has hit a new milestone.BlackRock’s Bitcoin Stash Hits ATHOn Thursday, March 28, BlackRock’s IBIT’s assets under management (AUM) reached a new all-time high, exceeding 250,000 BTC, valued at approximately $17.6 billion.This marks BlackRock’s position as the second largest Bitcoin issuer by AUM, surpassed by Grayscale, which currently holds a stash of 347,552 BTC. However, the growing momentum of BlackRock’s IBIT since its launch suggests a likely imminent overthrow of Grayscale, particularly considering the latter’s contrasting underperformance.Commenting on IBIT’s monumental performance, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed the prevailing market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. In an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, Fink asserted that the newly listed investment vehicle “is the fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs.” The CEO’s comments and surging AUM align with the growing daily inflows across the asset class, underscoring the tremendous success of Bitcoin ETFs.Bitcoin ETFs Monster PerformanceThe explosive launch of Bitcoin ETFs has propelled the asset class to the forefront of investment options, introducing a major shift to exchange-traded funds and shattering long-standing records.
Building on the momentum, the “newborn nine” ETFs crossed a historic milestone on March 8, collectively holding nearly 4% of the supply of the largest crypto asset by market cap at over $54 billion.
Trailing behind BlackRock is Fidelity’s WiseOrigin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), which boasts a total of $9.87 billion at press time. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) follows closely with over $3 billion, fueled by its recent record daily inflow value of $200 million.Issuers, including Bitwise’s BITB, VanEck’s HODL, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and others, lag behind the top performers, collectively holding over $4 billion.On the Flipside
The surge in the institutional accumulation of Bitcoin could hamper retail investors’ ability to participate and access the market.



The success of Bitcoin ETFs has led to increased anticipation for Ethereum ETFs. However, the SEC’s reluctance to engage with proposers is diminishing optimism for approval.



Since its launch, Grayscale’s GBTC has recorded over $11 billion in outflows.
Why This MattersThe growing BlackRock Bitcoin stash reflects the broader impressive performance of BTC exchange-traded funds since their approval and launch, and the maintenance of this momentum could see the firm overthrowing Grayscale and becoming one of the largest BTC holders.Is the SEC unwilling to greenlight the proposed Ethereum ETFs?

372 Million Dollar Crypto Project Decided to Distribute Airdrop: Here are the Terms - Bitcoin Sistemi


Glif, the largest protocol and liquid credit platform in the Filecoin (FIL) ecosystem, announced that it has launched its points program before the token launch.
Filecoin storage providers (SPs) and liquidity providers (LPs), the two parties in the Glyph system, are eligible to earn points. Glif stated that points will be awarded to both past and future SPs and LPs.


As a liquid leasing protocol, Glif allows Filecoin (FIL) token holders to deposit FIL into a liquidity pool. In return, they receive iFIL, Glif's native liquid rental token. SPs rent the accumulated FIL and pay back the rental fees to the LPs and the protocol. After depositing FIL, LPs earn pro rata rental fees.
According to data from Filfox, Glif is currently the largest protocol in the Filecoin ecosystem, with a total locked value of over $372 million.






Glif's points schedule arrives just two days before the project's one-year anniversary. The protocol allocated 75 million points for past (50 million) and future (25 million) SPs and LPs, and each party will receive a 50% share of the total points.
The starting date for the distribution of past points was determined as March 30, 2023, the date when the protocol was launched. The starting date for future points will be March 28, will continue until September 26, and point distribution will be made every two weeks. Glif plans to convert its points into its upcoming native token at a 1:1 ratio.

$15 Billion Bitcoin Derivatives Bet on Post-Halving Price Surge - DailyCoin


        
The Bitcoin derivatives market has seen unprecedented activity, with open interest reaching $15 billion.



Spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing institutional participation have fueled the derivatives market.



While past halvings have seen price surges, the impact of this record-breaking open interest remains uncertain.
The Bitcoin market is buzzing with anticipation as the next halving event approaches on April 20th. This highly anticipated event, which cuts the reward for mining Bitcoin in half, has historically coincided with price surges. But this time, there’s a new wrinkle: a record-breaking level of open interest in Bitcoin derivatives contracts.Bitcoin Open Interest Hits Record HighsOpen interest, which refers to the total value of outstanding futures and options contracts, currently sits at a staggering $15 billion across major derivatives exchanges like CME, Derebit, OKX, Binance, and Bybit. This figure dwarfs the $2 billion seen before the 2020 halving, highlighting a dramatic increase in market sophistication and liquidity.The surge in open interest can be attributed to several factors. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has undeniably fueled institutional participation, while seasoned veterans are likely placing strategic bets in anticipation of the halving’s potential impact on supply and price.For some context, open interest wasn’t always a reliable indicator of market sentiment. Early Bitcoin futures platforms failed to gain traction, leaving the first halving in 2012 to transpire with a relatively small and nascent investor base. By the second halving in 2016, the landscape had shifted. Will History Repeat, or Is This Time Different?Established platforms like BitMEX offered derivatives, and traditional financial giants like CME and CBOE entered the fray. This marked the first time crypto derivatives were traded on regulated U.S. exchanges. This coincided with the peak of the 2017 bull run when Bitcoin skyrocketed from $1,000 to $20,000.The 2020 halving, however, presented a unique scenario. The global pandemic served as a backdrop, further solidifying Bitcoin’s image as “digital gold.” This marked the first time significant open interest signaled a maturing market with a broader investor base, including a growing institutional presence.
With the current open interest eclipsing the 2020 figure by a factor of seven, the upcoming halving promises to be a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. Whether it triggers another price rally remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the market is approaching this event with a newfound depth and sophistication.On the Flipside
If the price of Bitcoin moves unexpectedly, it could trigger cascading liquidations, especially for overleveraged positions.



While past halvings coincided with price surges, there’s no guarantee the same will happen this time.
Why This MattersThe unprecedented open interest in Bitcoin derivatives suggests a far more mature market than previous halvings. This increased investor participation, particularly from institutions, could fuel significant price volatility and redefine how the market reacts to this historic Bitcoin event.

Bitwise Enters Race for Ethereum Spot ETF - Decrypt

Crypto investment firm Bitwise filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today to offer a spot Ethereum ETF. Bitwise joins an increasingly crowded field of companies vying to bring the first Ethereum spot ETF to market following the successful launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year.According to the S-1 registration form filed by Bitwise, the proposed "Bitwise Ethereum Trust" would hold Ethereum (ETF) and may stake a portion of the fund's assets through trusted staking providers to earn additional rewards. Staking—a practice that has drawn scrutiny by government regulators—involves locking up ether to help secure the Ethereum network and validate transactions, with participants earning newly minted ether as a reward.Bitwise's entry into the Ethereum spot ETF race comes amid growing interest from traditional financial firms. In recent months, asset management giant BlackRock, digital currency investment firm Grayscale, and VanEck have all filed proposals with the SEC to launch their own Ethereum spot ETFs. The increased competition reflects the potential demand for such products, as investors seek exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency without the need to directly purchase and store it themselves.The filing comes soon after a Bitwise executive predicted that approval of an Ethereum spot ETF would not come this summer, as many have predicted—and said that waiting until later in the year could be a good thing."Spot Ethereum ETFs will gather more assets if they launch in December versus if they launch in May," Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, in a recent tweet. "TradFi needs more time to digest the Bitcoin ETFs."The SEC has delayed decisions on several high-profile Ethereum spot ETF applications in recent months, including those from BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Invesco, and Galaxy Digital. Analysts like James Seyffart of Bloomberg originally predicted that delays would continue until May 23, the drop-dead deadline for the earliest applications from VanEck and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest. He now thinks they will be denied.Despite the delays, some experts remain optimistic about the prospects for Ethereum spot ETFs.British multinational bank Standard Chartered expects the SEC to approve such products by May, citing the regulator's lack of designation of ether as a security. The bank also predicts that the price of ether could reach $8,000 by the end of the year and $14,000 by the end of 2025, driven in part by the anticipated approval of spot ETFs.The potential impact of Ethereum spot ETFs on the cryptocurrency market could be significant. Since the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, billions of dollars have flowed into these funds, pushing up the price of the leading cryptocurrency. A similar effect may be seen with Ethereum, as traditional investors gain a more accessible avenue to invest in the asset.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Abra settles with fifth state as US operations may be winding down

Cryptocurrency platform Abra and its CEO William Barhydt reached a settlement with the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation, under which it will return assets held by Oregon users on the platform and cease and desist from offering unregistered securities in the state. This is the latest step in the United States-based company’s withdrawal from the U.S. market.Oregon is at  least the fifth state to take action against the companies that make up the Abra ecosystem. The state of Oregon charged Abra with violations of state securities laws in connection with its interest-bearing crypto depository accounts Abra Earn and Abra Boost. It required Abra to advise all account holders in the state to remove their crypto assets from the platform. If it succeeds in returning all assets to Oregon customers by April 25, it will not be subject to a monetary penalty.In Oregon, 167 Abra customers have $32,387.14 on the platform. The state of Iowa settled with Abra and its CEO in February, and Abra agreed to return $6,426.90 to its approximately 39 customers in that state. It would avoid a penalty of $461,610.14 by fulfilling the conditions of the settlement by March 6. Related: SEC and CFTC Fine Crypto Investment App for Offering Synthetic AssetsMaryland took action against Abra in September 2023 on behalf of 162 Marylanders with balances totaling $700,000. Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown stated in the announcement:“Maryland has been participating in a working group of state securities regulators focused on interest-bearing crypto asset accounts.” This past January, Abra agreed in a settlement with the Texas State Securities Board to repay state residents their balances on the platform. That was the second action Texas had taken against Abra. In a June 2023 enforcement action, the Texas agency found that Abra had approximately 1,600 state residents on its platform with a balance of $1.8 million. It also claimed that Abra has been insolvent since March of that year, which was during the height of the banking crisis.Source: Bill BarhydtThe California Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation issued a consent decree in April 2023 requiring Abra to close out Californians’ Earn accounts, worth $19 million.Abra said in a blog post in July that it was ending retail operations in the United States.Magazine: Home loans using crypto as collateral: Do the risks outweigh the reward?

                        Cryptocurrencies like WIF, DOGE and CORE compete for best crypto to buy today  Image by cryptonews.com As Bitcoin (BTC) holds firm to the north of the $70,000 level amid reports in the Chinese media that the PBoC has been directed by President Xi Jinping to restart bond purchases for the first time in decades, investors are scouring altcoin markets as they hunt for the best crypto to buy today.China’s shift towards quantitative easing (QE) comes at a time when most other major global central banks are also on the brink of easing. The Fed, ECB and BoE are all expected to deliver rate cuts this year.Easing of financial conditions has historically been a big positive for crypto prices. That’s largely because easier financial conditions boost risk appetite amongst investors, benefitting riskier asset classes like stocks and crypto.Quarter-end choppiness as traders square expiring options positions could rock the boat this week.But Bitcoin price risks remain firmly tilted to the upside amid macro tailwinds and ahead of the halving.Both of these themes, plus Bitcoin’s strong Q1 performance, could encourage more traditional investors to add to their BTC exposure via spot Bitcoin ETF purchases.Further ETF inflows could add another tailwind to the BTC market in Q2, as was the case in Q1.Bitcoin remains odds on to hit $100,000 this year. That could mean easy 40-50% upside from current levels.For any investors new to crypto, Bitcoin is certainly the best crypto to buy today. After all, it’s the oldest and most trusted crypto, with by far the most adoption. It’s also the best-performing asset of all time.But some investors with high risk-reward appetites will be targeting larger than 40-50% gains this year.Those looking for gains in the region of 5-10x will need to find gems in the altcoin market.Here are some of Thursday’s top-performing altcoin names that could be the best crypto to buy today.Best Crypto to Buy TodayDogwifhat (WIF)After nearly two-weeks of consolidation, Dogwifhat (WIF) just broke out to fresh record highs above $3.50.Having pumped nearly 30% today to close to $3.90, WIF is closing in on $4 per token. That would take its market cap to $4 billion.That still around eight times smaller than Dogecoin, the leading meme coin crypto. WIF could easily still post 5x gains this bull market.That’s why WIF ranks as potentially the best crypto to buy today.Dogecoin (DOGE)Speaking of Dogecoin, the crypto industry’s leading meme coin is also up big on Thursday.Dogecoin (DOGE) was last trading around $0.22, up 18% today and at its highest level since December 2021.That still leaves it 70% down versus its 2021 record highs in the $0.70s. Indeed, many think that integration into a future X payments system could soon propel DOGE above $1.Dogecoin could still 5x from here, making it one of the best cryptos to buy today.Core (CORE)Innovative layer-1 blockchain protocol Core (CORE), whose blockchain is secured through a combination of delegated Bitcoin’s mining hash and delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), is pumping on Thursday.As per CoinMarketCap, it was last up more than 15% in 24 hours. That has propelled its market cap to above $1 billion and into the top 100 cryptos by market value.Whether the blockchain will garner much adoption remains anyone’s guess. But at a still modest valuation of only $1 billion, there is plenty of room for upside.CORE could easily be the best crypto to buy today.New Crypto ICO Alternatives to Consider
Investing in smaller, lesser-known altcoins is one great way of turning a quick profit in crypto.But investors looking to up their risk profile shouldn’t neglect another highly profitable strategy – investing in new crypto ICOs.Up-and-coming web3 start-ups often look to raise funds in their infancy via the sale of their native protocol token.These sales are almost always conducted at a steep discount to the project’s potential. For example, most presales will sell their token at a price that gives them a market cap of $10-30 million.But successful projects can easily become billion-dollar market cap cryptos. Presale investors thus often target projects with 10-50x potential.Of course, investing in new crypto ICOs comes with a lot of the same risks as traditional start-up investing. The success of a project relies heavily upon the competency of management and execution.With so many new crypto ICOs to choose from, getting started can be a daunting task.Luckily, the experienced team at Cryptonews has already done a lot of digging.Here are 14 of their favorite projects:See the 14 Cryptocurrencies

Ripple (XRP) Bashed by Forbes: Cardano's Charles Hoskinson Responds


																TL;DR

Forbes labeled Ripple’s blockchain as ineffective and its token as purely speculative, questioning its utility and market value.
Charles Hoskinson and crypto supporters defended Ripple, making jokes with the media company’s report.


Forbes Takes Aim at Ripple (XRP)
The global media company Forbes recently published a report called “The Rise of Crypto’s Billion Dollar Zombies,” which touched upon numerous cryptocurrency protocols. It paid special attention to Ripple (the company behind the XRP token) and provided detailed information about its early days.
“To fund their ambitious project, executives at the company created 100 billion XRP tokens and sold $1.4 billion worth to the public. In early 2018, at the height of the first wave of crypto euphoria, XRP was trading with a market value of $132 billion, giving cofounder and executive chairman Chris Larsen a net worth of $8 billion.”
However, Forbes claimed that Ripple failed to meet its goal to improve the global financial network in the following years. The media company went even further, calling Ripple’s blockchain “useless.” 
“In terms of global money flows, not much is going on at Ripple Labs today, and few expect it ever to disrupt the Belgian banking cooperative known as SWIFT, which facilitates $5 trillion in interbank transfers every day. It’s largely useless, but the XRP token still sports a market value of $36 billion, making it the sixth-most valuable cryptocurrency,” the report reads.
Forbes’ bashing manifest did not stop here, describing Ripple and numerous other blockchains as “crypto zombies.” It also argued that the company’s native token – XRP – has “no purpose other than speculation.”




Hoskinson’s Reaction
One person who opposed Forbes’ report is Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson. He jokingly mentioned that all cryptocurrency protocols mentioned by the media (most importantly Ripple, Algorand, Tezos, Bitcoin Cash, and Stellar) are “zombies,” but “it’s because we got all the brain.”

Numerous X users agreed with Hoskinson’s stance, calling Forbes’ report “a joke of an article.” It is worth noting that the media company has not always been that hostile toward the cryptocurrency industry. Earlier this month, it presented a list of the top 10 digital assets people should focus their attention on, with XRP being one of those.

Ethereum futures open interest at all-time high - Bullish or bearish?

Ether (ETH) has been grappling with the $3,600 level for the past three days, yet it seems traders may have overlooked the fact that the ETH price has soared by 58.8% since February. While some market participants attribute the limited upside to uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved in the U.S., others contend that the surge in Ether futures open interest indicates strong demand from institutional investors.Ether spot ETF decision in May is pivotal for Ether’s priceThe debate continues over the implications of the indictment by the United States Justice Department against the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin. On one hand, the indictment is viewed as a negative for the industry due to the resulting tighter regulatory landscape. However, some argue that this event actually improves the prospects for the approval of a spot Ether ETF by May 25, the date by which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to issue its final decision.A complaint filed on March 26 by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against KuCoin for illegal trading activities notably identified Bitcoin (BTC), Ether, and Litecoin (LTC) as “digital assets that are commodities,” falling firmly under the CFTC’s jurisdiction. This stance appears to directly challenge the SEC’s assertions that Ether could be considered a security.Source: Alexander GrieveBlackRock CEO Larry Fink remarked in a March 27 interview on FOX Business that listing an Ether ETF could still be feasible even if the asset is classified as a security by regulators, as reported by Unchained Crypto. Meanwhile, in a March 27 update on the X social network, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart reiterated his prediction of a denial in May, noting that the CFTC has recognized Ether as a commodity since at least February 2021, “when they allowed CME Ethereum futures to begin trading.”The growth of the Ether futures market is undoubtedly a positive development, as increased liquidity, particularly in the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) market, facilitates participation by hedge funds and large asset managers. However, the fact that aggregate Ether futures open interest achieved a new record high on March 28 should not be immediately interpreted as a bullish indicator.Ether futures aggregate open interest, USD. Source: CoinglassIt is important to note that Binance leads the pack, amassing $4.55 billion in ETH futures market positions, with Bybit trailing at $2.4 billion. Meanwhile, the open interest in CME Ether futures currently sits at $1.3 billion. Thus, attributing the recent surge solely to institutional investor interest would be oversimplifying the matter.Moreover, in every derivatives market, the volume of long positions, those wagering on a price increase, invariably equals the volume of short positions, those betting on a decline. However, the demand for leverage can serve as an indicator of the market's bullish or bearish sentiment.Ether derivatives reflect moderate optimismPerpetual contracts, or inverse swaps, include a rate that adjusts based on the demand imbalance for leverage. A positive funding rate indicates increased demand for bullish leverage positions, whereas a negative rate suggests a preference for bearish positions.Ether perpetual futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: CoinglassRecent data indicates a rise in the demand for leveraged long positions in ETH, with the current funding rate at 0.04%, or roughly 0.8% on a weekly basis. Typically, rates above 1.2% per week signal excessive optimism, suggesting that traders are presently moderately bullish.To gauge professional traders’ sentiment more accurately, one should examine data from the Ether options market. The 25% delta skew provides insight into whether arbitrage desks and market makers are charging more for upward or downward protection. Specifically, a skew metric above 7% suggests expectations of a price decline, whereas excitement in the market usually results in a negative skew below -7%.Related: Covered call options strategy, explainedDeribit Ether 2-month options 25% delta skew. Source: LaevitasThe Ether option delta skew indicates balanced pricing between call and put options, aligning with a neutral market stance. However, a comparison with data from March 21, when the ETH skew metric showed signs of optimism, suggests that traders are now less optimistic about Ether's potential to surpass the $3,800 mark.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

USDT Transaction Volume Soars on TRON DAO, Hits 2 Million Daily


																There has been a remarkable surge in USDT transactions within the TRON ecosystem via TronDAO, showing a substantial increase since early February, now averaging over two million transactions daily.
According to the latest data compiled by IntotheBlock, the surge brings the transaction volume close to the peak observed in January 2023.
USDT Transaction Volume Soars on TRON DAO
For the uninitiated, TRON DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization connected to a blockchain ecosystem. USDT, complying with the TRC-20 token standard on TRON, allows transfers using various non-custodial wallets like TronLink, Trust Wallet, and MetaMask.
TRON’s popularity for stablecoin transfers, particularly with USDT TRC-20 tokens, stems from its scalability advantage over Ethereum, resulting in comparatively lower on-chain fees.
With its higher throughput capacity, the TRON network supports intensive projects without the significant “gas” requirements associated with Ethereum, making it an increasingly favored platform for such transactions.






However, Tether, being a controversial entity in the eyes of several law enforcement agencies, has also brought its stablecoin, USDT, under scrutiny.
Recent reports, including a United Nations study earlier this year, suggest a rising trend of money laundering and fraudulent activities in Southeast Asia utilizing USDT for payments and fund transfers, particularly via its TRC-20 protocol.
However, Justin Sun and TRON DAO have refuted these allegations, with the latter stating active collaboration with on-chain forensic partners to share transaction-related information and dismiss such claims.
USDT Expansion
Despite the intense scrutiny and backlash, USDT has grown significantly in tandem with market recovery. The stablecoin broke above a milestone of $100 billion market cap earlier this month.
In terms of expansion, Tether recently announced the launch of USDT on the Celo blockchain, making it the 15 network to accommodate the leading stablecoin, after Ethereum, TRON, Polygon, Avalanche, and Algorand, among others.
Meanwhile, Tether has intensified its efforts to focus on artificial intelligence (AI) this year. Key areas of focus include the development of open-source, multimodal AI products to establish new industry benchmarks. Additionally, the crypto firm intends to collaborate with various entities to integrate AI solutions into market-oriented products, addressing real-world challenges.

Dogwifhat Hits All-Time High, Flips Pepe as Meme Coins Soar - Decrypt

While the broader cryptocurrency market has been relatively flat, meme coins have been on a tear, with Dogwifhat leading the pack. The most popular Solana memecoin reached a new all-time high earlier today.Dogwifhat is a relatively new meme coin launched on the Solana ecosystem in November of last year. Despite being a newcomer, it has made a name for itself in the highly competitive meme coin space. Today, the coin started at $3.21, traded sideways until about 9am ET, then suddenly started to spike, reaching an ATH of $3.90 at around 4:30pm ET. It's trading at $3.81 as of writing.Image: TradingviewThis marks Dogwifhat's best daily performance since its launch. It recently flipped relative veteran meme coin Pepe, rising to the 38th position in the Top 100 as Pepe settled in 43rd place with respective market caps of $3.8 billion to $3.37 billion, according to Coingecko.If all conditions remain the same, in fact, there is still room for further upward movement.Dogwifhat's Relative Strength Index (RSI)—an indicator that measures whether bulls or bears dominate the market— is currently at 69 points, suggesting that the coin is oversold. This means there is a risk that a major cohort of holders is waiting for the best time to realize their gains, which would trigger a correction in the price.Beyond this, given the young nature of the coin—limiting the amount of past data—it is hard to make any price projections based on technical analysis.It is also important to note that meme coins are extremely volatile and are known for their lack of fundamentals. The WIF vision, for example, is nothing else but "literally just a dog wif a hat". This makes them susceptible to drastic and unpredictable changes influenced by random events like tweets, unrelated news, and market movements of other coins. These tokens are driven more by market sentiment than anything else.Image: Dogwifcoin.orgOther memecoins are also doing well today. Besides Dogwifhat, the four best-performing tokens in the overall crypto industry's Top 100 are meme coins: Dogecoin (+16.83%), Floki (+12.7%), and BONK (+10%). Beyond the top 10, PEPE is up 8.29% and is currently being traded at $0.000008293 per token, Shiba Inu is up +5.85% to $0.00003179, and 65 out of the 100 biggest meme coins are posting some gains in the last 24 hours.Today has been a good day for meme coin traders overall—but these tokens also tend to crash fast. It's important to exercise caution when dealing with these assets due to their volatile nature, but chances are that you probably don't care if you're a HODLer.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Vitalik Buterin takes us through what comes next for Ethereum after blobs | Cryptopolitan

Vitalik Buterin, the man, the myth, the legend – back with us to discuss what is coming next for the blockchain diva Ethereum in the aftermath of the Dencun hard fork, an iconic event that launched the Ethereum network into a new scaling paradigm with the introduction of proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844 or, you know, blobs. Right out of the gate, this move slashed the cost of rollup transactions by a whole lot, over 100 times cheaper, because blobs were basically free. Just recently, we’ve seen blobs getting more action, and the cost for using them started to find its groove as more folks began using blobscriptions protocol.Vitalik said, after blobs hit the scene, scaling Ethereum went from a massive leap to just figuring out the next steps – it’s more about the nitty-gritty now. He’s talking about making blobs work harder and making sure rollups use each blob to its fullest. The big, earth-shattering changes to Ethereum? According to Vitalik, we’ve seen most of them. Now, it’s more about fine-tuning and looking towards issues that matter more to app developers and users.Ethereum’s New DirectionEthereum’s been on a slow movement towards something called a Layer 2 (L2) centric ecosystem. This means the heavy lifting isn’t done by the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1) but by these new layers built on top of it.Major apps are moving to L2, payments are being done on L2 by default, and wallets are getting designed around using multiple L2s. This whole shift was planned, aiming to make a special space in Ethereum blocks that can hold data for L2 projects but isn’t messed with by Ethereum’s main brain, the EVM.This is about setting the stage so in the future, nodes can just check bits of data to confirm everything’s there, without needing to look at everything. This trick, called data availability sampling, could let Ethereum hold a lot more data, aiming for about 16 MB per slot.EIP-4844, the blob thingy, doesn’t get us all the way there, but it sets up the basics. The real game changer, data availability sampling, can be added later without everyone having to redo their homework. The only big change needed down the line is a tweak in the settings.The Next Steps for EthereumSo, what’s next? Vitalik talked about two big to-dos: getting more data into each blob and making L2s smarter about using this data. There’s talk about a newbie version of data availability sampling called PeerDAS, where nodes share the load of holding onto data. This could let Ethereum handle a lot more data without breaking a sweat.And to keep things from getting too wild, there are ideas like EIP-7623 to keep the size of regular Ethereum blocks in check, making it safer to turn up the dial on how much data and how many transactions Ethereum can handle.L2 improvements are also on the menu. Vitalik says there’s a bunch of ways L2s can get better:Squishing Data: Making transactions take up less space.Smart Security: Figuring out ways to keep L2s safe without always running to L1 for help.Better Inside Workings: Making rollups and other L2s work more smoothly and handle more transactions without getting clogged up.Up the Security Game: Making sure rollups are as secure as they promise, moving from trust to proof.Vitalik told us we’re now past the big, crazy changes to Ethereum. The next steps are more about refining what’s already been built. He’s also thinking a lot about what all this means for the people making apps and using Ethereum. With lower fees thanks to blobs, the door’s open for apps that were too costly before. But, there’s a warning too. He says we’re not totally out of the woods yet. Fees could go up if things get too busy, so there’s more work to do on scaling.It’s Go Time for DevelopersVitalik explained that developers now have the tools they need to make things that are secure, user-friendly, and ready for the big time. He’s seeing signs that people are stepping up, like the Daimo wallet trying to be like Venmo but on Ethereum, and Farcaster aiming to make decentralized social networking actually nice to use.Vitalik’s point is clear though. Ethereum’s ready for the next wave of apps, and it’s on developers to make it happen. He’s also saying Ethereum isn’t just about just making transactions anymore. It’s about building a whole new kind of internet, with privacy, voting, and community at its heart.And for the apps still kicking it old school on Ethereum’s main layer?It’s time to level up and get with the times, boys! Embrace L2 and the new tools Ethereum’s got to offer.

Ethereum Reaches 1M Validators: Will It Boost the Network? - DailyCoin


        
Ethereum’s validator count rises sharply to 1 million. 



The Shapella upgrade catalyzed the growth in validators.



More validators enhance security but also raise concerns.
Ethereum, a cornerstone for DeFi, has recently marked a pivotal achievement by surpassing one million active validators. This development is crucial, considering validators are at the heart of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. However, the substantial increase in Ethereum’s validators, especially following the Shapella upgrade, has brought excitement and concern. Some have raised concerns about technical and centralization challenges that may arise from such a rapidly expanding validator count.Ethereum Validator Milestone Raises ConcernsOn Thursday, March 28, Ethereum reached a significant milestone in its validator count: 1 million, according to data from Dune. After Ethereum reached this milestone, concerns regarding the network started emerging in the crypto community. Source: DuneA notable discussion point revolves around the validator set’s growth, particularly after the Shapella upgrade, which allowed for the withdrawal of staked Ethereum. This upgrade is key for  Ethereum’s evolution towards a more scalable and energy-efficient network. However, as the number of validators grows, each must independently download the latest data and verify state changes within a constrained time frame. This means they require more computing power for larger data blocks.Validator Count Raises Centralization RisksAnother layer of concern is the potential for increased centralization. This scenario could emerge if the network’s growing bandwidth allows validators with significant computational resources to participate effectively.This privileges institution-owned data centers over individual, self-hosted nodes. Moreover, it pushes the Ethereum network towards centralization, which contradicts its foundational ethos.On the Flipside
It is also important to note that validators don’t represent signe entities. For an entity to run a validator, it must have 32 ETH. However, it is possible to run multiple validators on a single server. 



In January, Ethereum saw a significant lowering of its validator count, leading to concerns over staking rewards. 
Why This MattersEthereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism is crucial to enhancing efficiency. However, balancing this growth with the network’s foundational principles of decentralization and accessibility remains a critical challenge. Read more about issues with Ethereum validators:

'Som Bonkmon Fraud': SBF Meme Coins Pump 300x, Then Crash After Sentencing - Decrypt

If the 25 year prison sentence announced today for disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried came as a shock to any, here’s a related development that will surely surprise no one: Degens churned up multiple meme coins to piggyback on the news, which in some cases surged over 30,000% in value before plummeting back to worthlessness.On Ethereum scaling network Base, some intrepid crypto user created a meme coin called "Sam Baseman Fraud" around 6:00 am ET, hours before Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearing was set to begin. By 1 pm, just after the hearing concluded, the token (FTX) had spiked nearly 35,000% to a price of just over one cent. Minutes later, it collapsed. At writing, the token is worth less about 4/10ths of a penny, and continues to trend downwards—though since creation, it’s still up over 9,500%. That volatility hasn’t stopped degens from aping in, however. Of course not. “Sam Baseman Fraud” has already seen over $3.4 million worth of trading volume today, according to DexScreener. It still retains a market capitalization of $400,000, and $80,000 worth of liquidity—though that amount has been decreasing in recent hours as the novelty apparently fades.Meanwhile, on Solana, a near-identical, though marginally more creative token—"Som Bonkmon Fraud" (SBF)—lived through almost the exact same cycle, albeit with slightly different timing. Created yesterday, the Solana SBF token spiked some 15,000% yesterday evening. That streak continued overnight into the minutes before Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearing began. At that point,  though, the coin started tanking—falling from just shy of a penny to under 9/100ths of a cent at writing. It is now down over 90% in the last 24 hours.For some reason—perhaps the ongoing meme coin frenzy on Solana, perhaps the cheeky allusion to meme coin sensation BONK, or perhaps the Solana-SBF connection—”Som Bonkman Fraud” has seen a massive $24 million in trading volume over the last day. The token retains $146,000 in locked liquidity, and—at the moment—is posting a $675,000 market cap. Today’s SBF tokens are hardly the first to capitalize on a major news event to spin up millions of dollars worth of capital out of nothing. Such tokens rarely result in happy endings for holders: They are routinely “rug-pulled” by their anonymous creators, who withdraw liquidity and leave investors holding the bag.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

How high can Bitcoin go? New BTC price prediction sees cycle top at $180K

Bitcoin (BTC) price could gain another 150% during the current bull market cycle, according to Laurent Benayoun, the CEO of Acheron Trading and quantitative trading strategies expert. Bitcoin price top at $180K?The executive anticipates a potential cycle top of $180,000 for BTC price, based on a combination of factors, including the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the new supply reduction from the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Benayoun explained:“If we look at historical performance, with every cycle the multiple on the all-time is getting lower. So if we apply this reasoning it could be 2x to 3x what we saw in the previous cycles, so let's say around $120,000 to $180,000 per unit.”Improving financial policy in the United States will also contribute to Bitcoin’s price appreciation, according to Benayoun:“The market is pricing in a reduction in interest rates because they have been flatlining, so it’s reasonable to expect them to go down in the near future.”Other BTC price predictionsBenayoun’s prediction is in line with several other recent forecasts. Bitfinex analysts, for instance, see price reaching $120,000 by the end of 2024, according to a research report shared with Cointelegraph:“Our analysis forecasts a conservative price objective of $100,000-$120,000 to be achieved by Q4 2024, and the cycle peak to be achieved sometime in 2025 in terms of total crypto market capitalization. The ETFs have introduced passive demand which means demand is coming from investors that is largely price agnostic.” Meanwhile, wealth management giant Bernstein expects Bitcoin to break out to around $150,000 following the halving by mid-2025.Related: Max pain $51K?

Investors can participate for $64 per token and a 1% administrative fee. BitGo will be the token manager, and staking rewards will be distributed based on purchase volume, but the rewards will be locked to the underlying token.However, as FTX Legacy said on its dividend last time, there are reports that some investors are going out of business with a 13% drop in dividends. However, interest in purchasing unlocked Solana tokens remains high as investors look at the development potential of the token.Interest received from othersFTX Co. Other investment companies such as Equipment’s Solana expressed interest in purchasing their products. Pantera, for example, announced that it was seeking money to create a fund that would purchase up to $250 million in tokens. The fund will charge a 0.75% management fee and a 10% commission. Another fund, Phoenix, is also considering raising money for a similar project, but reports say the bid has failed.FalconX also announced that it will raise funds through a massive auction of unlocked Solana tokens.

Increased demand could increase Solana’s value, benefiting existing owners and attracting new investors looking to enter the market. Additionally, interest from investment firms such as Neptune Digital and Galaxy Business could provide Solana with additional credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of investors who could provide rapid growth and integration with traditional finance.Overall, FTX Asset Group’s Solana token sale is the most significant sale for cryptocurrencies and a sign of things to come.

Optimistic Outlook: Celestia (TIA) Price Targets a Bullish April


Celestia’s (TIA) price had a rather bearish March but this did not stop the optimistic bunch of investors from remaining hopeful of a rally.
This is evident in their behavior, which may result in a bullish April, provided their pessimism does not hinder the price action.
Celestia Price to Bounce Back?
Celestia’s price can be seen changing hands at $13.8 at the time of writing, barely recovering from $13. This, however, has not slowed the optimism that TIA investors hold as they continue to place bullish bets on the altcoin.
The Funding Rate of Celestia at the moment is positive. The funding rate is a mechanism used in perpetual futures contracts, which signals whether traders are placing long or short contracts. Positive funding rates hint at the former, while negative rates suggest the latter.

TIA’s positive rate shows that despite the correction, traders are expecting a rise in price. In part, they are right about their prediction since the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is signaling bullishness.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. It’s composed of a MACD line and a signal line, used to identify bullish and bearish trends.

Presently, the indicator is signaling that the altcoin is at the cusp of a bullish crossover. This hints at the incoming bullish momentum, which, if sustained, would drive TIA higher.
TIA Price Prediction: What to Expect Next?
Celestia’s price recovered a part of the 28% decline noted in mid-March. Looking at the aforementioned conditions, the chances of a rally seem high, which would likely send TIA to $18.

However, the retail investors are exhibiting slight pessimism at the moment. The overall sentiment they hold is negative, which might keep TIA from witnessing a substantial rally.

Should they move to protect their present gains from further losses, Celestia’s price could lose the support of $13.08 and fall to 11.5, slipping beyond which would invalidate the bullish thesis.

Dogecoin's price prediction: Is DOGE to $1 still on for the memecoin? - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin witnessed a surge in price as transaction volumes grew.
However, sentiment around the DOGE token fell significantly during this period.

Dogecoin [DOGE] witnessed a massive uptick in price over the last few weeks despite the overall market seeing volatility. One of the reasons for this could be the high transaction volume occurring on the network.
Surge in volume
Based on data from Santiment, there was a notable surge in Dogecoin transaction volume, escalating from 1.22 billion to 9.20 billion within a span of 48 hours.

Coupled with this, the overall velocity around DOGE had also increased. This indicated that the frequency with which DOGE was being transferred had also grown over the last few days. The spike in velocity could add more momentum to DOGE’s recent rally.
Moreover, the total number of holders that were accumulating DOGE had also grown. This meant that the recent surge in price was caused by new entrants in the market and it wasn’t caused by increased accumulation from old holders.
The interest shown by new addresses indicated the growing popularity of DOGE across the crypto sector. However, there were other factors that could impede DOGE’s growth going forward.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data showcased that the number of daily active addresses on the Dogecoin network had declined significantly over the past few days.
The declining activity on the network showcases a falling interest in the overall Dogecoin ecosystem. If the declining interest in the ecosystem persists, it could have dire consequences for DOGE in the long run.
Source: Santiment
Some challenges ahead
Another factor that could impact DOGE would be the social volume around the token. As DOGE is a memecoin, a large part of its price is driven by social activity.
Recent data indicated that social volume around DOGE had fallen considerably over the last few days. Moreover, the weighted sentiment around the token had also declined.
This meant that the number of positive comments around DOGE had reduced, whereas the negative comments around DOGE had surged. These factors may affect DOGE’s chances of rallying.
Moreover, the memecoin sector has grown significantly over the last few months in both high and low market cap areas.

Read Dogecoin’s [DOGE] Price Prediction 2024-25

Memecoins such as PEPE and WIF have amassed massive popularity and have gained significant standing in the sector.
The Solana memecoin frenzy has also attracted a large amount of users. This can drive liquidity and interest away from DOGE in the future.

SBF bags 25 years in jail - Now what about Gary, Nishad, Caroline? | Cryptopolitan

After the circus of a trial that landed their ex-boss, Sam Bankman-Fried, behind bars for a cool quarter-century, folks are itching to know. What is going on with the three musketeers Gary Wang, Nishad Singh, and Caroline Ellison? These three amigos, once riding high on the crypto wave at FTX and Alameda Research, have, as we all know, come crashing down hard. They’ve sung like canaries to the feds, but we all know that’s not their golden ticket to freedom.Can’t be that easy.Ellison, at 29, ditched continents and cozied up back home after the feds raided her place, snagging her electronics and spilling her secrets. Wang, 31, bolted from the Bahamas and hightailed it to Manhattan’s prosecutors faster than you can say “crypto crash.” Singh, the youngest at 28, hit rock bottom, grappling with the fallout in the Bahamas before he too decided to spill the beans.It’s a sorry state of affairs when your best hope hinges on how much dirt you can dish out on your former boss. Legal eagles hint that singing to the feds might spare them the clink, but history tells us it’s no picnic. Remember the Enron snitch and the WorldCom whistleblower? Yeah, they still got the slammer. So, our trio’s path is as clear as mud.Since dropping the dime on Bankman-Fried, it’s been all quiet on the western front for our three musketeers. Singh’s back in California, trying to do some good with his time, even snagging a software gig. Wang’s also back in tech, keeping a low profile. And Ellison? Well, her whereabouts and doings are a bit of a mystery post-trial.Their courtroom drama made for some spicy headlines. Ellison, in particular, delivered the goods on Bankman-Fried, explaining a ton of misdeeds and mismanagement that had the jury at the edge of their seats. It’s like something out of a Telenovela, complete with a love affair gone sour and financial shenanigans that would make your head spin.The government’s got their back, prepping a sweet deal for the judge to consider. How much their cooperation weighs in their favor remains to be seen. The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, holds their fate in his hands. Will he show mercy, or will he drop the hammer?Aside from dodging jail time, there’s the little matter of their careers. The SEC has slapped them with a ban from the director’s chair of any public company, and crypto trading? Forget about it. It’s like being barred from the candy store after you’ve had a taste of the sweetest treats. They’re sidelined, watching as crypto bounces back without them.So, what’s next for this troubled trio? Their past with FTX and Alameda Research is a saga of ambition, betrayal, and a spectacular fall from grace. As they await their own sentencing, one thing’s clear. They do not belong here anymore.

Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) Gets 25 Years: Here's a Full Breakdown - DailyCoin


        
A federal judge has issued a sentence against former FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried for defrauding customers and investors.



The issued sentence falls far below the recommendation of the prosecution. 



Delve into the charges the former crypto wunderkind faced and what comes next for him.
In November 2023, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was found guilty of multiple counts of fraud in relation to the stunning collapse of his exchange that left customers and investors with billions of dollars in losses. Five months after the verdict, the disgraced crypto mogul has finally faced sentencing. On Thursday, March 28, Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison, far more than the five to seven years requested by the defense and still far less than the 40 to 50 years recommended by the prosecution. In addition to the prison term, the judge ordered $11.02 billion in asset forfeitures to go toward repaying the victims of the FTX collapse.In this article, we break down the charges faced by the disgraced crypto mogul, what comes next, and what is likely to happen to former executives who turned on him.A Multi-Year FraudIn October 2023, Bankman-Fried stood trial for seven counts of fraud for his role in the FTX collapse. All of which suggested that he diverted FTX customer funds to keep sister trading firm Alameda Research afloat and fund his personal ambitions.Count One: Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud on CustomersAccording to prosecutors, from the start, Bankman-Fried and his colleagues lied to customers that FTX did not commingle customer funds. Still, all the while, they intended to use these funds to support the firm’s troubled sister trading firm, Alameda Research.Per testimony from former FTX CTO Gary Wang, SBF ordered special privileges for Alameda on FTX as early as 2019, exempting the trading firm from the exchange’s liquidation engine. In essence, the firm was exempted from liquidations on FTX and allowed unfettered withdrawals sourced from customer deposits when the trading firm was in the red. 
Wang further disclosed that at some point in 2020, Alameda’s negative balances exceeded FTX’s revenue by about $50 million. But even at this point, Bankman-Fried continued lying to customers about Alameda’s access to customer funds.Bankman-Fried would maintain this stance even in the throes of FTX’s collapse, famously tweeting, “FTX is fine.”Count Two: Wire Fraud on CustomersIn line with count one, this charge contends that Bankman-Fried and his colleagues defrauded customers by misappropriating their assets to pay off Alameda loans, cover Alameda expenses, purchase private assets, and fund political donations. 
During the trial, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison admitted that the trading firm siphoned up to $14 billion in FTX customer deposits for the purposes above. However, she pointed to Bankman-Fried as the mastermind."He set up the systems and told us to take the money," she revealed.At the time of FTX’s bankruptcy, prosecutors found that at least $8 billion in customer funds were missing.Count Three: Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud on LendersThis charge alleges that the disgraced crypto mogul and his fellow executives planned to mislead lenders to obtain loans. Specifically, as far back as 2020, Bankman-Fried and his colleagues doctored Alameda’s balance sheet to mislead lenders about the state of the trading firm.Alameda’s Caroline Ellison testified that Bankman-Fried had instructed the addition of illiquid tokens like the FTX-created FTT to the trading firm’s balance sheet.“I thought it was misleading,” she told the court, adding that she complied because she feared for her job.Count Four: Wire Fraud on LendersIn line with count three, this charge alleges that Bankman-Fried went ahead with his plan to defraud lenders by offering these doctored balance sheets in exchange for loans.The court found that these lenders lost an estimated $1.3 billion in FTX and Alameda’s collapse.Count Five: Conspiracy to Commit Commodities FraudBankman-Fried is accused of employing manipulative schemes and devices to defraud FTX customer of their trading funds. As outlined by the exchange’s former CTO Gary Wang, FTX offered Alameda backdoor access to customer funds with a line of credit of up to $65 billion.Count Six: Conspiracy to Commit Securities FraudThis claim alleges that Sam Bankman-Fried made false representations about FTX’s financial conditions and operations with the intent of defrauding investors. Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang told the court that Bankman-Fried had lied to investors about FTX’s relationship with Alameda, dismissing concerns about possible advantages that could have been afforded to the trading firm.Investors lost an estimated $1.7 billion in FTX’s collapse. Paradigm’s loss is estimated at around $278 million.Count 7: Conspiracy to Commit Money LaunderingThis claim accuses Bankman-Fried and his associates of trying to utilize customer monies in such a way as to conceal their origin. This included property purchases and executive loans.What’s Next for Sam Bankman-Fried?Following Bankman-Fried’s sentencing, his lawyers have reiterated their interest in launching an appeal of his conviction. This appeal is expected to be filed within the next two weeks.Pending and during this appeal, however, Bankman-Fried will start serving his sentence, most likely in a medium-security prison per the recommendation of Judge Kaplan. Medium-security prisons typically strike a balance between security and rehabilitation as they largely play host to convicts with less violent histories. While they can feature double fences and security cameras, they also offer a big rehabilitation focus with educational opportunities and job training.Will Bankman-Fried Serve the Full Term?While there is no possibility of parole for Bankman-Fried, the disgraced crypto mogul can still cut some time from his sentence for good behavior.Former Federal Prosecutor Mitchell Epner told CNN that non-violent federal inmates can reduce their time by as much as 50% under the prison reform legislation known as the First Step Act. This legislation opens up the possibility for the former crypto wunderkind to spend only 12 and a half years in prison.What About Other FTX and Alameda Executives?Following the collapse of FTX and Alameda, executives like Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh, and Gary Wang all took plea deals with the U.S. DOJ. While the details of this deal remain unclear, these executives are all likely to get off on lighter sentences.On the Flipside
Sam Bankman-Fried could end up serving only half of his term.



Several members of the crypto industry have described the Sam Bankman-Fried sentence as too lenient, especially when compared to the life sentence faced by Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht.
Why This MattersAt its peak, FTX was the largest crypto exchange in the world, behind only Binance. A key catalyst of the exchange’s success was Bankman-Fried’s ability to market himself as a crypto wunderkind, bridging the gap between the crypto industry, traditional finance, and the political scene. Behind all of this, however, the crypto mogul was taking risky bets with customer funds to fuel his ambitions. The recent sentencing ensures that his crimes will not go unpunished.Read this for more on Sam Bankman-Fried:Sam Bankman-Fried: Crypto’s Fallen Hero?Learn more about Larry Fink’s recent statements on Ethereum ETFs:How ETH ETF Works with Security Label According to Larry Fink

XRP Among Losers, Dogecoin (DOGE) Shows Who's Meme Coin Leader, Solana (SOL) Paints Symmetrical Triangle

A technical overlook of XRP's price movement illustrates this struggle, as recent trends signal potential headwinds for this digital asset.The chart demonstrates that XRP is navigating a delicate position. The asset has recently veered away from the higher moving average lines, indicating bearish sentiment among traders. These moving averages serve as layered resistance, with the 50-day moving average positioned as immediate resistance, followed by the 100-day and 200-day moving averages as further barriers to price growth.XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewAt the moment, XRP moves near a significant support level around $0.57, a point at which buying interest has historically emerged. The next critical support lies near the $0.50 threshold, a psychological threshold that acts as support thanks to the "round number" phenomenon. XRP's move past its moving averages could see resistance levels at $0.63 and the more formidable $0.70 come into play.Unfortunately, XRP is not really following market trends and has been showing suppressed dynamics rather than growth similar to what we have seen on Dogecoin.Dogecoin gains serious strengthDOGE is seeing an explosive rise in its price, reaching up to $0.2184. Such an explosive price surge is a result of a prolonged reversal, with a flattened-out bottom. The pattern usually emerges on assets that have been trading sideways for a considerable amount of time.A closer look at the price chart reveals that DOGE has found strong support at $0.1599, a level that previously saw the asset bounce back after a downward trend. On the upside, resistance can be spotted around the recent high of $0.2184.If DOGE can break through this top level, the price might climb even more. However, if the upward push loses strength, the $0.1599 support is key to keeping investors' positive views on the coin.For the future, if Dogecoin stays above the average lines shown in orange (50-day), blue (100-day) and black (200-day) on the chart, it could mean the upward trend is getting stronger. This would help DOGE not just as a meme coin, but as a solid option in the larger crypto world.In terms of the future, growth potential certainly exists. The breakthrough could indicate a strong continuation of the current trend, given increasing demand and positive sentiment among investors. However, Dogecoin's main fuel is community and social media hype, rather than fundamentals and technical strength.Solana gets squeezedWhen you look at SOL's chart, you can see the symmetrical triangle. It is made by lines that come together and sort of squeeze the price between ascending and descending trendlines. This means that people buying and selling SOL are evening out, and the price is not changing as much.Right now, SOL's price is about $183.74, and it is getting to the pointy end of the triangle. This spot is very important because we expect the price to break out from here. The price has support at around $167.11, where people have bought SOL before to make its price go up. If the price of Solana goes below this, it might drop to around $139.84, but this could also be where it stops falling.The triangle pattern does not tell us if the price will go up or down for sure, so staying cautious as advised. If the price breaks out and goes up, it shows that people really want SOL and think positively about it.

Bitcoin miner CleanSpark plunges 10% after $800M share offering

Bitcoin miner CleanSpark plunged 10% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the firm amended its at-the-market (ATM) offering agreement to sell up to $800 million of its stock.CleanSpark initially inked a deal for a $500 million ATM offering with New York investment banking firm H.C.

Did Putin just point fingers at crypto for the terrorist attack? | Cryptopolitan

The aftermath of a terrorist attack is never easy. Least of all when it happens on the global stage with accusations flying faster than I can report them. Recently, Moscow found itself the target of such an attack, leading to a complex web of blame, international intrigue, and a recent notable nod towards cryptocurrency’s role in modern warfare. How did we even get here?Unraveling the ChaosA couple of weeks ago, the tranquility of Moscow was shattered by a brutal terrorist attack that had me clicking on Twitter faster than my Mom turns on me.Initially, ISIS stepped forward, claiming responsibility for the violence. However, things changed dramatically when Russian President Vladimir Putin disclosed that “radical Islamists” were the masterminds behind the devastating event, with a peculiar twist suggesting Ukraine’s involvement. Apparently, the terrorists were paid by Ukraine using, you guessed it, crypto.The assault was a meticulously planned operation. Armed individuals in camouflage burst into Crocus City Hall during a concert, unleashing gunfire on the attendees and igniting a fire that led to the building’s partial destruction and the tragic loss of at least 137 lives.Putin, in a televised discourse, pointed out the historical struggle against the ideology of radical Islamists, emphasizing the incident as possibly another link in the chain of aggression against Russia since 2014, indirectly referring to the neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv. The fact that the assailants attempted to flee to Ukraine post-attack was for sure a big hint.In a curious omission, Putin refrained from discussing the ISIL (ISIS) affiliate’s claim over the attack, despite its repeated assertions and the dissemination of graphic content by ISIL-affiliated media channels validating their involvement. Interesting, huh?Further complicating the narrative, both the United States and France, through their intelligence services, supported the ISIL’s claim, with French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledging the hand of an “ISIL entity” in the barbarism.The Kremlin, through its spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, maintained a cautious ambiguity, steering clear of direct blame and highlighting the confidentiality of intelligence warnings from the U.S. about a potential attack.A Nation in MourningThe aftermath saw a swift judicial response with the detention of eleven individuals linked to the attack. Four of these suspects faced charges in a Moscow court, showing visible signs of physical assault, a grim reminder of Russia’s contentious human rights track record under Putin’s regime.The suspects are set to appear in court. And their ages range from 19 to 32, and last we saw, they all had visible bruises and one individual was barely even conscious, needing medical support just to appear before the judge.Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin vocalized the ongoing nature of the investigation but assured that justice would be merciless for the perpetrators. Echoing him, former President Dmitry Medvedev called for the extermination of those responsible.The attack not only caused significant loss of life but also left over 180 people injured, with 97 still hospitalized due to their injuries. In the wake of it, Moscow has heightened its security measures, particularly in public spaces like shopping malls, which have seen at least ten security alerts leading to evacuations.

Crypto Hackers Siphon Over $300 Million in Q1 2024, Immunefi - DailyCoin


        
Hackers are still running rampant in the crypto industry. 



The crypto industry has so far incurred over $300 million in losses due to hacks and scams. 



Immunefi’s latest report reveals that while losses remain significant, there has been a notable decrease in events compared to last year.
The crypto industry, while brimming with immense potential, is also teeming with hackers and scammers looking for their next victim. This is particularly true now, as many tokens, including Bitcoin, have reached new all-time highs after enduring a two-year bear market. As more investors enter the fray to ride the crypto hype, scammers are also ramping up their methods, siphoning off millions in just the first quarter of this year. Crypto Hacks Run Rampant in the DeFi IndustryThe crypto industry has so far incurred a total of $336 million in losses due to hacks and scams during the first quarter, with nearly half of that capital stolen in January of this year, according to the latest report from Immunefi, a web3 bug bounty and security solution platform.The report reveals that the DeFi industry, boasting over $100 billion in total value locked (TVL), remains a lucrative hunting ground for scammers and hackers, given the wide array of decentralized exchanges. Immunefi notes that the DeFi industry accounted for 100% of the exploits identified by the web3 bug bounty platform in Q1, compared to zero for CeFi platforms. The Main Culprit? Crypto HackersImmunefi also detailed that hacks continued to be the predominant cause of losses at 95.6%, in contrast to fraud, which only accounted for 4.4% of the total losses. The two most targeted chains in Q1 2024 were Ethereum and BNB Chain. Ethereum suffered the most individual attacks with 33 incidents, followed by BNB Chain with 14 incidents, and Arbitrum with 6 incidents.A majority of the losses were incurred by two projects alone, accounting for a combined $144.5 million, or 43%, of the total. An $81.7 million exploit of the cross-chain bridge protocol Orbit Bridge, occurring during New Year’s celebrations, represented the largest attack. January witnessed the highest monthly losses in Q1 overall at $133 million.
The recent $62 million exploit of the Blast-based NFT game Munchables added to the total losses, marking the second-largest attack.Nevertheless, while scammers have been actively filling their pockets with users’ funds, the industry has since implemented measures to recover these funds.A Recovery From Crypto Hacks and ScamsImmunefi reports that over $73.9 million, or 22% of the total funds in Q1, were recovered from seven exploits. A significant portion came from the Munchables hack, with the NFT game recovering over $62 million from the exploit.
The web3 bug bounty platform also noted that the number of attacks, in contrast to last year, has also dropped a significant amount from 74 in Q1 2023 to 61 in Q1 this year, a 17.6% drop. Additionally, the $336.3 million in losses this year represents a 23% decrease compared to last year’s $437 million in the same quarter. Not Users But Platforms to BlameAnother interesting finding Immunefi reported is that most of the losses weren’t due to user error, such as clicking on shady links or participating in unnecessary rug pulls. Instead, the ecosystem suffered due to protocol infrastructure lacking the necessary strength to counteract hacks.Immunefi founder and CEO Mitchell Amador emphasized. “The ecosystem witnessed a considerable volume of losses due to private key compromises, emphasizing the critical need to secure both code and protocol infrastructure.”On the Flipside
Crypto users lost a total of ​​$1.8 billion to hacks in 2023. 



This year Tether implemented a wallet-freezing policy enabling the freezing of USDT obtained through illicit means. The stablecoin issuer has averted several hacks this year with this feature. 
Why This MattersImmunefi’s latest report serves as a stark reminder that hackers remain active in their pursuit of illicitly gaining funds, showing no signs of slowing down. Therefore, users should take proactive measures to protect themselves and exercise due diligence.Learn more about the ASI alliance:What is ASI?

PEPE whale shifts 2.7T tokens; Should you panic? Well... - AMBCrypto



Withdrawals from exchanges outpaced deposits.
Money flow was low and could hinder a quick pump.

On the 27th of March, a whale transferred Pepe [PEPE], valued at $21.10 million from the KuCoin exchange. According to Whale Alert, this value was equivalent to 2.63 trillion tokens. Moments after the transaction, the price of PEPE dropped.
At press time, PEPE’s price was $0.000007, representing a 1.12% increase in the last hours. But before that, the value of the token declined to $0.000073, indicating that the memecoin felt the impact of the transfer.
However, on-chain data AMBCrypto analyzed showed that significant respite. To do this, we checked the exchange inflow and outflow.
From the information we got, exchange inflow was 22.11 billion. For the uninitiated, this metric tracks the number of tokens sent from external sources to exchanges.
Source: Santiment
Price set to be stable
On the other hand, exchange outflow gauges the number flowing out of exchanges. As of this writing, the metric was higher at 88.30 billion. The difference between the metrics suggests that more participants withdrew PEPE to hold for the long term than those cashing out.
Should this remain the case as we head into the weekend, PEPE might stabilize. There is also a possibility that the value of the cryptocurrency might increase toward $0.0000081 in the short term.
At press time, the Bollinger Bands (BB) showed that volatility around PEP has begun to increase. From a bullish perspective, high volatility and buying pressure could send the price toward $0.0000085.
However, if bulls fail to provide the much-needed strength, PEPE might decline to $0.0000073. Indications from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed that the reading was about to cross the neutral area.
A further increase in the RSI might validate the bullish bias and suggest that buying momentum has increased. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) showed that lots of capital has not flowed into PEPE yet.
Source: TradingView
No more selling pressure
With position, bulls were not yet armed with the right liquidity to trigger a significant jump. Hence, the price of the token might swing sideways for a while before the predicted rally comes into play.
Concerning social dominance, AMBCrypto observed that the metric dropped. The decline in the metric, suggests that discussions around PEPE have decreased.
The social dominance decrease is a positive sign when placed with the price action, as it could imply that the value was close to its bottom. Another indicator we analyzed was the annual inflation rate.
On the 27th of March, the annual inflation rate jumped, indicating that sellers were “dealing” with PEPE. However, the metric declined at press time, suggesting that the selling pressure on the token had reduced.

Read Pepe’s [PEPE] Price Prediction 2024-2025

Moving on, PEPE might experience a surge soon. However, market participants might need to watch out for changes in the market.
Should sentiment flip bearish, the potential increase might be invalidated.

Analyst Jason Pizzino Predicts Bitcoin Price Targets and Potential Spurring of 2024 Altseason - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is updating his outlook on Bitcoin’s (BTC) path forward in the ongoing bull market cycle.
In a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 320,000 YouTube subscribers that he is closely watching to see if Bitcoin will hit key price targets to the upside, which could lead to a six-figure value.










“Looking at some price targets. $72,500, get past that, obviously the all-time high at $74,000. My next two targets are $78,500. That one is based on this level here: we’ve got our extension tool from the weekly swing, so the low of the ETF (exchange-traded fund) [launch in January] to the top, projected off the current low, and 50% comes in at $78,400. Now the 100% is at $81,000. 
That $81,000 comes from the entire move, that was the previous entire bull market from the low at $3,000 to the top at $69,000 projected from this low here at around $15,500…
And that’s why I’ve got here roughly $78,000 to $82,000. Should it run a little higher, doesn’t matter. That’s pretty much that price range that we’re looking for for the next move.”
Source: Jason Pizzino/X
Looking at his chart, the trader suggests if Bitcoin can flip $82,000 into support the next targets to the upside are $87,000, $96,000 and $113,600. The trader also believes that a Bitcoin rally to the $78,000 level could ignite altcoins to put up massive gains.
“Bitcoin does need to get above that $78,000 and start to consolidate above the $82,000 should it have the potential to get to those higher numbers, your $90,000s, your $100,000s. The reason being, if it gets stopped at this level here, $78,400, that would be 50% of this weekly range [from $39,000 in January] which could then send the price back down. 
We’ve obviously got plenty of time to go from there. There is still about 11% to get to that $78,000. And in the meantime, that could also spur on your altcoin season.”
Bitcoin is trading for $69,369 at time of writing, down more than 1% in the last 24 hours.

What’s Next for Ethereum NFT Game ‘Parallel’ and Solana's ‘Colony’ After $35 Million Raise - Decrypt

Parallel Studios, the startup behind Ethereum NFT card-battler Parallel, announced late Wednesday that it has raised $35 million in fresh funding from a bevy of major firms around the crypto world and numerous well-known angel investors.The list includes investment management giant VanEck, Solana Ventures, the Base Ecosystem Fund, Collab + Currency, and The Spartan Group, while the list of angels features Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, Pudgy Penguins owner and CEO Luca Netz, and Yield Guild Games co-founder Gabby Dizon, among others.Parallel previously raised $50 million from Paradigm in 2021 at what the studio then said was a $500 million valuation. The company did not disclose an updated valuation or the format of the latest funding round.However, Parallel Studios did share some details with Decrypt’s GG on how it plans to utilize the $35 million infusion, along with more clarity on what’s ahead not only for Parallel—GG’s 2023 game of the year—but also the recently unveiled AI-powered Colony game that it’s building on Solana.The fundraise comes just weeks after Parallel opened up to the public in a free-to-play beta. A studio representative said that Parallel Studios aims to “start onboarding a ton more users” by expanding its recent Parallel Ambassadors program and working more with influencers broadly, as well as through paid advertising in various markets worldwide.Furthermore, they aim to roll out some significant moves in the coming months, including launches on the Epic Games Store and Steam, and the impending in-game launch of the Planetfall expansion. They said that mobile versions are also on the roadmap and that it’s a “key area of interest,” but that no timeline has been finalized there.The rep added that Parallel is already seeing 10 times the website signups recently than in January before the open beta debuted and that it just had its best-ever tally for daily active users. The team says it plans to share such data more openly in the near future once it can better validate the measured stats.And then there’s the studio’s other major focus, Colony. After plenty of teases, Parallel Studios recently launched an extensive whitepaper detailing the generative AI powered “survival simulation” game, which will utilize the Solana blockchain—instead of Ethereum and scaling network Base, as seen with Parallel.As noted above, Solana Ventures took part in the latest funding round, and two of the network’s prominent co-founders were counted among the backers too.Parallel Studios aims to get a beta version out to the public by the end of the year, echoing the target noted in the whitepaper. Funding will also help further development on Wayfinder, the on-chain AI protocol that will power Colony and potential other apps and games ahead.“Wayfinder is a new artificial intelligence (AI) focused omni-chain tool enabling user-owned, autonomous AI agents to securely and efficiently navigate within and across blockchain ecosystems and applications while independently transacting assets they control via dedicated Web3 wallets,” the protocol whitepaper reads.A pre-alpha version of Colony has already been tested, but the studio says that it will utilize investment funds to help ramp up the development of the game and launch additional tests beginning this summer. The representative said that Parallel Studios is “moving very, very quickly to hire more people on the Colony side” to reach those goals.PRIME, the Ethereum-based token of Parallel that will also be bridged to Solana for use in Colony, is up 12% over the last day to a current price of about $23.30 since the funding news was announced. The token has been on a hot streak lately, up 63% over the last 30 days. It set a new all-time high price of $28.00 on March 18 following the latest Colony reveal.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Sam Bankman-Fried might get early release, suggest legal experts - Crypto Briefing




Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), founder of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX, recently received a 25-year prison sentence for crypto fraud. This sentence is far less than the 40-year minimum prosecutors sought and the 110-year maximum suggested by sentencing guidelines. Legal experts said SBF might serve even less time with good behavior.James Murphy, a renowned crypto lawyer, outlined possible next steps in the SBF case. According to him, SBF’s team will appeal the conviction and sentence as part of its legal strategy.Murphy’s point came after SBF’s legal team confirmed plans to file appeals against both the guilty verdict and the sentence on fraud and money laundering charges in today’s court.Murphy also suggested that supporters of SBF, particularly those involved in Effective Altruism, might lobby the Biden administration for a pardon or commutation. He added that SBF could be released early under federal “good time credit” policies.In the federal prison system, inmates are typically required to serve 85% of their sentence before being eligible for release. This is known as “good time credit,” designed to incentivize good behavior and reduce recidivism.Sharing Murphy’s viewpoint, Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor, told CNN that SBF’s good time credit could significantly reduce his actual time served.
“There is no possibility of parole in federal criminal cases, but Bankman-Fried can still shave time off his 25-year sentence with good behavior,” stated Epner. “SBF may serve as little as 12.5 years, if he gets all of the jailhouse credit available to him.”
Still, the appeal’s success, any potential lobbying efforts, and SBF’s actual prison time are all uncertain at this point.FTX’s saga of lies and fraud has reached a turning point as Sam Bankman-Fried received a 25-year prison sentence in Manhattan federal court for crypto fraud on Thursday. Judge also ordered a forfeiture of $11.02 billion and recommended medium-security for SBF’s federal prison term.SBF’s inner circle, including Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh, and Ryan Salame were previously convicted for their roles in the FTX saga. Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, is expected to face sentence on May 1, as reported by Bloomberg.

April Altcoins Analysis: Noteworthy Tokens and Trends


Amidst a bustling altcoin season, April unveils potential for five standout tokens. Bonk emerges as a leading Solana memecoin, while Jupiter eyes gain within Solana’s ecosystem surge. Pyth solidifies its status with robust live price infrastructure and strategic partnerships. Fetch.ai makes waves by merging with two other AI tokens, reshaping its trajectory. 
Meanwhile, Ondo’s recent surge hints at growing momentum, fueled by a strengthening narrative. With bullish sentiment pervading the market, these altcoins signify diverse opportunities within the crypto space, promising exciting developments in altcoin prices and trends throughout the month.
The Bullish Case For BONK

Price: $0.0000274
Market Cap: $1.78B
Rank: #69

BONK is now one of the biggest memecoins in crypto. It’s currently just behind dogwifhat in the Solana ecosystem. BONK grew 84% in 2024. However, compared with other memecoins counterparts, it’s year-to-date (YTD) growth was surpassed by all the top 6 memecoins in the market today.

From that point of view, BONK could be seen as undervalued. Today, as the second biggest memecoin on Solana, it has a market cap of $1.78B. However, the second biggest memecoin in Ethereum, which is PEPE, has a market cap of $3.38B. This indicates that if Solana continues to attract attention from memecoin traders, BONK could continue its escalation.

Bitcoin Difficulty Drops: Halving Making Miners Hesitant?


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin difficulty has seen a drop in the latest network adjustment, suggesting the miners have stopped their expansion.
Bitcoin Difficulty Drops 1% As Hashrate Remains Flat
The “difficulty” is an in-built feature of the Bitcoin network that controls how hard the miners would find it to find blocks on the chain right now. This feature exists because the BTC blockchain intends to keep its “block production rate” at a constant rate.
The block production rate refers to the rate at which miners find blocks on the network. As compensation for solving these blocks, the miners receive block rewards.

These rewards serve as the only way to mint more of the cryptocurrency, so the rate at which they are given out equals the production rate of the cryptocurrency itself.
By nature, their BTC value remains fixed (except for during halvings), so the production rate of the asset is directly dependent on the speed at which miners can go through blocks.
When the miners increase their total computing power (known as the “hashrate“), they become faster at their task and produce blocks faster, thus raising the production rate of the asset.
This is problematic, however, as it means that these chain validators can go through the unmined supply faster and faster, and continuously flood the market with tokens.
Demand-supply dynamics would suggest that such inflation can be disastrous for the value of the asset. And indeed, Satoshi, the creator of the digital asset, recognized this issue.
As mentioned before, the difficulty exists to keep the block production rate constant. This is the solution Satoshi came up with: by controlling how hard miners would find it to mine blocks, the speed boost owing to greater computing power can be negated.
Approximately every 14 days, the network adjusts its difficulty based on the average block time that the blockchain has observed since the previous adjustment. The Bitcoin network aims to keep this value at around a standard rate of 10 mins per block.
The latest such adjustment has occurred during the past day and has resulted in a reduction of difficulty.

From the chart, it’s visible that although the Bitcoin difficulty has gone down, the reduction has only been slight: under 1%. This means that the average block time has recently been just a bit less than the 10 minutes per block target.
Earlier, the difficulty had been riding an uptrend and setting new all-time highs, as the miners had been constantly expanding their hashrate.

Looks like the 7-day average value of the indicator has sharply gone up over the past year | Source: Blockchain.com
The indicator has declined a bit recently, though, which is why the difficulty has gone down. It’s unclear right now whether this means that the miners are putting their expansion on hold for now or not.
Next month, Bitcoin is set to see a big event that will drastically change the economics of mining: the halving. Halvings are periodic events coded into the BTC blockchain that permanently slash the block rewards in half.
These events go off after every 210,000 blocks or approximately every four years. The block rewards make up for the majority of the miners’ revenues, so these rewards being cut in half would naturally be quite significant for the miners’ bottom line.

It’s possible that some miners may not see it worth adding more hashrate now, as the halving may well make it unprofitable for them. Though, the bigger factor in the slowdown of the hashrate may be the fact that the BTC price has also slowed down since setting its new all-time high.
The block rewards obviously go up in value along with the BTC price, so a fresh uptrend in the coming days could encourage some miners to bet more and get new hashrate online, as it has always happened in history.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $70,800, up over 6% in the last seven days.

(Source: CoinGecko)South Korean Judges Make First Crypto Disclosures – the Details
A long-running scandal dubbed Coin Gate by the South Korean media broke last year. This initially centered on a lawmaker who reportedly sold coins after receiving insider information on forthcoming regulatory changes.Since then, the scope of the scandal has expanded to other lawmakers. It has also expanded to senior civil servants and leading judiciary members.This led the Supreme Court to rule that senior judges must make annual public declarations of their coin and other asset holdings to avoid possible conflicts of interest.Judges’ declarations must also include spouses’ holdings. They must also include details of wallets held in their children’s names.Cheongju District Court Chief Justice Lim Byeong-ryeol reported the most sizeable Bitcoin holdings. Lim and his family declared holding BTC 9.92, with BTC 3.38 in wallets under his name.Lim’s spouse and eldest son hold the remaining BTC 6.54 in wallets in their names.Lim’s spouse and son also reported holding smaller amounts of altcoins “such as Ethereum, Solana, and XRP” in private wallets.Documents show that Seoul High Court Chief Justice Hwang Byeong-ha’s dependents also reported holding BTC 2.07.Another Seoul High Court Chief Judge, Kim Bok-hyung, revealed crypto holdings worth some $2,200.Meanwhile, Seoul Bankruptcy Court Chief Justice Ahn Byeong-wook and National Court Administration Deputy Director Bae Hyeong-won also revealed that wallets in their children’s name “also contained crypto holdings.”The children of Supreme Court Justices Roh Tae-ak, Kwon Young-jun, and Shin Sook-hee also reported that they own cryptoassets, Joongang Ilbo reported.Judges Hold Unlisted Stocks, Crypto, and Overseas Shares
Judges were also obliged to reveal their total assets, with data showing that several judges hold unlisted domestic stocks, as well as overseas stocks.Senior South Korean judges seemed particularly keen on blue-chip US stocks. Several declared holding shares in companies like Amazon, Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia.Earlier this month, a South Korean law firm operator was sent to jail for stealing clients’ money to spend on private crypto investments.

Business Concerns Rising: DeFi Vulnerabilities and Scams Revealed in Q1 | Cryptopolitan

Driving Cats NFT Club Pre-Sale - Should You Buy DCNC Instead of SHIB, DOGE or PEPE?



                    
The Driving Cats NFT Club pre-sale will be available to all members of the public, and it will get underway at 8:30 AM (GMT) on 29 March.



Many crypto investors have been pouring money into altcoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Pepecoin (PEPE) in search of higher gains than what they’re likely to achieve holding Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH).




While these altcoins can deliver significant returns in the next bull run – potentially over 200% – investing in NFTs during a pre-sale can potentially generate even higher returns, in a much shorter period of time.



One such opportunity that is emerging is the Driving Cats NFT Club (DCNC.)



The pre-sale for the Driving Cats NFT Club will be available to all members of the public, and it will get underway at 8:30 AM (GMT) on 29 March via OpenSea.io.




During the pre-sale, each of the 999 NFTs that make up this collection will be available to buy for just 0.07 ETH (around $240).



Once the public sale starts in mid-April, each NFT will be priced at 0.25 ETH – over four times its price during the pre-sale.



However, as the NFT collection is expected to sell out during the pre-sale, and as most buyers will likely hold onto their NFTs rather than trying to flip them in the secondary market, the price of each NFT could rally much higher than 0.25 ETH.



For early buyers, the Driving Cats NFT Club could be a great investment, potentially delivering much higher returns than if you were to invest in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepecoin (PEPE), Bitcoin (BTC), or Ethereum (ETH.)

Crypto ATMs to resurge once Bitcoin ‘FOMO’ hits full swing, says CEO

Bitcoin ATMs will likely see a global acceleration in installations after the Bitcoin halving, a period when crypto FOMO (fear of missing out) typically hits a fever pitch, according to the boss of a major Bitcoin ATM operator.In 2023, crypto ATM installs had their first-ever yearly decline in a decade, owing to a bear market likely exacerbated by the collapse of several crypto firms. However, Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz notes that 2024 has already started with a bang, with 1,469 crypto ATMs installed in just the first three months, compared to the over 3,000 removed by around the same time in 2023, according to data from CoinATMRadar.“It’s looking really positive that the industry continues to see a lot of growth in kiosk count,” Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz told Cointelegraph.Over 400 ATMs have been installed between March 1 and March 27. Source: CoinATMRadarMintz is now tipping an industry-wide ATM rebound with Bitcoin (BTC) back in swing, which has already twice beaten its all-time high in March.In past bull markets, Mintz noted that “later in the cycle, especially that period of FOMO that starts happening,” is when crypto adoption surges and, with it, brings more customers.“The adoption rate is really helpful because if more people are buying Bitcoin, then a portion of those are likely going to Bitcoin ATMs.”That, however, typically comes later in the cycle and “it’s still pretty early,” according to Mintz.“We aren’t even at the halving yet,” he said, mentioning the event slated for late April when Bitcoin’s mining rewards are cut 50%. “In the past, more of the uptick we’ve seen has been after the halving,” he added. “After the halving is when the price skyrockets the most, and that’s when the FOMO phase starts.”While the ATM count has recently climbed, Mintz claims over the past 18 months, the number of ATM operators has dropped. One of the largest was the 5,000 ATM-strong operator Coin Cloud, which went bankrupt in February 2023.“A lot more of them were struggling and went out of business than was shown publicly,” he said.The drop “happened pretty quickly” after crypto exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022 and took the crypto market with it, he added.Bitcoin Depot’s fourth quarter and full 2023 results released on March 25 saw full-year revenues up 7% year-on-year to $689 million, though net income dropped 54% to $1.6 million. It also bought 900 ATMs to install in the first quarter of 2024 and has plans for 940 ATMs to go live in convenience stores in 24 United States states.According to CoinATMRadar, the Bitcoin ATM operator shares the market with a small number of other operators. The runner-up rival operator Coinflip has just over half that with over 4,200, while Bitstop is third with over 2,500.Spot Bitcoin ETFs are no botherOf the 37,001 crypto ATMs in the world, the United States is home to nearly 83% of them, with over 30,600, per CoinATMRadar.In January, the U.S. also approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which some have hailed as an adoption catalyst for institutions and retail punters looking to get into Bitcoin.Mintz was unshaken by what impact the ETFs could have on Bitcoin ATMs. “We view it as a totally different customer base,” he said.Related: Bitcoin ATM flaw could’ve given hackers ‘total control’“A large portion of our customer base transacts primarily in cash or only in cash because they’re underbanked or unbanked,” he added.On the other hand, Bitcoin ETF buyers are “more high-income individuals with brokerages and brokers.”“[The] vast majority of all of our customers make less than $90,000 to $100,000 a year, so our customer base is not that likely to have a brokerage account or a broker and has not been likely to have just been sitting on the sidelines waiting for [an ETF] when it’s so easy to just buy through a Bitcoin ATM,” Mintz said.Instead, he thinks the ETFs driving Bitcoin’s price higher could mean more ATM usage as Bitcoin adoption climbs.“If adoption increases, we think it likely translates to increased usage of Bitcoin ATMs. So in the grand scheme of things, I think it is way more helpful to us in our industry than it is in terms of impacting us in a negative way.”Big Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?

IMF Report Advocates for Digital Currencies to Boost Financial Inclusion in Pacific Islands



                    
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has highlighted the potential of digital currencies, including stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), to enhance financial inclusion and improve financial services in the Pacific Islands.



 A report released by the IMF on March 25 delves into the impact these digital currencies could have on the economies of these remote and dispersed nations.




The 58-page document crafted by IMF’s senior economists identifies significant challenges for the Pacific Islands, emphasizing the importance of financial services for overcoming poverty and inequality. 



A particular concern for these nations is their heavy reliance on remittances and the detrimental effects of reduced correspondent banking relationships. 



The IMF sees digital currencies as a means to develop payment systems, broaden financial inclusion, and address these banking challenges.




Though the report leans towards the advantages of CBDCs, a preference of the IMF, it doesn’t disregard the role of private stablecoins, specifically those backed by foreign currencies. 



However, it advises against smaller Pacific Island countries issuing their own stablecoins due to the potential lack of regulatory oversight. 



Tether, a well-known private stablecoin, is specifically mentioned within this context.



For countries with their own national currencies and established banking systems, the report suggests a dual-structure CBDC model.

This approach involves the central bank issuing the digital currency while entrusting its operation to private entities. 



On the other hand, for nations without their own currencies, the IMF considers foreign currency-backed stablecoins as a viable option, contingent on strict regulation and supervision.



The report acknowledges that none of the Pacific Island countries currently use private cryptocurrencies or stablecoins officially. 



However, a few, including Fiji, Palau, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, are exploring the possibilities of adopting a CBDC.



The IMF has been a staunch advocate for the adoption of CBDCs globally. In November 2023, its managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, emphasized the importance of the public sector preparing to implement CBDCs. 



She posited that CBDCs could not only replace cash but also serve as a “safe and low-cost alternative” to private money, underlining the IMF’s support for digital currency initiatives as a means to foster financial inclusivity and resilience among the world’s most isolated economies.

Bitcoin Critic Peter Schiff Slams BTC ETF Recommendation Over Gold Assets Despite Record High For Precious Metal - Benzinga

Peter Schiff, a prominent critic of Bitcoin BTC/USD, has expressed his views on the potential of gold outperforming Bitcoin in the upcoming month despite the lack of recommendations for gold ETFs on CNBC’s Fast Money.What Happened: On Tuesday, Schiff took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice his thoughts on the recent investment advice given on CNBCFastMoney. Despite the record-high close for gold, none of the crew members recommended buying a gold ETF or any gold mining stock. Instead, one member suggested buying one of the new Bitcoin ETFs.See Also: Dogecoin’s GigaWallet To Simplify Integration Of Transactions Across Platforms: ‘Beginning Of A Strong Bullish Move,’ Says TraderSchiff, being a known proponent of gold, has expressed his skepticism about the quality of US growth and has often highlighted the contrasting performances of gold and Bitcoin. He has critically observed the divergent paths of gold and Bitcoin ETFs’ performances despite both hitting record highs.Bitcoin has appreciated over 67% since 2024 began, hitting an all-time high of $73,750.07 on March 14. In contrast, spot gold has risen 8.25% in a similar period.Why It Matters: Schiff’s stance comes amid the cooling of the crypto rally and his consistent criticism of Bitcoin. His skepticism towards the apex cryptocurrency has been evident in his past statements and tweets. Despite expressing a twinge of regret for not purchasing Bitcoin back in 2010, Schiff has remained a staunch advocate of gold.He has repeatedly warned about the potential credit bubble in the US economy, citing data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and has been critical of CNBC for consistently highlighting the positive gains of Bitcoin while often overlooking its declines.Schiff’s prediction for April comes at a time when Bitcoin ETFs have experienced their worst day since going public, whereas gold ETFs have continued to close at record highs. As Schiff suggests, this divergence in performance might be a sign of potential trouble ahead for Bitcoin and its ETFs.Price Action: At the time of writing, the price of BTC was $70,871, up 0.10% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro. On the other hand, spot gold was seen trading 1.72% higher at $2,232.37.Read Next: Here’s How Much $100 In Bitcoin Could Be Worth In 2030 If Cathie Wood’s New Price Target Is ReachedPeter Schiff Wikimedia Commons

Copper's Sushi Event Sparks Controversy and Prompts Internal Review | Cryptopolitan

In a recent turn of events that has stirred the fintech and cryptocurrency sectors, Copper, a prominent crypto custody firm, has found itself at the center of controversy following a sushi event that has been widely criticized for its insensitivity and lack of judgment. The event, which involved serving sushi on the bodies of models clad in thin bodysuits, has led Copper to issue a public apology and announce the initiation of an internal review to reassess its event approval and sponsorship processes.Public outcry and apologyThe event, hosted at the luxurious Mandrake hotel in London, was intended to be an immersive experience that engaged all five senses, according to promotional materials. However, the execution, which involved the use of human bodies as serving platters for sushi, sparked immediate backlash from attendees and the wider public. Critics condemned the event as objectifying and demeaning, arguing that it did not align with the professional and ethical standards expected of corporate events, especially within the progressive tech and financial sectors.In response to the growing criticism, Copper released a statement expressing regret over the incident. “We did not get this right,” the firm admitted, acknowledging the offense caused by certain aspects of the event. The statement emphasized that the controversial event did not reflect Copper’s corporate values, highlighting the company’s commitment to conducting an internal review. The review will focus on the processes for approving events and sponsorship arrangements, as well as evaluating the overall value and impact of such events on the company’s reputation and ethos.Copper’s internal review and future measuresCopper’s decision to launch an internal review signifies a crucial step towards addressing the fallout from the event and preventing similar incidents in the future. The review aims to scrutinize the existing protocols for event approval and sponsorship, ensuring they align with the company’s values and the expectations of its clients and the broader community. Copper, chaired by former UK chancellor Lord Philip Hammond and founded in 2018, serves a sophisticated clientele, including hedge funds, trading houses, and institutional investors. Despite its prominence in the crypto custody space, the firm has yet to secure regulatory approval from the Financial Conduct Authority, adding another layer of complexity to its operational challenges.The firm also indicated that a third party had organized the controversial event, suggesting a possible oversight or misalignment in the vetting process for external partners and event organizers. The revelation underscores the importance of stringent due diligence and alignment of values when outsourcing event management, especially for events that are intended to represent the company and its brand.Reflecting on corporate values and industry standardsThe incident has sparked a broader discussion within the fintech and cryptocurrency industries about corporate responsibility, ethical standards, and the importance of aligning company actions with stated values. As companies in these sectors strive to innovate and push boundaries, the Copper sushi event serves as a reminder of the need for sensitivity, inclusivity, and respect in all aspects of corporate conduct.Copper’s public apology and commitment to an internal review have been received as positive first steps towards rectification and accountability. However, the effectiveness of these measures will ultimately be judged by the firm’s ability to implement meaningful changes and ensure that future events and partnerships reflect its corporate values and respect for individuals.The controversy also highlights the evolving expectations of corporate behavior, especially in industries that are at the forefront of technological and financial innovation. As companies navigate the complexities of growth, innovation, and public scrutiny, the Copper incident serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of ethical considerations and the potential repercussions of oversight or misjudgment in corporate events and sponsorships.ConclusionCopper’s experience with the sushi event debacle underscores the delicate balance between innovative event planning and the maintenance of ethical standards and corporate values. As the firm embarks on its internal review and seeks to rebuild its reputation, the broader industry will be watching closely, potentially taking cues on how to better align corporate actions with the values they profess to uphold.

This Is Why Optimism (OP) Price Could Rally by 26%


Optimism (OP) price is prime for the picking since the broader market cues and investors’ behavior are signaling a buy signal.
The question remains: will OP generate more profits than it has since the beginning of the year, or will it be stopped mid-way?
Optimism Among Investors Is High
Although the beginning of the month was bleak for Optimism price, the altcoin found its footing in the last few days. This was the result of an increase in participation from OP holders. This is evident from the surge in active addresses, which has grown by over 30% in the last 24 hours.

Along with the increased activity of investors on the network and the decline in price, Optimism is exhibiting a buy signal. According to the price daily active addresses (DAA) divergence, OP is a good asset to accumulate at the moment.

Read More: What Is Optimism?
Price-Daily Active Addresses (DAA) Divergence occurs when a cryptocurrency’s price and the number of daily active addresses show contrasting trends, indicating potential discrepancies between market valuation and actual network usage or adoption. When the price goes down and participation increases, a buy signal is flashed, and vice versa.

Thus, if Optimism holders move to add OP to their wallets, the price could see a surge.

OP Price Prediction: Profits on the Way
Optimism’s price is presently trading at $3.72 after failing to breach the resistance marked at $3.99. Crossing this barrier would enable OP to reclaim $4.00 as a support floor, which will enable a rise towards $4.69, marking a new year-to-date high as well as a 26% rally.
Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicate potential bullishness. RSI measures price momentum, indicating overbought or oversold conditions. MACD, on the other hand, is a trend-following indicator showing the relationship between two moving averages, signaling potential buy/sell opportunities.

At the moment, both indicators are at the cusp of a bullish reversal, which would support the anticipated 26% rally.

However, should OP fail to breach $4.00, Optimism’s price could note a decline of $3.42 losing, which would push the altcoin below $3.00, invalidating the bullish thesis.

Mystery malware targets Call of Duty cheaters, stealing their Bitcoin

A new flood of mystery malware has reportedly been targeting video gamers and draining their Bitcoin (BTC) wallets as part of a new info stealer campaign, which also has been targeting cheaters. Malware information repository vx-underground said in a March 28 X post it was aware of a “currently unidentified Threat Actor” using malware to steal login and other credentials of those using pay-to-cheat video game software.The attacks target players, including those who buy cheating software, and have compromised over 4.9 million accounts for Activision Blizzard users and its game store Battle.net along with accounts for a game-focused trading site Elite PVPers and cheat software markets PhantomOverlay and UnknownCheats.“Impacted users have begun reporting being victims of crypto-draining — their Electrum BTC wallets have been drained. We do not have any information on the amount of money stolen,” vx-underground wrote.Source: vx-undergroundIn a March 27 Telegram post, PhantomOverlay claimed the number of hacked accounts “are inflated” as over half of the logins in a database it viewed “are invalid garbage.”It added the malware “seems to be an entire network of free/cheap software” that has originated from “some latency program, VPN, or something that millions of gamers are using.”“It’s the largest infostealer malware campaign in gaming/cheating community history.”In a separate post, PhantomOverlay claimed it has “a pretty good idea of where the malware is coming from but the malware gang is aware of suspicions on them [and] has made it increasingly hard to prove anything.”Activision Blizzard had contacted the cheat-selling site and “will help us assist millions of infected users,” PhantomOverlay said.An Activision Blizzard spokesperson told Cointelegraph it was aware of claims that credentials “across the broader industry could be compromised from malware from downloading or using unauthorized software.”Related: Prisma Finance exploited in $10 million breachIt said its servers “remain secure and uncompromised” and recommended users change their password if they want to ensure their accounts are protected.In its post, vx-underground wrote that PhantomOverlay was “alerted of fraudulent activity when user accounts began making unauthorized purchases.”PhantomOverlay contacted the alleged victim, and since then, more have been identified, it said.Magazine: Inside Pink Drainer — Security analyst defends his crypto scam franchise

Prisma Finance $11.6M hacker claims it was a ‘whitehat rescue’

The hacker behind the $11.6 million exploit of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Prisma Finance is claiming it was a “whitehat rescue” and is enquiring about returning the funds, according to on-chain messages. “Hi, this is a whitehat rescue, who can I contact to refund,” the exploiter said on March 28, around 6 hours after the attack. The message came from the address “0x2d4…7507a” — which was earlier identified as being one of three addresses linked to the attack. “Please contact us at negotiations@prismafinance.com,” the DeFi firm said in response about two hours later.On-chain messages were sent between Prisma Finance and the hacker. Source: EtherscanA white hat hacker refers to a person who uses their hacking ability to find security vulnerabilities in software code. In the broader cybersecurity world, these security experts often notify the creator of the attack vector rather than exploiting it themselves. However, in the cryptocurrency industry, it is more common for hackers to exploit the protocol and then ask for a white hat bounty in exchange for immunity, though there have also been cases where they’ve returned funds without asking for any reward. The first batch of malicious transactions occurred at 11:29 am UTC on March 28. Prisma Finance is still investigating the root cause of the attack.Blockchain security firm PeckShield estimated about $11.6 million was stolen and sent to three separate addresses.The hacker then started swapping the stolen funds to Ether (ETH), according to blockchain security firm Cyvers. PeckShield later observed about 200 Ether was transferred to OFAC-sanctioned cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash.Prisma Finance engineers have since halted the DeFi protocol.

Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Recapture $0.7 While BTC Tops $70K - DailyCoin


        
Cardano is lagging in its recovery compared to its competitors.



While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have returned to their previous levels, ADA is struggling to reclaim $0.7.



Still, there’s a glimmer of hope on the horizon as indicators point to a potential rally.
Earlier in March, Cardano stole the spotlight after breaking through historical resistances and catapulting to its 2-year high of $0.8, sparking hopes of reaching the highly coveted $1 price level. With just a 20% gain remaining, ADA teetered on the edge of another breakthrough. However, as is often the case, the market quickly turned for the worse when Bitcoin tumbled and triggered chaos in the altcoin market. While many tokens have since bounced back to their previous levels, Cardano has been struggling in its recovery. Cardano’s Slow RecoveryExcitement quickly gave way to disappointment after Cardano experienced a sharp 30% decline in the second half of the month, dropping as low as $0.57. The primary catalyst for this downturn was Bitcoin’s sudden drop from its all-time high of $73,000 to $60,000.Following Bitcoin’s lead, altcoins across the board experienced drops as high as 30%, sparking chaos in the market. However, it wasn’t long until the market recovered, with ADA bouncing back to $0.61 after the Federal Reserve revealed its dovish outlook for 2024. Cardano Price Chart. Source: TradingView.Still, despite the overall market rebound, Cardano’s struggle to reclaim $0.7 raises concerns. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and BNB have returned to their previous levels, ADA is struggling to regain its footing. At press time, Bitcoin exchanged hands for $70,500, Ethereum traded for $3569, and Solana for $188.Adding to the unease is the worrying trajectory of the Cardano-BTC pair as Bitcoin widens the gap with its historic run while ADA lags in its recovery. However, a glimmer of hope looms on the horizon. The last time the Cardano-BTC pair was at this level was in December 2023 when ADA surged by over 100%. ADA All-time High Soon?Except for Cardano, a majority of the top ten tokens are either near their all-time highs or have already reached new highs this year. ADA, in contrast, still has an 80% gain left to cover to reach its all-time high of $3.1.
While it remains uncertain whether ADA will gather enough momentum to surpass even $1, it wouldn’t be wise to underestimate the token. Last year, Cardano surged to become one of the leading gainers in the top 10 tokens, marking a 150% gain.
Considering historical patterns, Cardano is at a pivotal point and could begin its ascent. However, its success hinges on fresh capital rotating from Bitcoin to Cardano. As we navigate the weeks ahead, ADA must first rebuild investor confidence to reclaim its former glory.At press time Cardano traded at $0.65, boasting a daily trading volume of $442 million. On the Flipside
Market dynamics can be unpredictable, so it is essential to consider alternative perspectives and opinions when evaluating the potential future performance of ADA.



ADA’s yearly growth has since fallen to 45% from peaking at 63%. 
Why This MattersCardano’s sluggish growth could become a major concern for market participants, particularly as its competitors are either achieving new all-time highs or nearing them. ADA needs to restore investor confidence in the coming weeks through its price performance before the disparity between itself and its rivals widens too much.Crypto hackers are still running rampant in 2024:Crypto Hackers Siphon Over $300 Million in Q1 2024, ImmunefiLearn more about the ASI Alliance:What is ASI?

SBF memecoins pump and dump as FTX founder gets 25-year prison sentence

Memecoin degenerates have once again put their money on a swathe of questionable tokens — this time amid the historic sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried, which saw him wrapped with a 25-year prison sentence. On March 28, Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to a total of 25 years in prison on seven counts of fraud, making the former CEO the first person from FTX to face prison for the collapse of the exchange in November 2022 — referred to as one of the biggest corporate collapses in United States history.A few hours before Bankman-Fried’s sentence was handed down, however, a developer launched a memecoin dubbed Sam Baseman Fraud — humorously sporting the ticker FTX — on the Coinbase layer-2 network Base. In just seven hours, the FTX memecoin rallied more than 23,300%, with market capitalization peaking to $1.5 million on March 28, per DexScreener data,As many memecoins often do, the token proceeded to sell off harshly, dumping more than 85% within the span of three hours. At the time of publication, the memecoin’s price has leveled out and is trading around the $0.06 mark, still down 60% from all-time highs. Sam Baseman Fraud (FTX) rallied before selling off.

The pair could gain bullish momentum if it settles above the $3,680 resistance zone.

Ethereum Price Eyes Fresh Increase
Ethereum price started another downside correction below the $3,550 zone. ETH retested the $3,450 zone before the bulls appeared, like Bitcoin. A low was formed near $3,459 and the price recently climbed higher.
There was a move above the $3,520 resistance zone. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,680 swing high to the $3,459 low. There was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $3,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.
Ethereum is now trading above $3,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,630 level. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,680 swing high to the $3,459 low.

The next key resistance sits at $3,680, above which the price might gain bullish momentum. In the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $3,800 level. If there is a move above the $3,880 resistance, Ethereum could even climb toward the $3,920 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,000.
Another Decline In ETH?
If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,630 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,540 level.
The first major support is near the $3,480 zone. The next key support could be the $3,450 zone. A clear move below the $3,450 support might send the price toward $3,325. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,250 level.

Vitalik Buterin wants rollups to hit stage 1 decentralization by year-end

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is proposing to raise the bar on what’s considered a rollup in the Ethereum ecosystem — and suggests developers should aim to get their decentralization efforts in order by the end of the year. The comments came in his latest blog post on March 28, reflecting on the year ahead following Ethereum’s latest Dencun upgrade, which significantly reduced transaction fees for rollups on layer 2.Buterin noted that Ethereum was in the “process of a decisive shift” from a “very rapid L1 progress era” to an era where L1 progress will still be very significant.He also said that Ethereum’s scaling efforts have shifted from a “zero-to-one” problem to an incremental problem, as further scaling work will focus on increasing blob capacity and improving rollup efficiency, he said. Source: Vitalik ButerinHe continued to state that the ecosystem’s standards will need to become stricter, adding: “By the end of the year, I think our standards should increase and we should only treat a project as a rollup if it has actually reached at least stage 1.”Stage 1 is Buterin’s classification of layer-2’s decentralization progress, whereby a network has advanced enough in terms of security and scaling but is not yet fully decentralized (which would be stage 2).He observed that only five of the layer-2 projects listed on L2beat are at either stage 1 or 2, and only Arbitrum is fully EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible. The next steps on the roadmap include implementing data availability sampling to increase blob capacity to 16MB per slot, optimizing layer 2 solutions through techniques like data compression, optimistic execution, and improved security.L2 data compression. Source: Vitalik Buterin“After this, we can cautiously move toward stage 2: a world where rollups truly are backed by code, and a security council can only intervene if the code “provably disagrees with itself,” he added. Related: Vitalik Buterin is cooking up a new way to decentralize Ethereum stakingButerin said that further changes such as Verkle trees, single-slot finality, and account abstraction are still significant, “but they are not drastic to the same extent that proof of stake and sharding are.” “In 2022, Ethereum was like a plane replacing its engines mid-flight. In 2023, it was replacing its wings.”Ethereum is currently at “The Surge” phase of its upgrade roadmap with upgrades related to scalability by rollups and data sharding. The next phase, “The Scourge,” will have upgrades related to censorship resistance, decentralization, and protocol risks from MEV.Developers should design applications with a “2020s Ethereum” mindset, embracing layer-2 scaling, privacy, account abstraction, and new forms of community membership proofs, he said before concluding: “Ethereum has upgraded from being ‘just’ a financial ecosystem into a much more thorough independent decentralized tech stack.”Magazine: ‘Account abstraction’ supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide

Top Three Data Privacy Issues Facing AI Today - The Daily Hodl


								
 
AI (artificial intelligence) has caused frenzied excitement among consumers and businesses alike – driven by a passionate belief that LLMs (large language models) and tools like ChatGPT will transform the way we study, work and live.
But just like in the internet’s early days, users are jumping in without considering how their personal data is used – and the impact this could have on their privacy.
There have already been countless examples of data breaches within the AI space. In March 2023, OpenAI temporarily took ChatGPT offline after a ‘significant’ error meant users were able to see the conversation histories of strangers.
That same bug meant the payment information of subscribers – including names, email addresses and partial credit card numbers – were also in the public domain.
In September 2023, a staggering 38 terabytes of Microsoft data was inadvertently leaked by an employee, with cybersecurity experts warning this could have allowed attackers to infiltrate AI models with malicious code.
Researchers have also been able to manipulate AI systems into disclosing confidential records.
In just a few hours, a group called Robust Intelligence was able to solicit personally identifiable information from Nvidia software and bypass safeguards designed to prevent the system from discussing certain topics.
Lessons were learned in all of these scenarios, but each breach powerfully illustrates the challenges that need to be overcome for AI to become a reliable and trusted force in our lives.
Gemini, Google’s chatbot, even admits that all conversations are processed by human reviewers – underlining the lack of transparency in its system.
“Don’t enter anything that you wouldn’t want to be reviewed or used,” says an alert to users warns.
AI is rapidly moving beyond a tool that students use for their homework or tourists rely on for recommendations during a trip to Rome.
It’s increasingly being depended on for sensitive discussions – and fed everything from medical questions to our work schedules.
Because of this, it’s important to take a step back and reflect on the top three data privacy issues facing AI today, and why they matter to all of us.
1. Prompts aren’t private
Tools like ChatGPT memorize past conversations in order to refer back to them later. While this can improve the user experience and help train LLMs, it comes with risk.
If a system is successfully hacked, there’s a real danger of prompts being exposed in a public forum.
Potentially embarrassing details from a user’s history could be leaked, as well as commercially sensitive information when AI is being deployed for work purposes.
As we’ve seen from Google, all submissions can also end up being scrutinized by its development team.
Samsung took action on this in May 2023 when it banned employees from using generative AI tools altogether. That came after an employee uploaded confidential source code to ChatGPT.
The tech giant was concerned that this information would be difficult to retrieve and delete, meaning IP (intellectual property) could end up being distributed to the public at large.
Apple, Verizon and JPMorgan have taken similar action, with reports suggesting Amazon launched a crackdown after responses from ChatGPT bore similarities to its own internal data.
As you can see, the concerns extend beyond what would happen if there’s a data breach but to the prospect that information entered into AI systems could be repurposed and distributed to a wider audience.
Companies like OpenAI are already facing multiple lawsuits amid allegations that their chatbots were trained using copyrighted material.
2. Custom AI models trained by organizations aren’t private
This brings us neatly to our next point – while individuals and corporations can establish their custom LLM models based on their own data sources, they won’t be fully private if they exist within the confines of a platform like ChatGPT.
There’s ultimately no way of knowing whether inputs are being used to train these massive systems – or whether personal information could end up being used in future models.
Like a jigsaw, data points from multiple sources can be brought together to form a comprehensive and worryingly detailed insight into someone’s identity and background.
Major platforms may also fail to offer detailed explanations of how this data is stored and processed, with an inability to opt out of features that a user is uncomfortable with.
Beyond responding to a user’s prompts, AI systems increasingly have the ability to read between the lines and deduce everything from a person’s location to their personality.
In the event of a data breach, dire consequences are possible. Incredibly sophisticated phishing attacks could be orchestrated – and users targeted with information they had confidentially fed into an AI system.
Other potential scenarios include this data being used to assume someone’s identity, whether that’s through applications to open bank accounts or deepfake videos.
Consumers need to remain vigilant even if they don’t use AI themselves. AI is increasingly being used to power surveillance systems and enhance facial recognition technology in public places.
If such infrastructure isn’t established in a truly private environment, the civil liberties and privacy of countless citizens could be infringed without their knowledge.
3. Private data is used to train AI systems
There are concerns that major AI systems have gleaned their intelligence by poring over countless web pages.
Estimates suggest 300 billion words were used to train ChatGPT – that’s 570 gigabytes of data – with books and Wikipedia entries among the datasets.
Algorithms have also been known to depend on social media pages and online comments.
With some of these sources, you could argue that the owners of this information would have had a reasonable expectation of privacy.
But here’s the thing – many of the tools and apps we interact with every day are already heavily influenced by AI – and react to our behaviors.
The Face ID on your iPhone uses AI to track subtle changes in your appearance.
TikTok and Facebook’s AI-powered algorithms make content recommendations based on the clips and posts you’ve viewed in the past.
Voice assistants like Alexa and Siri depend heavily on machine learning, too.
A dizzying constellation of AI startups is out there, and each has a specific purpose. However, some are more transparent than others about how user data is gathered, stored and applied.
This is especially important as AI makes an impact in the field of healthcare – from medical imaging and diagnoses to record-keeping and pharmaceuticals.
Lessons need to be learned from the internet businesses caught up in privacy scandals over recent years.
Flo, a women’s health app, was accused by regulators of sharing intimate details about its users to the likes of Facebook and Google in the 2010s.
Where do we go from here
AI is going to have an indelible impact on all of our lives in the years to come. LLMs are getting better with every passing day, and new use cases continue to emerge.
However, there’s a real risk that regulators will struggle to keep up as the industry moves at breakneck speed.
And that means consumers need to start securing their own data and monitoring how it is used.
Decentralization can play a vital role here and prevent large volumes of data from falling into the hands of major platforms.
DePINs (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) have the potential to ensure everyday users experience the full benefits of AI without their privacy being compromised.
Not only can encrypted prompts deliver far more personalized outcomes, but privacy-preserving LLMs would ensure users have full control of their data at all times – and protection against it being misused.

British Columbia Courts Target Quadriga CX Exec's Wealth Origins


																The province of British Columbia is taking proactive steps in its battle against financial crime, with the latest move targeting Michael Patry, the co-founder of the defunct Canadian largest crypto exchange, Quadriga CX.
Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, announced the filing of a third unexplained wealth order (UWO) with the British Columbia Supreme Court, aimed at seizing assets potentially linked to criminal activity.

If successful, the order could lead to the forfeiture of assets worth $250,200 in cash, 45 gold bars, luxury watches, and expensive jewelry, Farnworth said in the press release dated March 27.
Farnworth also emphasized that the focus isn’t just on flashy assets like gold bars and luxury goods; it’s about disrupting the financial incentives of criminal enterprises.
By targeting ill-gotten gains, authorities aim to strip criminals of their resources and prevent further harm to victims.

“We will continue to take the assets from unlawful activity and redirect the proceeds of crime to much-needed victim services programs and crime prevention initiatives, such as the anti-hate grants to communities announced on Feb. 15, 2024.”

Quadriga CX, once considered Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, experienced a collapse in 2019. The platform shut down its operations and subsequently declared bankruptcy.
The CEO and founder of the company, Gerald William Cotten, mysteriously passed away in 2018 during a trip to India.
Following his demise, it was discovered that he owed around $190 million in crypto to 115,000 customers that either went missing or remained inaccessible, as Cotten was the sole holder of the passwords to offline cold wallets.
In March 2022, Netflix released a documentary named “Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King.”

Should Dogecoin’s upward trajectory persist, these markers will be crucial to watch.Conversely, support levels are found at $0.1888, $0.1699, and $0.1483, which could stabilize any potential downturns.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 77 hints at an overbought condition, suggesting a possible pullback.Additionally, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.1756 reflects the sustained bullish trend.The breach of the upward channel at $0.2190 hints at further potential gains, but the appearance of an inverted hammer pattern warns of a potential correction.Dogecoin Soars on X Platform Speculation and Musk’s Influence
Dogecoin’s price rally to its highest since December 2021 has been underpinned by significant speculation within the community, particularly concerning its integration into the X platform’s payment system.Despite the broader market’s stability, Dogecoin remains sensitive to developments related to Elon Musk’s enterprises, including X and Tesla, driving speculative trading.Recent discussions within the Dogecoin community about X’s payment branch gaining more licenses in the U.S. have sparked expectations of cryptocurrency payment implementations.While Elon Musk previously stated that X Payments’ initial phase wouldn’t feature crypto, the community remains abuzz with anticipation.Conclusion
The current trajectory of Dogecoin is bullish above the $0.2255 mark, with potential for further escalation if it maintains above this level.However, the market must remain cautious of an overbought RSI and the speculative nature of recent price movements.If Dogecoin falls below $0.2255, it could signal a shift towards a bearish correction.Embracing the Future: Dogecoin20 Unleashed

Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: Is $300 Possible After the Bitcoin Halving? (Analyst)


																The host of Coin Bureau, Guy Turner, tells his two million followers on YouTube that SOL might be on a potential 35% – 45% breakout above the $300 mark.
Turner’s bullish outlook is based on promising weekly and monthly charts throughout the beginning of 2024. According to him, SOL is looking “incredibly bullish” on both timeframes, facing stiff resistance at the $300 mark.
Can SOL Reach $300 After the Bitcoin Halving?
The analyst paired SOL against Bitcoin to showcase an even more bullish chart, given that BTC pairs demonstrate an altcoin’s strength.
Moreover, Turner highlighted that the Bitcoin halving is nearing, and the market expects that this event will catapult BTC to new heights.
“Given that Bitcoin’s halving is just around the corner, it’s likely that BTC’s price will rally. That means a 35 to 45% gain in SOL versus BTC would bring it above the $300 milestone.”
Turner emphasized that SOL’s price will be heavily influenced by the development of four upcoming milestones, as per the Solana Foundation’s updated roadmap. These milestones include the release of token extensions, the launch of new validator clients like Firedancer, more institutional support, and developer engagement.




Solana TVL Reaches New ATH
Solana has surpassed $4.6 in total value locked across its diverse ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), according to data from DefiLlama.
The surge comes amid a new inflow of users partially driven by the meme coin mania, of which several Solana-based such tokens have experienced substantial gains through the week.
As CryptoPotato reported, another important reason for Solana’s price and TVL increase can be attributed to the overall bullish sentiment coming from retailers and institutional investors alike.

Grayscale Maintains Optimism for May Approval of Spot Ether ETFs Despite SEC Engagement Concerns



                    
Despite concerns regarding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) engagement level with spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applicants, Grayscale remains optimistic about approval prospects in May. 



Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm, in a recent X post, underscored his confidence, stating, “I don’t think perceived lack of engagement from regulators should be indicative of one outcome or another […] I personally am not deterred by it and believe the ETFs should be approved.”




Salm highlighted that the groundwork laid by the approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs has addressed many issues relevant to spot Ether ETFs, including the mechanics of creation and redemption, asset protection strategies, and custody concerns. 



He suggested that the SEC’s prior engagement in these areas means that there’s less new ground to cover this time, with the exception of the complexities introduced by staking in spot Ether ETF proposals.



Notably, firms such as Ark 21Shares, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, which are looking to include staking features in their ETFs, face additional regulatory scrutiny. 




Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have expressed reservations about the SEC’s apparent disengagement, recently adjusting their approval odds to a “pessimistic 25%.”

Balchunas indicated that the SEC’s stance appears more strategic than procrastinatory.



Nevertheless, the path for spot Ether ETFs seems paved by the recent approval and regulation of Ether Futures ETFs. 



The classification of these products as commodity futures suggests a favorable precedent for spot Ether ETFs, given the historical correlation between futures and spot markets. 



This view is supported by Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal and former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Brian Quintenz.



With several prominent financial institutions, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Hashdex, applying for SEC approval, the decision anticipated by May 23 is keenly awaited. 



The outcome for VanEck’s application on this date is expected to signal the fate of all pending spot Ether ETF proposals.

This brings the amount of Bitcoin held by the nine ETFs to a current worth of $35 billion over just 54 trading days.Source: HODL15CapitalIn total, all U.S. spot Bitcoin funds, including Grayscale, hold 835,000 BTC, which is almost 4% of the entire supply, it noted.

Fidelity and Bitwise saw similar inflows of around $67 million each, while Ark 21Shares saw $27.6 million following a huge inflow of $200 million on Wednesday. Grayscale’s GBTC outflow was $105 million, which is the lowest it has been since March 12. The crypto asset manager has now shed around 284,846 BTC from its GBTC fund since it converted to a spot ETF in mid-January. Related: Spot Bitcoin ETFs regain traction, posting $418M net inflowsIn related news, Bitwise filed an S-1 application with the Securities and Exchange Commission for their spot Ethereum ETF on March 28. Fellow ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reacted to the news stating that his odds for ETH ETF approval in May remain a pessimistic 25% but he could go lower. There are seven weeks until the deadline and the radio silence from SEC is bleak, he added.

XRP Price Holds Support - Indicators Show Risk of Downside Break


                            XRP price is holding gains above the $0.60 zone. The price could gain bearish momentum if there is a close below the $0.570 support zone.

XRP is facing a major hurdle near the $0.6580 zone.
The price is now trading below $0.640 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.640 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could gain bearish momentum if there is a close below the $0.5720 support.

XRP Price Faces Uphill Task
After a steady decline, XRP price found support near the $0.5720 level. A low was formed at $0.5714 and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
There was a move above the $0.5880 and $0.600 resistance levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.7442 swing high to the $0.5714 low. The bulls pushed the price above the $0.620 resistance zone, but the bears are active near $0.640.
Ripple’s token price is now trading above $0.6320 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.640 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.640 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair.

The next key resistance is near $0.6580. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.7442 swing high to the $0.5714 low. A close above the $0.6580 resistance zone could spark a strong increase. The next key resistance is near $0.700. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.700 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.7440 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.800 resistance.
More Losses?
If XRP fails to clear the $0.640 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.600 zone.
The next major support is at $0.5720. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5720 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.5250 support zone.
Technical Indicators
4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.
4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $0.600, $0.5720, and $0.5250.
Major Resistance Levels – $0.640, $0.6580, and $0.700.

Tron Accounts for Nearly Half of Illicit Transactions: Report


According to analytics firm TRM Labs, the Tron blockchain is responsible for a whopping 45% of illegal cryptocurrency transactions in 2023,  the South China Morning Post reports. The blockchain, which is associated with controversial entrepreneur Justin Sun, is becoming increasingly popular with drug traffickers, but Bitcoin still maintains the lead there. Tron has emerged as an increasingly attractive option for criminals due to its speed and low transaction fees. The report states that Tether, the top stablecoin, accounted for more than $19 billion of illegal transactions. Roughly 1.6% of the stablecoin's total volume was linked to criminal activities. The Tron-based USDT token, which was introduced back in March 2019, has now become the primary choice for terrorism financing, according to TRM Labs. As per data provided on Tether's website, Tron-base USDT has a market cap of $54 billion, which makes it the top stablecoin on the blockchain. The Ethereum-based token comes in second place with $49 billion. Tether believes that the volume of illicit transactions that involved its flagship stablecoin has been exaggerated, according to a statement made by the company's spokesperson. A recent UN report has also singled Tron as the preferred choice for bad actors. However, Tron DAO said that such an allegation was inaccurate in its statement, arguing that it is "actively engaging" with blockchain forensics companies. It added that it was "flawed" to assume that we could exercise direct control over those who use the technology.  As reported by U.Today, the Tron founder was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last March.

SBF's Fall From Crypto King to Convict: The $11 Billion FTX Fraud Case | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 28 March 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that Samuel Bankman-Fried (aka “SBF”), a co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the trading firm Alameda Research, had been sentenced to 25 years in prison. The sentence, delivered by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, also includes three years of supervised release and an order for Bankman-Fried to pay $11 billion in forfeiture.



The DOJ’s announcement elaborates on SBF’s misdeeds, detailing how he misappropriated billions of dollars of customer funds deposited with FTX. Furthermore, according to the DOJ, he defrauded investors in FTX of more than $1.7 billion and lenders to Alameda of over $1.3 billion. These actions led to SBF being found guilty of multiple charges, including wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, and money laundering.



According to a report by CoinDesk, in court, SBF’s lawyer, Mark Mukasey, portrayed his client in a compassionate light to Judge Kaplan, emphasizing that SBF’s actions were driven by analytical thinking rather than malicious intent, describing him as an individual guided by logic and mathematics rather than greed or a thirst for power. Highlighting SBF’s personal challenges, including autism and social difficulties, alongside his altruistic values, Mukasey characterized him as an extraordinary individual with a remarkable intellect and work ethic. He appealed to the judge, requesting leniency to preserve SBF’s future prospects, including the chance to start a family, portraying his client as a unique yet fundamentally human figure deserving of compassion.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Attorney General Merrick B. Garland commented on the case, emphasizing the grave consequences of defrauding customers and investors: “Anyone who believes they can hide their financial crimes behind wealth and power, or behind a shiny new thing they claim no one else is smart enough to understand, should think twice.” As for FBI Director Christopher Wray, he said: “Today’s sentencing should serve as a warning to others looking to use fraudulent means for personal gain — there are consequences for your actions.”



U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York also weighed in, characterizing SBF’s actions as one of the largest financial frauds in history: “His deliberate and ongoing lies demonstrated a brazen disregard for customers’ expectations and disrespect for the rule of law, all so that he could secretly use his customers’ money to expand his own power and influence. The scale of his crimes is measured not just by the amount of money that was stolen, but by the extraordinary harm caused to victims, who in some cases had their life savings wiped out overnight.”



Judge Kaplan granted permission for the authorities to allocate the assets obtained via forfeiture to reimburse the victims of Bankman-Fried’s offences.

                        Detained Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan has sued two Nigerian agencies, accusing them of infringing his basic human rights.Local media outlet Premium Times reported Thursday that the suit was filed against the Natural Security Adviser (NSA) and the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on March 18.Meanwhile, Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance’s regional manager for Africa, has also lodged an individual lawsuit for rights enforcement with Justice Ekwo. Anjarwalla, who eluded lawful detention on March 22, is pursuing the same legal remedies as Gambaryan.Binance didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.The lawsuits follow the detention of both executives and the confiscation of their passports in February as part of a wider crypto exchange crackdown in Nigeria. Nigerian authorities alleged that Binance violated local tax regulations by failing to provide proper documentation (VAT invoices) and hindering tax collection from its users.This crackdown was related to Nigerian Naira experiencing frequent depreciation compared to the US dollar.Binance Exec Demands Release and Passport Return in Nigerian Legal Saga
According to Premium Times, Gambaryan (a US citizen) argued that his detention and passport confiscation violated his right to personal liberty enshrined in Articles 35(1) and (4) of the Nigerian Constitution. He petitioned for his immediate release and the return of his passport.He further requested a permanent court order barring the authorities from detaining him in connection with any future investigation or demands related to Binance. Additionally, he sought a public apology from the authorities and compensation for all legal expenses incurred.In a supporting affidavit, Gambaryan clarified that he visited Nigeria on Feb. 26 solely as a Binance representative, attending a meeting requested by the authorities to discuss relevant issues.He further asserted that he neither committed any offense during the meeting, nor received prior written notification of any alleged wrongdoing in Nigeria.Nigerian Court Sets New Hearing Date
During the hearing on Thursday, a senior Nigerian lawyer, TJ Krukrubo, appeared on behalf of both executives, but clarified they lacked official legal representation. He notified the court of a previously submitted withdrawal notice filed for Anjarwalla on March 26.In light of the missing representation, Justice Echo postponed the case until April 8. This adjournment allows the applicants to secure legal counsel and provides the respondents with additional preparation time.

Binance Executives File Lawsuit Against Nigeria’s NSA and EFCC


							

Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan sues Nigeria’s NSA and EFCC for allegedly violating his fundamental rights.



Gambaryan’s colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla also filed a separate lawsuit against the Nigerian authority.



The lawyers requested the court release Binance executives and return their passports.




In a recent update on Binance’s legal tussle with Nigeria, two Binance executives filed a lawsuit against the Nigerian authorities following Nigeria’s decision to arrest the executives. 



According to a recent Reuters report, Tigran Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen and Binance’s head of financial crime compliance, sued Nigeria’s National Security Adviser (NSA) and the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for allegedly violating his fundamental rights.



In the originating motion filed on March 18, Gambaryan’s lawyer, Olujoke Aliyu, sought five reliefs before Justice Inyang Ekwo. The lawyers requested that the court permit Gambaryan’s release from legal custody and retrieve his passport.



In addition, Gambaryan sought a public apology from the NSA and EFCC and an injunction order against the authority’s future investigation.



The lawyers requested the court consider his detention and the seizure of his passport a “violation of his fundamental right to personal liberty” as guaranteed by Nigeria’s constitution. In addition, Binance’s African regional manager, Nadeem Anjarwalla, who fled from custody on March 22, filed a lawsuit separately in court.



These incidents happen on the heels of the Nigerian Department of State Security’s arrest of the two Binance executives in Nigeria’s capital city, Abuja. Following the Nigerian authorities’ finding that Binance Nigeria was allegedly involved in an illicit flow of $26 billion, executives were arrested and their passports seized.



The lawyers further explained Gambaryan and his colleague’s innocence, stating that they were arrested on February 26, when they came to Nigeria on an invitation from the NSA and EFCC to discuss the legal conflicts involving Binance. They added, “The only reason for his detention is because the government is requesting information from Binance and making demands on the company.”

Bitcoin To Skyrocket by Over 110% if History Repeats, Says Hedge Fund Veteran Mark Yusko - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								The co-founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Mark Yusko is doubling down on his prediction that Bitcoin (BTC) will hit a six-figure price over the coming months.
Yusko says in a new CNBC interview that Bitcoin could triple in price from its current fair value or double in price from its post-halving fair value.










According to the veteran hedge funder, Bitcoin’s fair value is estimated based on the number of users and miners or its network effects.
“So we look at the fair value today from the Metcalfe’s Law model… that gives us around $50,000. The halving occurs in three weeks. What a halving does is it cuts the block rewards, the amount of money that’s given to the miners to secure the network. If those rewards were to get cut in half, as they do, many of the miners would struggle. So historically what has happened? The price rises, the fair value rises. So that would push it to $100,000.
But this time it’s a little different in that instead of just block rewards, we get transaction fees because of ordinals and inscriptions. So let’s say the fair value only goes to $75,000 this time. Then post-halving you get a lot of interest in the asset, a lot of people FOMO (fear of missing out) in and we normally go to about two times fair value in the cycle. 
So in the last cycle fair value was $30,000, we got to as high as $69,000. This time, I think probably two times because there’s less leverage. So that gets us to $150,000.”
Bitcoin is trading at $70,882 at time of writing.
According to Yusko, Bitcoin could reach the peak for the bull cycle that will ensue around nine months after the halving.
“So the big move happens post-halving. So the halving occurs sometime between April 20th and April 21st most likely. So once that occurs then you start to get an increase in demand right from the [spot Bitcoin] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other people interested. But the supply of new coins goes from 900 a day to 450.
Well, think about it… if there’s more demand than supply, price has to rise. So the price starts to rise. It starts to become more exponential or parabolic toward the end of the year, and historically, about nine months after the halving. So sometime toward Thanksgiving, Christmas we see the peak in price before the next bear market.”

Analysis Company: "This Asset Could Take Over The Spotlight As Bitcoin Stalls" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Cryptocurrency research firm Wolfe Research suggests that gold could potentially outperform Bitcoin as the Bitcoin price hovers around $70,000.
Both of these assets have traded in sync over the past month, hitting new records even as the U.S. stock market continues to trade near its highest levels.


According to analysts, Bitcoin's trading patterns mirror its own 2021 movements, where it rose to new all-time highs twice before experiencing a significant pullback. “Bitcoin has historically traded more like a ‘risk asset,’ often finding a home for excess liquidity for the retail investor,” said Rob Ginsberg, managing director at Wolfe.
Ginsberg is not predicting a 50% correction like last time, although the similarities with the 2021 model are undeniable. However, he would not be surprised to see Bitcoin continue to hold steady just above $70,000.






On the other hand, according to the analyst, gold may be in a better situation. “Gold and Bitcoin ratio is approaching support while oversold on a weekly basis,” Ginsberg said and added:

“If our views on Bitcoin are correct and it continues to consolidate in the $60,000-$73,000 range, this could provide a good opportunity for gold to start outperforming.”

Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $73,679 on March 14 and fell to around $60,800 last week as traders absorbed the run. Although Ginsberg warned that selling pressure “has historically emerged strongly above $70,000,” BTC has since rebounded to its highs and looks poised to accelerate again.

Can GMT repeat its 70% hike to cross $1? - AMBCrypto



GMT broke out past the resistance zone that rejected the bulls earlier this month.
Metrics reflected a healthy bullish bias, but sustained gains could hinge on Bitcoin breaking out.

Stepn [GMT] posted outsized gains in the past eight days. From 20th March’s low at $0.2506, GMT rallied to $0.445, a move that measured 77.57%. A few hours before press time, GMT prices fell to $0.406 and could dip lower.
Earlier in March, AMBCrypto reported that the on-chain metrics of GMT were healthy, and a bullish run of 70% or more could commence. However, Bitcoin [BTC] fell below $70k and nearly touched $60k just a few days later, dragging GMT prices down by 30%, from $0.3822.
Sentiment was firmly bullish once more

GMT did not rally as expected, but it did show strength during its resurgence. AMBCrypto looked closely at on-chain metrics to see if the token could maintain its bullish momentum.
The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) metric has been in a downtrend throughout January. This was a bullish sign and showed old coins re-entering circulation and rising demand.
The weighted sentiment was also strongly positive, reflective of the recent gains the token saw. The network growth also ticked higher in the second half of March.
The MVRV ratio shot higher alongside prices to reflect holders at a profit. While this was a positive outcome, it could lead to selling pressure in the form of profit-taking activity shortly.
Examining the supply distribution

AMBCrypto analyzed the behavior of wallets holding different brackets of GMT tokens. The smaller holders, encompassing up to 100k GMT, saw a downtrend in March. This was especially pronounced in the 1k-100k GMT holders.
This suggested that holders were taking profits as prices rose.
On the other hand, wallets with 100k-10 million of the tokens made up a greater percentage of the supply distribution in the past three weeks. What it means is possible accumulation from whales.

Realistic or not, here’s GMT’s market cap in BTC’s terms

It is hard to be conclusive with this metric alone, but overall, the health of GMT remained bullish. The sharp BTC correction forced sentiment to sour across the altcoin market.
Perhaps this time favorable conditions will last longer for the bulls.

ERC-7231: Ethereum Community Backs CARV’s NFT Standard for Value Redistribution to Users in the AI Revolution



                    Santa Clara, US, March 28th, 2024, Chainwire


CARV, the modular data layer for gaming and AI, today announces the final approval of ERC-7231 – the protocol that establishes a revolutionary system of data self-sovereignty, empowering users to possess, manage, and contribute their information to both AI systems and data consumers, thereby enabling the equitable sharing of generated value.
Ethereum Community greenlighting the standard is a major step in bridging disparate digital identities and enabling users to own their online history, relationships, and experiences across platforms.
ERC-7231 binds multiple Web2 and Web3 identities to a single non-fungible token (NFT) and achieves encrypted aggregation of multi-domain identity data. The result is an “identity of identities” that enables self-authentication, social overlapping, and commercial value generation from targeted user data.
“At long last, this solution breaks down identity silos, rewrites the rules of data ownership, and lays the foundation for a user-owned internet where individuals can have an equitable share in value distribution,” said CARV Co-Founder Victor Yu.
ERC-7231 offers three important benefits at the dawn of Web3. First, the protocol’s integration with account abstraction wallets makes Web2 and Web3 onboarding (and therefore adoption) easier. Second, uniting multiple identities under one banner enables greater interoperability between different platforms and services. Third, users exercise unprecedented control over their data to decide how it’s used. If they opt to share this data, for example, users can passively earn whenever brands leverage their on-chain and off-chain identity information.
Case in point: CARV ID is integrated with the standard and already empowering users to manage their digital presence across the gaming universe with ease and confidence. More than 900,000 CARV ID holders are playing their favorite games and earning rewards across CARV’s comprehensive ecosystem, which spans from its foundational data stack, its gaming-focused application layer, to the increasing list of games integrated with CARV ID. CARV has also developed an AI Agent in house, where more nuanced data can be scrapped in a privacy-preserving way and attributed to CARV ID. Entities building on CARV’s modular data layer, such as MARBLEX which recently just announced their strategic partnership with CARV, can tap into this rich data source for game and AI development. ERC-7231 is “the key to stringing everything together,” said Yu.
Understanding gamers today is increasingly difficult due to app tracking changes (IDFA) and shifting privacy regulations (CCPA). With ERC-7231, users can not only aggregate, own, and control their identities, but gaming and AI companies can leverage this zero- and first-party data to create customized experiences and more accurately target gamers.

For example, according to the company, improved user acquisition was the aim of Electronic Arts and its latest game, EA Sports FC Tactical, in Indonesia. Utilizing CARV as one of the primary channels for user acquisition, EA recently recruited Indonesian gamers for the beta test at a lower Cost Per Install (CPI) than traditional channels. Better yet, the game can better understand each gamer and their history thanks to ERC-7231’s aggregated data from multiple gaming accounts.
“Backed by this standard, brands can shift and shape their offering with quality and compliant data, and users can share in the value creation from this information. We welcome all user identity solutions to adopt ERC-7231 and usher in a new age of identity-aggregated NFTs,” said Yu.
About CARV
CARV is the largest modular data layer for gaming and AI, revolutionizing how data is used and shared. CARV ensures privacy, ownership, and control are firmly in the hands of individuals and provides gaming and AI development with holistic and high-quality data reinforced with human feedback in a regulatory-compliant, trustless way. To pioneer a future where data generates value for all, CARV has built CARV Protocol, the modular data layer integrated with 40+ chain ecosystems, and CARV Play, its flagship gaming superapp. CARV has more than 2.5 million registered users and 700 integrated games.

Mem Token Wind in the Markets: This Solana-Based Mem Token Outperformed PEPE! Are DOGE and SHIB Next? - Bitcoin Sistemi

While the mem token craze has increased recently, Solana-based mem tokens have come to the fore.
Among the Solana-based mem tokens, Dogwifhat (WIF) is undoubtedly the most notable project, while Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, also listed WIF.


At this point, while WIF has experienced an unstoppable price rise this year, the WIF price exceeded $ 4 today and left PEPE behind, becoming the third largest meme token after DOGE and SHIB, with a market value reaching $ 4 billion.
WIF, which exceeded $ 4 with an increase of more than 230% in the last 24 hours, continues to be traded at $ 3.68 with a 19% increase at the time of writing.





With this increase, WIF topped the list of the most profitable altcoins, followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI).



As WIF continues its unstoppable rally, WIF's largest holding address, 2Fcm…PE6d, made a profit of $134 million (+1440%). This whale started buying WIF in December 2023 at an average purchase price of $0.248.
Analysts stated that despite the tremendous rise in WIF, the data shows that the whale has not started to sell, “which indicates that the upward expectations in WIF continue.” said.





Analysts also stated that they expect the Dogwifhat price to continue to increase and with this increase, the WIF market value will exceed $10 billion in the next few years and WIF will gain the status of a premium meme token.

Kerrisdale Capital on BTC and MSTR: 'Know When to HODL, Know When to FODL' | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent report titled “Long Bitcoin / Short MicroStrategy Inc (MSTR): Know When to HODL, Know When to FODL,” Kerrisdale Capital Management outlines a bold investment strategy. The hedge fund advocates going long on Bitcoin directly while simultaneously shorting shares of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), a publicly traded company known for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation tactics.



Kerrisdale Capital is a hedge fund known for its short-selling investment strategy, where they profit from declines in a company’s stock price. The firm often targets companies they believe are overvalued or have questionable business practices, publishing in-depth research reports to support their short positions. Kerrisdale has a history of attracting controversy due to their aggressive approach and the potential conflict of interest inherent in short-selling activities. Despite this, they have a track record of identifying potential weaknesses in companies across various industries



Kerrisdale argues that MicroStrategy’s stock price implies an inflated Bitcoin valuation of over $177,000 – more than 2.5x the current spot price. They assert that the company’s historical premium over Bitcoin’s actual price is unsustainable. Kerrisdale believes that as more accessible and affordable Bitcoin investment vehicles emerge, such as ETFs and ETPs, MicroStrategy will lose its appeal.



Kerrisdale questions MicroStrategy’s self-proclaimed status as a “Bitcoin development company.” They point out that the core software analytics business represents a tiny fraction of MicroStrategy’s overall value. According to Kerrisdale, the company’s stock price is almost entirely driven by its Bitcoin holdings, which were largely acquired through debt financing and equity-linked offerings.



The report disputes the argument that MicroStrategy’s use of leverage and share dilutions to buy Bitcoin creates superior shareholder value compared to direct Bitcoin ownership. Kerrisdale highlights that while MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings may have increased, the dilution has kept Bitcoin holdings per share relatively stagnant.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Kerrisdale questions other justifications for MicroStrategy’s high premium. They deem the ability to reinvest cash flows from the software business into Bitcoin insignificant, citing minimal free cash flow generation. The lack of management fees in holding MicroStrategy compared to a spot Bitcoin ETF is also dismissed by Kerrisdale, especially considering the substantial premium and the low fees of spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC.



Kerrisdale’s thesis hinges on the expectation that the extreme premium commanded by MicroStrategy shares will return to more historically consistent levels. They note that since early 2021, MicroStrategy’s premium has only exceeded 2.0x on 6% of trading days, with an average of 1.3x. This suggests considerable room for the premium to contract, potentially resulting in a significant decline in MicroStrategy’s share price.



Kerrisdale emphasizes that their investment strategy is not based on a bearish view of Bitcoin or MicroStrategy itself. They are simply wagering on the distortion between the two assets correcting. It’s also crucial to remember that Kerrisdale Capital has both a short position in MicroStrategy and a long position in Bitcoin ETFs, standing to profit if their analysis proves accurate.



On Thursday, a day during which the Bitcoin price was more or less stable, thanks to all the short-selling of the stock, MSTR closed at $1,704.56, down 11.18% (though still up 148.79% for the year-to-date period).

FTX former execs and promotors to settle class lawsuit for $1.3M

Former FTX executives and promotors have come to a nearly $1.36 million settlement with a class action group of the crypto exchange’s former investors seeking compensation for being defrauded.FTX co-founder Zixiao “Gary” Wang, former engineering lead Nishad Singh and sister trading firm Alameda Research ex-CEO Caroline Ellison agreed to cooperate and give information to the lawsuit to resolve the claims against them, according to a March 27 Miami federal court bid seeking the settlements’ approval.Settlements were also reached with seven other influencers and former FTX chief regulatory officer and FTX.US chief compliance officer Daniel Friedberg.The former execs didn’t admit to any of the lawsuit’s allegations, but the class group found the trio’s “knowledge and other information” would be valuable in strengthening its case against others it sued — including celebrities, companies and venture capitalists.A highlighted excerpt of Ellison’s settlement notes her testimony against former boyfriend Sam Bankman-Fried could help the suit — the FTX MDL (multidistrict litigation). Source: PACERWang, Singh and Ellison will turn over — and have already begun sharing — “all non-privileged documents and/or data” they gave when helping prosecutors lock up their old boss Sam Bankman-Fried for 25 years.The three each face their own sentences after pleading guilty to fraud. The class will affirm their cooperation with the court before their sentencing. The former execs will also hand in records used in FTX’s bankruptcy case and make themselves available for depositions and hearings.The settlement agreement further saw the three agree to forfeit their assets for the judge in their criminal case to decide the recovery and distribution of victim funds.They are not to oppose a request from FTX investors that the funds be distributed through the class suit, as opposed to FTX’s proposed bankruptcy paybacks or other lawsuits.A settlement with Friedberg was also reached, with the filings noting he has voluntarily “provided valuable information” to the class group and “has agreed to do so on an ongoing basis.”Related: Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prisonFriedberg’s settlement notes he “did not have knowledge of the FTX fraud,” and after he found out about it, he “immediately resigned” and “promptly contacted the authorities.”Seven YouTubers and influencers also paid to settle the suit, including $180,000 from Brian Jung, $122,000 from Kevin Paffrath, $37,485 from Tom Nash, $10,000 from Graham Stephan, and $5,000 each from Jeremy LeFebvre and Andrei Jikh.Information for American football star William Trevor Lawrence’s settlement wasn’t available, but he seemingly paid $1 million to settle based on the total disclosed relief minus the other agreements’ sums.All named in the settlements were released “from all claims related to any of the alleged conduct giving rise to this litigation.”Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?

Bitcoin Vs. Gold Vs. SPY: Which Asset Class Would've Given Best Returns On $1000 Investment In Q1? - SPDR S&P 500 (ARCA:SPY) - Benzinga

The first quarter of 2024 has turned out to be a blockbuster for most asset classes, and the strong performances have left investors worried about the sustainability of the uptrend.How long will the party last? What are the risks involved in investing in an overbought market? Benzinga collated views from analysts and economists to make sense of the rally so far and zero in on the opportunities that could pay off in the near to medium term.Equity Market — From Shaky Start To Strong Surge: The equity market kicked off the new year with a whimper, with concerns that 2023’s gains might not hold. However, the momentum from last year carried through, quashing skepticism and propelling the market to new highs.Three months in, the S&P 500 Index has notched record highs for both closing and intraday trading. Blue-chip stocks mirrored this performance, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing the quarter at a fresh record. Tech stocks were once again at the forefront, fueled by the AI boom that spurred gains for companies of all sizes. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite couldn’t quite reach its record peak as valuation concerns prompted some profit-taking near the quarter’s end.                               Source: Benzinga The more heartening aspect of the recent rally is that, unlike in 2023 when it was nearly exclusively fueled by tech, this time around, the participation has broadened. LPL Financial‘s Chief Technical Strategist, Adam Turnquist, said in a recent note that the strong uptrend in the S&P 500 Index is supported by broad participation and cyclical leadership. “Improving relative strength in industrials, financials, and materials provides additional evidence of a bullish rotation that has largely been overshadowed by mega-caps and AI enthusiasm,” he said.See Also: Investing In Stocks For BeginnersAI optimism drove much of the upside early in the quarter, with stocks such as Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Microsoft Corp. MSFT — the ones at the forefront of the revolution — clocking strong gains for the year.

Nvidia (+83%)



Constellation Energy Corp. CEG: +58%



Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK: +41%



Micron Technology, Inc. MU: +38%
On the flip side, Tesla, Inc. TSLA and Boeing Co. BA, which were hit by negative headlines (softening EV demand and supply-side bottlenecks; airplane safety concerns), were the worst S&P 500 stocks, shedding 29% and 26%, respectively, for the quarter.Cable telecom company Charter Communications, Inc. CHTR, trading platform provider MarketAxess Holdings Inc. MKTX, and medical and specialty insurance products company Humana, Inc. HUM rounded up the list of worst performers.Gold’s Dazzling Run: Gold rode on the dollar’s weakness as the greenback took a hit from expectations that the Fed is ready to cut the Fed fund rate, which currently hovers at 22-year highs. The yellow metal shares an inverse relation with the dollar as it is denominated in the latter.The precious metal ended the quarter at a record high of $2,254.80 and on an intraday basis, it peaked at $2,256.90 on Thursday.Current LevelQTD Change2023 PerformanceGold futures (Price/troy once)$2,254.80*+8.83%+13.45%*record closing highBitcoin Builds On Gains: The crypto space began to see an accelerated rally in late 2023, and the gains continued into 2024. In the run-up to the spot Bitcoin BTC/USD approval, the space saw solid gains, and the momentum stalled in a typical “sell-the-news” move after the approval came through.

However, inflation and the Federal Reserve’s actions are seen as key drivers for the financial markets.Larry Tentarelli, Chief Technical Strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, shared exclusive comments with Benzinga. He highlighted incoming inflation data, especially the Consumer Price Index and Personal Consumption Expenditure Index, as crucial factors. Additionally, economic data on GDP growth, non-farm payrolls, and 10-year Treasury bond yields will be closely watched to determine the market’s course.Charlie Ripley, Senior Investment Strategist for Allianz Investment Management, agreed with Tentarelli. He emphasized the Federal Reserve’s actions as the most significant influence on the market. “The current stance from the Fed is that they will follow through with 3 rate cuts this year, but sentiment could shift quickly if inflation measures remain sticky and the Fed is forced to stay on hold for longer,” he said. Ripley, however, flagged concentration risk. Any faltering on the earnings front could pose a risk to the rally, he said.Tentarelli said he is very bullish on U.S. large caps, based on easing bond yields and inflation, and the earnings season, which starts in mid-April. The analyst sees further momentum for AI stocks much against fears of a bubble burst. “We are very bullish on the AI stock leaders and think that valuations are very reasonable here,” he said.Tentarelli named Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Arista Networks, Inc. ANET, and Super Micro as his AI stock picks.He is also exceedingly bullish on Bitcoin and expects the apex cryptocurrency to rally past $100,000 by the year-end. The upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected around April 19-20, could be the catalyst driving it higher, although he advised keeping an eye on bond yields.“The one caveat here is for bond yields to not break out over 4.40[%],” he said.Fund manager Louis Navellier said he sees earnings estimate revisions likely to be the main market driver in the near term. He also noted that the next two quarters will have easier comparisons, making the bar manageable to scale. “There is a fear of missing out, you know, with the Nvidia and super microcomputer strength, but there are other hot pockets,” Navellier said, referring to weight-loss drug companies such as Novo Nordisk A/S NVO and Eli Lily & Co. LLY. Among the other stock picks flagged by Navellier were:
Cloud security company CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD and Fortinet, Inc. FTNT



AI names Nvidia and Super Micro



Norwegian provider of browser and mobile browsers Opera Limited OPRA



Homebuilders, particularly Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL

Bitcoin Cash open interest surges past $700M ahead of BCH halving

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trading at $574.84, having jumped 9.06% over the past 24 hours as the second-ever BCH halving event is set to take place next week.Traders appear to be heavily securing their positions in anticipation of the BCH halving, which is scheduled for April 4, according to NiceHash data.On March 28, $190,140 was liquidated in short positions and $211,870 in long positions. On the same day, open interest (OI) in Bitcoin Cash futures perpetual contracts reached all-time highs of $708.75 million, spiking 18.26% in 24 hours and 165% over the past 7 days, as per CoinGlass data.Bitcoin Cash open interest surged to record highs ahead of the halving next week.

Polygon (MATIC) and Immutable X (IMX) Whales See Algotech (ALGT) as Best Presale Opportunity in 2024 After $3M Presale | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $70,000 at the beginning of 2024. This is caused by the upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) halving event. Crypto whales are buying up Bitcoin (BTC) in anticipation of its scarcity doubling. The crypto bull run has left early investors smiling, with top coins and altcoins hitting all-time highs.Despite Bitcoin’s rising prices, large cryptocurrency investors such as Microstrategy are buying Bitcoin (BTC) in large quantities. Other altcoins such as Polygon (MATIC) and Immutable X (IMX) are not far behind. However, the market is currently experiencing a slight correction in the Bitcoin price, which may allow alternative cryptocurrencies to attract some investment capital from these large investors.12-hour downtime on the Polygon (MATIC) network sparks concern among the investorsThe network experienced an outage of 12 hours due to a glitch in the protocol sequencer. This has impacted the zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEM). The outage has made room for speculation about the network’s credibility, reliability, and scalability. Polygon (MATIC) dropped 8% in market value. It is now selling for $1.03 in the crypto market, with a total market cap of $10B, and is ranked 16th. It is celebrated for providing a solution to blockchain’s inherent limitations regarding speed and transaction costs. However, the decreasing value has shifted investors’ interest to other altcoins.Immutable (IMX) Price Slides as Bears Take Over Immutable X is known for its ability to work above limitations like low scalability, poor user experience, and a low developer experience. It helps users with instant trading and massive scalability. However, the IMX token is sliding further into the bear market. Its value has fallen by 20% in the previous month.Moreover, IMX’s market cap is down. Its rising trading volume can trigger a resurgence; however, holders continue to look for alternatives. Some analysts anticipate that IMX will not show a price rally as it has fallen below the $3 support zone.While Polygon (MATIC) and Immutable X (IMX) may make excellent investments, a massive opportunity awaits in the Algotech (ALGT) presale.Algotech Emerges as the Best Presale Opportunity After $3M PresaleAlgotech’s (ALGT) scalable infrastructure and impressive project roadmap can handle real-time issues such as large trade volumes and rapid execution. As demand for advanced trading tools increases, Algotech’s TradFi platform will become more relevant with its advanced technology and cutting-edge use cases.Despite being just weeks into the launch, the project has managed to defy market expectations with a massive $3.2 Million public presale round. Stage 2 of the presale grabbed significant attention after 80 million ALGT tokens were sold out within two weeks, reaching 85,000 unique holders. Algotech uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to help traders with efficiency and precision. It relies on decentralization and AI technologies for real utility, encouraging adoption in DeFi.ALGT token value is anticipated to skyrocket beyond its current $0.06 level as the presale demand heats up. Analysts believe that its value can reach an all-time high of $1 before it gets listed on more exchanges. This makes Algotech the best crypto to buy in 2024. It has also announced a giveaway to celebrate this milestone: $250K in ALGT tokens will be distributed to 10 lucky winners. Learn more:Visit Algotech PresaleJoin The Algotech Community

Logan Paul: "il progetto NFT CryptoZoo non è una truffa"

Logan Paul from the NFT CryptoZoo project, accused of scamming his audience, has returned to assert his version in a new documentary. 

Logan Paul and the new documentary: his version on his NFT project CryptoZoo
Logan Paul, famous YouTuber and WWE fighter, is back in the spotlight with his NFT project CryptoZoo that, in the past, caused investors to lose money. Specifically, Paul once again claims that CryptoZoo is not a scam. 
In a new documentary “5 Months with Logan Paul”, journalist Graham Bensinger met with Paul and, regarding CryptoZoo, stated that Paul’s exposure “has led people to lose money”.
On this subject, here is how Paul responded: 
“Everything you just said has an element of truth. The problem is this. What you just described is not a scam. I took on a project that I simply wasn’t able to handle at that time. […] I didn’t make any money, brother. I lost half a million dollars on this project. Where’s the scam?”.
CryptoZoo was announced 3 years ago, with the launch scheduled for September 2021, but Paul’s NFT project still does not exist. In practice, Paul and his team sold NFTs and released a ZOO token, but the game has never materialized. 
With this documentary, Paul would like to confirm his version that his NFT project was difficult for him to manage, but that it was not a scam to investors. 
Logan Paul and the new documentary about his NFT project CryptoZoo
Continuing with the documentary, Paul also stated that he had suicidal thoughts because of his CryptoZoo project. He felt like he was entering a tunnel, from which he was able to come out.
Another thing that Paul does in the documentary dedicated to him is to promise that he will “take care” of those who have plotted to make it seem like he has set up his scam. 
In this regard, Logan Paul had received a class action, or collective legal action, in February 2023, precisely for the never-happened launch of CryptoZoo.
Not only that, such legal action is of the “rug pull” type, accusing Paul and his team of raising funds for a new token or NFT collection, without keeping the promises made about the benefits and advantages but abandoning the project and keeping the buyers’ funds.
And indeed, the accusations against the defendants speak of trading NFTs to buyers, claiming that they would have received benefits, rewards, and exclusive access to other crypto resources at a later time, as well as the support of an online ecosystem for using and trading NFTs. 
Refund to defrauded investors
After six months from his video in which he outlined his plan to fix things, which was in July 2023, Paul had not yet refunded any of his defrauded investors.
Once again, another unkept promise for the YouTuber, who had announced his three-phase plan to fix things, which was to start refunding.
The latest news on this topic, then, arrived at the beginning of January 2024, when Paul stated that he will “buy back” the CryptoZoo NFTs, but even here there would be a “scam”.
Basically, the program provides that holders of NFTs receive 0.1 ETH for each eligible NFT, but they must also waive any current or future claims against Paul.

Bitcoin to attract $1T from institutions amid ‘raging bull market’ - Bitwise exec

Bitwise chief investment officer Matthew Hougan said institutional investors would likely inject as much as $1 trillion into Bitcoin (BTC) through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as they slowly move into crypto.In a memo sent to investment professionals, Hougan addressed concerns over Bitcoin’s price volatility. As the asset bounces between $60,000 and $70,000, the executive said the best approach would be to “keep calm and take the long view.”Source: BitwiseWhile the price seems unstable in the short term, Hougan noted many key events to look forward to in the coming months and years. These include the Bitcoin halving and the spot Bitcoin ETFs getting approved on national account platforms like Morgan Stanley or Wells Fargo.Furthermore, the executive highlighted that the space has to wait for investment committees and consultants still conducting their formal due diligence on Bitcoin. This is a necessary step they have to take before investing in the asset. Related: Bitcoin Halving: Latest News and Full Coverage by CointelegraphHougan said that while the space waits for these key events, the BTC price would likely “chop sideways” whenever there are small changes in sentiment; however, the investment officer believes things would be different long-term. Hougan wrote: “But long-term, we believe Bitcoin is in a raging bull market. Not only is it up nearly 300% in the past 15 months, but there are strong reasons to think that will continue.”According to Hougan, the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in January opened crypto to investment professionals in a major way. Related: 3 theories why the SEC may be eyeing down Ethereum: Crypto lawyerHe also believes that investment professionals who control trillions of dollars are just starting to move into crypto. Hougan highlighted that onboarding more professional investors would “take years, not months.”The executive also said that the $12 billion flowing into ETFs since their launch is exciting and is “the most successful ETF launch of all time.” However, he believes that once global wealth managers begin to allocate 1% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, this would mean $1 trillion in inflows into the space. “A 1% allocation across the board would mean ~$1 trillion of inflows into the space. Against this, $12 billion is barely a down payment,” he added.Magazine: Ether ETFs face Senate opposition, Wright is not Satoshi, and Dencun goes live: Hodler’s Digest, March 10–16

Support for This Altcoin from Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin! Price Reacted Backwards! - Bitcoin Sistemi


There is no calm on the Worldcoin (WLD) front, which has been at the center of discussions and investigations since its launch.
Worldcoin, which was recently vetoed by Spain and Portugal, received support from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.


At this point, responding to a post about the recent negativities that Worldcoin has faced in Portugal, Buterin said that he believes Worldcoin has done a pretty good job of introducing system design changes in response to privacy criticisms.
Accordingly, Vitalik Buterin once again expressed his appreciation for Worldcoin and said:






“They're actually doing a pretty good job of taking privacy criticisms seriously and designing their systems to be increasingly data minimal. Modern cryptography is truly amazing.”

Vitalik has previously stated that Worldcoin's efforts towards privacy protection are much higher than other centralized authentication solutions.
At the time of writing, WLD price has not yet reacted to Vitalik Buterin's post. WLD, which has dropped around 2% in the last 24 hours, continues to trade at $ 8.35.

Binance exec seeks redress over Nigeria detention, demands apology

Binance’s head of financial crime compliance has asked the Federal High Court in Nigeria to mandate the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to issue an apology to him regarding his detention in the country.According to local reports, Tigran Gambaryan is suing the government for violating his fundamental human rights. Gambaryan’s motion claims that his detention in Nigeria soon after his arrival in February and the confiscation of his passport violates the country’s constitution, which guarantees an individual’s right to personal liberty.In the lawsuit, Gambaryan disclosed that the federal government is using his ongoing detention “as a means to exert pressure and persist in making requests to Binance.” The motion emphasized that Nigeria could communicate with Binance through other channels instead of detaining Gambaryan, who only attended a meeting.Source: Obinna Uchechukwu UzoijeThe financial crime compliance head for Binance also reportedly requested the court to order the immediate return of his passport and the issuance of a public apology. Nadeem Anjarwalla, regional manager of Africa at Binance, detained alongside Gambaryan, also lodged a similar complaint. Anjarwalla reportedly escaped Nigerian detention recently.During the court session, Gambaryan’s attorney informed Justice Inyang Ekwo that their application had been served to the respondents, who still had time to reply. The lawyer requested an adjournment for the ONSA and EFCC to respond. The judge granted the request, postponing the case to April 8.Related: Binance’s Russian successor CommEx to shut down in AprilAmong Nigerian crypto enthusiasts, various theories have risen in a bid to make sense of the situation. An enthusiast, who identifies as Chineduokoli expressed concerns about the possibility of getting proper redress in a Nigerian court.Another individual, Obinna Uchechukwu Uzoije, questioned the delay in the Binance executive’s decision to file a lawsuit against the agencies and speculated whether his colleague’s escape prompted it.Gambaryan, a United States citizen, and Anjarwalla, who holds both British and Kenyan citizenship, purportedly landed in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, on Feb. 25.

What Are Bitcoin Runes? Biggest Update Since Ordinals


								On Thursday, Bitcoin Ordinals founder Casey Rodarmor unveiled the documentation for a new Bitcoin-native digital commodities protocol known as Runes. This groundbreaking update is set to coincide with Bitcoin’s upcoming halving, marking a significant evolution in the Bitcoin protocol’s capabilities for handling digital assets directly on its blockchain.


What Are Bitcoin Runes?
Runes introduce a novel fungible token protocol on Bitcoin, utilizing an indexer-based model that builds upon the social consensus mechanisms first popularized by the Ordinals initiative. This new protocol facilitates the etching, minting, and transferring of Bitcoin-native digital commodities, potentially altering the landscape of how digital assets are created and exchanged on the Bitcoin network.

According to analysis by ren (wassie arc) (@0xren_cf) from Electric Capital, shared via X (formerly Twitter), “The biggest update since Ordinals is coming to BTC at the halvening… RUNES.” Ren’s analysis highlights several key features and improvements that Runes brings to the table:

Simplified Transactions: Unlike the BRC-20 token standard, which requires multiple transactions for deployment, minting, and claiming, Runes streamline these operations into a single transaction.
Extendability and Future Proofing: Runes feature an even-odd field tagging system within their protocol, allowing for future extensions and programmability through soft forks.
Larger Namespace for Tokens: Runes expand the available character space for token names up to 28 characters, compared to BRC-20’s four-character limit.
Security Enhancements: Runes addresses several security concerns, including the prevention of spoofing through the exclusion of Unicode symbols and mitigating the risk of token balance lockup by attackers.
Unique Token Naming: Runes enforces unique naming for tokens, preventing the creation of tokens with duplicate names. “Rune names shorter than 13 characters will be gradually released over a 4 year period after the runes launch to prevent immediate grabbing of the shortest names,” Ren remarked.

One of the most innovative aspects of the Runes protocol is its approach to token issuance and transfer. Utilizing a UTXO-based system, Runes tokens are directly issued into a UTXO during the transaction that sets their initial supply, ticker symbol, and decimal precision. This mechanism not only aligns closely with Bitcoin’s native design principles but also enables more efficient and flexible management of token balances and transfers.

The introduction of Runestones, described as the “precompiles” for Runes, further enhances the protocol’s capabilities. These instructions, stored within the OP_RETURN of a transaction, facilitate the movement of Runes from inputs to outputs and ensure future compatibility through an even-odd tagging system.
However, users are cautioned to be mindful of the specific tags used, as even-tagged Runestones can lead to the effective burning of the involved Runes, a process referred to as creating a “Cenotaph” by Rodarmor.
Vision For The Future
Looking forward, the Runes protocol aims to support a wide array of applications and interactions, from intricate inscriptions that could, for example, influence the abilities of digital collectibles based on the amount of a specific Rune held, to facilitating off-chain liquidity pools for Rune trading. This opens up new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Bitcoin network, a prospect that has garnered excitement within the community.
Ordiswap Labs, through a statement on X, emphasized the potential of Runes to enhance the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem, noting the protocol’s efficient on-chain footprint and compatibility with existing Bitcoin standards, including the Lightning Network. “Runes aims to provide a simple, Bitcoin-native token system with a unique issuance model and efficient on-chain footprint […] Runes are one that we are now specifically looking into, and we cannot be more excited about the potential of the BTC DeFi ecosystem in the coming months!”


The activation of the Runes protocol is strategically timed to coincide with the Bitcoin halving, with expectations set for a block height of 840,000, around April 20.
At press time, BTC traded at $70,366.

                        While the overall cryptocurrency market remains relatively stable, meme coins have been gaining momentum, with Dogwifhat emerging as a front-runner. The red-hot Solana-based meme coin has recently reached a new all-time high, becoming the third largest meme coin by market cap after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Starting the day at $3.21, the coin experienced sideways trading until around 9 am ET, after which it witnessed a sudden spike. Earlier today, it reached an all-time high of above $4 and is currently trading at $3.73, up by more than 20% over the past day. Dogwifhat’s Strongest Daily Performance
The recent performance marks Dogwifhat’s strongest daily showing since its launch. The coin has surpassed the more established meme coin Pepe, securing the 38th position in the Top 100. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Dogwifhat has a market cap of $3.7 billion, while Pepe settles in 43rd place with a market cap of $3.32 billion.It is important to note that meme coins are highly volatile and lack strong fundamentals. The vision behind WIF is simply “literally just a dog wif a hat.” As a result, they are influenced by random events, such as tweets, unrelated news, and the movements of other coins. Market sentiment plays a larger role in driving these tokens than any tangible factors.Other meme coins are also performing well today. In the overall Top 100 of the crypto industry, the four best-performing tokens are meme coins: Dogecoin (+16.83%), Floki (+12.7%), and BONK (+10%). Outside of the top 10, PEPE has seen an 2% increase and is currently trading at $0.000007883 per token, while Shiba Inu is up 5.85% to $0.00003179. A total of 65 out of the 100 biggest meme coins have posted gains in the last 24 hours.Solana Emerges as Preferred Blockchain for Meme Coins
Solana (SOL), a blockchain platform known for its low transaction costs, has emerged as a preferred venue for trading these coins. According to data from CoinGecko, the Solana meme coin sector has surged by 13% over the past week and more than 40% over the past month. The platform has seen a wave of new coins featuring caricatures of public figures like Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Meanwhile, there has been a surge in presale scams amid the meme coin season on the Solana blockchain, which continues in full force.Just recently, crypto detective ZachXBT highlighted several presale coins that have raised concerns due to fraudulent activities and suspicions of being rug pulls. One instance involves X user @Sartoshi0x, who received 7,000 SOL as part of a presale but secretly kept 62% of the funds without distributing the tokens as promised. The surge in Solana meme coin presale scams comes as these events have amassed a staggering $150 million in SOL from only 33 presales. Despite the allure of quick gains, ZachXBT emphasizes that many of these projects, often promoted by smaller accounts, are either dubious or outright scams.

                        Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently commented on Worldcoin’s attempt to ensure user data’s privacy, acknowledging their effort.Replying to a user’s post on social media Buterin addressed to the project co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, saying that Worldcoin has done “quite a good job” when it comes to protecting personal information with cryptography.“IMO [In my opinion] they actually have been doing quite a good job of taking the privacy critiques seriously and designing their system to be more and more data-minimal,” said Buterin.“Modern cryptography is truly amazing,” he said.Buterin’s Concerns and Skepticism
In October 2023, Vitalik Buterin expressed concerns about Worldcoin, especially its fundamental mechanism that verifies human identity via iris scanning. He discussed its “digital passport” that differentiates humans from AI but raised privacy and accessibility issues.Buterin noted the system’s potential to solve “anti-spam and anti-concentration-of-power problems,” yet he cautioned, “If proof of personhood is not solved, decentralized governance becomes much easier to capture by very wealthy actors, including hostile governments.”His primary worry was the extensive data collected through iris scanning, potentially revealing personal details like sex, ethnicity, and medical conditions.Regarding Worldcoin’s global accessibility, Buterin was skeptical, pointing out, “Even with much higher-scale distributed manufacturing, it would be hard to get to a world where there’s an Orb within five kilometers of everyone.”Governments Act to Regulate Worldcoin
Worldcoin’s biometric data collection practices have recently faced regulatory actions globally.In Portugal, the National Data Protection Commission (CNPD) temporarily halted Worldcoin for 90 days on March 26, due to concerns over collecting iris and facial scans without adequate consent, particularly from minors.Similarly, in Spain, the Data Protection Agency (AEPD) issued a three-month ban on Worldcoin’s data collection starting March 6, citing similar issues. Legal appeals by Worldcoin were rejected by a local court, affirming the AEPD’s decision.These instances reflect a growing scrutiny of Worldcoin by regulators in different jurisdictions, including Hong Kong and Kenya, where concerns over privacy risks and biometric data collection have led to investigations and restrictions on the platform’s activities.

Bitcoin Behemoth Transfers Over $6 Billion, Signaling Institutional Investors' Growing Faith in Crypto Ahead of Halving



                    
In a significant move within the cryptocurrency community, a notable Bitcoin whale, identified only as “37X,” has shifted an enormous sum of over $6 billion in Bitcoin to three separate addresses, marking the first such transaction since 2019. 



This transfer saw the whale relocating nearly its entire stash of 94,500 Bitcoin, valued at $6.05 billion as of March 23, leaving a mere 1.4 BTC in the original wallet. 




The details of this massive transaction were shared by Arkham Intelligence on March 25, stating, “$5.03B BTC was sent to bc1q8yj, with addresses bc1q6m5 and bc1q592 receiving $561.46M and $488.40M in BTC respectively. bc1q592 has since sent those funds onwards.”



This whale activity coincided with a surge in Bitcoin interest from institutional investors, partly fueled by the anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event set for late April. 



This event is expected to cut the reward for mining new blocks in half, a significant change that has historically impacted Bitcoin’s price. 




Despite Bitcoin achieving a record price level prior to this halving, experts believe the market has yet to fully account for the impending reduction in supply. 



A D8X co-founder and former UBS executive director highlighted to Cointelegraph that the price increase does not fully reflect the anticipated supply squeeze.

The timing of the whale’s transfer was also noteworthy, occurring just as Bitcoin surpassed the $70,000 mark on March 25 after a 10-day absence from this price point. 



This resurgence is part of a broader trend of Bitcoin accumulation off exchanges, with Coinbase’s Bitcoin supply dropping to a nine-year low. 



According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s price saw a 6.4% increase in the 24 hours leading up to March 25, reaching $71,222.



The current Bitcoin rally is largely attributed to halving anticipation and increased institutional investment, including from traditional financial institutions launching Bitcoin-related products. 



Ten Squared’s partner, Christopher Cheung, mentioned to Cointelegraph, “The involvement of traditional financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity in launching BTC products is further legitimizing cryptocurrency as an alternative asset class. 



“This reduces the ‘career risk’ for investors who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto market.” 



The growth in Bitcoin ETFs, with a combined total of $58.3 billion in on-chain holdings, underscores the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class among investors.

Bitwise applies for Ethereum ETF; Bitbot presale gathers steam with price expected to rise to $0.0141



                    

                    
Bitwise applies for Ethereum ETF emphasizing spot trading but omitting staking features.
Bitbot presale raises over $1.6 million, BITBOT tokens currently going at $0.0134.
Next Bitbot presale stage expects BITBOT price to rise to $0.0141.

Bitwise Asset Management has taken a bold step forward in the cryptocurrency market by applying to an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), despite facing regulatory challenges.
At the same time, Bitbot, a new Telegram bot, is also making waves as its token presale quickly sells out through its presale stages.
Bitwise’s application for an Ethereum ETF
Bitwise filed its S-1 form with the U.S. SEC for what it is calling the Bitwise Ethereum  ETH ETF with the SEC on Thursday. The application marks a significant milestone in the company’s journey into the cryptocurrency investment space. 
The Ethereum ETF application includes a comprehensive correlation analysis between Ethereum and Bitcoin, highlighting similarities in market dynamics and bolstering the case for Ethereum ETF approval.
Following the approval of its spot Bitcoin ETF, Bitwise aims to replicate its success with Ethereum.
The company’s decision to venture into Ethereum ETFs underscores its confidence in the potential of Ethereum as a viable investment asset.
Unlike some competitors, Bitwise’s proposal focuses solely on the spot trading aspect of Ethereum, omitting mention of staking features present in other ETF filings. This strategic differentiation aims to streamline the approval process and position Bitwise uniquely in the competitive ETF landscape.
Bitbot: empowering crypto trading with innovative features
In parallel with Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF endeavours, Telegram continues to innovate in the cryptocurrency trading sphere with its new trading bot Bitbot.
Bitbot is a non-custodial Telegram trading bot designed to democratize access to advanced trading tools for users of all experience levels.
With features like automated sniping, limit orders, copy trading, and yield optimization, Bitbot provides users with institutional-grade trading capabilities directly from the convenience of Telegram.
Central to Bitbot’s ecosystem is its native token, BITBOT, which serves as a utility coin offering holders various benefits.
BITBOT holders enjoy revenue sharing, exclusive access to presales, unique perks, and governance rights, empowering them to participate actively in Bitbot’s strategic direction.
Bitbot presale 
Bitbot’s ongoing presale has garnered significant attention and support from the crypto community.
With over $1.621 million raised thus far, the presale demonstrates strong investor confidence in Bitbot’s vision and capabilities.
In the current presale stage, BITBOT tokens are available at $0.0134, offering investors an opportunity to secure their stake in Bitbot’s ecosystem at an attractive rate.
Looking ahead, the next presale stage presents an opportunity for investors as the price is expected to rise to $0.0141.
With Bitbot’s innovative features and promising roadmap, the presale serves as a gateway for investors to become early adopters and contributors to Bitbot’s continued growth and success.

Binance Introduces Ethena (ENA) as 50th Launchpool Project | Coinspeaker



The introduction of Ethena to Binance Launchpool coincides with the protocol planned website launch later today, March 29, 2024

Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by market value, has announced the addition of Ethena (ENA) to its Launchpool, making the protocol the 50th project to join the program.
The announcement comes a few weeks after Binance unveiled EtherFi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) network focused on liquid staking, as the 49th project to enter the program.




Users to Start Farming ENA on Binance
Ethena is a synthetic dollar and internet-native yield platform built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Its synthetic dollar, USDe, aims to bring stability and scalability to the DeFi ecosystem.
The platform utilizes delta-hedging against Ethereum collateral to maintain USDe’s peg and introduces the ‘Internet Bond’ for yield opportunities from staking and derivatives.
Starting on March 30, 2024, users can farm Ethena’s native token, ENA, by staking their BNB and FDUSD tokens alongside other projects in the Binance launchpool.
With a total circulating supply of 15,000,000,000 ENA, Binance said it will initially release 1,425,000,000 ENA, representing 9.5% of the total supply. Additionally, the exchange has allocated 300,000,000 ENA, constituting 2% of the maximum supply, as Launchpool token rewards.
Binance to List ENA on the Exchange
The farming event is scheduled to last three days, and only users from non-restricted regions can participate in the program.
Users from certain regions have been restricted from participating in the token’s farming due to regulatory issues. The company said that users in Australia, Canada, Cuba, the Crimea Region, Iran, Japan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, North Korea, Syria, the United States of America and its territories, and non-government-controlled areas of Ukraine are not eligible to farm ENA.
Nevertheless, the exchange assured users that the list of prohibited countries could change according to regulatory updates.
Binance also disclosed that on April 2, 2024, at 08:00 (UTC), the company will officially list ENA on the platform. The listing will come with a range of trading pairs, including ENA/BTC, ENA/USDT, ENA/BNB, ENA/FDUSD, and ENA/TRY.
Ethena to Airdrop 750 Million ENA to Early Adopters
Meanwhile, the introduction of Ethena to Binance Launchpool coincides with the protocol planned website launch later today, on March 29, 2024. The platform also plans to reward users for their contributions to the network since launch.
Ethena Labs, the brains behind the network’s development, recently announced that it would airdrop 750 million ENA to users holding “shards”, which represent their engagement with the protocol.
The planned airdrop accounts for 5% of the total ENA supply. However, the number of tokens each user receives will depend on the shards accumulated by April 1.
To be eligible for the airdrop, users must ensure that their USDe, the protocol’s synthetic dollar pegged to the US dollar, is staked or held within the Ethena protocol. Eligible participants can expect to receive their ENA tokens on April 2, which will be available for trading on crypto exchanges such as Binance.

Fake Ethena Labs token exploited for $290K on Binance Launchpool

Update March 29, 09:50 am UTC: This article has been updated to clarify the token in question is a fake bearing the same name as Ethena Labs' ENA token.A fake token with the same name as Ethena Labs's ENA token has been exploited for 480 BNB (BNB) tokens worth $290,000 on the Binance launch pool for farming. The vulnerability behind the exploit is still unknown. On-chain security firm PeckShield reported the incident at 8:31 am UTC on March 29 in an X post, mistaking the fake token for the real ENA token.Ethena Labs’s ENA token was announced on the Binance Launchpool on March 29. The exploit of the fake token, which is unrelated to Ethena Labs, occurred a few hours after the announcementing listing, causing widespread confusion.Ethena Labs launched its USDe synthetic dollar on the public mainnet on Feb. 19. Ethena became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8, when it offered investors an annual percentage yield (APY) of 67%. In terms of total sum, the exploit is on the smaller side of crypto hacks. The attack occurred a day after the over-$11-million Prisma Finance hack on March 28.Crypto hacks are a long-standing issue in the industry, eroding investor trust. Over $200 million worth of crypto has been lost to hacks and rug pulls in 2024 across 32 individual incidents up to Feb. 29, according to blockchain security firm Immunefi.The over-$200-million loss represents a 15.4% increase compared to January and February 2023, when $173 million of digital assets were stolen.A total of $1.8 billion was lost to crypto hacks and scammers in 2023, 17% of which can be attributed to the North Korean Lazarus Group, according to a Dec. 28 report by Immunefi.Related: Funds hacked in 2024 increased by 15.4% vs. the same period in 2023 — ImmunefiAmount of crypto funds stolen fell 54% in 2023The biggest year for crypto hackers was 2022, which saw over $3.7 billion in funds stpo, a decrease of 54.3% to $1.7 billion in 2023, according to the “2024 Crypto Crime Report” by Chainalysis.Despite the value of funds falling, the number of incidents grew from 219 in 2022 to 231 in 2023.Total value hacked. Source: ChainalysisChainalysis attributed the significant yearly drop to a decrease in decentralized finance (DeFi) hacking, according to the report:“Hacks of DeFi protocols largely drove the huge increase in stolen crypto that we saw in 2021 and 2022, with cybercriminals stealing more than $3.1 billion in DeFi hacks last year. But this year, hackers stole just $1.1 billion from DeFi protocols. This amounts to a 63.7% drop in the total value stolen from DeFi platforms year-over-year.”Related: Marc Andreessen, Galaxy Digital, Accolade, back new $75 million crypto fund: Report

                        Brazilian exchange operator B3 has received approval from the country’s securities regulator to introduce Bitcoin futures trading. On Thursday, the platform said the Bitcoin futures trading is scheduled to commence on April 17, according to a report from Reuters. Currently, B3 offers exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and ETF receipts related to cryptoassets. With the addition of Bitcoin futures, the exchange aims to meet the growing demand for derivatives that provide a hedge against price fluctuations or directional exposure to the popular cryptocurrency.B3’s Bitcoin Futures Will be Tied to Nasdaq
The Bitcoin futures contracts offered by B3 will be tied to the Nasdaq Bitcoin Reference Price, with each contract representing 10% of Bitcoin’s price in Brazilian reais. It is important to note that these futures contracts will involve financial settlement, meaning there will be no actual buying or selling of physical bitcoin.“The launch meets the demand for a derivative that allows a hedge against bitcoin’s price fluctuations or a directional exposure to the asset,” Felipe Goncalves, B3’s superintendent of swap rates and currency products, said. He said that the move by B3 signifies a significant step in the integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial market of Brazil. By offering Bitcoin futures, B3 provides investors with a regulated and secure platform to participate in Bitcoin trading, leveraging the price movements of the digital asset.Brazil Warming Towards Digital Assets
Brazil has been moving toward digital assets and innovative technologies like blockchain. Last year, the country announced it is set to issue digital identification documents for its more than 214 million citizens using blockchain technology.The decision to leverage blockchain technology for digital identity stems from its inherent properties of immutability and decentralization. Alexandre Amorim, president of Serpro, said that blockchain technology is crucial for protecting personal data and preventing fraud. He claimed that the b-Cadastros blockchain platform significantly enhances the security and reliability of the National Identity Card project, offering a more secure digital experience for Brazilian citizens. In addition to the digital identity project, Brazil is also making strides in the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). In August, the government provided more details about the project, which has been rebranded as Drex. The CBDC aims to expand business access to capital through a tokenization system associated with the Drex. More recently, the central bank of Brazil vowed to tighten rules and strengthen its oversight of crypto platforms amid growing crypto adoption in the country.Roberto Campos Neto, the governor of Brazil’s central bank, said last October that “cryptocurrency imports” by Brazilian residents have risen 44.2% in the period between January and August 2023 compared to the same period last year.“We understand that a lot is connected to tax evasion or linked to illicit activities,” Neto said while stressing that oversight of the crypto sector in Brazil will be strengthened going forward.

Driving Cats NFT Club Drop Begins in Challenge to SHIB, BONK, PEPE and DOGE



                    
The first phase of the Driving Cats NFT Club public sale got underway on 29 March at 8:30 AM (GMT) on OpenSea. 



Cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Bonk (BONK) and Pepecoin (PEPE) have been attracting huge inflows from retail investors in recent weeks and months, amid the beginning of the bull run. 




While these altcoins can deliver significant returns during the current cycle – potentially over 200% – investing in NFTs at the beginning of the drop can potentially generate even higher returns, in a much shorter period of time.



One such opportunity that has emerged is the Driving Cats NFT Club (DCNC.)



The first phase of the public sale of the Driving Cats NFT Club started today at 8:30 AM (GMT), and investors can now buy and mint their NFT from this collection. 



During the first phase, each of the 999 NFTs that make up this collection will be available to buy for just 0.07 ETH (around $240).



Once the first phase of the public sale ends in late April, each NFT will be priced at 0.25 ETH – over four times its price during the first phase.



However, as the NFT collection is expected to sell out during the first phase, and as most buyers will likely hold onto their NFTs rather than trying to flip them in the secondary market, the price of each NFT could rally much higher than 0.25 ETH.




For investors who buy and mint their NFT during the first phase of the public sale, the Driving Cats NFT Club could be a great investment, potentially delivering much higher returns than if you were to invest in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepecoin (PEPE), or Bonk (BONK).

WIF, DOGE, SHIB Lead Memecoin Gains as Bitcoin (BTC) Traders Warn of Pullback

“The price rally has been exponential in Q1, and there are signs of exhaustion,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast Friday. “ETH risk reversals are skewed to the downside at -8%, indicating some fear. Funding and forwards remain very elevated, which means that speculators are still paying high prices to keep their leveraged longs.”

Bitcoin shows ‘signs of exhaustion’ as Q1 BTC price gains near 70%

Bitcoin (BTC) risks “exhaustion” as it nears the end of Q1 2024 with 65% BTC price gains.In an update sent to Telegram channel subscribers on March 29, trading firm QCP Capital warned that “exponential” upside could pose a problem next quarter.BTC price slows after “exponential” Q1Bitcoin market observers are firmly focused on the weekend as several key candles — the weekly, monthly and quarterly — close at once.After a transformational start to the year, BTC price action continues to hover around all-time highs while still facing difficulty flipping them to new support.For QCP Capital, the outlook for the second quarter nonetheless remains “very bullish.” It summarized:“For Q2, there are sufficient catalysts to form a very bullish view:1. Continued BTC spot ETF demand (and shrinking supply as GBTC runs out)2. BTC halving3. London Stock Exchange ETNs4. Potential ETH spot ETF approval.”Despite this, the extent of progress since the start of the year — including the launch of the United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January — has been such that bulls may have problems continuing that momentum.“At the same time, the price rally has been exponential in Q1 and there are signs of exhaustion,” QCP explained.It flagged declining sentiment on the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH), and persistent high funding rates across exchanges.“While we remain bullish, we are cautious about leverage and we are also prepared to scoop some value on big dips,” the update concluded.Bitcoin monthly chart looks to match recordThe latest live data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, TradingView and monitoring resource CoinGlass confirms that BTC/USD is 65.4% year-to-date.Related: Bitcoin ‘sell-side liquidity crisis’ sees BTC move for the first time since 2010BTC/USD quarterly returns (screenshot).

Hackers Swipe Bitcoin from Unwitting Call of Duty Cheaters


In a striking turn of events, gamers, particularly those bending the rules in Call of Duty, find themselves in the crosshairs of a sophisticated malware campaign. 
An unknown threat actor deployed this malware. It targets users of pay-to-cheat services in games. This leads to unauthorized transactions and compromised accounts.
Activision Blizzard Teams Up with Cheat Makers to Battle Malware Theft
The initial alarm was raised by a Call of Duty cheat provider, PhantomOverlay, upon noticing unauthorized purchases on user accounts. This discovery quickly unraveled a wider web of compromised accounts across various gaming platforms, including Battlenet and Activision, with over 3.6 million and 561,183 accounts affected, respectively.

“The scope of the impact is so large, and in a bizarre twist of fate, Activision Blizzard is coordinating with cheat providers to aid users impacted by the massive infostealer campaign.” Stated vx-underground.

This cyber-attack doesn’t stop at gaming credentials. Impacted users report significant losses from their Electrum Bitcoin wallets, adding a financial sting to the breach. The exact amount siphoned off remains unclear, but the implications are alarming, underscoring the vulnerabilities associated with illicit gaming practices and third-party tools.

In an unexpected collaboration, gaming behemoth Activision Blizzard is joining forces with cheat providers like PhantomOverlay to assist users caught in this malware incident. This partnership aims to identify and remediate affected accounts, shedding light on the scale and sophistication of the infostealer campaign.
Zeebler, a developer of cheating software for Call of Duty, initially made the discovery of this malware campaign. Zeebler revealed in PhantomOverlay’s channel the hackers’ tactic. They target gamers, even cheat users, to steal usernames and passwords. Alarmingly, they also aim to take their cryptocurrency assets.
Activision has responded to the crisis, with spokesperson Delaney Simmons asserting that the company’s servers remain “secure and uncompromised.” The focus now shifts to understanding the malware’s propagation methods, which remain ambiguous but seem to involve the download or use of unauthorized software.

This malware incident warns gamers about the dangers of cheating and using third-party tools. As the probe continues, gamers eagerly await measures to combat this threat. They want to protect their digital and financial assets.

Analysis of the cryptocurrencies Ondo, Patex, and Bonk

In this historical period there are some cryptocurrencies whose prices are performing in a particularly unique way: we are talking about Ondo, Patex and Bonk.

Latest crypto news at Ondo, Patex, and Bonk prices
Ondo is one of the most interesting cryptos at the moment. 
ONDO is the Ethereum token of Ondo DAO, and grants specific rights in Flux Finance.
The Ondo Finance project is related to the tokenization of real assets (RWA, Real World Asset), which is one of the fastest growing sectors within the crypto world.
Around it, Flux Finance is a platform that allows loans in stablecoin collateralized in tokenized US bonds. 
The Ondo token made its debut on the crypto markets only at the beginning of 2024, so there is little historical data to analyze. Furthermore, the project’s platforms have not yet had time to prove themselves to be solid and long-lasting.
Nevertheless, in less than three months the price of Ondo has risen from the initial $0.17 to the current $0.88, with a gain of 415%.
The all-time high was reached three days ago at almost $1, but if the current medium-term trend continues, it is possible that it will be updated in the coming weeks. 
However, it is necessary to pay close attention to this project, because there is a possibility that RWAs may be considered securities in financial markets, and in that case they could not be freely traded on platforms that are not specifically registered and authorized to deal with securities. 
Furthermore, giants like BlackRock are also entering the RWA sector, which do not have authorization problems, so the competition could be significant. 
However, throughout the duration of the bullrun, it is possible to ride the wave of tokens linked to RWAs, even if it is primarily just propaganda. 
Therefore, the doubt is not so much about short-term resistance, but about long-term resistance, since the RWA sector is just beginning, and it will presumably take some more time before giants like BlackRock fully appropriate it.
The trend of Patex 
Patex is also a token on Ethereum, and this token has also debuted on the crypto markets only this year.
This is always a project related to RWAs, so the same considerations just made for Ondo apply. 
The price trend of Patex on the crypto markets, however, is decidedly different. 
While Ondo debuted at a very low price, and then has almost done nothing but rise, Patex instead debuted at prices in line with current ones.
But after all, it landed on the crypto markets less than three weeks ago, so it could still be only in its initial phase.
The debut was made at around $6.5, with a first peak at $9.7, a subsequent drop below $5, and a rise up to the current $7.3. 
It is therefore a fairly volatile token, more than Ondo, which has not yet really taken off on the crypto markets. 
The Patex project is specifically targeting the Latin American market, and includes an ecosystem of tools that should enable the tokenization and exchange of RWA. 
At this moment it is very difficult to say how solid this project really is, and what concrete potential it has, besides the fact that the crypto sector of RWA seems to be currently dominated by Ondo. 
The trend of Bonk 
Bonk instead has nothing to do with RWA, because it is a memecoin on Solana. 
The token made its debut on the crypto markets at the end of 2022, so it has been traded for almost a year and a half. 
The initial debut took place at very low prices, but this is a typical characteristic of memecoins, which usually perform very poorly until the moment of the boom. 
The price of Bonk tends to enter a bull run at the end of the year, in view of Christmas, since its project revolves around this event. 
Indeed, by the end of 2022 it had already recorded a first boom with a spectacular +3,000% in just a few weeks. 
However, he had then lost a large part of those earnings, only to repeat themselves at the end of 2023. 
Indeed, starting from mid-October the price started to rise again, going from 0.2 millionths of a dollar to 25 millionths in about two months. The gain was 12,000%. 
As often happens in these cases, it was a speculative bubble that burst at the beginning of 2024, but the price did not drop much below 10 millionths of a dollar. 
In March, a new speculative bubble inflated, leading to new all-time highs above 45 million dollars. Now it has dropped back to 27 million, but it is not possible to completely exclude the possibility of new bubbles inflating. 
It is worth noting that, despite the three sensational booms, its market capitalization is still less than 1.8 billion dollars, while other longer-standing memecoins, such as Shiba Inu, have a market capitalization even ten times higher. 
So the potential for some new bubble seems to be there, even if not with gains similar to those of the past.

Vitalik Buterin Fires Shots at Crypto Villains


Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has ignited a firestorm in the crypto world with his recent social media post, taking aim at what he calls "crypto villains." In an unexpected move, Buterin singled out figures like Mark Karpeles and Kyle Davies, labeling them as emblematic of a darker side of the industry.In his post, Buterin mentions Mark Karpeles and Kyle Davies, two famous "crypto villains." The former is known for having purchased the infamous Mt. Gox exchange in 2011, in 2014 it went bankrupt, and in 2015 Karpeles was arrested by the Japanese police. As a result, he was under investigation for the next four years.Davies co-founded the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which collapsed in 2022 after failing to meet its multi-billion dollar obligations. The fund's bankruptcy set off a chain reaction that is believed to have gotten to FTX, which eventually collapsed later that year. Interestingly, Buterin believes that while Karpeles deserves a chance at forgiveness due to his current activities, Davies does not. The screenshots attached to the post by the Ethereum founder make it clear what he dislikes — it is the fact that Davies, after losing billions and ruining a lot of people's lives, continues to post his meme cryptocurrency deals and generally engage in cheap attention-grabbing activities.This comes hot on the heels of the imprisonment of another notable figure in the crypto sphere, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the FTX exchange, who was sentenced to 25 years behind bars. FTX, once a titan in the crypto exchange arena, faced insolvency following revelations of financial instability and subsequent investor withdrawals.

Update March 29, 11:00 am UTC: This article has been updated to add that Binance refutes SCMP’s claim of HKVAEX being part of the Binance group. HKVAEX, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange allegedly tied to Binance, withdrew its license application from the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC) on March 28.The SFC had set a deadline of Feb. 29 for all crypto exchanges to apply for operational licenses in the region. HKVAEX, a crypto exchange that, according to Chinese state media SCMP, shares technical and other resources with Binance, applied for the Hong Kong license on Jan. 4. List of all crypto exchanges that withdrew license applications with the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC). Source: sfc.hkThe SFC website confirms that HKVAEX withdrew its license application nearly three months after the filing. Following the application withdrawal, HKVAEX must wind up its operations in Hong Kong on or before May 31. The Hong Kong SFC shared deadlines for crypto license applications. Source: sfc.hkSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Binance denied any links to the Hong Kong-based crypto exchange and stated:"HKVAEX is not part of Binance group. Please reach out to HKVAEX."Three other virtual asset trading platforms have withdrawn their operational license applications in 2024 for reasons that were not made public, including the prominent global crypto exchange Huobi.Crypto Twitter community member Wu Blockchain speculated that the reasons for the withdrawal may involve a variety of reasons, including a request to change the audit company or provide more information. At the time of its launch, HKVAEX was confused with VAEX, a different crypto exchange in Hong Kong tied to KuCoin. At the time, an HKVAEX representative told Cointelegraph, “VAEXC is another applicant, and they have nothing to do with us.”Related: Binance executive reportedly escapes detention as Nigeria files tax evasion chargesCommEx, a Russian crypto exchange with strong ties with Binance, officially announced it is shutting down operations and has halted deposits on March 25.“We have to announce the gradual suspension of operations on the CommEX platform,” the firm said, recommending users to withdraw their assets immediately to third-party wallets.Binance had previously hinted at exiting Russia in early September 2023 as top local executives, including vice president of Eastern Europe Gleb Kostarev, stepped down. Subsequently, CommEx emphasized that it operated independently of Binance but admitted that some of its core members were former Binance staff.Magazine: Creating ‘good’ AGI that won’t kill us all: Crypto’s Artificial Superintelligence Alliance

Tezos Blockchain: the proposals of the Paris protocol

After the successful activation of the Oxford 2 protocol on February 9th, the Tezos Blockchain community is once again buzzing. 
This time it’s about the proposals of the Paris protocol – Paris A and Paris B – which each promise significant advancements to the Tezos protocol. 
These proposals, identified by their hash keys, aim to introduce lower latency, faster finality, and crucial updates to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. 
Let’s delve into the complexity of these proposals and their significance for the future of Tezos.

Updates and important improvements of the Tezos blockchain
Both Paris A and Paris B offer substantial improvements to the Tezos protocol, including:
Lower latency and higher speed: By reducing block times to just 10 seconds, both proposals aim to improve transaction speed and network efficiency without compromising decentralization or security.
Activation of the Data Availability Layer (DAL): The introduction of DAL on Mainnet is set to revolutionize scalability, benefiting especially Smart Rollups like Etherlink, significantly increasing throughput and bandwidth.
Refinement of Tezos PoS: Both proposals include enhancements to Tezos PoS, with the aim of simplifying the acquisition and updating of baking rights, while also simplifying the calculation.
Paris B introduces Adaptive Issuance, Staking and Adaptive Slashing immediately after the activation of the protocol. These features represent a significant revision of the Tezos PoS mechanism, adapting it to real-world use and improving the security of the chain.
Paris A, instead, provides the possibility for bakers to vote for the activation of these features at a later time through a signaling mechanism on the chain. This mechanism allows for a more gradual adoption process, allowing bakers to assess the impact of these features before implementation.
Main features
Adaptive issuance: This mechanism regulates the issuance of tez by the protocol based on the ratio between the tez staked and the total supply, incentivizing participants to stake funds to maintain a target ratio defined by the protocol.
Episode: The proposals from Paris introduce a new role – the staker – which allows participants to contribute to a baker’s security deposit without giving up custody of their funds. The deposited funds are subject to slashing in case of misconduct.
Adaptive Slashing: this function enhances the slashing mechanism to distinguish between innocent errors and deliberate attacks, ensuring fair penalties based on the total stake of the attester.
Paris A offers a more deliberative approach, allowing the activation of the function through a voting mechanism. Paris B, on the other hand, activates Adaptive Issuance, Staking, and Adaptive Slashing immediately upon protocol activation, providing a faster implementation path.
Both proposals from Paris include further enhancements to Tezos’ PoS, independent from Adaptive Issuance, Staking, and Adaptive Slashing.
These changes simplify the calculation of batch rights and reduce various delays and grace periods, thus optimizing the efficiency of the network.
Conclusions
The proposals of the Paris protocol mark an exciting chapter in the evolution of the Tezos blockchain. With innovations aimed at improving speed, scalability, and security, Tezos continues to consolidate its position as a leading blockchain platform.
Whether it’s the gradual adoption offered by Paris A or the immediate implementation of Paris B, the future looks promising for Tezos and its vibrant community.
While we eagerly await the outcome of these proposals, we continue to collaborate and build together a brighter future for Tezos. 
Join the conversation on Tezos Discord and stay tuned for further updates in the #baking-announcements channel. The journey ahead of us is full of possibilities and together we can shape the next phase of Tezos’ journey.

                        TRM Labs data revealed that 2023 saw illicit crypto volumes drop by a third from $49.5 billion in 2022 to $34.8 billion. However, of all crypto frauds in 2023, TRON blockchain hosted 45%, up from 41% in 2022.A new report from TRM’s blockchain intelligence team highlighted key trends in crypto illicit transactions through 2023.Criminals have handled over $34 billion worth of cryptocurrencies, despite 9% decrease in year-on-year total illicit crypto funds from 2022-2023.The report titled “The Illicit Crypto Economy,” also noted that almost half of all illicit crypto volume (45% in 2023) occurred on the TRON blockchain. This was followed by Ethereum blockchain at 24% and Bitcoin blockchain with 18%.Further, Tether (USDT) stablecoin has seen the largest illicit volume last year, at $19.3 billion. “Approximately 1.63% of Tether volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,” it noted.When asked about the factors that make TRON blockchain a potential hotbed for perpetrators, Angela Ang, senior policy advisor at TRM told Cryptonews that “one of the reasons for TRON’s popularity could be its low transaction fees and high speed.” This makes it cheap and quick to launder funds, she added.“The availability of stablecoins like USDT on TRON could be another factor. For example, we know that USDT on TRON is the currency of choice for terrorist financing entities.”2023 Observed Crypto Crime Reductions
While the damage on TRON blockchain was massive, 2023 witnessed a significant decline in the volume of illicit funds. There was a 30% decrease than the $49.5 billion recorded in 2022.Also, sanctions volume was the largest driver of the overall decline last year. Crypto value linked to sanctioned entities fell 30% from $25.4 billion in 2022 to $16.2 billion in 2023. Source: TRMAdditionally, crypto hacks and exploits saw a dramatic 50% reduction to $1.8 billion in 2023 from $3.7 billion in 2022. On an average, every hack in 2023 saw $10 million compromised, against $21 million in 2022, it added.“Many factors are likely to have contributed to the dent in crypto crime over 2023, including increased vigilance from businesses, fraud awareness among the general public, and pure chance,” the report read.

Top Judges' Cryptocurrency Portfolio Revealed: They Hold Bitcoin and These Altcoins! - Bitcoin Sistemi

South Korea, which came to the fore with its parliamentarian's suspicious cryptocurrency transactions, has now come to the fore with the cryptocurrency assets of senior judges.
According to reports from local news agency NoCut News and Joongang Ilbo, it was revealed that some senior South Korean judges hold popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Solana (SOL).


The information came to light after South Korea's Supreme Court ruled that senior judges must make annual public disclosures about their financial assets to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
According to the court decision, the statements that judges must provide must also include the assets and crypto wallet information of their spouses and children.





Accordingly, Cheongju District Court Chief Judge Lim Byeong-ryeol said that he held 9.92 and 3.38 BTC, while his wife and son held a total of 6.54 BTC in their names.
Chief Judge Lim Byeong-ryeol stated that apart from Bitcoin, he holds small amounts of Ethereum, Solana and XRP.


Additionally, Kang Il-won, Chairman of the Supreme Court Public Service Ethics Committee, disclosed the assets of 141 high-ranking judges, including Chief Justice Cho Hee-dae and Supreme Court Justices, including cryptocurrencies.
Cheongju District Court Chief Judge Lim Byeong-ryeol reported that he held 3.38 Bitcoins (192.34 million KRW) in his name, while his wife and son held 519.68 million KRW and 1.05 million KRW worth of cryptocurrencies, respectively.

Rapid rise and fall of Memecoins amidst SBF's sentencing

In a whirlwind of speculative fervor, the cryptocurrency community witnessed a fierce surge in memecoins coinciding with the historic sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of FTX. Judge Lewis Kaplan’s decision to impose a 25-year prison sentence on Bankman-Fried sent shockwaves through the industry, marking a significant milestone as the first prison sentence for an individual linked to the collapse of a major cryptocurrency exchange.Within hours of the sentencing, a memecoin titled “Sam Baseman Fraud” emerged on the Coinbase layer-2 network Base, amusingly adopting the ticker symbol “FTX.” This tongue-in-cheek nod to Bankman-Fried’s legal woes quickly captured the attention of speculative investors. The memecoin skyrocketed by an astounding 23,300%, reaching a peak market capitalization of $1.5 million on March 28, according to DexScreener data.However, the euphoria proved short-lived as the token rapidly shed more than 85% of its value within three hours, exemplifying the volatile nature of memecoin investments. Despite a subsequent stabilization, with the token trading around the $0.06 mark, it remained substantially below its all-time highs, reflecting a 60% decrease.Solana-based SBF memecoin surges In a parallel development, the Solana network witnessed the launch of another memecoin, dubbed “Som Bonkmon Fraud,” also themed around Sam Bankman-Fried. Initially, this token surged to a market capitalization of approximately $20 million, representing an astonishing 18,000% increase from its launch value of $30,000.Nevertheless, mirroring the fate of its counterpart, the SBF memecoin experienced a steep decline, plummeting over 95% from its peak. As of the latest update, the token trades around $0.0008, only marginally above its initial listing price, underscoring the speculative nature and inherent risks associated with memecoin investments.The emergence of Bankman-Fried-themed memecoins adds to a growing trend of memecoins inspired by crypto and political figureheads. With the upcoming United States election looming, several political memecoins, including Boden and Tremp, have sought to capitalize on the heightened attention surrounding political events.The resurgence of memecoins gained momentum following the meteoric rise of Dog Wif Hat (WIF). This Solana-based memecoin soared from a market capitalization of approximately $50,000 to $3.5 billion within four months. Other meme tokens, such as the frog-themed Pepe on Ethereum and the rooster-themed Coq Inu (COQ) on Avalanche, have experienced notable rallies.FTT token dips amidst legal turmoilThe fallout from Bankman-Fried’s sentencing reverberated across the cryptocurrency market, impacting not only memecoins but also established tokens. FTX Token (FTT), the native cryptocurrency of the now-defunct exchange, witnessed a significant decline of more than 16% following the news of Bankman-Fried’s legal troubles, per CoinGecko data.

Wyckoff 'SOS' Could Catapult Bitcoin To $100,000: Fund Manager


                            Charles Edwards, founder of the Bitcoin and digital asset hedge fund Capriole Investments, published a detailed examination of Bitcoin’s current market phase suggesting a bullish trajectory, potentially reaching the $100,000 mark. The analysis hinges on the identification of a Wyckoff ‘Sign of Strength’ (SOS), a concept derived from the century-old Wyckoff Method that studies supply and demand dynamics to forecast price movements.
Understanding The Wyckoff ‘SOS’: Bitcoin To $100,000?
The Wyckoff Method, developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, is a framework for understanding market structures and predicting future price movements through the analysis of price action, volume, and time. The ‘Sign of Strength’ (SOS) within this methodology signifies a point where the market shows evidence of demand overpowering supply, indicating a strong bullish outlook.
Edwards’s observation of an SOS pattern in Bitcoin’s recent price movements suggests that the market is at a pivotal point, where sustained upward momentum is highly probable. In Capriole’s latest newsletter, Edwards offered a precise depiction of Bitcoin’s market behavior, highlighting a period of volatility and consolidation in the $60,000 to $70,000 range.

This phase was anticipated by the hedge fund. Currently, as Bitcoin ventures above its last cycle’s all-time highs, it aligns with the predicted zig-zag SOS structure. Edwards elucidates, “It would not be surprising to see a liquidity grab at / into all-time highs […] All consolidation above the Monthly level at $56K is extremely bullish. It would be uncommon (but not impossible) for price to continue in a straight line up.”
The “zig-zag” phase also perfectly aligns with the halving cycle as BTC tends to consolidate “both months either side of the Halving.” Edwards added that “the realities of a much lower supply growth rate + unlocked pent up tradfi demand will then kick-in and launch 12 months of historically the best risk-reward period for Bitcoin.”
From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s foray into price discovery territory above $70,000 is devoid of significant resistance levels. This opens a pathway to psychological and Fibonacci extension levels, with Edwards pinpointing $100,000 as the next major psychological resistance.

The 1.618 Fibonacci extension from the 2021 high to the 2022 low is noted at $101,750, serving as a technical marker for potential resistance. Edwards reflects on investor sentiment, stating, “You can also imagine quite a few investors would be happy seeing six-digit Bitcoin and taking profit in that zone,” acknowledging the psychological impact of such milestones.

BTC Fundamentals Support The Bull Case
Edwards also delves into the importance of fundamentals, underscoring their role in providing a bullish backdrop for Bitcoin. The introduction of the Dynamic Range NVT (DRNVT), a unique metric to Capriole, indicates that Bitcoin is currently undervalued. Edwards describes DRNVT as “Bitcoin’s ‘PE Ratio'”, which assesses the network’s value by comparing on-chain transaction throughput to market capitalization.
The current DRNVT readings suggest an attractive investment opportunity, given Bitcoin’s undervaluation at all-time price highs. “What’s fascinating at this point of the cycle is that DRNVT is currently in a value zone. With price at all time highs, this is a promising and unusual reading for the opportunity that lies ahead in 2024. It’s something we didn’t see in 2016 nor 2020,” Edwards remarked.

With both technical indicators and fundamental analysis signaling a bullish future for Bitcoin, the anticipation surrounding the upcoming Halving event adds further momentum to the positive outlook. Despite the expectation of volatility and consolidation in the short term, Edwards confidently states, “probabilities are starting to skew to the upside once again.”
At press time, BTC traded at $69,981.

SBF Is Going to Prison for 25 Years

With trial by combat out of the question (at least, for now), Bankman-Fried will have to serve his time the old-fashioned way. Kaplan did take his autism diagnosis and gentle nature into account in one regard – he recommended that Bankman-Fried be placed in a medium or low-security federal prison, preferably one that’s close to San Francisco, where his parents live, arguing that his autism, notoriety, and perceived wealth would make him vulnerable in a maximum security facility.

X Payments To Launch Without Crypto


							

X Payments debuts without crypto, only securing a Money Transmitter License in Louisiana.



Major firms like PayPal and Coinbase comply with Virtual Currency License requirements, unlike X Payments.



New York’s strict crypto license rules impact X Payments’ strategy, reflecting Musk’s regulatory concerns.




In the development of the digital payment industry, X Payments, a new venture by the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), is set to make its debut without cryptocurrency integration. Acquired and rebranded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, X Payments recently received a key Check Sales and Money Transmitters license in Louisiana. 



However, the company’s absence of a Virtual Currency Business License, crucial for crypto asset transactions, signals a delay. This indicates that digital currencies like Dogecoin and others may not be embraced at its inception.



Notably, Louisiana and states like New York require firms engaging in crypto-related activities to obtain a specific Virtual Currency Business License. This requirement has been met by major players such as Robinhood, PayPal, Coinbase, and eToro.



Essential for operations involving virtual assets, this license has not been sought by X Payments, as indicated by the sole issuance of the Money Transmitter License. Consequently, the lack of application for the necessary virtual currency permissions underscores a decision to exclude cryptocurrency payments from its platform initially.



Further insight into the company’s regulatory strategy emerges from the situation in New York, a state known for its stringent licensing requirements for virtual currency businesses. According to a report from BitcoinSistemi, the New York State Department of Financial Services confirmed that X Payments has not applied for a virtual currency license. 



This move aligns with Musk’s previous comments on the challenges of obtaining approval in states like New York and California. Although X Payments has reportedly sought Money Transmitter Licenses in these jurisdictions, the omission of virtual currency licenses suggests a cautious approach to integrating cryptocurrencies.

UAE research showcases challenges facing Blockchain implementation in UAE banking sector | Cryptopolitan

The UAE based ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market) Academy research Centre alongside the College of Business and Economics at the United Arab Emirates University (UAEEU) carried out a research project entitled, “Digital Transformation of banking and financial institutions in the UAE: Understanding the common challenges for collective action” aimed at understanding the current landscape of the digital transformation of banking and financial institutions in the UAE.The results of the research clearly showcase that the UAE banking sector is apprehensive and mostly not enthusiastic about utilizing blockchain technology. The reasons are many, ranging from technical, regulatory and even talent challenges.The research was supported by senior representatives from across the UAE’s financial sector, who shared their insights via interviews conducted by the research team.While the research covered an array of technologies, and the digitization history and movement within the UAE, there was a specific section on Blockchain.Benefits of BlockchainInterviewees did identify the benefits of blockchain, which according to them facilitated the recording and verification of transactions and their authentication.The research report also noted that blockchain technology increases the confidentiality and trust for transactions and tracks assets they noted that hybrid systems (blockchain technology and non-blockchain systems) will still be used for the foreseeable future.Blockchain technology has many other benefits including increased speed of transactions, and reduction in costs and reduced risks because of its tamper proof nature and transparency. So, it is a welcome solution for businesses and customers.As per the research, blockchain contributes as well to cross border payment, KYC and digital currencies. It states, “It can revolutionize the financial services sector in the UAE by streamlining processes and increasing efficiency and transparency while reducing time and costs. These benefits can lead to increased trust in the financial system as trust is a critical factor in financial decision-making globally.”UAE Banks and BlockchainWhen it came to the research on how ready UAE Banks are for Blockchain, the researchers revealed that both the UAE government and the Central Bank of UAE have supported blockchain initiatives. Yet the technology has only been utilized in some functions in the financial sector.However, there is no clear indication of how ready the UAE financial and banking system is to move financial statements into a distributed and consensus-driven ledger.Despite this, interviewees in the report believe that the UAE is an ideal location to leverage the benefits of Blockchain in the financial services and banking sector. Tech ChallengesYet some interviewees believe that most banks have not adopted blockchain because of the technology challenges facing blockchain.There is an opinion that banks will not move solely to blockchain. They believe that many banks are still considering moving financial statements into a distributed and consensus-driven ledger. The reason is that they need more time to be ready with the IT infrastructure required to build the blockchain-enabled ecosystem.Despite the view by some that blockchain can generate greater trust in products and services, it was identified that there is a need for more confidence in blockchain itself. The use cases are scattered so finding the proper use case can also be problematic.Furthermore, cyber security remains a challenge as well as implementing complex IT infrastructure-related blockchain technology in multi-cloud ecosystems.In addition, others believe that the UAE needs to implement a standard protocol among different financial institutions on how to use blockchain. Some replies stated, “Blockchain is a solution looking for a problem to solve.” The opinion exists that there is no universal case for why the UAE needs blockchain and whether it has the skills, technologies, vendors, and partners to implement it.The report stipulated that there are two opposing views on the status of blockchain adoption in the UAE. This is in line with global studies. OMFIF (Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum) indicated that 72% of central banks are unsure that blockchain will be used in future payment systems.Respondents believe it takes time and is costly to transform the existing system. Secondly a standard protocol for operations is not present. Blockchain is also resource hungry.Some interviewees also experienced integrating blockchain into the traditional fiat money systems managed by governments as a considerable challenge.There are also skills gap. Some replies explained that blockchain increases the level of complexity in banking, requiring greater skill levels that are already in short supply.Regulatory challengesAnother challenge mentioned by interviewees was the lack of a unified regulatory framework making cross border transactions difficult.As per the research, “Some banks perceive a need for a regulatory framework at the CBUAE for blockchain.”From a governance perspective, some banks believe compliance and legal could be more blockchain-friendly.ConclusionWhile Blockchain has always looked to be a promising technology for the financial and payments sector, it is still facing resistance, even in the UAE which has been a vanguard for blockchain and advanced technology implementations.Addressing the concerns mentioned in this study should help propel Blockchain further within the banking sector.

Google’s inclusion of Bitcoin wallet balances sparks privacy debate

Google has expanded its features to allow users to search wallet balances across multiple blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon and Fantom. When entering the wallet address, search results display the token balance by network along with the last updated time.Users can search three Bitcoin address formats — P2PKH, P2SH and Bech32 — and view current balances and recent transactions. Incorporating Bitcoin data into search results boosts Google’s accessibility to on-chain activity, leveraging its extensive daily search volume. While some praise Google’s new feature as a move toward mainstream adoption, privacy-centric Bitcoin supporters have raised concerns about centralized data aggregation and its impact on privacy.An example of a Google Bitcoin wallet search. Source: GoogleGoogle’s latest feature comes after it introduced Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain search results, allowing users to check wallet balances with readable domain names like “vitalik.eth” for Ethereum wallet addresses. Google’s recent expansion builds on its initial introduction of Ethereum wallet balance searches in May 2023. In 2022, Google integrated a crypto feature enabling some Ethereum wallet addresses to have their Ether (ETH) balances tracked by the Google search engine, saving the need to make the trip to Etherscan.Related: Amazon takes minority share in ChatGPT rival Anthropic AIThe addition of wallet searches marks a shift in the tech giant’s attitude. Google prohibited Bitcoin-related advertisements in 2018 but recently reversed its stance, allowing spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) advertisements following their approval in the United States in January.ETF products from notable asset managers like BlackRock now appear in search results.In October 2022, Google partnered with Coinbase to allow its customers to pay for cloud services with crypto. The tech firm also initiated a countdown to the Ethereum Merge event — Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022 — by featuring animated pandas moving in sync.In 2023, Google Cloud joined forces with Web3 startup Orderly Network to create user-centric developer tools for decentralized finance (DeFi) to lower the barrier of entry into the decentralized world. The collaboration aimed to address DeFi’s major hurdles: entry barriers and security issues, which have been long-standing challenges in the ecosystem.Magazine: Doctor Who materializes in Web3 — Tony Pearce’s journey in time and space

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



Within a span of just 14 hours, transactions amounting to 1.4 trillion SHIB have been recorded, which raises some questions: Why are whales moving so much SHIB and can it affect its market price?Transaction logs show a sequence of movements that catch the eye — notably from major exchange hot wallets like Coinbase and Binance. These platforms are central to the crypto trade, and their hot wallets are instrumental for immediate transactions.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFor example, one transaction from a Coinbase hot wallet moved 36.3 billion SHIB, valued at approximately $1.03 million, considering the token's price at the time was around $0.0000284.The timing of these large-scale movements coincides with an explosive rally on the Shiba Inu chart. As for now, Shiba Inu is moving in the uptrend, as suggested by the movement above crucial moving averages.The reasons behind these whale movements can be manifold. Some investors might be reallocating their holdings in anticipation of market events or potential news that could affect SHIB's valuation. Others might be taking profits after the recent price surge or redistributing their assets for strategic diversification. The significant transfer activity could also be preparatory, setting the stage for a larger market play.The impact of these whale moves can be quite noticeable, often hinting at heightened price volatility. Market sentiment can swing, and prices can sharply rise or fall in response to such large-scale transfers. For SHIB, which stays and moves in an uptrend, peaking at $0.00003083, these transactions may be of a new market trend.However, one should most certainly stay cautious; while these signals may hint at impending market movements, they do not always lead to immediate or predictable outcomes.

Everything Vitalik Buterin Said About Ethereum's Future


Vitalik Buterin sheds light on how the Dencun hard fork improved the blockchain’s scaling and efficiency. 
Indeed, proto-danksharding marks a significant shift, reducing transaction fees for rollups by a staggering factor of over 100. According to Ethereum’s co-founder, this development paves the way for a more scalable, cost-efficient ecosystem. It addresses long-standing concerns about blockchain bloat and high fees.
Why Ethereum’s Future Looks Bright, According to Vitalik Buterin
The Dencun hard fork signifies a pivotal transition for Ethereum. The blockchain’s shift towards a Layer 2 (L2)-centric ecosystem reflects a forward-thinking approach to decentralization, with major applications transitioning from Layer 1 (L1) to L2. 
This transition reimagines Ethereum’s infrastructure to support a broader range of applications and improve user experience across the board.
Vitalik Buterin emphasizes the importance of separate data availability space. This is a novel concept that allows L2 projects like rollups to store data in a section of a block inaccessible by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The new mechanism enables data to be broadcasted and verified separately from the block.
Therefore, it lays the groundwork for future scalability through data availability sampling. This method promises to dramatically expand Ethereum’s data capacity without compromising security or requiring significant changes from users or developers.

“Because data space is not EVM-accessible, it can be broadcasted separately from a block and verified separately from a block. Eventually, it can be verified with a technology called data availability sampling, which allows each node to verify that the data was correctly published by only randomly checking a few small samples. Once this is implemented, the blob space could be greatly expanded; the eventual goal is 16 MB per slot (~1.33 MB per second),” Buterin wrote. 


Read more: ZkEVMs Explained: Enhancing Ethereum Scalability
The roadmap outlined by Buterin includes several critical areas for development. These include increasing blob capacity and enhancing L2 protocols to maximize data usage efficiency. The introduction of PeerDAS, a simplified version of data availability sampling, and EIP-7623 aims to further streamline Ethereum’s capacity for handling transactions and data, marking an ongoing commitment to scalability and efficiency.
Buterin also addresses the need for improvements within the L2 protocols themselves, from optimizing data compression to enhancing security measures. These improvements are crucial for supporting Ethereum’s growth and maintaining its position as a leading blockchain for decentralized applications.

“We no longer have any excuse. Up until a couple of years ago, we were setting ourselves a low standard, building applications that were clearly not usable at scale, as long as they worked as prototypes and were reasonably decentralized. Today, we have all the tools we’ll need, and indeed most of the tools we’ll ever have, to build applications that are simultaneously cypherpunk and user-friendly,” Buterin emphasized.

The vision is for Ethereum to become a blockchain ecosystem that is capable of supporting a wide array of applications at scale and one that prioritizes user experience, security, and decentralization.

“BOME Will Be the Next SHIB” - Smart Money Investor


							

Smart Money whale predicts BOME will be the next SHIB.



The whale accurately predicted BOME’s rise, buying the memecoin before Binance’s listing.



BOME rallied over 300% within hours, making the whale one of the top gainers.




According to Lookonchain, the smart money on-chain platform, the whale who withdrew $2.3 million from Binance to buy 314 million BOME predicts the novel memecoin will be the next SHIB. The whale accurately predicted BOME’s recent rise and bought the memecoin before Binance listed it on its platform.







In a recent post on X, the identified whale noted it was not all bloom for him as an investor in crypto assets. According to him, a market downturn on March 15 caused him to panic over his capital in Binance Futures, where he risked liquidation. However, he quickly redirected his investment and bought BOME, the Solana-based memecoin.



Although the whale intended to preserve his capital, he claimed to have changed his mind after observing a growth in BOME’s popularity. According to the BOME investor, the newly launched memecoin became as famous as SHIB across the cryptocurrency network, turning the intended capital preservation into a viable investment.



Following SHIB’s growth pattern and the similarity he observed between the Shiba Inu memecoin and BOME, the whale claimed to have envisaged a similar scenario. However, he noted that BOME’s situation was more intense, leading to his decision to invest in the Solana-based memecoin.BOME started trading on November 16, 2024, for $0.00751, rallying over 300% within the first few hours, according to data from TradingView. The whale’s account indicates he invested in the memecoin before the rally began, making him one of the highest gainers from the rally. BOME traded for $0.0133 at the time of writing after pulling back from the initial rally and staging a recovery to the upside.

Vitalik Urges Ethereum Developers To Target ‘Millions’ Of Users Post-Dencun - The Defiant

Ethereum’s chief scientist said Ethereum is ready to support applications servicing millions of users following Dencun's massive L2 fee reductions.Vitalik Buterin, the chief scientist and co-founder of Ethereum, penned a blog post calling on developers to pivot their focus towards building new applications that could serve millions of users following the activation of its Dencun upgrade earlier this month.Ethereum’s highly-anticipated Dencun fork went live on March 13, ushering fee reductions of up to 95% on Layer 2 networks supporting EIP-4844 — the main upgrade included in Dencun. The fee reduction also precipitated triple-digit increases in transaction volume on leading L2s.Buterin described Dencun as the most significant Ethereum upgrade since The Merge, which transitioned the network to Proof of Stake consensus in September 2022.“As of two weeks ago, the two largest changes to the Ethereum blockchain — the switch to Proof of Stake, and the re-architecting to blobs — are behind us,” Buterin said.With fees on many Layer 2s now sitting below six cents, Buterin issued a challenge to developers to begin building applications addressing non-financial use cases that could serve “millions” of users.“Pretty much every crypto application that is not financial speculation depends on low fees — and so while we have high fees, we should not be surprised that we mainly see financial speculation,” Buterin said. “Now that we have blobs, this key constraint that has been holding us back all this time is starting to melt away… What this means to developers is simple: we no longer have any excuse.”Vitalik described the first nine years since Ethereum’s mainnet launch as a “training stage,” with low fees setting the stage for large-scale applications to take flight on the network. He said the tools are now available to build protocols that are both “cypherpunk and user-friendly,” urging developers to work on new applications targeting mainstream use cases including identity, reputation, and governance.“Ethereum is no longer just a financial ecosystem,” Buterin continued. “It's a full-stack replacement for large parts of ‘centralized tech’, and even provides some things that centralized tech does not... We are building tools for millions of people to use. Across the ecosystem, we need to fully readjust mindsets accordingly.”L2s need further developmentVitalik noted that more progress must be made on L2, including further mechanisms improving scalability, the efficiency of blobs, data compression, and security.Buterin said that just five of the 47 Layer 2 networks tracked by L2beat have reached “stage 1” decentralization, meaning they have only “limited training wheels” in place. In a previous post, Vitalik said stage 1 decentralization means that a network boasts a fraud or validity proof scheme, at least a seven-day delay on upgrades, and a multisig account with at least six of eight signers if a security council can override transactions.DeFi AlphaPremium ContentLooking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community.DeFi Daily | WeekdaysDeFi Alpha Letter | WeeklyDefiant Podcast Transcript | WeeklyInbox Dump | SaturdayWeekly Recap | SundayStart for free“The ecosystem's standards need to become stricter,” Buterin said. “So far, we have been lenient and accepted any project as long as it claims to be ‘on a path to decentralization’. By the end of the year, I think our standards should increase and we should only treat a project as a rollup if it has actually reached at least stage 1.”Buterin added that Ethereum’s core developers will continue to work on Layer 1 scaling in the background, describing the introduction of Verkle Trees with Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra fork as the last remaining “truly significant” upgrade still to come to Ethereum’s base layer.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Open Interest Hits Highest Level in 3 Years, Here’s Why



Bitcoin Cash remains a long distance from its all-time high of $4,355 which it attained back in December 2017.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently seeing a surge in open interest, and the reasons may not be far-fetched. On Thursday, open interest in Bitcoin Cash futures perpetual contracts soared to levels not seen since May 2021, reaching an impressive $708.75 million all-time high in the process.
The surge signals an 18.26% rise within 24 hours, and a 165% bump over the last seven days, per Coinglass data. Similarly, BCH price has picked up pace, surging 6.05% in the past 24 hours to stand at $578 as of press time.




Why Bitcoin Cash Is Seeing Record-Breaking Open Interest
The second-ever Bitcoin Cash halving is only a few days away. According to projections, the event, which will cut block rewards in half, is scheduled to take place on April 4. However, traders and investors appear to have already entered a race to secure good positions in anticipation of potential price movements.
A positive takeaway is that the surge in open interest indicates Bitcoin Cash is now more appealing than ever. This is because halving usually brings scarcity – a general recipe for increased value. So, traders might be bracing up for the potential price appreciation that will likely come with the upcoming event.
Miner activity is another factor that could be driving the surge. With the halving expected to bring block rewards from 6.25 BCH to 3.125 BCH, miners too would be doubling down on their efforts.
A popular X user identified as DavidShares has corroborated this line of thought in a recent post. The user reported that the Bitcoin Cash hash rate has doubled in the past week.
Still Struggling with Acceptance
Despite its self-acclaimed technical superiority, BCH is still struggling to warm its way to the hearts of crypto lovers. Its market capitalization is significantly lower than that of Bitcoin (BTC), and it often faces skepticism due to its name and what appears to be a controversial history. To date, many view it as a “Bitcoin wannabe”, while others see it as an unserious experiment and not a real competitor to BTC.
For a better perspective, Bitcoin approaches its fourth halving on April 21 amid record highs. On the other hand, Bitcoin Cash remains a long distance from its all-time high of $4,355 which it attained back in December 2017.
Be that as it may, Bitcoin Cash’s open interest surge is a positive that shows a budding interest in the cryptocurrency. Whether BCH would be able to maintain the momentum, however, remains to be seen. One thing is clear though, the countdown to the halving has injected fresh energy into the BCH market.

Search Engine Giant Google Announced It Will Allow Wallet Address Searches For These Altcoin Networks! - Bitcoin Sistemi

In a significant development for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, Google has expanded its search capabilities to include wallet address searches for various blockchain networks, including Bitcoin, Fantom, Arbitrum, and others.
Google Introduces Wallet Address Searches for Bitcoin, Fantom, Arbitrum and More
This development allows users to conveniently check their wallet balances on different blockchain networks directly from the search engine.



Supported blockchain networks for wallet address lookups now include Bitcoin, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, and Fantom.

Users can enter a wallet address into Google's search bar to get information about the remaining token balance in the wallet for each respective network.
Additionally, search results also show when the balance was last updated, providing users with real-time information on their cryptocurrency holdings.





Google clarified that the balances shown in search results represent only the native token for each network, and the last updated timestamp reflects the balance as of the last external transaction. It is important to note that updates to wallet balances are not instantaneous.
This latest feature builds on Google's recent efforts to support Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains in search results.



ENS provides readable domain names for Ethereum wallet addresses, allowing users to easily identify wallet owners. For example, vitalik.eth, the domain name of Ethereum producer Vitalik Buterin, can be searched on Google to view relevant wallet balance information.
Google's expansion of wallet address searches for various blockchain networks follows its initial support for Ethereum wallet balance searches that began in May of the previous year.





At the time, Google allowed users to search for specific public addresses and view wallet balances directly within the search results.

R. Kiyosaki reveals why ‘Boomer retirements’ are going broke


Not long after his warning that the upcoming stock market crash would particularly victimize his generation, a popular investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ explained why the Boomer generation retirements were going broke.
As it happens, Robert Kiyosaki pointed out that “another giant bank in China went bust” and that the same was happening in the United States “as commercial real estate, specifically office buildings go bust,” according to the X post he published on March 29.

Baby Boomers bust
Furthermore, he pointed out that the Baby Boomer generation was especially at risk due to their retirement plans containing “fake assets” through real estate investment trusts (REITs) “a.k.a. Mutual Fund ETFs for real estate,” and that “Boomer retirements are going broke as paper assets crash.”


To avert the damage caused by the imminent crash, Robert Kiyosaki has advised his followers to “get out of fake assets, including fiat, dollars and buy real gold, silver, and real Bitcoins, (…) regardless of your age,” adding that:

“I do not trust anything that can be printed. Go real… Get real.”

Robert Kiyosaki’s preparation plan
As a reminder, the famous entrepreneur with a massive following on social media earlier explained that his generation was about to suffer greatly in the upcoming “biggest stock market crash in history,” which was still coming amid the Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, excessively printing paper money.
It is also important to note that Robert Kiyosaki has long argued that the best way to protect oneself from the fallout of this massive crash was to focus on investing in commodities and resources as the superior investment in 2024, including precious metals like gold and silver, Wagyu cattle, and maiden cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC).
That said, Bloomberg’s senior expert Mike McGlone has recently warned that commodities might be in trouble, preparing for a possible 30% crash under the influence of underperforming stocks and dipping government bond yield in China, the world’s top commodity consumer, as Finbold reported on March 28.

Under-the-Radar Memecoin That’s Exploded Over 5,800% in a Month on the Cusp of an ‘Epic Sprint’, Says Trader - The Daily Hodl


								Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez is expressing bullish sentiment on an altcoin built on the Ethereum (ETH) scaling solution Base.
Martinez tells his 55,200 followers on the social media platform X that the memecoin Brett (BRETT) could appreciate by around 57% from the current level.










The analyst, however, warns that a correction of around 25% from the current level could occur first.
“The memecoin craze might seem to be cooling off, but I believe it’s just warming up. BRETT on Base is one of those that is gearing up for an epic sprint!
Before soaring, BRETT might dip to the $0.038 support, setting the stage for a bullish breakout to $0.080!”
Based on the analyst’s chart, it appears that the memecoin is forming an ascending triangle pattern in the one-hour time frame. An ascending triangle pattern is considered bullish once the price breaks out of the upper resistance level.
Source: ali_charts/X
BRETT is trading at $0.0509 at time of writing, up by around 5,865% from the February 29 low of $0.000847.
Turning to Bitcoin (BTC), Martinez says that the flagship crypto asset could go up by around 9% from the current level if a key support and psychological level holds.
“Bitcoin appears to be breaking out of a bull flag on the 4-hour chart! If BTC holds above $70,000, we could see a surge of nearly 10% to a new all-time high of $77,000!”

                        HSBC’s recent launch of retail gold tokens underscores the growing adoption of financial asset tokenization, a practice that’s transitioning from early adoption to mainstream use.However, challenges remain in ensuring standardization and broader integration.Asset tokenization leverages blockchain technology to represent ownership of real-world assets (real estate, art, shares, etc.) as tradable digital tokens. These tokens function as digital ownership certificates, enabling fractional ownership. As a result, it broadens the investor base and increases trading activity, thereby enhancing liquidity in these markets.A critical limitation of many current tokenization platforms is their narrow scope, according to Ralf Kubli, board member for the Casper Association. He explained that tokenization platforms prioritize the digitization of the underlying asset itself, neglecting to represent the associated liabilities and cash flows. Consequently, an asset-backed token is created and linked to a blockchain, with a separate PDF document containing the terms and conditions.Overcoming Tokenization’s Transparency Gap with Smart Financial Contracts
However, the dependence on manual cash flow calculations negates the very efficiency and automation that tokenization promises. This lack of transparency and verifiability surrounding cash flows presents a substantial risk, echoing a critical vulnerability exposed during the 2008 financial crisis.“The current projects do not define the cash flows of the underlying financial instrument in a machine-readable and machine-executable term sheet,” Hubli told Cryptonews on Thursday.“Failing to do so means we still have the same risks that have already plagued the financial industry for years. Especially the brute force efforts required around reconciliation.”The Role of Smart Contracts in Tokenization
Kubli proposes a clear solution: ensure all cash flows are algorithmically and deterministically defined within these assets.This necessitates the development of “smart financial contracts.” These contracts wouldn’t just encode information about the tokenized asset, but would also explicitly define all payment obligations of the parties involved. By doing so, they would comprehensively define both the asset and liability aspects of the financial instrument.“Fortunately, we do have such a standard available. Established in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards (ACTUS) Research Foundation was formed to help clarify the cash-flow patterns of financial instruments based on collateralization,” he said.“Now, they have created and deployed an open-source standard that any business could use.”The adoption of standardized cash flow definitions within tokenized assets, as advocated by Kubli, would offer financial institutions real-time insight into their resources and obligations. This enhanced transparency could significantly mitigate the risk of a future crisis mirroring the events of 2008.

In a recent analysis conducted by cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, it has been revealed that Dogecoin whales have engaged in significant accumulation, acquiring approximately 1.4 billion DOGE tokens valued at around $280 million over the course of the last two weeks.This accumulation phase began following a notable decline in DOGE's price, which dropped by 40% in the initial two weeks of March, hitting a low point after reaching a local high of $0.2 per DOGE.Illustrated in the accompanying chart is the discernible uptick in accumulation coinciding with the recent rally, during which the DOGE price surged by 78% within a nine-day time frame. At its current valuation of approximately $0.22 per token, Dogecoin reached a recent peak of $0.2288 per token, marking its highest point since November 2021. This surge in price can be attributed to various factors, including the underperformance to other meme coins such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), which experienced a notable 140% increase in value against Dogecoin over a two-week period.4/20 and "Dogecoin Father"Additionally, anticipation surrounding the month of April has contributed to DOGE's upward momentum, as historical trends indicate a tendency for significant price increases during this time, often linked to cultural events like the April 20 commemoration. Speculation regarding potential catalysts, including the impact of Elon Musk's tweets, further adds to market sentiment.Here's what happened previous April, for example. Despite uncertainties regarding future market movements, one undeniable observation is the strategic accumulation efforts by Dogecoin whales, reflecting their confidence in the cryptocurrency's potential. As enthusiasts and investors monitor these developments, Dogecoin remains the hottest topic in the space of digital assets right now.

Bitcoin's Market Dominance Poised for Growth, Predict Crypto Traders Amidst Ascending Triangle Pattern



                    
Several crypto traders have observed a promising pattern on the Bitcoin dominance chart, hinting at a possible increase in Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market. 



This pattern, known as an ascending triangle, suggests that Bitcoin’s market dominance might be on the rise. 




This technical analysis tool is identified by a chart pattern where the price moves within a confined area, marked by a rising trendline support and a flat resistance line, indicating potential upward momentum in Bitcoin’s market share.



Benjamin Cowen, a notable figure in the crypto community and the founder of Into The Cryptoverse, expressed his optimism regarding Bitcoin’s dominance, telling his substantial audience of over 810,000 on X on March 27, “The BTC dominance train is about to leave the station.” 



This sentiment is echoed by other traders who see the pattern as a bullish sign for Bitcoin.




Another prominent voice in the crypto space, a trader known as Beanie, shared with his nearly 195,000 followers on X that Bitcoin’s dominance is “coming back in a big way.”

Beanie pointed out that in bear markets, Bitcoin often becomes a refuge for investors, attributing to its perceived stability compared to other, more speculative assets. 



This shift towards Bitcoin in uncertain times is not unprecedented, as Beanie compared the current market conditions to the bear market of 2018, contrasting it with the bull market of 2021 where Bitcoin’s dominance saw a significant decline from 70% to 40%.



The landscape of Bitcoin’s market dominance has seen dramatic shifts over the years, from a commanding 85% in March 2017 to a record low of 32.45% by January 2018. As of the latest data from CoinStats, Bitcoin’s dominance stands at 50.1%.



However, not all traders are convinced of this bullish outlook. 



Some, like Zero Ika, who has a following of 43,500 on X, argue that Bitcoin’s dominance is on a “long-term downtrend” from a macro perspective, suggesting a more cautious view of Bitcoin’s market share moving forward. 



This divergence of opinions highlights the speculative nature of the crypto market and the varying interpretations of market data among investors.

While Bitcoin Prepares for Halving, Another Record Prediction Came for BTC! - Bitcoin Sistemi


As the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin prepares for the halving event, which is expected to take place in April, bullish expectations for BTC are increasing.
At this point, while the giant bank Standard Chartered increased its 2024 year-end BTC target to $ 150,000, Acheron Trading CEO Laurent Benayoun predicted that the Bitcoin price could increase by another 150% during the current bull market cycle.



Stating that at this point, the BTC price could rise up to $180,000 in the bull cycle, the famous CEO said that ETFs and the decrease in supply after the Bitcoin halving will be effective in this rise.
Speaking to Cointelegraph, Laurent Benayoun stated that the current bull cycle peak will be $180,000 and said:






“If we look at Bitcoin's past performances, the supply decreases in each cycle. Since the supply will be halved in this cycle, the BTC price may reach 2 to 3 times what we saw in previous cycles.
“I predict Bitcoin will reach $120,000 to $180,000 per unit.”

The famous CEO stated that the loosening of financial policy in the USA will contribute to the appreciation of the Bitcoin price and said, “The market is pricing in a decrease in interest rates because interest rates are horizontal, so it is logical to expect interest rates to decrease in the near future. A possible reduction in interest rates will have a positive impact on the BTC price.” .” said.

                        Posted March 29, 2024 at 7:00 am EST.                     

                    Listen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Fountain, Overcast, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Pandora, Castbox, Google Podcasts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.
Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), FTX’s co-founder, was sentenced to 25 years in prison and $11 billion in forfeiture for massive fraud, marking a historic moment in the crypto industry. Judge Lewis Kaplan emphasized the sentence’s necessity due to Bankman-Fried’s risk-oriented decision-making philosophy known as “expected value” and lack of remorse.
Sam Enzer joined Unchained to unpack the sentencing, discussing the fairness of the length, explaining how the $11 billion forfeiture would work and how it’s different from the bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, Enzer provided insights into the kind of prison SBF would end up in and into the three-year supervised release SBF will face after his prison term. The conversation further delved into the broader impact of the sentencing on the crypto industry, suggesting it could signify the end of a dark chapter.
Show highlights:

Whether the 25-year sentence is fair, according to Sam
What the $11 billion in forfeiture means for SBF
Whether the assets of SBF actually belong to the FTX estate
Where SBF will likely go to prison and why Sam believes that SBF will not go to a maximum security prison
When the clock starts ticking for the 25-year sentence
Why SBF will not be eligible for parole and whether he could get “good time credit”
What the defense will attempt in appealing the conviction
What types of behavior could get SBF enough credit to appeal for a reduced sentence
Why SBF will have to be supervised for three years after his release
How SBF’s philosophy about “expected value,” was the theme of the crime, according to Judge Kaplan
Whether the co-conspirators, such as Caroline Ellison, will be sentenced and serve in prison
Why Sam says that the sentencing represented “the closing of a dark chapter” in crypto

Bitwise exec predicts $1T institutional shift to Bitcoin

Matthew Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, forecasted a huge surge of institutional investments into Bitcoin. He argued that ETFs could inject as much as $1 trillion into the digital asset. Hougan published these comments in a memo to investment professionals, which was a signal of a clear move toward crypto investments.Interest in Bitcoin ETFs is growing among institutional investorsHougan also discussed the volatility issues of Bitcoin in his memo. He accepted that the asset fluctuated in price between $60,000 and $70,000. Nevertheless, he recommended that investors take a long view. Hougan emphasized patience and listed future developments that can strengthen Bitcoin.Foremost among these occurrences is the expected endorsement of spot Bitcoin ETFs on the likes of Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. These developments, Hougan says, would give a good framework for institutional investments in Bitcoin. He pointed out due diligence processes taking place as critical steps before these institutions invest in the asset.The way to trillion-dollar inflowHougan positively commented on the future of Bitcoin, calling it a “rage bull market” and mentioning an almost 300% increase in the value of Bitcoin over the previous fifteen months. He credited this growth to Bitcoin spot ETF approval in January, which allowed investment professionals to participate.The Bitwise executive specified the slow but considerable move of investment professionals into the crypto world. He foresaw that this process would take years rather than months. Hougan also rejoiced in the $12 billion that came into ETFs since their introduction, making it the most successfully launched ETF ever.Prospects for investments and long-term visionAs for the future, Hougan pointed out the possibility of bigger investment inflows into Bitcoin. He claimed that if global drivers of wealth dedicated only 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, it could mean $1 trillion of new investments. This amount is quite huge in comparison to the 12 billion dollars that have already been invested in ETFs, which reflects an untapped potential for the cryptocurrency market.Confidence was Hougan’s characteristic when the price of Bitcoin fluctuated. He proposed that oscillations are a fact of life in the short term, but the long-term future for Bitcoin is bright. He emphasized the strategic significance of professional investors to gradually join the crypto market, a development that he sees as sustaining the growth of Bitcoin through the years.Matthew Hougan’s insights shed light on the burgeoning relationship between institutional investors and the cryptocurrency market. With ETFs as a conduit, Bitcoin stands on the brink of a significant transformation. Hougan’s memo not only reassures existing investors but also signals a watershed moment for potential institutional entrants into the crypto space.

Crypto traders bet $2.4M on spot Ether ETF approval results

Crypto gamblers are placing bets on whether a spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before May 31.Polygon-based crypto gambling site Polymarket shows that traders have placed “Yes” or “No” bets on whether a spot Ether ETF application will be approved before May ends. Over $2.4 million worth of bets have been placed, with about 81% pessimistic about the chances of a spot Ether ETF approval before the end of May. Spot Ether ETF approval’s betting market. Source: PolymarketCrypto traders buy yes or no shares, depending on their predictions of how they expect things to go. The share’s value represents the odds of the bet and changes similarly to how the crypto market goes. At the moment, the cost of a Yes share is $0.19, while No is worth $0.81. This means fewer gamblers believe in the chances of spot ETH ETF approvals before the end of May. The top trader for Yes holds about $84,000 worth of shares, while the top holder for No has around $127,000 in No shares.If the SEC approves a spot Ether ETF before the betting market’s deadline of May 31, 2024, at 11:59 ET, the market will resolve, meaning that holders of Yes shares will be able to cash out their earnings. However, the opposite also applies if there are no approvals before the date. Related: Bitwise files with SEC for spot Ether ETF listingThis is not the first time that crypto traders gambled on ETF approval results. On Jan. 5, Reddit users criticized Polymarket gamblers for betting on whether spot Bitcoin ETFs would be approved by the SEC before Jan. 15. A Reddit user described the betting as stupid and said it was like putting up dollars to win dimes. Meanwhile, another joked that they were about to lose their kid’s college fund to place a bet. The overall bets on the ETF outcomes have reached at least $12 million on the predictions market. The SEC eventually approved the trading and listing of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10.Investment management company Grayscale has expressed confidence in the approvals of spot Ether ETFs in May. On March 25, Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said that the SEC’s perceived “lack of engagement” with applicants does not indicate whether an ETF will be approved or not.

                        Brandon Mintz, CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) ATM operator Bitcoin Depot, predicts a global surge in Bitcoin ATM installations following the Bitcoin halving. Mintz anticipates that the period after the halving, when crypto FOMO (fear of missing out) typically intensifies, will drive increased demand for Bitcoin ATMs. In 2023, crypto ATM installations experienced their first-ever yearly decline in a decade, likely due to the bear market exacerbated by the collapse of several crypto firms.However, the start of 2024 has already shown promising signs, with 1,469 crypto ATMs installed in the first three months alone, compared to the over 3,000 removed during the same period in 2023, according to data from CoinATMRadar. FOMO to Drive Users to Bitcoin ATMs
Mintz expects the FOMO phase and increased adoption of cryptocurrencies to drive more customers to Bitcoin teller machines. “It’s looking really positive that the industry continues to see a lot of growth in kiosk count.”However, he believes it is still early in the cycle, as the halving event, scheduled for late April, approaches. Historically, the uptick in Bitcoin adoption and ATM usage tends to occur after the halving, when the price of Bitcoin experiences significant growth.While the number of teller machines has increased recently, Mintz notes that over the past 18 months, the number of ATM operators has actually decreased.The bankruptcy of Coin Cloud, a major operator with 5,000 ATMs, was one of the notable casualties. Mintz attributes the decline to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, which had a significant impact on the crypto market.Bitcoin Depot, in its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results, reported a 7% increase in revenues compared to the previous year. The company has plans to install 900 teller machines in the first quarter of 2024 and an additional 940 ATMs in convenience stores across 24 states in the United States.Mintz believes that the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States will not negatively impact Bitcoin ATMs. He views the ETF customer base as different from that of Bitcoin ATMs, with ATM users primarily transacting in cash. Mintz suggests that the increased adoption and price growth driven by ETFs could actually lead to more ATM usage as Bitcoin adoption continues to rise.Bitcoin ATM Hacks Become Prevalent
Bitcoin ATM scams are becoming increasingly prevalent, resulting in unsuspecting users losing substantial sums of money. Last year, major Bitcoin teller machine manufacturer General Bytes experienced a security breach that led to $1.5 million worth of BTC stolen from a number of its crypto teller machine operators. At the time, General Byes founder Karel Kyovsky said that a hacker was able to upload their own Java application onto the company’s Bitcoin ATMs, which allowed them to read and decrypt API keys to access funds on exchanges and hot wallets.In August 2022, General Bytes also reported a hack that led to the theft of deposited Bitcoins at ATMs, which led to around $16,000 stolen.

Bitcoin wallets drained as infostealer malware targets Call of Duty players - Crypto Briefing




A group of unidentified cybercriminals has released an information stealer malware targeting gamers who cheat in Call of Duty, resulting in the theft of bitcoin (BTC) holdings from affected players.The malware has already compromised hundreds of thousands of accounts, with the numbers continuing to grow.According to vx-underground, an information security and malware market resource, the malware has impacted at least 561,000 Activision accounts, over 3.6 million Battlenet accounts, as well as over 117,000 accounts from Elite PVPers.
“Impacted users have begun reporting being victims of crypto-draining — their Electrum BTC wallets have been drained. We do not have any information on the amount of money stolen,” vx-underground said in a disclosure published on X.
Activision Blizzard, the American video game holding company behind the Call of Duty series, has confirmed the existence of the malware and said that they are working with PhantomOverlay, one of the providers of cheat engines and codes for the video game series. Activision Blizzard became a subsidiary of Microsoft after a $68.7 billion acquisition in 2022. This is not the first time that game cheaters have been targeted by exploiters. In 2018, a supposed cheat for the popular video game Fortnite turned out to be malware designed to steal Bitcoin wallet login details. Fortnite players were again targeted in 2019, with hackers blocking access to users’ entire device data.
“There is not enough data yet on how [the malware] is spreading, [it] could be only affecting folks who have third-party tools installed,” a source familiar with the matter said.
PhantomOverlay first noticed the suspicious activity when users reported unauthorized purchases. Other cheat providers, such as Elite PVPers, have also confirmed similar attacks on vx-underground in the past week.However, while the current estimated number of compromised accounts is substantial, PhantomOverlay claimed in a Telegram broadcast message on Wednesday that the figures “are inflated” dismissing database logins as “invalid garbage.”In a separate statement, PhantomOverlay also claimed that they had some idea who the threat actors behind the malware distribution scheme are.
“[…] the malware gang is aware of suspicions on them [and have] made it increasingly hard to prove anything,” PhantomOverlay said.
To date, the total amount of crypto stolen remains unknown.

Top 5 Rising Stars: Exploring the Leading Projects on TON Blockchain



                    
The TON (The Open Network) ecosystem is rapidly becoming a pivotal force in the cryptocurrency domain, attracting a wide range of developers and investors due to its burgeoning growth and innovative capabilities. Originally envisioned by Pavel Durov for use with Telegram, TON has since morphed into a powerful, scalable network known for its swift transactions and intuitive applications. This piece highlights five cryptocurrencies within the TON ecosystem poised for noteworthy expansion.



1. Gramcoin (GRAM): The Premier Choice



Potential for growth: Significant




Within the Telegram community, Gramcoin, or GRAM, has carved out a niche for itself, thanks to its innovative approach to mining. Unlike traditional methods, GRAM allows for mining via video cards using Givers — specialized smart contracts that assign computational tasks. This process rewards miners in a manner akin to the Bitcoin protocol but without necessitating the use of costly ASIC hardware. This decentralized mining strategy ensures inclusivity, allowing individuals with video cards to participate, ultimately leading to a more equitable distribution of tokens.



The GRAM community has swelled to include tens of thousands of enthusiasts, drawn by its open and decentralized model. Within this community, many see GRAM as the potential successor to Bitcoin, capable of following in Bitcoin’s pioneering footsteps within the world of digital currencies. While both cryptocurrencies offer fast and cost-effective money transfers, GRAM, operating on the high-performance TON blockchain, sets itself apart with its instant transactions, accessibility to mining, and inclusive nature. GRAM mining only requires a video card and a simple software setup, making it accessible to any user. In contrast, Bitcoin mining now requires substantial initial capital, limiting participation to investors with significant resources.



Within the TON ecosystem, GRAM trades actively on a number of decentralized platforms, including STON.fi, Ton Diamonds, DeDust, and the Cryptorg bot on Telegram. Since its launch in January, GRAM’s valuation has soared by 28,000 times, with its user base expanding to over 30,000 in just a couple of months. With rumors of potential listings on major exchanges swirling within the project’s Telegram group, the GRAM community is abuzz with anticipation for what the future holds. Keen observers have noted significant GRAM token transfers, including transactions of over a million units to wallets linked with MEXC and OKX exchanges.




2. Notcoin (NOT): The Viral Sensation of the TON Ecosystem



Potential for growth: Moderate



NOT, a meme coin originating from the Notcoin clicker game within the TON ecosystem, has experienced a remarkable surge in popularity among cryptocurrency enthusiasts during the winter season. This surge can be attributed to the widespread distribution of free giveaways. As of mid-March 2024, the Notcoin community boasts an impressive user base of over 30 million people on Telegram, with 5 million users actively engaging with the platform on a daily basis.



The game itself is straightforward and integrated directly into Telegram chats, requiring players to simply tap on the Notcoin symbol to earn coins with each press. However, the game introduces a strategic element by limiting the energy available for clicking; it depletes with each tap but gradually regenerates over time, preventing endless clicking. Players can also acquire NOTs through various activities such as participating in specific Telegram groups or channels, using referral links to invite friends, and advancing these friends to higher tiers within the game. An exclusive offer of 50,000 Notcoins was available to Telegram Premium subscribers, but as of April 1, 2024, the Notcoin team announced they would cease the “mining” process of the coin, a decision shared by the Web3 gaming project.



In an interesting twist, NOT has established a friendly relationship with the GRAM project. The creator of NOT holds GRAM tokens and has organized competitions rewarding winners with GRAM tokens. This collaboration highlights the strong sense of community and shared objectives among supporters of these projects.



3.  STON.fi (STON): The Premier DEX within TON



Potential for growth: Above Average



STON.fi stands as a pivotal decentralized exchange (DEX) within the TON ecosystem, operating on an innovative automated market maker (AMM) model. Established in 2022, it utilizes request-for-quote (RFQ) mechanisms and hashed time-locked contracts (HTLC) for seamless cross-chain swaps, positioning itself as a technological frontrunner in facilitating secure and efficient trading.



With a daily trading volume reaching $7 million, STON.fi not only showcases the vibrant activity within the TON ecosystem but also signifies the trust and reliance traders place in its infrastructure. This figure, one of the highest among emerging TON-based platforms, indicates a robust and growing interest in TON’s offerings.



STON.fi’s growth potential is rated above average, buoyed by the TON ecosystem’s expanding user base and the intrinsic value of its technological foundation. The STON token, integral to protocol governance and voting through long-term bets, has seen a remarkable six-fold increase in value from February to March 2024, peaking at $18. This growth trajectory underscores STON.fi’s solid market position and its pivotal role in shaping the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) within the TON ecosystem.



4. DeFinder Innovations (DFI): Pioneering the TON Ecosystem Landscape



Potential for growth: Moderate



DeFinder Innovations (DFI) stands as a comprehensive initiative within the TON ecosystem, showcasing a diverse array of products including the ARBUZ gaming experience with ongoing coin rewards, the DeWallet virtual wallet, the DeFinder Innovations Fund, ArrakenPlanet agricultural simulation game, and a groundbreaking TON-based betting platform. These varied offerings aim to meet a wide range of user preferences, spanning entertainment, financial management, and investment avenues.



DFI is on a mission to emerge as the leading community within the TON ecosystem by addressing gaps in services and product offerings and enhancing TON’s appeal through active user involvement. DeFinder Innovations seeks to unify different facets of the cryptocurrency community, fostering a cohesive environment. This goal is facilitated by the strategic use of the DFI token for ecosystem governance, employing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model to distribute tokens from a communal pool to engage and incentivize participation.



With its moderate growth potential, DFI’s innovative ecosystem and broad service portfolio set it up as a key contender in the TON arena. The initiative has attracted attention and support from the TON Foundation, highlighted by a significant $20,000 donation from the foundation’s leader to DeFinder’s wallet. Furthermore, DFI’s trading value has seen an extraordinary rise of 1440% since December 2023, illustrating a promising path towards realizing its lofty ambitions.



TonUp (TONUP): Catalyzing Project Launches



Potential for growth: Moderate



TonUp operates as an essential catalyst within The Open Network (TON), dedicated to promoting new project launches by providing necessary funding and liquidity. As a foundational element of TON’s project incubation framework, TonUp plays a crucial role in encouraging innovation and contributing to the ecosystem’s growth.



To safeguard and potentially enhance the value of its tokens, TonUp adopts a methodical approach involving regular token redemptions and destructions, effectively diminishing the total supply in circulation. This strategy aims to not only stabilize but also increment the value of TonUP tokens, instilling additional confidence among investors regarding the platform’s future prospects.



TonUP has showcased remarkable performance, with its token value experiencing a 180% increase within a month, peaking at $1.2 on March 25. This surge reflects strong investor trust and market demand for what TonUp has to offer. With its strategic approach to token management and its status as an incubator, TonUP exhibits moderate growth potential, marking it as an instrumental entity in attracting further innovation and investment to the TON ecosystem.



Synergizing Leading TON Initiatives



Examining these five cryptocurrencies unveils their critical contributions and potential within the TON ecosystem. Each project brings unique solutions and strategic visions to the table, enhancing TON’s vibrancy and innovation capacity. From GRAM’s commitment to decentralization to NOT’s captivating gameplay, DFI’s community-centric approach, STON.fi’s trailblazing DEX model, and TONUP’s facilitative role in project launches, these endeavors collectively highlight the expansive opportunities for growth and innovation in The Open Network. As they evolve and broaden their influence, their combined efforts are set to redefine the future of blockchain technology and decentralized finance.

This Memecoin Edges Out PEPE for Third in Market Cap


The Solana meme coin season persists as dogwifhat (WIF) witnesses its market capitalization reach $4 billion on Friday.
WIF touched $4 on Friday morning, a new all-time high from Solana’s latest dog-themed memecoin. 
Dogwifhat Climbs to Third Spot in Memecoin Market Cap Rankings
During the recent price surge, WIF surpassed PEPE to claim third in the rankings. Solana’s inaugural dog-themed meme coin now finds itself behind WIF. Currently, BONK holds a market capitalization that is almost half the size of WIF.

Having launched in November 2023 at a measly price of $0.0000021, WIF has seen a meteoric rise within the crypto sector, climbing as high as 40 in the total market cap rankings.

Solana memecoins continue to see a rise in popularity. The increased interest in trading Solana-based tokens comes off the back of cheaper gas fees. Something Ethereum has yet to overcome. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) recently broke $4 billion and currently sits at $4.5 billion as interest continues to increase. 
Read More: Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030
The recent listing by tier 1 exchanges such as Binance and KuCoin has only added credibility to the project, which describes itself on its website as “LITERALLY JUST A DOG WIF A HAT.”

While WIF remains the top memecoin on Solana, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) remain the top dogs, with market caps 3x and 5x that of WIF. Safe to say no one will be catching the top two anytime soon.

SOL Price Forecast: Consolidation Phase Prepping for a Bull Run?


Since peaking on March 17, Solana has maintained a unique user count consistently above 800,000, signaling a strong community engagement that reflects positively on the Solana (SOL) price. Daily DEX trades on the blockchain remain high, underscoring sustained active participation. 
While the outlook for Solana remains bullish, it’s anticipated that the current consolidation phase may persist a bit longer before the token experiences a significant uptick once again.
Solana Total Value Locked Remains Above $4 Billion
Recently, the Solana ecosystem has achieved a noteworthy achievement by surpassing the $4 billion mark in Total Value Locked (TVL) for the first time since April 2022. This mark was reached on March 15, and since March 22, Solana TLV has remained above $4 billion. 
This significant metric, which tallies the aggregate value of assets deposited across decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms within Solana, serves as a critical indicator of the ecosystem’s overall health, the effectiveness of its DeFi applications, and the degree of user engagement. The recent uptick in TVL shows a revival of investor confidence and an escalating interest in the DeFi offerings available on Solana.

Historically, Solana’s TVL reached its peak in 2021, with figures soaring above $10 billion. This period of exponential growth was followed by a marked decrease, leading to a considerable contraction in TVL. The span from November 2022 to November 2023 saw the TVL fluctuating within the range of $250 million to $350 million, indicating a phase of stabilization and consolidation for the Solana ecosystem. 

This phase was crucial in laying the foundation for the subsequent revival, as it reflected a period of equilibrium that ultimately paved the way for the current surge in DeFi activity on Solana.

Solana Users and DEX Trades Remain Strong
A notable event was the unprecedented daily volume of Decentralized Exchange (DEX) transactions, reaching a record 7.86 million on March 14, setting a new high. From March 14 onwards, Solana’s DEX trading volume consistently exceeded 6 million transactions daily, a stark contrast to the period before December 2023 when daily transaction volumes peaked at 2.2 million on Solana DEXs.
Between March 19 and 24, unique daily DEX trades were always around the 6 million zone. Then, it started to grow again, reaching more than 7 million from March 25 to March 27.

Another metric drawing attention from Solana’s on-chain analytics is the Daily Unique Transaction Signers, which gauges the number of unique users transacting on the network each day.

Starting in January 2024, there’s been a consistent rise in this metric. It reached 823,000 users by March 14 and soared above 2,000,000 by March 17. That represents an increase of 143% in just three days. Yet, after surpassing 2,000,000 daily unique users, the count of daily signers began to diminish, dropping to 936,000 by March 21. After some consolidation, that number started to rise again. 
Solana registered 873,000 unique users on March 23, and that number grew to 1.1 million on March 27.
SOL Price Prediction: EMA Lines Are Drawing a Consolidation
The SOL 4-hour price chart clearly indicates the 20 EMA line nearing a dip below the 50 EMA line. EMAs, more responsive than SMAs, adeptly reflect market trends by weighting recent price movements, crucial for identifying trend directions and reversals.

When the shorter-term 20 EMA crosses under the longer-term 50 EMA, it typically signals a shift towards bearish momentum. This movement often ushers in a consolidation phase, where prices stabilize as the market reaches equilibrium between buyers and sellers.

Observing the SOL price chart, it’s evident that while short-term EMAs stand well above the longer-term ones, they are aligning with current price levels. That indicates that SOL is indeed undergoing a consolidation phase.

Should Solana undergo a correction, it may test the $167 support level. If SOL fails to hold, the next potential support is at $137. However, should the bullish momentum resume, this consolidation could serve as a springboard. This would potentially propel SOL back to its journey to a new all-time high. Its previous record is $259.97, reached in November 2021.

BTC and BCH Make Gains Days Before Halving Takes Place


							

BCH rebounded significantly, climbing above $500 a few days before its next halving event.



Data from Coinglass shows a significant increase in Open Interest in BCH-backed futures.



BTC has gained 7% this week with the return of the bulls after a two-week bearish period.




Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rebounded significantly, climbing above $500 a few days before its next halving event. The Bitcoin fork bounced off a swing low of around $348 to surpass its highest price since December 2021, according to data from TradingView.



Data from Coinglass shows a significant increase in Open Interest (OI) in BCH-backed futures is partly responsible for the recent surge in the cryptocurrency’s price. At the time of writing, the OI in BCH-tracked futures had more than doubled to $500 million on Thursday from $213 million last week.



The surge in OI continued and recorded an additional 17.71% rally within 24 hours as of Friday morning. As of the time of writing, it has increased by an additional $202 million to $702 million. This surge shows increased leveraged bets on more expected price volatility a few days before the halving event. The crypto community expects BCH halving to happen on April 3, 2024, five days from filing this report.



Bitcoin surged alongside BCH following a recent pullback from its all-time high (ATH) of $73,794, according to data from TradingView. The flagship crypto rebounded from a $64,537 recent low, climbing above $70,000. 



BTC has gained 7% this week with the return of the bulls after a two-week bearish period adjudged to be triggered by a profit-taking action after a significant bull run. With the recent rebound, many crypto community members believe Bitcoin is preparing for a new phase of volatility toward the upcoming halving event. Meanwhile, data from Deribit, a leading cryptocurrency options exchange, shows that it will settle $15.2 billion worth of quarterly contracts this Friday, with Bitcoin accounting for $9.5 billion of the volume. Users expect this development to catalyze the top crypto’s volatility ahead of the halving event, which will take place on April 20, 2024.

In a remarkable turn of events, over 264 million Dogecoin (DOGE) were transferred in significant transactions involving the trading platform Robinhood. These movements, documented by Whale Alert, a service dedicated to tracking large transactions, highlight the ongoing interest in Dogecoin, especially against the backdrop of its recent price surge.The first transaction recorded by Whale Alert involved an enormous transfer of 200 million DOGE, with a market value of approximately $43 million, from an unidentified wallet to Robinhood. Hours after this initial transfer, a second significant movement was detected. This involved 64,438,642 DOGE, valued at roughly $13.8 million, moving from Robinhood to an unknown wallet. These transfers out of Robinhood indicate a considerable accumulation of Dogecoin. They are characteristic of "whale" behavior in the market. Whales possess the market power to influence price movements and market dynamics significantly. Their actions, such as the massive accumulations and transfers of DOGE observed, can lead to rallies or trigger volatility in the market. Notably, the involvement of a mainstream trading platform like Robinhood in these transactions shows the accessibility and interest in Dogecoin among retail investors. Robinhood's platform facilitates easy entry for individuals looking to participate in cryptocurrency trading, thereby amplifying the impact of trading on market dynamics.Dogecoin price holds gainsThese transactions come at a time when Dogecoin has shown remarkable bullish behavior. The price of DOGE has surged to $0.2121, marking a 65.61% increase in the last 30 days. Such a price rally in Dogecoin often attracts interest from both individual and institutional investors, contributing to increased trading volumes and market activity.Several factors contribute to Dogecoin's popularity and price volatility, including social media influence, endorsements by public figures and its cult status within the cryptocurrency community. Moreover, the broader market trend toward meme coins and speculative assets has further fueled Dogecoin's rally.As Dogecoin continues to rally, the crypto community remains divided on its future prospects, with some viewing these developments as indicators of confidence and others as a reminder of the inherent volatility and speculative risk in the market. The actions of large investors and the role of platforms facilitating access to these markets will continue to be critical in shaping market trends.

Ethereum Founder Lays Out 'What Else Memecoins Could Be'


								In a blog post, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, has laid out a vision for the future of memecoins that challenges the crypto community to rethink their potential beyond mere speculative assets. Titled “What Else Could Memecoins Be?”, published on March 29, 2024, Buterin’s comprehensive analysis not only critiques the current state of memecoins but also proposes innovative pathways for their evolution.
Ethereum Founder Is Disappointed With Memecoins
Reflecting on the genesis of his thinking around digital currencies, Buterin recounts, “Ten years ago, two weeks before the Ethereum project was publicly announced, I published this post […] arguing that issuing coins could be a new way to fund important public projects.” He envisioned digital currencies like AntiCancerCoin or ClimateCoin as mechanisms through which societal contributions could be directed towards significant causes, thereby leveraging blockchain technology for the public good.
The discourse around memecoins today, however, has deviated significantly from such ideals, Buterin notes. The resurgence of meme coins has been marked not by innovation but by controversy, including instances of overt racism within certain Solana meme coin projects.

This trend has stirred discontent within the crypto space, leading figures like Ethereum philosopher Polynya to express severe disillusionment. Buterin quotes Polynya’s reaction to underscore the depth of the community’s unease: “Even long-time Ethereum philosopher Polynya is very very unhappy.”
Seeking solutions to this quandary, Buterin introduces the concept of “charity coins” — cryptocurrencies where a substantial portion of the token supply is allocated to charitable endeavors. He reminisces about past initiatives like “GiveWell Inu,” which supported effective altruism through GiveWell, and “Fable of the Dragon Tyrant,” aimed at funding anti-aging research among other causes.
Despite mixed results and challenges, such as the dissolution of GiveWell Inu and community issues with “Fable of the Dragon Tyrant,” Buterin sees potential in the idea. He recalls the positive impact of donating half the supply of the Dogelon Mars token to the Methuselah Foundation, highlighting the benefits of aligning cryptocurrency projects with charitable causes.
Integration Into Blockchain Gaming
Expanding on this idea, Buterin advocates for the integration of gaming into the memecoin ecosystem through what he terms “Robin Hood games.” These games would not only offer entertainment but also provide a means of supporting public goods and enabling financial gains for participants, especially those from lower-income backgrounds.

He emphasizes the importance of creating genuinely engaging and enjoyable games, critiquing and praising the play-to-earn model exemplified by Axie Infinity for its mixed outcomes. Buterin is particularly enthusiastic about the potential for these games to democratize cryptocurrency participation, offering a unique blend of fun, financial opportunity, and societal contribution.
He states, “Don’t just make a coin, make a game. But make an actually meaningful and fun game. Don’t think Candy Crush on the blockchain; think World of Warcraft on the blockchain.”
In his concluding remarks, Buterin calls for a more nuanced approach to evaluating crypto projects, urging the community to recognize and support initiatives that align with their values, even if they stem from traditionally criticized sectors. He advocates for a crypto space that is not only more inclusive and entertaining but also one that actively contributes to the betterment of society.
I have zero enthusiasm for coins named after totalitarian political movements, scams, rugpulls or anything that feels exciting in month N but leaves everyone upset in month N+1. […] At the least, more good memecoins than bad ones, ideally those that support public goods instead of just enriching insiders and creators.
At press time, ETH traded at $3,530.

DOGE dynasty: Whales scoop up $280 million in two-week buying spree


Amid bullish times for the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency sector, the popular doge meme crypto Dogecoin (DOGE) is recording gains on all of its charts and massive interest coming from the market’s largest investors, suggesting more price increases.
As it happens, Dogecoin whales have bagged 1.4 billion DOGE or around $280 million worth of the asset in the past two weeks alone, according to the most recent data observations shared by renowned crypto trading expert Ali Martinez in an X post on March 29.

Indeed, the whale purchases of Elon Musk’s favorite doge meme crypto, specifically in the 10 million – 100 million range, have intensified in recent weeks, soaring from the mere 15.33 billion DOGE in mid-March to the current 16.73 billion DOGE, as the analyst’s chart demonstrates.


Why is Dogecoin going up?
Meanwhile, Dogecoin is boasting a price gain of 5.14% on its daily chart, adding a whopping 32.20% to its value across the previous seven days, and accumulating an even more impressive advance of 114.88% in the last month, currently trading at $0.21411, according to the most recent information.

So, why is Dogecoin going up? Notably, the latest gains are happening against the backdrop of the increased whale accumulation but also Musk, the CEO of electric vehicle (EV) behemoth Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), announcing the company’s plans to enable DOGE payments for its products.
Dogecoin price prediction 2024
So, how high will Dogecoin go? If whale activity is anything to go by (and it is), this asset is looking at a bright future this year, with some experts setting their DOGE price prediction as high as $1 by mid-April, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms eyeing $0.41-$0.51 area as their Dogecoin price prediction 2025.
In conclusion, although things are looking great for the top doge meme coin now, it is important to remember that making any definitive Dogecoin prediction is challenging, as the situation in the crypto industry can change, so doing one’s own research and monitoring any Dogecoin news is critical when investing.

Regulation crypto: the SEC can proceed against Coinbase

In a significant development in crypto regulation, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of New York has ruled that the case involving the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, must proceed, denying the motion to dismiss.
This decision represents a crucial moment in the ongoing legal examination of Coinbase’s operations in the cryptocurrency sphere.
SEC moves against Coinbase: the government regulatory authority’s attempt to regulate the crypto world
Judge Failla’s decision stems from the SEC’s allegations that Coinbase operated as an exchange, broker, and clearing agency without proper registration, in addition to conducting an unregistered sale of securities through its staking program.
The judge has granted most of the SEC’s requests, but has rejected the claim that Coinbase acted as an unregistered broker with its Wallet application.
Coinbase, which was sued by the SEC last year, vehemently contested these accusations, requesting the dismissal of the case and accusing the regulatory authority of using a “regulation through enforcement” strategy. 
However, with the court ruling in favor of the SEC, the case is now set to proceed to trial, which will likely begin in 2025.
The judge’s decision highlights the SEC’s ability to take legal action against cryptocurrency platforms operating outside regulatory frameworks.
Allowing the case to proceed, Judge Failla highlighted the importance of adhering to securities laws in the thriving cryptocurrency sector.
One of the crucial aspects of the ruling concerns the application of the Howey test, a legal standard established by a 1946 case of the United States Supreme Court. 
The test evaluates whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract and therefore as a security. Judge Failla has ruled that some cryptocurrency transactions on the Coinbase platform met the criteria outlined in the Howey test, reinforcing the SEC’s allegations of selling unregistered securities.
The irrelevant charges to the court’s judgment
However, not all of the SEC’s accusations carried weight in the court’s ruling. The claim that Coinbase’s Wallet application operated as an unregistered broker was rejected by Judge Failla. 
The judge ruled that the SEC did not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim, highlighting a significant victory for Coinbase in the legal battle.
Furthermore, Coinbase had invoked the doctrine of big questions in its defense, arguing that the SEC’s actions lacked a clear authorization from Congress for matters of significant national importance. 
Despite Coinbase’s claims, Judge Failla was not convinced, emphasizing that the impact of the cryptocurrency industry is not significant enough to constitute a major part of the American economy.
Furthermore, Coinbase has argued that the SEC violated due process by initiating charges without proper notice.
However, Judge Failla rejected this claim, citing the SEC’s efforts to provide guidance and warnings to Coinbase regarding potential enforcement actions related to the sale of certain crypto-assets.
This legal battle between Coinbase and the SEC highlights broader issues regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. 
With the continuous evolution of the cryptocurrency sector, regulatory clarity remains a pressing concern for market participants and authorities.
The outcome of this case could set important precedents for future regulatory actions and for the overall trajectory of the cryptocurrency market.
Conclusions
In conclusion, Judge Failla’s decision to allow the advancement of the SEC’s requests against Coinbase represents a significant development in the ongoing legal saga between the exchange and the regulatory authority. 
On one hand, the ruling presents challenges for Coinbase, especially regarding the alleged securities violations, on the other hand it highlights the complexities and uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrency regulation. 
As the case moves towards trial, all eyes will be on the courtroom as it faces the intersection between law and innovation in the digital asset landscape.

Future of Ethereum: Vitalik Buterin's Vision Unveiled


							

Vitalik Buterin talked about the future of Ethereum post-Merge and Dencun upgrade.



ETH has entered a new phase where “blob fee markets” enter “price discovery mode.”



Buterin said that the debut of Blobscriptions brings a dynamic element to the fee structures




Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin offered insights into the future trajectory of the Ethereum network, shedding light on key developments and innovations while providing a roadmap for Ethereum’s scalability.



In a series of posts on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Buterin acknowledged the existence of “blobs” while asking, “Where do we go from here?”



Buterin talked about the Dencun hard fork, stating that Ethereum entered a new phase where “blob fee markets” entered “price discovery mode,” marking a pivotal moment in the blockchain’s development. 



Additionally, the introduction of Blobscriptions brings a dynamic element to Ethereum’s fee structures, signaling a shift towards greater flexibility and efficiency in transaction processing.



Buterin also highlighted the importance of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which is paving the way for future scalability enhancements. Buterin said:




“I argue that now that the merge and EIP-4844 are done, we are decidedly on the right side of the S-curve. Further L1 changes will be quite meaningful and significant, but relatively milder.”




He also advocated for raising the standards of rollups, calling for a shift towards more advanced iterations that offer enhanced security and performance.



The Ethereum co-creator concluded that Ethereum is currently transitioning from a period of “very rapid L1 progress” to a phase where the L1 development will be significant but “more mellow and less disruptive to applications.” Buterin also said that Ethereum has upgraded from being “just” a financial ecosystem to being much more. 



As reported earlier, Buterin also emphasized the critical importance of ERC-4337 as account abstraction (AA) gains traction.

This is Why Another Nation Has Banned WorldCoin


Portugal has imposed a temporary halt on Sam Altman’s WorldCoin from collecting biometric data. 
The decision highlights escalating global concerns over privacy and data protection rights with technologies that harvest sensitive personal information.
Portugal Bans WorldCoin
WorldCoin, aimed at creating a unique digital ID and financial network through facial scans, has registered over 4.5 million individuals across 120 nations. Yet, the venture’s ambition hit a snag in Portugal, where the CNPD highlighted the acute risk to citizen data protection, citing the need for “urgent intervention.” 
The suspension, affecting a service that engaged over 300,000 Portuguese citizens, follows numerous complaints regarding unauthorized data collection. This is particularly regarding minors and issues around consent withdrawal and data deletion.
Still, Jannick Preiwisch, WorldCoin’s Data Protection Officer, emphasized the project’s adherence to legal standards, expressing surprise at the allegations. He assured efforts are underway to rectify any reported issues, especially concerning underage participation.

“The report from CNPD is the first time we are hearing from them regarding many of these matters, including reports of underage sign-ups in Portugal, for which we have zero tolerance for and are working to address in all instances, even if a matter of a few reports,” Preiwisch said.

This development in Portugal mirrors broader skepticism and regulatory scrutiny facing WorldCoin. Countries like Spain and Kenya have similarly curtailed WorldCoin’s operations. These nations voiced apprehensions about the safety and ethical implications of biometric data collection. 
Meanwhile, privacy advocates and regulators, including the Bavarian state regulator spearheading the EU’s investigation into WorldCoin, question the adequacy of protections against potential misuse or breach of personal data.
Despite these challenges, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin commended WorldCoin’s efforts to address privacy concerns. He highlighted advanced cryptographic solutions, showcasing the project’s commitment to evolving in response to criticism.

“[WorldCoin] has been doing quite a good job of taking the privacy critiques seriously and designing its system to be more and more data-minimal. Modern cryptography is truly amazing,” Buterin said.

How much will MARA stock be worth if Bitcoin hits $100,000?


Notable absentees of the ongoing crypto market rally have, for the most part, been major Bitcoin (BTC) mining firms. 
This, perhaps, isn’t surprising given that the companies not only suffered immense damage during the ‘crypto winter’ but their prospects for the Bitcoin halving might not be as stellar as might appear at first glance.
Indeed, as the mining rewards are set to become smaller, Bitcoin prices will have to increase significantly for the miners to remain profitable and the world’s premier cryptocurrency would have to rise above $120,000 for firms like Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) to maintain relative parity with the 2021 bull market.


Still, given the halving is likely to favor bigger firms, and that stocks like MARA have done all except match the crypto market rally, they may constitute value buying opportunities as of late March 2024. 
With these troubling yet promising circumstances in mind, Finbold decided to ask and try to answer, how high could the stock of Marathon Digital – the biggest Bitcoin miner by market cap – rise should BTC hit $100,000?
MARA stock price chart
So far, the stock of Marathon Digital has shown some correlation with Bitcoin’s movements, though nowhere near as much as companies such as MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR). 
While Bitcoin’s 52-week surge of 147.67% was accompanied by MARA’s rise of 184.03%, the coin’s year-to-date (YTD) rally of 58.95% wasn’t shadowed by the miner which declined 1.53% in the same time frame.

In fact, the correlation between the two appears to have weakened in recent weeks. 
While BTC reached a new all-time high in March. Marathon Digital shares erased most of their earlier 2024 gains.
The miner has, however, been catching up in the last 5 trading days and managed a 7.17% climb to $22.58.
Where will MARA stock stand if BTC hits $100,000?
The recently-observable correlation – or lack thereof – between MARA and Bitcoin makes predicting future movements for the stock difficult. Indeed, the 2024 figures hint that Marathon Digital shares might remain level, or drop toward $20 even should Bitcoin hit the long-awaited high.
Both the longer-term and the most recent performance, however, demonstrate that the miner could match and slightly exceed Bitcoin’s rise and that should the cryptocurrency land at $100,000, MARA could climb to a range between $35 and $40.
Finally, Bitcoin’s movements could have a disproportionate effect on the miner’s shares. There remains a strong possibility that should BTC rally in a fashion akin to its previous halvings – maybe reaching or exceeding Robert Kiyosaki’s 2024 $300,000 price target – MARA could repeat its 2020 and 2021 rally and surge toward $1,400.
While such a 6,000% rally might appear more appropriate for a penny stock Marathon Digital was at the time of Bitcoin’s last halving, it is worth remembering that 2024 is no stranger to already major stocks surging at exceptional rates.
In fact, Super Micro Computer’s (NASDAQ: SMCI) involvement with artificial intelligence (AI) led to a 253.84% YTD rise and MicroStrategy’s own connection to Bitcoin saw it surge 148.79%.
Conversely, should BTC fail to meet post-halving expectations and offer only a middling rally, Marathon Digital is in danger of plummeting back into penny stock territory on fears of evaporating profitability.

The Crisis Between Binance and Nigeria Continues! Counteraction from Binance Manager! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Tigran Gambaryan, one of the detained executives of Binance, has initiated legal action against the Nigerian National Security Advisor and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for alleged violation of his fundamental human rights.
Binance Manager Tigran Gambaryan Filed a Lawsuit Against the Nigerian Government Following His Detention
According to local news, Gambaryan filed the lawsuit, arguing that his detention after arriving in Nigeria in February and subsequent confiscation of his passport violated the country's constitution, which guarantees the right to personal freedom.


According to Punch News published in Nigeria, Gambaryan's application demands that his passport be returned immediately and that the Nigerian authorities apologize to him.
As Binance's head of financial crimes compliance, Gambaryan's legal challenge highlights the seriousness of his situation and the urgency of addressing allegations that his rights have been violated.






In a parallel development, Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance's Africa regional manager and another person detained with Gambaryan, reportedly filed a similar complaint.
Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, both foreign nationals, arrived in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, on February 25 and were immediately taken to a government facility the next day. According to Punch, they were detained there after meeting with Nigerian authorities.


Amid these legal battles, the Nigerian government has escalated its stance against Binance, filing four tax evasion charges against the global cryptocurrency exchange.
The Federal Supreme Court of Nigeria ordered Binance and two executives to appear in court on April 4.





According to Nigeria's Vanguard News, Nigerian authorities also announced that they intend to enlist Interpol's help to capture Anjarwalla for trial.

Zero-Knowledge Large Language Models [zkLLMs]: Revolutionizing Privacy in the AI Ecosystem

We are aware of the fact that encrypted data is the heart of the decentralized ecosystem right? In the sense that there is a system that essentially relies on anonymity and privacy. And so naturally as the ecosystem grows we can easily assume that the need for performing computations on encrypted data with the power of AI algorithms has seen a rise.
This in turn has also brought up the charts for the demand for privacy-preserving systems, don’t we agree? This is where zkLLMs step in, my fellow degens!
Okay, let me tell you that if you and I were to enter a prompt to run a computation using an AI engine there can be two major things that would determine the quality of that computation. Want to know what are those?
Well, they are obviously the privacy (of the prompt provided, the parameter on which the computations happen and output data generated) and also mind you the efficiency of actually running that computation. 
Zero Knowledge Proofs works for the privacy of the data so that it is preserved and talking about the Large Language Models (aka the trained Machine learning models) these basically ensure that the computation is done efficiently within seconds by an algorithm trained on an incredibly massive amount of data. Do you get it? 
Zero-Knowledge Large Language Models (zkLLMs) are a way forward to keeping user data supremely private while utilizing powerful AI models you know. Built on none other than regular LLMs, ZK LLMs make use of zero-knowledge proofs (zkPs) to make sure the AI model processes user data correctly without ever actually seeing it. 
Understanding Zero Knowledge Proofs (zkPs)
For the uninitiated let me tell briefly that Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) is a powerful cryptographic tool that allows one party (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) of the truth of a statement without revealing literally anything about the statement itself. Well imagine how precious it can be in situations where privacy is a concern, am I right? 
To provide you degens an overview of what is the function on ZKPs, I’d say that they–
Preserve the Privacy of Our Data
Yes, the importance of zero-knowledge proofs lies in the fact that the prover never reveals the underlying information used to prove the statement. So it is comparable to proving you’re over 21 without showing your ID you know. In that situation, a ZK proof allows you to literally demonstrate this using a cryptographic protocol which ultimately ensures that your date of birth remains confidential. 
Verify Our Computations
ZKPs have also proved to be important in verifying the accuracy of computations performed on sensitive data. Is it that crucial, you ask? Well yes because simply knowing the outcome doesn’t guarantee the computation was done correctly. I mean imagine a situation of outsourcing a complex financial calculation and a technology like zero-knowledge proof that allows the recipient to verify the answer without ever needing access to the original financial data.

Nevertheless, if you decide to nerd out on zero knowledge proof then here is your ultimate guide to understand this concept more deeply.

Machine Learning and ZK Proofs: A Perfect Match
For us fellow degens living under a rock let me tell you that Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have been on fire lately and the likes of Google, Microsoft and Apple are all turning to this new tech. 
Machine learning is essentially where algorithms are trained on different data sets to make predictions or answer queries you know. These algorithms learn from a large set of data and ZK proofs can help them protect the privacy of the data.
Now the interjection of zkP + ML = zkML is way too cool to be missed out on. zkML allows the machine learning model to learn from the data provided without you know it being ever exposed for privacy and security reasons.

Here’s the complete walk-through of this nascent technology called Zero Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML) that everyone talks about to have improved the state of AI/ML.

Traditionally speaking training machine learning models often naturally required access to incredibly vast amounts of data which may contain sensitive information. And this is where zk proofs stepped in to bridge the gap of privacy (as well as data security) in providing sensitive information by allowing these models to be trained and used without revealing the underlying data. 
Now you might wonder what are LLMs then? Well Large Language Models aka LLMs are a kind of Machine Learning Models which are trained on certain data of certain logics. 
Let’s get a deeper understanding of LLMs before we see how they interact with zk Proofs, shall we?
What Are Large Language Models?
A diagram illustrating the interaction between a user’s prompt, a large language model, and its training data, demonstrating the cycle of input and output in AI language processing.
Well, Large Language Models (or LLMs) are machine learning models that are you know explicitly trained on incredibly huge amounts of data to understand the complexities of language. These ML models use deep learning techniques to process and analyze natural language text and this understanding ultimately leads them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to our queries or prompts.
LLMs are used in a wide range of applications including language translation, text generation and sentiment analysis. Some well-known examples of LLMs include:-

GPT-3.5/4
BERT 
Transformer models 

While we can agree to the fact that machine learning has been going rogue it is also agreeable that combining the fruits of Zero Knowledge Proofs and LLMs can bring unimaginable feats to the computer world. And zkLLM for the real world is like hiring a digital accountant or an assistant with the help of whom you can get your accounts done and books maintained but you don’t even have to expose your data and neither does the virtual assistant reveal their trade secrets (algorithm).
Now join me in the journey of learning how this synergy between ZK Proofs and LLMs works!
zkP + LLM = zkLLM, What Is It?
You know ZK proofs can be used by LLMs to prove the existence of non-explicitly programmable properties of the input. I know that sounds intimidating. Well, what I’m trying to say is that an LLM could prove a sentence conveys a specific sentiment (e.g., sarcasm) without revealing the underlying algorithms used to determine that sentiment you know. This opens doors for more nuanced and privacy-preserving applications of LLMs.
While ZK proofs are important enough for proving the correctness of computations in zkLLMs, they alone cannot handle the complex computations required by these powerful AI models. This is where Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) comes into play.
Fully Homomorphic Encryption: Computing on Encrypted Data
Fully Homomorphic Encryption is a cryptographic technique, by the use of which computations can be performed on encrypted data directly. Yes, you heard it right! Now computers have the super power to perform computations without decrypting the data itself. 
The FHE method ensures the security of the data throughout the computation process. This technique has the potential to revolutionize the field of secure computing. Tt enables computations on sensitive data to be performed on data without ever revealing the underlying information itself. 
Imagine a locked box with special properties. You can put your data inside and perform computations without opening the box. FHE allows zkLLMs to do calculations or operate on encrypted user data. The LLM can perform complex tasks like sentiment analysis or text generation on the encrypted data itself, without ever decrypting it.
When it comes to saving privacy, zkPs and FHE work hand in hand and complement each other working towards the same goal. 
zkP and FHE: The Ultimate Powerhouse of Privacy Preserving
Zero-knowledge proofs (zkPs) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) are two powerful tools that when used together can create a privacy-preserving powerhouse.
As we already know zkPs allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) the truth of a statement, without revealing any additional information about the statement itself. FHE on the other hand, allows computations to be performed directly without decrypting the data. This is useful in situations where privacy is a concern. 
ZK proofs and FHE form the backbone of zkLLMs. Here’s how they work together:-

FHE encrypts the user data. This ensures the data remains safe throughout the process.
The user performs asks the LLM to perform computations on the encrypted data. zkLLMs are designed to work efficiently with FHE for these computations.
ZK proofs prove that the asked queries/computations were solved correctly. The LLM proves it processed the data as instructed without revealing the data or the intermediate steps.


Learn about the new way of thinking about cybersecurity that’s going rogue lately known as zero trust architecture (ZTA) in this comprehensive article by DroomDroom.

As we go deeper into understanding zkLLMs, one thing we need to keep in mind is the value of zkLLMs is created because decisions based on vast amounts of data are made securely and privately within seconds. To quote again ‘Within Seconds’.
The use of LLMs is of no value if the decisions are taking more time than they’re supposed to. Combining LLMs with zkProofs can sometimes cause an overload, making the time taken to perform a particular computation long. 
Don’t scratch your head over it though. The answer to the problem we are facing it lies in some brilliant data quantization mechanisms that help us reduce the presented data to fewer bits ultimately improving efficiency and getting us back to speed.
What are Quantization Techniques & How do they work?
Data Quantization techniques are like data compression methods. These methods essentially reduce the number of bits required to carry a piece of information. This translates to smaller file sizes and faster processing. So to keep it sweet and simple, quantization plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of zkLLMs.
Here’s how quantization techniques work. 
zkLLMs work with large stacks of data to deliver intelligent responses. However, the movement of this data and processing of this data can be time-consuming and expensive. Quantization techniques my friends, are the angels in this disguise. These techniques shrink the size of this data so that fewer bits are required to carry that data.
For Example:-

Numbers can be rounded or compressed to a smaller range to reduce the size of detail
Similar data points can be grouped and assigned a single codeword

Once smaller data packers are created, this enables faster movement of the data. This means less data to store means less space needed, and less data to process translates to faster computation and lower power consumption for zkLLM operations. 
Cerberus Squeezing (along with zkLLMs) is one such method used by the BasedAI network in their approach to speed up the computations made by their AI network engines. 

Hitesh an active member of the crypto community, brilliantly explained on X platform how BasedAI is a prime example of the the excellence of zkLLMs. Hitesh went on to explain that
BasedAI is a system that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to process information while keeping user data confidential. 
The company achieved this through a combination of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and a technique called Cerberus Squeezing. With FHE the data stays encrypted even during computations and Cerberus Squeezing ensures that the process is done with efficiency and avoids and slowdowns.
BasedAI creates a decentralized network where users interact with miners and validators through “Brains”. These Brains are basically nothing but containers that can run modified LLMs. The network gives incentives to partners in order to maintain high performance through a reward system based on $BASED tokens.
Some Other famous techniques include Uniform, Non-uniform, Scalar and Vector Quantization.
Now that we have determined how zkLLMs work we have solved the problem of efficiency. Let’s take a look at some real-world use cases for zkLLMs.
Real-Life Use Cases of zkLLM 
In today’s world privacy and powerful AI capabilities are both necessary. zkLLMs are a relatively new concept, but their applications hold some promise for real-life situations.  
Here let’s take a look at some real-life situations where zkLLMs can be applied:-
Secure Medical Diagnosis
Example of application of zkLLM in Healthcare

zkLLMs can be very useful in the healthcare industry. Suppose a patient uploads their medical records to a Cloud-based AI system. zkLLMs could analyze the data while keeping the sensitive patient information still encrypted and still identify any potential health issues. This protects patient privacy while allowing for advanced AI-powered diagnosis.
Personalized Financial Analysis
One of the primary uses of zkLLMs could be to analyze user’s encrypted financial data. Data from bank statements and investment portfolios can be scanned by the LLMs and asked to provide financial advice based on that. The LLM could identify investment opportunities without ever decrypting the financial information.
Secure Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
zkLLMs can also be used to power chatbots and virtual assistants. These bots can solve the queries of a user magically within seconds! What’s more?, the query still remains encrypted which means that the privacy of the user is maintained as well.
Private Content Moderation
Another great application of zkLLMs could be to analyze, identify and remove harmful or inappropriate content on the internet. The Large language Model operates on the encrypted chats to identify any violations or inappropriate data. On the other hand, ZK proofs can be used to show that the chats were scanned correctly. 
Secure Scientific Research
zkLLMs can be used to analyze sensitive scientific data such as genomic data and other research findings. 

Learn about the nitty-gritty of blockchain security including the threts and best practices for developers in this extensive guide by DroomDroom.

Conclusion
Zero-knowledge Large Language Models (zkLLMs) show that AI has taken a significant leap forward by offering language models that prioritize user privacy. Combining the strengths of zero-knowledge proofs (zkPs) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption zkLLMs ensures that computations are performed correctly in a secure manner. 
That’s amazing, isn’t it? this outright opens doors to a wide range of privacy-preserving applications across various sectors. Even though the zkLLM technology is still in its early stages, the potential benefits are undeniable. As the technology moves forward, it makes way for a more secure and privacy-aware digital future.

Dogwifhat takes third spot in meme coin rankings by market cap - Crypto Briefing




Solana-based meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF) has experienced a significant surge this week, overtaking Pepe to become the third-largest meme coin by market capitalization.Based on data from CoinGecko, WIF now has a market cap of $3.6 billion, following Shiba Inu’s $18.2 billion (SHIB) and Dogecoin’s $31 billion (DOGE). The dog with a hat meme token has outranked Pepe, which has a market cap of around $3.3 billion.There is relative stability across crypto markets, but the meme coin category has outperformed other sectors, such as decentralized finance, and exchange-issued tokens, such as BNB.For a brief period, the WIF token touched the $4 level, a feat that has been touted as its strongest daily performance since it launched. Out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap, WIF is now on the 38th place.The recent meme coin rally started early Thursday amid speculations of Dogecoin (DOGE) being used on an upcoming payments service of X, despite no official communication from the company. Purchases for DOGE-tracked futures saw a record $2 billion, which may indicate an oncoming period of sustained volatility, although this indication may be skewed with a bias for longs. Other dog-themed meme coins, such as Floki (FLOKI) and BONK, were also seen taking gains as the rally begun by Dogecoin took off, albeit with minimal change.On the macro side, trading firms are warning of a potential pullback in recent gains as Bitcoin and Ether price action showed signs of exhaustion.
“The price rally has been exponential in Q1, and there are signs of exhaustion,” notes Singapore-based QCP Capital. “ETH risk reversals are skewed to the downside at -8%, indicating some fear. Funding and forwards remain very elevated, which means that speculators are still paying high prices to keep their leveraged longs.”
The Solana network over which WIF was created is known for its low transaction costs, and it has since emerged as a preferred blockchain for trading meme coins. The Solana meme coin market has surged by 13% over the past week and more than 40% over the past month, according to data from CoinGecko.The surge in Solana meme coins has also been accompanied by a rise in presale scams. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT has highlighted several presale tokens that have raised concerns due to fraudulent activities and suspicions of being rug pulls.

A monumental movement of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens to the KuCoin exchange has jolted the crypto world awake. Whale Alert, the ever-watchful eye on blockchain transactions, flagged an astounding transfer of over 1.4 trillion SHIB, translating to a market value of approximately $43.5 million. Originating from an enigmatic source, this transfer is not just a numerical feat but a narrative-rich event that potentially foreshadows a significant shift in the Shiba Inu market landscape. The market movements by crypto whales are akin to the deep-sea titans they are named after — capable of creating waves that can either uplift or capsize market trends. The transfer of 1.4 trillion SHIB tokens to KuCoin, therefore, raises a critical question: Is this the prelude to a sell-off, or merely a strategic positioning within the whale's broader market playbook?What remains clear is the indelible mark of whale movements on the crypto ecosystem. As crypto continues to evolve from a niche digital curiosity to a mainstream financial instrument, understanding the motives and consequences of these titanic transactions will be paramount for investors, analysts and enthusiasts aiming to navigate the treacherous yet exhilarating waters of the crypto market.Shiba Inu market scenarioFollowing the transfer, SHIB's price experienced a slight contraction of 3.35% in the last 24 hours, a move that, while seemingly minor, plays into a larger narrative of market sensitivity to whale activities. Despite this, SHIB's price trajectory over the past month — boasting a 126.42% increase — narrates a tale of resilience and bullish sentiment within the Shiba Inu community.This juxtaposition of short-term decline against a backdrop of monthly gains encapsulates the volatile dance of numbers and sentiments that characterize the crypto market. It prompts a deeper reflection on the intrinsic value and speculative dynamics that drive the pricing of meme coins like SHIB.The significant transfer to KuCoin does more than just stir speculative debate; it illuminates the profound impact whales can have on the liquidity, volatility and overall health of the crypto ecosystem. Such movements are not merely transactions but signals that can sway market sentiment, trigger speculative trading and even reshape the strategic landscape of exchanges and DeFi platforms.

Crash incoming? Ripple to unlock 1 billion XRP on April 1


Ripple, the company behind the XRP Ledger development, will unlock 1 billion XRP tokens on April 1, worth $628.5 million. This is part of Ripple’s monthly sell-offs, which could negatively impact the XRP price in the following weeks.
Historically, Ripple has been unlocking 1 billion tokens through escrows, finalized on the first day of every month since 2017. April will mark the start of a new epoch for XRP’s inflation, using different accounts from the past few years.
So far, the company has been using ‘Ripple (22)’ and ‘Ripple (23),’ according to XRPScan, as reported in March’s unlock.


Now, ‘Ripple (10)’ will unlock 100 million and 400 million XRP, while ‘Ripple (11)’ will do two unlocks of 200 million and 300 million tokens.

What happened after Ripple’s XRP token unlock in March
The escrow system unlocked 1 billion XRP on March 1, from ‘Ripple (22)’ and ‘Ripple (23)’ accounts. Later, Ripple reserved 200 million tokens for March’s sell-off and re-locked the rest in escrows for July and August 2027.

However, the company spent 240 million XRP from its treasury account, ‘Ripple (1),’ in March, using old reserves. The sell-offs occurred in two batches, all sent to the same address, ‘rP4X2…Kxv3’.
As developed, Ripple sent the 200 million XRP to its reserves on March 1. Further, the payment protocol made one transaction of 100 million tokens on March 5 and one of 140 million XRP on March 13.

XRP price analysis amid sell-offs
It is notable how Ripple’s previous sell-offs could have impacted the XRP price. Finbold placed each of the company’s selling activities year-to-date on XRP’s daily chart.
Interestingly, only two out of eight days had a slightly positive price action. Yet, even these ‘green’ days were made of shy gains, while the negative ones were more impactful.

Solana-fueled 'memecoins to billions' - Here's what this exec has to say - AMBCrypto



More memes are crossing the billion-dollar valuation marks.
Key crypto figures blame the SEC and TradFi for the meme frenzy. 

Memecoins, especially within the Solana [SOL] ecosystem, recorded explosive growth in Q1 2024. At the time of writing, the community-driven Dogwifhat [WIF] was up 30% on the weekly chart.
 It briefly touched $4 and flipped Pepe [Pepe] to become the third largest memecoin by market cap. WIF, which started as a Solana native meme, is now worth $3.6 billion in market cap. 
The ecosystem now boasts two unicorn memes, WIF and Bonk [BONK], with over $1 billion in market cap. Out of the $67 billion memecoin total market, the Solana ecosystem accounts for $8 billion, translating to about $12% stake. 
Memecoin rally: Did the SEC/TradFi influence it?
Memecoins are now billion-dollar gems to seasoned speculators. Reacting to the crazy billions in the meme sub-sector, Messari Co-Founder Dan McArdle quipped,
“The SEC makes it illegal for people who aren’t already rich to try and get rich from early-stage companies & projects.
Result: memecoins to billions.”
Arthur Hayes, founder and former CEO of BitMEX exchange, had similar observations. In a February newsletter championing the “Points System” for crypto projects, Hayes underscored how retailers get raw deals in traditional markets. 
“But without a hungry hoard of retail buyers who are excluded from investing earlier at much cheaper prices, there would be no buying pressure to create a successful IPO. That is why retail participation must be saved for the end and not the beginning of the fundraising lifecycle.”
Retailers are excluded from discounted prices so that companies can dump shares at them during the IPOs (Initial Public Offerings). 
On the contrary, crypto allows any retailer to join early, like during the Ethereum ICO (Initial Coin Offering), yield farming, points, etc. 
On memecoins, Hayes recently stated that trading Slerf [SLERF] and BOME is “more fun” than “negatively yielding bonds.”
However, another user had a contrarian stance: “Meme coins are really just communities of traders that have agreed to compete to take each other’s money using price action.”
Despite what drives them, memes are now billion-dollar gems and have outperformed some legacy projects in Q1. However, they need great due diligence because they are not risk-free.

Ethereum Spot ETFs Odds At A Pessimistic 25%: Bloomberg Analyst | Bitcoinist.com


								Analysts’ optimism on the likelihood of Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approval in May is constantly waning, as the once optimistic senior Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas has lowered his prediction for the products being approved to a mere 25%.
Ethereum Spot ETFs Odds Continues To Drop
Eric Balchunas, who noted that his chances of having an Ethereum ETF approved in May by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are still a bleak 25%, expressed his pessimism in an X post. According to Balchunas, he would probably go lower if he could do so, suggesting how uncertain the analyst is towards the products.

The Bloomberg expert’s insights coincide with his colleague James Seyffart’s post regarding Bitwise Invest’s latest Ethereum ETF filling. On Thursday, Bitwise Invest registered shares of its ETH ETF with the SEC using a Form S-1 registration statement, which is its first stage of applying for the exchange products.
A 19b-4 form, announcing the firm’s intention to list the ETF on a stock exchange, was filed after this one. Bitwise plans to issue shares of the ETH investment vehicle on NYSE Arca, according to the 19b-4 modification filing that was submitted to the SEC.
Both filings preceded amid rumors that the SEC was attempting to classify ETH as a security under its regulatory scope, raising concerns about future listings of the ETH ETFs. Bitwise Invest is the latest asset company to join the ETH ETF race, indicating the firm’s confidence about an approval by the May deadline.
Even though some in the cryptocurrency world welcomed this move as a hint that regulations would soon approve it, experts like Eric Balchunas are still not convinced, warning that the likelihood is still slim.
Balchunas stated that he has been getting tagged in tweets about Bitwise’s latest filing, the ETH Correlation study, and other ETH ETF hopium. Despite his high regard for the developments, he still believes that the odds for approval are very low.
Furthermore, with seven weeks remaining until the May deadline, Balchunas noted that the SEC’s radio silence is still depressing. “Again, personally I want them to approve but I also want to get the call right so we will be a perfect 4 for 4 in crypto ETF predictions,” he added.
New Correlation As Part Of Bitwise’s ETH ETF Filing
It is worth noting that Bitwise’s recent spot Ethereum ETF filing includes the release of a new correlation analysis. This marks the first ETH correlation analysis to imitate the precise assessment process of Bitcoin (BTC) by the SEC, providing a promising outcome.

Several studies were conducted by Bitwise in order to mirror the SEC’s evaluation of Bitcoin specifically. These include the same 2.5-year sample period, exact intraday correlation intervals, the same correlation statistic, and others.
For hourly, one-minute, and five-minute correlations, the differences in correlation values across the whole sample period are limited to 0.2%, 8%, and 5%, respectively.

'Black Swan' Author Nassim Taleb Reveals Own Sam Bankman-Fried Verdict


Renowned author and financial expert Nassim Taleb has sparked widespread interest and debate with his recent commentary on the verdict handed down to Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.Taleb, best known for his bestselling book "Black Swan," took to social media to share his thoughts on Bankman-Fried's 25-year prison sentence for fraud.Taleb's remarks, made in response to a statement by Bankman-Fried expressing remorse for his actions, suggest a deep skepticism regarding the sincerity of the convicted businessman's repentance. Without directly addressing the specifics of the case, Taleb's comment implies a concern that Bankman-Fried may be more focused on his own situation than on the victims of his fraudulent activities. The trial, which concluded in November 2023 with Bankman-Fried being found guilty on all seven counts, revealed a staggering sum of $8 billion fraudulently obtained from FTX customers. Despite the evidence presented by prosecutors, Bankman-Fried maintained his innocence throughout the proceedings.Collapse of FTXFTX, once valued at $32 billion and ranked as the fourth-largest crypto exchange globally, faced significant financial turmoil following investigative reports exposing its precarious financial state. The revelation triggered a mass exodus of investors, ultimately leading to the exchange's collapse and declaration of bankruptcy.Bankman-Fried's legal troubles began in December 2022 when he was detained in the Bahamas at the request of the United States. Initially released on a staggering $250 million bail, his subsequent return to custody followed accusations of witness tampering, culminating in yesterday's sentencing.

21Shares president ‘less bearish’ than Cathie Wood on ether ETF approval - Blockworks


Executives at two of the issuers jointly looking to launch a spot ether ETF have differing views on whether such funds will gain near-term approval. 
Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said this week during a podcast with Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz that “the probability is probably going down” for the Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF, and other similar products, to be approved in May. 
Industry watchers expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to rule on spot ether proposals on or around May 23 — the date when the regulator’s 240-day clock to decide on the first such applications expires.  
“One of the tell-tale signs for bitcoin that something was gonna happen with the spot bitcoin ETF was the fact that we were communicating with the SEC,” Wood said. “I just think that the SEC is still biding its time, maybe studying the issues.”
Read more: Ether ETFs coming in May? Here’s why many are bearish
The SEC approved 10 spot bitcoin ETFs in January — the first products of their kind to hit the US market. 
Ark Invest partnered with European crypto ETP specialist 21Shares to launch one of those BTC funds. That ETF currently has roughly $3 billion in assets under management, the fourth-most in the segment behind Grayscale Investments, BlackRock and Fidelity.  
21Shares co-founder Ophelia Snyder noted the main reason that bitcoin ETFs were approved: a Grayscale legal victory over the SEC last year. Judges ruled in an August decision that the SEC allowing bitcoin futures ETFs, but blocking the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) from becoming an ETF, was “arbitrary and capricious.”
The SEC allowed ETFs that hold ether futures contracts to start trading in October.
Given “how fresh most of the documentation is,” Snyder told Yanowitz she is less bearish than Wood and others around the chance of spot ether ETFs gaining approval soon.    
“There are not a lot of differences between these filings for Ethereum and the filings for bitcoin,” the 21Shares executive noted. “They’re the same structure, the same custodians, the same disclosures. It’s very internally consistent. That means there’s less to look at.” 
Still, Wood said she believes the language in proposals around staking the planned funds’ assets has been “a sticking point” for the SEC. 


Staking ether is the process of depositing ETH to help secure the Ethereum blockchain — and earning yield on that ETH for doing so.
An amended proposal filed by Ark and 21Shares last month said the sponsor “may, from time to time, stake a portion of the trust’s assets through one or more trusted staking providers.” Fidelity and Grayscale have made similar additions to their ether ETF applications.
Read more: Ark 21Shares amends spot ether ETF proposal to include staking language
Bitwise filed for a spot ether ETF Thursday, though its proposal did not include details about the fund potentially staking its assets. 
Marshall Beard, chief operating officer at Gemini — a custodian for VanEck’s spot bitcoin ETF and in discussions related to the proposed ETH funds — previously told Blockworks he believes spot ether ETFs that stake assets are “not going to be version one.”
ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy argued that staking is a feature that makes ether look more like a security, “which the SEC won’t look favorably upon,” he noted.
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is another issuer with a spot ether ETF proposal in front of the SEC. The company’s CEO, Larry Fink, noted during a Thursday interview with Fox Business News that the designation of ether as a security or commodity might not have a big impact on whether such a fund gets greenlit.
When asked directly during the interview whether BlackRock could launch a spot ether ETF even if ETH is labeled a security, Fink added: “I think so, yeah.”

Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Talked About Memecoins! He Explained What Kind of Projects He Prefers! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin addressed the topic of memecoins in a thought-provoking blog post published today, sharing his views on their potential to positively contribute to the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Defends the Positive Impact of Memecoins in the Cryptocurrency Space
Known for his influential role in shaping the Ethereum network, Buterin emphasized his personal stance on memecoins, stating that he prefers projects that comply with certain moral principles.


He expressed disapproval of coins associated with totalitarian ideologies, fraud, or other negative connotations that may bring excitement in the short term but lead to disappointment in the long term.
While Buterin acknowledged the recent surge in memecoins and the controversy surrounding some of them, especially those that perpetuate racism or offensive themes, he also acknowledged the crypto community's desire to have fun and participate in light-hearted projects.





However, he advocated for a balance, calling for a proliferation of “very good memecoins rather than bad memecoins.” Buterin emphasized the importance of memecoins contributing positively to the ecosystem rather than merely enriching insiders and producers.

He suggested that memecoins that support public goods or charitable causes could be compatible with this vision, offering an example of how such projects could have a beneficial impact.


Buterin's comment comes amid ongoing debates regarding the role and impact of memecoins in the cryptocurrency industry.
While some, such as CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju, have expressed concerns about memecoins overshadowing legitimate projects and damaging the industry's reputation, others, including Buterin, see potential for positive contributions if executed responsibly.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sparks controversy with "crypto villains" remarks

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin startled the cryptocurrency world by naming names of those he called “crypto villains” in a recent social media post. Mark Karpeles and Kyle Davies, two individuals who have made lasting contributions to the profession despite having very different motivations, were named, among others.Mark Karpeles: Redemption from Mt. Gox?After leading the now-famous Mt. Gox exchange for a while, Mark Karpeles was involved in controversy when the exchange crashed in 2014, leaving a path of financial devastation. After being detained by Japanese police the next year, Karpeles came under much more scrutiny and was involved in a protracted four-year judicial fight.Despite his turbulent background, Buterin thinks Karpeles deserves a second opportunity and bases his forgiveness on his current actions. On the other hand, opinions about whether Karpeles’s recent efforts are enough to offset the consequences of Mt. Gox’s collapse are still mixed.The Three Arrows Capital debacle and Kyle DaviesKyle Davies, a co-founder of the now-defunct Three Arrows Capital (3AC), is at the opposite end of the spectrum. The failure of the hedge fund in 2022 rocked the sector and caused ripple effects that affected the whole cryptocurrency scene. Buterin and other community members have harshly criticized Davies for his role in meme cryptocurrency transactions and his attention-seeking actions after filing for bankruptcy.Even though Karpeles and Davies have different stories to tell in the cryptocurrency world, they have come to symbolize the difficulties and disputes that come with the fast development of the sector.The founder of the once-dominant FTX exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried, was recently imprisoned, highlighting the unpredictability and volatility of the cryptocurrency market. In response to disclosures of financial instability and investor withdrawals that precipitated FTX’s bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Formerly regarded as a behemoth in the cryptocurrency exchange space, FTX’s collapse should teach industry insiders and investors about the dangers of uncontrolled markets and rampant speculation.Managing cryptocurrency’s futureThe inspiring lessons learned from the repercussions of monumental scandals, scams, or crashes act as a cautionary tale and a reminder of the importance of responsible, transparent, and involved management in the crypto space as it evolves. But there are people, their names Karpeles, Davies, and Bankman-Fried, who can be considered undesired outsiders, and their mistakes show that it is recommended to have stricter ethical principles and governmental control over them to avoid the repetition of these events one day.As a crypto community, we are debating deeper fundamental questions such as the source of accountability, who exercises governance, and the prospects for decentralized finance as we navigate Buterin’s controversial comment and continue to face the impacts of previous scandals.One thing is certain as participants from all over the world struggle with these issues. Nevertheless, the fate of cryptocurrencies is not only about technical matters but it’s also about the morality and personality of the people who play a part in the process of their design. The question of whether the recognition gained from past failures will be the key to developing the upcoming digital economy with sustainable high efficiency, has still not been answered.

Solana vs Ethereum: A Detailed Comparison of Two Leading Blockchains

The crucial decision you make in the web3 space is to find the best blockchain and choosing between Solana vs Ethereum can be difficult considering each has its own pros and cons. Solana and Ethereum are two of the most widely known blockchains. The blockchains are often compared to one another but how do they actually differ from one another?
Solana is a blockchain network founded by Raj Gokal and Anatoly Yakovenko claiming to be able to process a maximum of 65,000 tps with the average cost per transaction of $0.00025. On the other hand, Ethereum, first proposed by Vitalik Buterin introduced the world of web3 enthusiasts to smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).
In this article you can expect to read about – Solana vs Ethereum, Consensus Mechanisms like Proof of History (PoH) in the context of Solana, Proof of Stake (PoS) in the context of Ethereum, unique features of each blockchain including the difference between Solana and Ethereum related to cost-effectiveness, transaction processing speed, scalability trilemma. So stay tuned to dive deeper!
Solana Vs Ethereum: Choosing the Right Blockchain Platform
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believed that a blockchain cannot possess all qualities i.e. decentralization, security and scalability at the same time. This situation right here is what is referred to as the scalability trilemma. One of these qualities must be compromised. Take the Layer 1 network Bitcoin for example. This compromise is a key difference between Solana vs Ethereum because let me tell you that while Ethereum focuses on security Solana prioritizes scalability.
The Bitcoin network is thoroughly secure with its heavy decentralization amongst numerous nodes. But the chain can only process around 7 transactions per second (TPS). The crux of the matter is that the more users on a platform like Bitcoin, the less scalable it would be. A great example of scalability trilemma, isn’t it? This is where the new blockchain technology, Solana, comes in.
At the heart of Solana’s protocol is proof of history that works in conjunction with proof of stake in reaching a consensus. Thus, it targets mainstream adoption by being energy efficient, immensely fast and extremely inexpensive.
Transactions per second over time
Talking about comparison in the battle of Solana vs Ethereum, the latter is the most favored blockchain and supports its native cryptocurrency ETH which is in the race for the leading altcoin in the crypto industry.
Originally, Ethereum could be mined by miners competing to solve complex mathematical problems so as to validate transactions and create new blocks on the network. This is called “Proof-of-Work” or PoW. However, in September 2022, Ethereum moved on from this consensus mechanism of PoW to “Proof-of-Stake” (PoS) in The Merge upgrade. 

Here’s an extensive article by DroomDroom on how these above mentioned consensus mechanisms: Proof of Work and Proof of Stake differ.

What Is Solana?
In an extensive research paper named, “A Prototype of Supply Chain Traceability using Solana as Blockchain and IoT” the authors specified definite features for choosing a blockchain that could best fit their prototype for traceability. Out of several reviews of blockchains, they chose Solana. Are you wondering what those specific characteristics are? Here let me list them out for you:

We know that the transaction fee usually depends on the size of the transaction i.e. the larger the transaction size, the higher the fee required to process the transaction. So one requirement was that we could reduce transaction fees by sending smaller transactions at lower processing priority.


The blockchain is able to process data i.e. extraction of data from the blockchain network is faster (high tps) especially where we want to provide real-time data sent to the Supply Chain web application.


Another interesting criterion of requirements includes a blockchain that provides the ability to create smart contracts for event-based automated transactions.


It is obvious that the blockchain network prioritizes security of data, especially the data sent from IoT devices because of it being sensitive.


Last but certainly not least, a chain that provides Development SDK or API.

Our above discussion only results in one conclusion and that is? It all boils down to the fact that: 
Solana is an open-source (completely transparent) blockchain platform with a primary objective of enhancing scalability, typically exceeding the performance of popular blockchains (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) while keeping costs low.
What Is Ethereum?
Some define Ethereum as “the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications.”
Ethereum is said to have become the first project to expand the use cases of blockchains. It introduced distinctive technologies allowing people to create their own digital tokens and self-sustaining, autonomous applications. This innovation paved the way for: 

Currency assurance through Ether (ETH)
Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
Smart contracts
Decentralized finance (DeFi)
Initial coin offerings (ICOs)
GameFi 
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)

Now, it is important to dive deeper into the comparison between Solana vs Ethereum. Because, evaluating both blockchain in respect to security, decentralization and other unique aspects is vital to understanding the trade-offs.
Solana vs Ethereum: Comparing Different Criteria
You can’t talk about the Solana blockchain without talking about its faster transaction processing speed. Solana blockchain is founded by Intel, Qualcomm and Dropbox engineers who have aimed to en route towards a theoretical limit of 710,000 TPS. 
So to give you food for thought, Solana has a theoretical speed of nearly 65,000 transactions per second which is 10,000 times faster than Bitcoin, 4000 times faster than Ethereum, and 2.5 times faster than the Visa (centralized) network. 
But what are some of the other features that make Solana unique from Ethereum in the race of these two blockchains?

Each blockchain has its own strengths, weaknesses and so understanding these nuances as we go on to compare the unique features of Solana vs Ethereum is important for developers, investors and users in the blockchain space.
The Detailed Breakdown of Solana Blockchain
Solana works it out on a combination of sharding and a novel consensus algorithm to scale horizontally. This is why the blockchain has quickly risen to prominence in the web3 space with its impressive qualities including scalability, low latency and low transaction costs. Let’s explore more of these unique features.
Consensus Mechanism
What sets Solana apart from other dapp-platform competitors like Ethereum? It is its unique approach to the transaction validation process. This approach also helps the chain to achieve its insane level of speed and scalability. 
Solana uses Proof of History (PoH) consensus combined with Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) to validate info with timestamp proving an event occurred at a specific time. This mechanism helps avoid this one problem which is experienced on other blockchains – inefficiencies in how the transactions are processed because of the temporary disagreement of the order transactions being submitted.
Proof Of History consensus mechanism is guided by Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). VDF helps in identifying the time when specific events occurred and makes consensus a faster process.

All events and transactions in Solana are hashed with SHA256 to keep data secured and encrypted. So, PoH adds the timestamp into the SHA256 record – recognized by everyone using Solana. The verification and transparency of transactions is so evident that it assists validators to add them into the block without relying on conventional timestamps. 
The result? A network wherein everyone is absolutely in sync with each other.

Tower Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
In order to avoid a possible miscommunication that can affect the entire blockchain, a fault tolerance system needs to be implemented. A key innovation introduced by the Solana team is Tower BFT, a PoH-optimized version of PBFT. Tower BFT makes sure that Solana will remain functional even if some of the nodes act maliciously. 
In simple terms, thanks to this innovation, a single node failure does not affect the chain and other nodes can carry on operating.

By the way, do you ever wonder how different blockchains can communicate with each other? If yes then learn about sidechains with this article.

The blockchain can take advantage of a synchronized clock with this technology. Nodes on Solana can eliminate the need to process and store the timestamps of past transactions, thereby creating more room to focus on other aspects of the transaction validation process. 
With Tower BFT, nodes on the network outstandingly increase their timeouts to reach consensus and examine timeouts of other validations as the ledger is a trustless time source.
Turbine
One of the fundamental innovations in the Solana network is the turbine – it’s block propagation technique that takes some inspiration from BitTorrent. With a constant bandwidth per node, it will be a major problem to increase the node count as it directly increases the time necessary to propagate data to all nodes. A scalability trilemma.
And the fact that Solana can be scalable is because of this innovation by the Solana team – the Turbine block propagation algorithm.
Turbine transmits data using User Datagram Protocol (UDP), i.e assists in dividing data into tiny packages, making the transfers easy. According to Yakovenko, the technology implements a random path per packet through the network as leaders or block producers stream their data. They break the block into packets up to 64 KB in size and transmits each packet to a different validator.
The Solana blockchain network with leader, validator and neighborhood nodes involved in data transmission using the Turbine protocol by Anatoly Yakovenko
In an interesting take on solana vs ethereum, Brandon Potts of crypto venture capital firm Framework Ventures suggested that the difference between the Ethereum and Solana blockchains is their contrasting strengths. 
“Ethereum is going for this bulletproof security model. They are going for more of a settlement layer, more of the high value transactions, if you will. But with Solana, they are going with high speed, low latency, performance and low cost. So I don’t mean to pit those two against one another, but they are starting on opposite ends of the spectrum.”
Gulf Stream
Well, to gain the “mempool-less” transaction forwarding, Solana uses a protocol called Gulf Stream. A mempool is kind of like a waiting area for unprocessed transactions. The validators of a blockchain select transactions from the mempool and later on add them to the network. 

Here’s your extensive guide to understanding the concept of mempool and how exactly it works!

In the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the number of unprocessed or unconfirmed transactions is somewhere around 20,000-100,000 as shown above and this typically results in significant bottleneck with the mempool rising.
For Solana, every validator knows the order of upcoming block producers and so, the transactions are forwarded to the expected leader ahead of time.

In case you are wondering about the blockchain network congestion scenario, DroomDroom’s article is here to give the gist of it all.

Sealevel
Co-founder of Solana describes Sea Level as, “What we’ve built in Solana is a runtime that can process tens of thousands of contracts in parallel, using as many cores as are available to the Validator.”
Basically, Solana facilitates several smart contracts to operate in parallel and amplifies the computing capacity of its network without negatively affecting the speed of the blockchain.
Pipelining
It is never enough to just form consensus for quick transaction processing. There has to be a way to validate massive blocks of transactions ASAP, while also replicating them across the network at the quickest. For this, the Solana network uses an optimization common in CPU design called pipelining.
Solana Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), a four-stage pipeline that processes transactions efficiently.
This is a technology in which the input data is required to be processed by a sequence of steps across many hardware devices. So using an analogy for this, we can understand that the washer is stage one, followed by the dryer and the last one is the folding stage. 
For maximizing efficiency you will add a third load of laundry to the washer right after the second is in the dryer and the first load is being folded, correct? Putting this analogy to test in Solana, the network ensures that all hardware (the network cards, the CPU cores and the GPU cores) is busy all the time.
Cloudbreak
To understand this concept you need to first have an overview of sharding. 

Consider this article by DroomDroom on the Role of Ethereum Sharding in Building Blockchain’s Efficiency for the same.

So sharding allows the scaling of a blockchain like Ethereum by splitting the blockchain into smaller “shards.”
Solana uses a horizontally-scaled account database i.e. Cloudbreak which empowers it to write data to and read data from the database for concurrent transactions. This all combines to create Solana the world’s first web scale blockchain. The concurrent reads and writes are possible between the 32 threads  through memory-mapped files.
One Last Thing About Solana: SOL Token
A SOL is Solana’s native token can and there are 424,333,409 SOL coins in circulation. SOLs are passed to nodes in a Solana cluster (set of validators) in exchange for running an on-chain program. It is currently ranked among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization of $26,838,550,394.
SOL works like a utility token for settling transaction fees and is used for Solana’s staking economy.

Learn more about the coin’s fundamental analysis including the tokenomics and future of the project in this article.

So having explored Solana’s technical aspects let’s now delve into the detailed breakdown of Ethereum Blockchain for highlighting the key differences in the showdown between Solana vs Ethereum.
The Detailed Breakdown of Ethereum Blockchain
Vitalik Buterin co-created the Ethereum blockchain project to tackle Bitcoin’s shortcomings. The Ethereum white paper, published in 2013, outlines the vision for the platform which seems to be enabling more than just digital currency transactions. 
A schematic representation of the Ethereum blockchain architecture, detailing its layered structure from application to storage, including elements like smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, and data encryption.
Ethereum introduced the smart contracts — automated immutable “if-then” statements — enabling the development of decentralized applications. Prior to Ethereum, DApp development already existed in the blockchain space but the platforms weren’t interoperable. Buterin believed that unifying the way DApps run and interact was crucial for adoption.
Let us now review what features make up Ethereum blockchain and explore what it offers for this comparison to balance between solana vs ethereum.
Consensus Mechanism
Ethereum blockchain reaches consensus using the proof-of-stake (PoS) algo wherein the validators create news blocks and work together to verify the information these blocks contain. So unlike Bitcoin Ethereum does not rely on Proof of Work for consensus as the original whitepaper proposed a variant called “Ethereum Casper” and now is replaced by PoS that secures the network by requiring validators to stake ETH tokens.

VIDEO
A video to understand blockchain consensus mechanisms.
So talking about the comparison in this battle of Solana vs Ethereum, the former uses PoH mechanism to validate information. 
Nodes and Clients
Ethereum is a decentralized network and so it is obvious that it uses a network of computers called nodes. This network of computers maintain a copy of the blockchain ledger and plays an incredible role in verifying transactions and network security.
Nodes perform tasks like validation, participate in consensus mechanism, store varying amounts of blockchain data and the like.
According to the Ethereum whitepaper nodes are of three main types:
Full Nodes
Full nodes store the blockchain history including all transactions and blocks and you know this allows them to independently verify transacctions and contribute to network security. In an ideal world, running a full node is possible for those who want to be fully independent validators.
Light Nodes
Light nodes offer a more lightweight alternative to the above as they verify transactions by checking block headers which are as we know much smaller than the entire block data. It is needless to say that this is what makes them more efficient in terms of say storage and processing power.
Well, talking more about light nodes it is noteworthy to mention that they cannot participate in consensus processes as they do not posses the entire blockchain history.
Archive Nodes
These nodes are basically the history buffs you know because these nodes are like full nodes with an extra archival function. So they store not only the current blockchain state but also historical data which can be in turn beneficial for research and analysis purposes.
Now, we are going to discuss clients–which are the software program installed a particular node that allows it to connect to the network. Clients are responsible for downloading and managing blockchain data, processing transactions and allows users to send and receive transactions along with interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain.
So users like you and me do not directly interact with individual nodes but we use client apps like crypto wallets or dApp interfaces to connect to the Ethereum network.
A node runs two client applications called Exceution Client and Consensus Client. Let’s have a brief explanation of these both.
Execution Client
This type of client processes new transactions on EVM and maintains the current state of network data.
Consensus Client (aka Beacon Node)
On the other hand, these client type utilizes the PoS consensus mechanism to verify information from the execution client and reach network-wide agreement on the validity of the new blocks.
Smart Contracts
These are pieces of code stored on the Ethereum blockchain that can be programmed to execute specific actions automatically when certain conditions are met.
By now the importance of smart contracts has risen to a point that there remains no point in defining these self-executing contracts. These are software programs which are run on individual nodes participating in the network in a language that the Ethereum Virtual machine (EVM) understands. 
And then when you deploy a smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain it is uploaded and assigned a unique address so that anyone can interact with this smart contract.

A smart contract after bring coded is verified and audited in a very conventional manner which are time consuming and so artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role to detect anomalies or security breach. Know more about it in this article.

Ethereum Virutal Machine (EVM)
Within the Ethereum architecture EVM acts as a decentralized computer that executes smart contracts on the blockchain. EVM acts like a sandboxed execution environment for smart contracts.
Key Features of EVM include:

Turing Completeness–which means it can theoretically execute any algorithm or program that can allow a wide range of functionalities for smart contracts.


Deterministic Execution of smart contracts–which means that for a given input and state the outcome will always be the same on any EVM.


Isolated Execution as the EVM prevents smart contracts from directly accessing the underlying OS or interfering with other contracts which ultimately helps maintain security and stability.

The EVM does not understand high level programming languages you know and so smart contracts are typically written in languages like Solidity and then compiled into EVM bytecode for deployment on the Ethereum blockchain.

Learn more about this programming language called Solidity that was specifically created by the Ethereum blockchain team in this DroomDroom article.

Now talking about the role of EVM in transactions is that each node executes smart contract code on its local EVM once the user interacts with it and since the EVM is deterministic all nodes will drive at the same outcome so you know there’s consistency across the network. And then once a consensus is reached on the outcome the state of the Ethereum blockchain updated.
Ethereum Accounts
Ethereum accounts are basically the entities on the blockchain that can interact with the Ethereum network you know like the foundation for user interaction. There are two main types of accounts on the Ethereum network:

Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)
Contact Accounts

EOAs, secured by private key, are like your bank accounts but obviously for the Ethereum network and user controlled and used to hold ETH, send and receive the cryptocurrency to other accounts and interact with smart contracts.
On the other hand, Contract Accounts are not directly controlled by users but by the code of a smart contract which you know means that they can hold ETH and interact with other smart contracts but their behaviour is dictated by the smart contract code.
One Last Thing About Ethereum: Ether (ETH) Token
ETH is more than just a digital currency at this point it fuels literally the entire Ethereum ecosystem allowing secure transactions to happen and enable dApp development. While Ethereum does not have a maximum supply like Bitcoin there have been proposals to introduce a hard cap on the number of coins issued. As of March 2024, Ethereum coins in circulation is approximately 120.2 million ETH.
The ERC-20 standard provides guidelines for creating tokens with specific functionalities which was proposed in 2015 by Fabian Vogelsteller. Ethereum’s token standards extend beyond ERC-20 to include other variants like ERC-777 for tangible tokens with unique features and ERC-721 for NFTs.
Now, ERC-20 tokens are a popular way to represnt assets on the Ethereum blockchain but you know by default when you approve a contract to spend your tokens it can potentially spend all of them so this is where ERC-20 token allowance comes into play. 

Learn more about the ERC-20 allowance and following security best practices in this DroomDroom article.

During the Ethereum Merge in September 2022 there was a significant shift from PoW to PoS for validating transactions and this made Ethereum the top cryptocurrency in terms of staked value.
Conclusion
We have discussed the two prominent players in the world of blockchain technology and pit them up against each other in terms technical aspects between Solana vs Ethereum. So I have explained in the article that Ethereum champions robust security and an incredibly well established developer ecosystem. Its recent transition to Proof of Stake consensus enhances its eco-friendliness but hey Ethereum is still grappling with scalability issues which leads to high transactions fees and slower processing times.
Solana on the other hand priortizes scalability and obviously clearly boasts blazing fast transactions speeds and minimal fees. Its Proof of History consensus mechanism combined with DPoS allows for high throughput. But then i have to also admit that Solana is a younger platform with a smaller developer community compared to Ethereum.
The Solana vs Ethereum debate is not about a clear wonner but it boils down to your specific needs which also underlines the contantly evolving development of blockchains.

Stablecoin delistings in Europe spell change for crypto exchanges, issuers

When the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange delists its leading stablecoin for an entire continent, it raises eyebrows. But this may just be a harbinger of things to come.Expect more disruptions as Europe’s path-breaking Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) regulatory regime takes effect at the end of June. Off-shore stablecoins, in particular, may face challenges. But in the long run, MiCA should provide a safer, stronger eco-system for stablecoin issuers and users, sources told Cointelegraph recently.As reported, Seychelles-based crypto-exchange OKX delisted Tether (USDT) trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) ahead of MiCA. “Moving forward, only EUR and USDC trading pairs will be accessible for spot trading,” said OKX in a customer support message.A shifting landscapeMarket observers were hardly shocked by the news. Christian Catalini, the founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cryptoeconomics Lab, said he was “not surprised at all by the delisting,” adding that “the stablecoin landscape will evolve substantially across the globe as new regulation is passed, and we will see entry by new players — many of which won’t be companies that started in crypto and are coming from traditional banking and fintech.” Regarding the OKX news, Arvin Abraham, partner at United Kingdom-based law firm Goodwin Procter, expects more of the same. He tells Cointelegraph: “Post-MiCA [i.e., after June 30], if a stablecoin is no longer compliant, we can expect exchanges to drop it from the exchange for European customers.”Because none of the world’s largest stablecoins are European, it follows that in the EEA, at least, one could see “a significant shifting of the landscape following MiCA coming into effect,” suggested Abraham. Some of the current leaders may have to bow out if they won’t, or can’t, get compliant. Recent: Over half of U.S. charities now accept cryptocurrency donations“MiCA, with its stringent requirements for both e-money tokens and asset reference tokens” [i.e., two forms of stablecoins in the new MiCA lexicon] will undoubtedly impact stablecoin offerings in the European Union,” Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux, global CEO at France’s Bitstamp cryptocurrency exchange, told Cointelegraph, and “we are closely monitoring developments in this area.” The challenge for stablecoin issuers is they will now need to be an EEA entity and authorized as an Electronic Money Institution firm in the EEA. “This is problematic for existing stablecoin issuances, and the timeline is now very short, with June 30, 2024, being the last date to meet the new regulatory requirements,” Graftieaux added. A harder task for off-shore stablecoin issuers?“For non-European [stablecoin] issuers, the requirement for the issuer to have an entity established and authorized in an EU member state is the most significant unique cost,” Abraham noted. But it isn’t just off-shore issuers who will face challenges. “For all issuers, significant additional burdens come from the requirements to maintain 1:1 reserves to cover claims; provide permanent redemption rights to holders of tokens; and for stablecoins with a value exceeding 100 million euro to provide quarterly reporting to their EU home state regulator,” Abraham added.Jon Helgi Elisson, co-founder and chairman of Monerium, a company issuing compliant on-chain fiat stablecoins in Europe, and former chairman of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland, told Cointelegraph that most stablecoins offered in Europe today are not compliant with existing electronic money rules — let alone those that will be implemented June 30 as a result of MiCA.“The e-money directive has been in effect in Europe for more than 20 years,” Elisson said. “Why do you have a market of stablecoins where you have one set of companies that are compliant and one set of companies that are not compliant? That is not a fair thing.”Still, he suggested that it could be “hugely expensive” for some stablecoin issuers to come into compliance. With MiCA, fiat-backed stablecoin issuers will not only have to maintain a 1:1 ratio of liquid reserves, but they will also have to segregate user’s funds, “meaning that the customer has a claim on the underlying funds,” not the company, said Elisson. Compliance demands will be greater for the larger market-cap issuers. “In the current [pre-MiCA] regulation and law, there is no distinction between the size of issuers,” said Elisson. The same rules apply to smaller and bigger issuers. However, MiCA distinguishes between “significant” issuers and “non-significant” issuers. “You have to put more of your own equity aside against potential losses if you are a ‘significant’ issuer,” Elisson explained.Will there be more changes for off-shore issuers? “The impact of the regulation may result in some challenges for those operating in international markets,” said Graftieaux. “For example, it could result in increased compliance costs, barriers to market entry, and potential conflicts with other jurisdictions’ regulatory frameworks, resulting in policy fragmentation.” Abraham foresees “a significant short-term disruptive effect on the market, as Tether is today the most popular stablecoin globally.” However, over a longer time frame, “other stablecoins would fill the void, and the ecosystem would arguably be safer as these coins would be compliant with MiCA’s strict consumer protection and prudential safeguards.” Crypto exchanges might have to adapt, too. “Some exchanges require stablecoins as an intermediate form of exchange before fiat can be used to purchase crypto or to effect a trade between two crypto assets,” said Abraham. Those stablecoins may not be available to them soon, at least for European customers.Setting an example for crypto marketsStill, Graftieaux emphasized the long-term benefits for investors and markets generally. “With a focus on market integrity and investor protection, these regulatory standards set an example for other markets, which, if followed, will only increase investor confidence.” The MiCA framework has already had an impact in the U.K., Graftieaux added, where the government’s commitment to digital assets has been widely seen “as a clear strategic move to lead the international regulatory stage alongside the EU.” Graftieaux also takes issue with those who claim that MiCA could thwart crypto and blockchain innovation in the EU countries. “While innovation plays a crucial role in the industry, the importance of market stability cannot be overstated.”Ultimately, the new framework “recognizes the revolutionary ability of blockchain technology while also finding a balance in offering legal clarity and certainty,” he continued. Moreover, “This harmonization encourages cross-border innovation through the seamless collaboration enabled between EU states.” Graftieaux told Cointelegraph:“This cross-pollination of ideas will continue to foster technological innovation – just under a more robust set of regulations.”Indeed, some on the continent see MiCA offering an opening for a new generation of stablecoin providers. “We cannot predict market reactions, but one thing is sure: MiCA is a real opportunity for Europe and euro stablecoins,” Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO at France’s Societe Generale – Forge, told Cointelegraph, adding:“The European market is dynamic, with a large, mature and sophisticated investor base. All the conditions are in place to allow a move toward rebalancing euro versus dollar stablecoins in the long term.”In sum, with their focus on market integrity and investor protection, the new EU crypto regulations could set an example for other markets — after some short-term pain, of course. The stablecoin sector might also see some new entrants to challenge the dominance of dollar-backed stablecoins.Recent: Ethereum Dencun upgrade lowers transaction fees for L2s“While MiCA is far from perfect, it provides a starting point for more robust stablecoin regulation. It’s also way better than the current situation in the U.S., where there isn’t any regulatory clarity and new rules are needed to deliver safe and sound stablecoins to consumers and businesses,” said Catalini, adding:“Once there is clarity, we’ll finally know which stablecoins are here to stay and which ones can actually solve real consumer and business needs at scale.”

The broader digital currency ecosystem is capitulating despite the sustained bullish fundamental that persists in the broader digital ecosystem owing to the spot Bitcoin ETF inflow sentiment. For XRP, the narrative is different as the digital currency has maintained a sheer stagnancy for the better part of the week before recording a mild breakout today.At the time of writing, XRP is changing hands for $0.6284, up by 0.94% in 24 hours. The XRP price is looking to find a balance, an effect that might be solidified by its historic price trends.Data from the crypto analytics platform CryptoRank shows that on average, the XRP price has always traded positively in the month of March. Though there have been more bearish March closures since its inception, the bullish months have massive jumps.In proper context, the 278.1% jump in March 2017 completely negated the 6.7% slump in March 2016 and the 43.3% drop in March 2018. Over the past four years, XRP has always closed March on a bullish note, jumping by 37.7% in 2021, by 4.15% in March 2022, by 43% in March 2023 and by more than 7% thus far this month.XRP Monthly Returns via CryptoRankHopes for XRP price growthPer the CryptoRank data, the average growth of XRP for March comes in at 19.9%, and if history repeats itself, the digital currency may grow by this percentage before the end of this first quarter.The volatility in the market and the impact of the ongoing Ripple v. SEC lawsuit may shape the outlook in the long term. The lawsuit that was brought on in December 2020 has already deprived XRP of hitting its all-time high (ATH) in tandem with multiple coins that have broken their individual records this month.XRP’s utility remains its biggest fundamental and forms the basis upon which many pundits believe the coin may shoot as high as $5.5 in the long term.

Google Introduces Bitcoin Wallet Balances in Search, Sparks Debate | Coinspeaker



With this feature, users can now search for three Bitcoin address formats, P2PKH, P2SH, and Bech32, and promptly access the current balances and recent transactions linked to those addresses.

In the latest development, tech giant Google announced that it’s expanding search engine capabilities allowing users to easily monitor their crypto wallet balances just by entering the wallet’s address. As part of this development, Google will support several different blockchains such as Bitcoin, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and Fantom.
The feature not only displays the native token balance of a wallet for each supported network but also indicates the most recent update time, offering users near real-time visibility into their cryptocurrency holdings.




For each supported network, this feature will display the native token balance of a wallet in addition to indicating the most recent update time. Thus, Google will offer users real-time visibility into their crypto holdings.
Users will be able to search for three Bitcoin address formats, P2PKH, P2SH, and Bech32, and instantly access current balances and recent transactions associated with those addresses. By integrating Bitcoin data into search results, Google has enhanced its accessibility to on-chain activity, while simultaneously capitalizing on its vast daily search volume.
Users Raise Concern over Privacy
Although some users praised Google’s introduction of checking wallet balances instantly, some of the privacy-centric Bitcoin supporters raised concerns regarding this centralized data aggregation and its impact on privacy.
This update builds upon Google’s previous integration of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains and represents a significant step forward for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Furthermore, it also enhances the accessibility and management of digital assets through the search platform.
Back in May 2023, Google introduced the Ethereum wallet balance searches. In the previous year 2022, Google also integrated a crypto feature allowing the Ethereum wallet addresses to check their Ether balances through the Google search engine.
The inclusion of wallet searches signals a change in the tech giant’s approach. Back in 2018, Google banned Bitcoin-related advertisements, only to reverse its decision recently. It now permits spot Bitcoin (BTC) tickers and advertisements for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following their approval in the United States in January.
Search results on Google now feature ETF products from prominent asset managers such as BlackRock. Additionally, in October 2022, Google collaborated with Coinbase to enable its customers to use cryptocurrency for paying cloud services.
Furthermore, the tech firm also initiated a countdown during the Google Merge event back in September 2022 by featuring animated pandas. Similarly, last year in 2023, google Cloud joined hands with Web3 startup Ordely Network to build user-centric developer tools for DeFi. The goal was to reduce the entry barrier to this field.

Avalanche (AVAX) Price Could Hold Above $50 Due to This Group


Avalanche (AVAX) price has been moving sideways for the past two weeks and was expected to continue this way until it found bullish momentum.
However, by the looks of it, the altcoin is set to face bearishness thanks to its own investors.
Avalanche Investors Might Move to Sell
The Avalanche price is currently trading around $53 and preparing for further decline. However, should the altcoin dip, it will take nearly $1 billion worth of tokens out of the realm of possible profits to certain losses.
The Global In/Out of Money (GIOM) metric highlights the supply bought at certain price levels and where it currently stands. Nearly 22 million AVAX bought between $51 and $56 will fall into the clutches of bears should Avalanche price note a fall below $51.

Although the market conditions do play a hand in dictating the price action of the cryptocurrency, Avalanche is facing a much larger threat from its own investors. Specifically, one single cohort of short-term traders. These investors are known to hold an asset in their wallets for less than a month, making it highly susceptible to selling.
At the moment, about 34.15% of the entire circulating supply sits in the hands of these investors.

If they move to sell their holdings to offset any potential losses, Avalanche price could observe a substantial drawdown.

AVAX Price Prediction: Decline is Likely Possible
Avalanche price, trading at $53, is set to lose the support marked at the same price level; this would result in the cryptocurrency likely testing $50. However, should selling intensify or bearish momentum gain strength, this support would be lost too, pushing AVAX down towards $47, which is the confluence with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

Read More: How To Buy Avalanche (AVAX) and Everything You Need To Know
On the other hand, if the winds shift, AVAX could flip the 50-day EMA into support from resistance. This could reignite a recovery. This would result in the price continuing its consolidation. Furthermore, the same could even extend to the altcoin, potentially breaching the $58 resistance and invalidating the bearish thesis.

A potential cup and handle pattern could see bulls target breakout alongside Bitcoin.
With BTC outlook positive, a rally for JTO could bring a 50% upside from current levels.

Jito (JTO) is looking to extend gains above $3 after bulls bounced off the support zone on March 29.
JTO reached highs of $3.83 on March 16, tracking gains by Bitcoin and top altcoins as BTC reached a new all-time high above $73k and ETH broke above $4,000.
Jito price outlook amid bullish Bitcoin sentiment
Despite paring gains, Jito looks to have established a fresh support zone at $2.75. The resulting upside to above $3.20 keeps the restaking protocol’s price in an uptrend, which has been in place since JTO/USD bottomed in early January.
In this case, the $3.50-$3.75 area looks crucial for bulls.
Although Jito remains in an uptrend, there’s potential for a downward flip if bulls fail to consolidate above $3.
If price climbs to $3.62, the technical picture will represent a cup and handle pattern.  Check the chart below showing the daily price movements for JTO.

Strengthening above this area could see a bullish flip allow for a retest of $4. The key upside target above this level will then be $6. This is the area of the all-time high of $6.01 reached on December 7, 2023 following Binance’s listing of JTO.
On the downside, the main support lies near $2.79 and $2.50. The daily RSI and MACD indicators suggest weakness and these might be key price levels to watch.
Bitcoin price is also poised near the $70k level. As such, traders are likely to pay attention to sentiment around the benchmark crypto. 
Solana (SOL) performance is another factor to consider. Jito is a  Solana liquid staking token that’s seen great interest since its introduction.

                        Hours after introducing Ethena (ENA) on Binance Launchpool, a fake ENA token has been exploited for 480 BNB worth $290,000.According to a report by on-chain security firm PeckShield on Friday, the exploited token is the fake version of ENA.“The token shares the same name as the legitimate ones,” the updated post on X (Twitter), read.Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by market value, added Ethena to its Launchpool, making the synthetic dollar protocol the 50th project to join the platform. The launch enables users to farm the token by staking BNB or FDUSD, the Friday announcement noted.The fake Ethena token exploit, separate from the Ethena Labs initiative, emphasizes robust security measures and due-diligence in token transaction.The news of the exploit spurred confusion among the crypto community on X. PeckShield confirmed users in a separate post that the token is fake and not linked with the legit Ethena.“Clarification: The token mentioned below is not authentic and should not be linked to Ethena in any way.”Ethena Token Airdrop – Highly Anticipated
The news of the fake Ethena exploit comes at a time when the community is highly anticipating the token airdrop which the company announced to take place on April 2. The airdrop marks the next phase in its expansion after the success of its USDe synthetic stablecoin.The protocol has planned to airdrop 750 million ENA tokens, which is 5% of its total supply. Further, the airdrop will apply to eligible participants on April 2 and become available on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs).The company noted that the size of each user’s drop is determined by the amount of “shards” they accumulated through April 1. Shards are digital units measuring users’ engagement with the protocol.Ethena’s USDe amassed a supply of over $1.38 billion, marking a key milestone, per DefiLlama data.

How will the Bitcoin halving impact Bitcoin L2s? - Blockworks


The Bitcoin halving is anticipated to occur in the second half of April this year. Like real-world gold, bitcoin is considered by many to be “digital gold,” with a maximum supply of 21 million coins. As the Bitcoin halving draws near, many are concerned that miners will endure an inevitable revenue cut following the major event.
Mining bitcoin has previously been a profitable way for people to earn rewards while simultaneously securing the network. Fisher Yu is the co-founder of Babylon, a project aiming to create a Bitcoin-secured proof-of-stake economy. He noted the motivation behind early participation in Bitcoin’s proof-of-work security, attributing it to the high amount of bitcoin rewards available when the blockchain was first created.
“Nakamoto’s hope is that, over time, Bitcoin becomes very well adopted so that the increase in transaction fee will outrun the reduction in mining rewards, so that miners’ operational costs are well covered,” Yu said.

Although such a trend is observed, Yu notes that existing transaction fees are not quite sufficient, and there are growing concerns that miners may leave the network, reducing the blockchain’s overall security. 
This belief is shared by Max Chamberlin, the founder of fiat-to-crypto on and off-ramp payments provider Bifinity, who noted that many bitcoin mining businesses could become unsustainable following the halving. 
“While bitcoin’s mining difficulty is dynamic, automatically adjusting to the current hash rate capabilities, it would still be better for the network’s decentralization to have as many miners as possible,” Chamberlin said.

He notes that the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals has boosted on-chain activity significantly and provided miners with a considerable new stream of income through transaction fees, which have so far amounted to almost $240 million.
“In a broader sense, the introduction of ordinals and Runes has sparked considerable excitement within the cryptocurrency community in general, introducing a novel category of tokens — assets that exist directly on the Bitcoin blockchain,” Chamberlin said.
Despite this, Chamberlin is aware that the Bitcoin ecosystem still needs to work on developing broad-spectrum, general-purpose applications, a challenge that stems primarily from the constraints of Bitcoin’s programming language, Script.
“This predicament echoes a longstanding conundrum in finance — the emergence of new assets begs the question of what to do with them,” he said. 
Read more: The history of Bitcoin halvings — and why this time might look different
He remarks that a potential solution to this concern is to integrate assets into DeFi services through Bitcoin layer-2 solutions, which often enable a more complex ecosystem of decentralized applications.
“Bitfinity, a next-gen EVM serving as a layer-2 for Bitcoin and other assets, emerges as a strong contender in this regard. It provides developers with the familiar EVM programming environment but with access to Runes and other Bitcoin-native assets,” Chamberlin said. 
Yu agrees and explains that Babylon’s Bitcoin staking protocol could alleviate some of the growing concerns around cut rewards. He notes that miners could use their bitcoin to secure its proof-of-stake economy and be rewarded for their security.

Rena Shah shares this sentiment. Shah is the vice president of products and operations at Trust Machines, a company that is building a decentralized economy on Bitcoin. She told Blockworks that Bitcoin will likely grow to rely on its layer-2 infrastructure a lot more for most post-halving transactions this year. 
“While the base layer will still focus on high-value settlements, Bitcoin DeFi and other activities will no longer have to use the base layer, as more [layer-2s] start unlocking frictionless usability,” she said. 
She added that “solving transaction times, identity solutions and even wallet functionality between the [layer-1] and [layer-2s] are areas our team at Trust Machines has identified as most appealing to users. As well as DeFi opportunities, which are of particular interest to users of other smart contract-based chains.”

Brace For Market Impact: Ethereum Open Interest Has Reached A New All-Time High


                            Ethereum has, for the most part, established a foothold above the $3,500 price level throughout the week as investors continue to anticipate a return to the $4,000 mark. Interestingly, the optimism has seen the open interest of Ethereum surging to new highs. The surge in open interest, although a bullish sentiment indicator, can also serve as a bearish signal of an impending change in market trend. 
Ultimately, this metric added to the current dynamics of the Ethereum ecosystem, including regulatory uncertainty and scalability concerns hinting at a complicated price trajectory for the price of Ethereum.
Ethereum Open Interest Reaches New High
Open interest is an efficient method for tracking the total number of open positions in a particular contract. Recent market dynamics and institutional investor interest have seen the total open interest in Ethereum futures surging above records set in the 2021 bull market phase.

According to data from Coinglass, the open interest on Ethereum futures, which has been on a surge since February 5, recently set a new high of $14.11 billion on March 15. This wasn’t particularly surprising, as a strong buying momentum from the bulls in the prior days saw the price of Ethereum surging past the $4,000 mark for the first time in two years. 
However, Ethereum has since reversed from the $4,000 price level and is currently trading below $3,600. On the other hand, the total open interest on Ethereum contracts has maintained around its all-time high level, which allowed it to cross over $14.10 billion again on March 28. The open interest weighted average also went up to 0.0462%, indicating an increase in the demand for leveraged ETH long positions.
The majority ($4.55 billion) in the Ethereum futures market were registered on cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Bybit and OKX came in second and third, with $2.39 billion and $1.94 billion respectively. Interestingly, CME’s Ether futures also surged to $1.3 billion. At the time of writing, the CME’s Ether futures now sit at $1.31 billion, reiterating the committed bullishness among institutional investors.
What’s Next For ETH?
Ethereum has been trading flat since the beginning of the week and is currently on a 0.78% gain in the past seven days. All eyes are now on reports of the SEC looking into Ethereum’s security status, the industry awaits an official ruling similar to the one that was handed down in the XRP case that will finally provide clarity to the regulatory landscape.

At the same time, investors continue to await the SEC’s decision regarding the applications of Spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. According to a Bloomberg senior analyst, the likelihood of approval is only 25%.

Expert Slams Sam Bankman-Fried's 'Attempt' To Use His Autism Diagnosis For A Lenient Sentence: 'Attempt To Use His Neurodivergence...Is Wrong' - Benzinga

In a recent development, the conversation around Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing has taken a new turn with discussions about his autism diagnosis and its potential impact on his legal consequences.What Happened: Eric Garcia discussed in an op-ed on MSNBC the complex issue of Bankman-Fried’s autism diagnosis and its role in his criminal case.He touched upon the arguments presented by individuals who believe Bankman-Fried’s autism should be considered for leniency in his sentencing. Garcia is the author of “We’re Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation.”Among them, Maria Centrella, a parent of an autistic adult, wrote to the court without personally knowing Bankman-Fried, suggesting his actions lacked malicious intent due to his neurotype.Psychiatrist George Lerner, in a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan, described his patient’s dispassionate discussion about FTX’s collapse, a demeanor he attributed to symptoms associated with autism. Bankman-Fried’s mother also expressed concern about her son’s potential miscommunication risks in prison due to his autistic traits.Garcia, being autistic himself, wrote, “Reading these statements as an autistic person evoked in me conflicting thoughts: The plea for leniency because of Bankman-Fried's neurotype follows a tired trope.”See Also: Former White House Lawyer On DJT: ‘Little Reason To Think That This Deal Will End Well For Anyone Other Than For Trump’Despite the lack of comprehensive data on autistic adults’ interactions with law enforcement, studies indicate a higher prevalence of autism among prisoners and a greater likelihood of deadly encounters with police.“All the same, Bankman-Fried's attempt to use his neurodivergence as a means to escape the consequences of his actions is wrong. The criminal justice system consistently fails neurodivergent people, but Bankman-Fried is not in that number,” Garcia concluded.Why It Matters: The sentencing of Bankman-Fried has been a focal point of discussion, not only for its implications on the individual but also for the broader cryptocurrency industry. Judge Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison, a decision that reflects his ambition and political manipulation. This outcome is particularly significant as the digital asset industry grapples with regulatory and ethical challenges, a topic that will be explored at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference.Amid calls for leniency, including a plea from a parent of an FTX victim who lost $130,000, recommending a six-year sentence, the crypto community has had mixed reactions. The 25-year sentence has been compared to the harsher punishment faced by Ross Ulbricht, founder of Silk Road. This comparison has sparked debate over the consistency and fairness of sentences within the crypto space, as seen in the reactions on X (formerly Twitter).Read Next: American CEO Spills Secrets From Xi Jinping Meeting: China’s President Gave ‘Tough Answers’ On Everything From Economy To Chips To TaiwanImage created using AI via MidJourney

However, this needs to be sustained by consistent interest and positive market conditions.On the flip side, Sei has experienced a small dip of 3.33% in the last month, which could indicate a cooling off or normal market fluctuation. The current price sits near the 10-day average, suggesting a neutral stance for short-term movements. If the price falls, it might find support at $0.5964 and further down at $0.3590. Investors should be cautious as the MACD suggests a sell, which could point to a potential short-term decline.  Pyth Network’s Price Surge: $1.18 in Sight?The recent surge in Pyth Network’s price to $0.91, up 24.41% over the last month and 138.11% over six months, shows strong momentum. With prices flirting near historical highs, reaching $1.18 might be on the horizon, especially if enthusiasm continues. Long term, a steady climb past the all-time high of $1.16 seems plausible, supported by growing adoption and positive sentiment in the market.Nonetheless, caution is warranted as the market is cyclical, and what goes up can also come down. If traders begin to take profits, support levels at $0.38 and $0.12 must hold to prevent a significant slide. In the short term, dips could offer buying opportunities, but market dynamics constantly change, and reliance on past performance is risky without considering broader market trends.Cardano Exhibits Growth with Potential RisksCardano‘s recent one-month growth of 4.01% and a significant six-month spike of 155.12% show momentum, suggesting a positive outlook. With a current price of $0.65, near the 10-day moving average of $0.64, there’s a foundation for stability. If it breaks the nearest resistance at $0.75, we could see a move towards the second resistance at $0.85. However, sliding below the nearest support level of $0.52 might pull the price down to the second support at $0.38, raising caution among investors.Considering the all-time high of $3.16, Cardano is currently at a fraction of its peak value. This gap indicates substantial growth potential, attracting long-term investors looking for significant returns. Yet, the 100-day average of $0.60, slightly below the current price, hints at underlying risk. Should the price dip and sustain below this average, it could signal a bearish trend, urging investors to reconsider their positions. Dogecoin Soars Past Averages & Aims HighDogecoin‘s recent jump to $0.224 has outpaced its 10-day average of $0.179 significantly, pointing to strong momentum. In the past month alone, it surged by roughly 130%, and over six months, it ballooned by almost 260%. With these figures, projection toward the first resistance of $0.143 seems conservative, suggesting a further push to the second resistance at $0.168 may follow. Assuming the trend holds, Dogecoin’s upward journey might continue, testing previous boundaries and possibly eyeing its historic peak of $0.7605.However, Dogecoin’s climb has not been straight, and prices can pivot quickly. Its current support levels at $0.085 and deeper at $0.052 are reminders of potential fallbacks. Despite its 100-day average resting at $0.109, current enthusiasm needs to withstand sell-offs that often follow steep ascents.  ConclusionWhile the other coins mentioned demonstrate potential for growth and market traction, BlastUP stands out as the crown jewel in the Blast ecosystem. Its distinctive combination of presale advantages, AI and Web3 integration, and a firm community-driven approach are why many consider it a contender for unprecedented growth. While the success of cryptocurrencies can never be guaranteed, BlastUP’s strong concept and ecosystem synergy appear to distinguish it as the frontrunner in the race toward significant returns on investment.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

The Spring Crypto Rush: 5 Fastest Growers to Watch | Cryptopolitan

After the Bitcoin halving, experts are buzzing about a big surge in crypto prices. Some say Bitcoin could soar to $200,000. High hopes are riding on crypto’s season of growth, much like the vibrant spring bloom. In this atmosphere of anticipation, we turn our focus to a select few cryptocurrencies that are rapidly gaining ground. These contenders are drawing attention from investors looking to tap into the crypto market’s potential windfall.BlastUP Presale Hits $3 Million: Anticipating the Next Big Thing in CryptoBlastUP, the premier launchpad on Blast, has recently made a splash in the crypto world with its head-spinning debut, raising  $3 million in a few weeks. The number of early investors who have already recognized BlastUP’s high potential is growing exponentially.BlastUP is poised to reach roaring success, with plans to empower Web3 tools with AI innovation for fast and quality startup launches. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools and a rich rewards system for all those coming on board.Currently, BlastUP is running its fourth presale stage, offering BlastUP tokens at the lowest price. Buying these tokens now at $0.055, you get a hefty discount of 45%, as the listing price is set at $0.1.>> Be Among the FIRST! Get the Exclusive Perks From BlastUP Presale <<Holders of BlastUP tokens may benefit from a number of privileges including allocations for token sales, exclusive loyalty rewards for participating in IDOs, and the ability to earn interest through staking.Following a simple mission to help blockchain startups grow faster and earn more, BlastUP is on its way to becoming a dominant force. The team of dedicated crypto enthusiasts behind the project are deeply committed to their vision and have ambitious plans to become a one-of-a-kind launchpad for easy and efficient blast off in the crypto space.The comprehensive roadmap of BlastUP extends through 2026, outlining plans to launch an AI IDO screener, develop AI tools tailored for startup teams, and set up the Community Marketplace.>> Join BlastUP Presale NOW to Unlock Early Benefits <<Render’s Strong Growth with Caution AdvisedRender has shown a strong one-month climb at 55.21% and an even more impressive six-months surge of 625.44%. Today’s current price is $11.16, sitting just above the 10-day average of $11.04, signaling positive momentum. However, with the nearest resistance level at $11.12, there’s potential for pullback if momentum shifts. Caution should be taken as prices could retreat toward the support at $5.09 or even $2.66, which would be significant drops. The fact that Render is trading above the 100-day average of $6.48 is a sign of strength and could suggest a sustained upward trend. Its all-time high stretches to $13.75, and given the latest prices, aspirations to revisit or surpass this peak seem within reach.  Optimism’s Short-Term Slip vs. Long-Term Growth PotentialThe short-term look for Optimism shows a bit of a slip in the last month, at a small drop of 0.12%. However, we’ve seen a strong bounce over the last six months with a rise of 175.46%. The push above the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) prices of $3.64 and $3.61 suggests some positive energy. With the current price at $3.70, nearby support at $2.95 might hold, but if it slips, we could see a drop to the lower support at $2.20.Longer-term, Optimism has room to grow towards its highest point of $4.86. The near resistance level of $4.32 could break with enough buying power, lining up a move towards the second resistance at $4.95. With a consistent buy signal from moving averages and MACD, there’s optimism in the air.  Aptos Surges 73.62%: Potential to Hit New PeaksAptos has seen a 73.62% rise in the past month and a staggering 214.82% increase over six months. This trend suggests a strong upward momentum, possibly driving prices past the current $17.25. If this growth continues, it could challenge the second resistance level at $18.82 soon. However, the crypto market can be very volatile, and any shift in trader sentiment could lead to a test of support at $9.07, or even $6.41.Looking at the all-time high of $72.56, despite the current price of $17.25, Aptos shows it has significant room for growth. Over the longer term, steady advancements and increasing adoption could push Aptos closer to former peaks. Nevertheless, traders should be mindful of the 100-day average at $10.85, as falling below this mark may indicate underlying weaknesses and potential for further declines. Long-term potential is there, but so is the risk of downturns.Mantle’s Growth: Resilience Amid FluctuationsMantle has been showing impressive growth recently, with a one-month upswing of 35.28% and a six-month leap of 200.60%. Considering the current price of $1.20, Mantle could experience further gains if it pushes past the nearest resistance level of $1.08, which seems likely given the positive technical signals from the MACD and both 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages. However, traders should also be aware of potential fallbacks to the support levels of $0.63 or worse, $0.37. Short-term fluctuations are always possible, and the neutral RSI suggests a potential consolidation phase might be on the horizon.Looking at the longer-term trend, Mantle’s robust six-month price jump suggests a strong bullish momentum, which can be considered a good sign for continued growth. The recommendations to buy from the MACD and the Simple Moving Averages point towards a positive market sentiment for Mantle. Yet, investors must consider the possibility that after such a significant increase, there may be a correction period. The resistance at $1.27 could cap near-term growth and should be closely monitored. ConclusionAs the crypto market enters this exuberant spring, the astonishing presale of BlastUP token draws a veil of optimism for the fintech community. While other coins have undoubtedly showcased potential for growth and profit, BlastUP gleams with the brightest prospects. Nestled within the Blast ecosystem and armed with a unique concept, BlastUP’s ambitious roadmap and integration of AI in Web3 tools position it as a frontrunner for those seeking fresh yet well-grounded opportunities. It’s evident that BlastUP holds a torch for innovation, illuminating a path for blockchain startups to flourish, and signaling a promising horizon for savvy investors.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Buy BlastUP Tokens Now and Catapult Your Investments <<Optimism’s Recent Dip Amid 175% 6-Month RallyThe recent performance of Optimism shows a slight dip of 0.19% over the past month, indicating some short-term trading hesitations. However, the six-month rally of 175.29% cannot be ignored. It reflects strong momentum which may continue pulling the price upwards towards the nearest resistance level of $4.32 and beyond. Considering its history of reaching $4.86501702, it’s possible that the current price of $3.70 could be seen as a buying opportunity for those believing in its further growth. Traders would watch the Simple Moving Average (SMA) values at $3.64 (10-days) and $3.61 (100-days), which are currently supporting the price, suggesting the potential for continued upward movement.On the flip side, one must consider the risks inherent in any cryptocurrency investment. The proximity of the nearest support level at $2.95, and the second support level at $2.20, indicate that if negative sentiment overtakes the market, the price could experience a decline. With the current price hovering above these supports, any shift in trader confidence could lead to testing these lower boundaries. The SMA indicators also suggest that if the price drops below them, it could signal a downward trend, inciting a more cautious approach from investors.  Aptos Rally: Over 215% Growth in 6 MonthsAptos has shown a strong uptrend recently, with over 73% gain in a month and over 215% in six months. These substantial rises hint at a growing belief in Aptos’ potential. With its current price at $17.29, above the 10-day average of $16.71, investors may see a chance for growth towards the all-time high of $72.56. However, respect for support levels at $9.07 and $6.41 remains crucial, as a fall below these could signal a shift in trend.Considering the encouraging move above the $13.77 nearest resistance, Aptos displays strength in the short-term, backed by buying signals from the MACD and simple moving averages. As it surpasses the 10-day average, the momentum could carry prices closer to the second resistance at $15.82. While the positive trend is substantial, a long-term outlook should account for normal market cycles, with the 100-day average at $10.85 serving as a humbling reminder of potential volatility.Render’s Soaring Growth: Surpasses Key Resistance LevelsRender has had a remarkable journey with a substantial one-month increase of 55.10% and an even more impressive six-month rise of 624.95%. With the current price at $11.15, surpassing both the simple moving average for 10 days at $11.04 and the 100-day average at $6.47, momentum seems to be on its side. Considering the nearest resistance level is $11.12, which Render has already crossed, the next target might be the second resistance level at $13.72. If the bullish trend continues, testing its all-time high of $13.75 could be within reach. The market’s appetite for growth and innovation could further fuel this ascent.However, the current price is also in a delicate position, slightly above the second resistance level. This upward trend may invite short-term profit-taking, potentially pushing the price towards the nearest support at $5.09 or even the second support at $2.66 if the market reacts strongly. Long-term, prices are volatile and subject to changes in market sentiment and broader economic conditions. Mantle’s 200.7% Surge: Trend, Resistance & SupportLooking at Mantle’s recent surge of 35.32% over a month and an impressive 200.70% hike in six months, the momentum is strong. With the current price at $1.20, the nearest resistance at $1.08 might soon be a support if the trend continues. Yet, remember, trends can reverse, and if it does, the price could test the $0.63 support, or even drop to $0.37. Be mindful that rapid climbs can lead to sharp declines.The long-term view shows Mantle has grown a lot, but without the all-time high and change, it’s tricky. If it can hold above the 10-day and 100-day averages of $0.96 and $0.76, this could signal stability and ongoing growth. Watch for any move towards the second resistance of $1.27 as a sign of strength. Still, any negative developments could push the price back to these averages or below, testing long-term trust in its value stability.ConclusionIn conclusion, while several assets stand out with notable performances and commendable growth potential, BlastUP comes under the spotlight with its unique position in the Blast ecosystem. The impressive $3 million raised in mere weeks, coupled with its strategic roadmap reaching into 2026, firmly suggests that this project is not just another fleeting trend, but a foundational platform set to catalyze the crypto space. Investors looking for a high-potential asset should strongly consider the innovative concept and robust backing BlastUP offers—it’s poised to lead the charge in the anticipated crypto bull run.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Buy BlastUP Tokens Now and Catapult Your Investments <<Avalanche’s Strong Growth with Investment CautionsAvalanche has surged 38.22% in one month and an impressive 487.32% in six months, showcasing robust growth. Considering the all-time high of $151.22 and the current price at $54.26, there are splendid long-term opportunities if the coin taps into ongoing market trends and innovations, possibly revisiting past peaks. Short-term, Avalanche faces a mix of signals. With RSI and Stochastic indicators suggesting neutrality, there’s room for the price to swing in either direction, hinging on market sentiment. The current SMA 10-days at $55 suggests some selling pressure, while the 100-day SMA at $41.44 is a buying signal. Investors could see dips as chances to buy, but cautiousness is key; the MACD’s sell signal indicates possible upcoming price drops.Impressive 176% Surge in Optimism (OP), Market Eyes ResistanceIn the past six months, Optimism (OP) surged impressively, jumping nearly 176%. This upward movement signals strong market interest, and if this trend continues, the price could look at testing the first resistance level at $4.32, perhaps even aiming for the second at $4.95. Multiple indicators suggest buying, including the MACD and both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages. Given these signals, enthusiasm might drive prices nearer to the all-time high of around $4.87, especially if the short-term outlook remains bright and traders keep a buy-and-hold stance.However, the one-month change shows a modest increase of just 0.02%, indicating that recent momentum has slowed. This pause can imply that the price may stabilize before making any significant moves. If the market sentiment shifts or if traders lock in profits, it could challenge the nearest support at $2.95 or even push towards the second support at $2.20.  Polkadot’s Growth Indicates Potential for RecoveryPolkadot shows a notable one-month price change at 13.26% and an impressive six-month growth of 131.22%. Considering its all-time high of $56.22 and the current price of $9.48, there’s strong potential for recovery and further growth. Recent trends could attract investors looking for growth opportunities, which may push the price towards the nearest resistance level at $9.26 and beyond.  However, market indicators like the MACD suggest a sell action, which could point to potential short-term downward pressure. If this sentiment prevails, prices might test the nearest support at $6.91 or even the second support at $5.55. Investors might see these levels as opportunities to buy, reflected by the simple moving average recommendations asserting a buy action in both 10-day and 100-day windows. Jupiter’s Market Surge: Analyzing its PotentialJupiter’s recent growth is hard to ignore, with a one month jump of 158.83% and a massive six month surge of 4250.00%. Considering the current price of $1.31, a bullish case could see the price testing the nearest resistance at $0.68, possibly aiming for $0.81. If the momentum continues, the appetite for risk among investors might push the price even higher, attracting more attention to its growth narrative.  Despite the impressive uptick, investors must remember every asset has potential downturns. The nearest support at $0.42 and the second level at $0.30 serve as reminders of where the price might land if the market sentiment shifts. Long-term prospects could be dampened by unforeseen events, leading to a reevaluation of the asset’s value.  ConclusionIn a sea of digital assets each promising a tomorrow brighter than the next, BlastUP stands out with extraordinary potential as part of the innovative Blast ecosystem. With its strong concept and comprehensive Web3 and AI tool suite, BlastUP is poised for significant impact in the blockchain startup sphere. While other coins spotlighted in this article show promise with their respective gains and market indicators, BlastUP seems particularly positioned to spearhead the charge into the future of crypto. Its rapid fundraising success and a clear-cut path to 2026 exemplify why BlastUP could very well lead the pack with the highest potential for growth.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

BlastUP is about to shake up the crypto scene, so get on board before this rocket ship takes off without you!>> Act Fast! Supply of BlastUP Tokens is Limited – Secure Your Spot in the BlastUP Launch! <<Avalanche’s Momentum: Short-Term Gains and OutlookSeeing Avalanche has climbed by over 38% in the last month signals strong short-term momentum. It overshooting its nearest resistance suggests high demand, yet we need to watch if it holds above the $46.32 level. Should it stay above the 10-day SMA, the uptrend might persist. But, breaking under could attract selling, pressing it towards the $33.98 support.A 487% surge over six months coupled with a price notably lower than the all-time high presents room for future growth long-term. Steadily exceeding the 100-day SMA indicates building strength. However, significant increases can attract profit-taking, potentially pulling the price back. Still, if buying persists, it may test the second resistance level, hinting at a longer-term uptrend.Polkadot’s Growth: Balancing Potential and RisksPolkadot shows a significant one-month gain of 13.38% and an impressive six-month increase of 131.46%. With the current price at $9.49, just above the nearest resistance of $9.26, the momentum could push prices towards the second resistance level at $10.25. Considering the historical peak at $56.22, current levels suggest room for growth. The moving averages signal a buying opportunity, indicating a potential upswing if the market sentiment remains positive.However, the mixed signals from technical indicators such as the MACD suggest that selling could be prudent, pointing to possible short-term declines. The current price hovers near the 10-day simple moving average of $9.38, signaling stability, yet the nearest support level at $6.91 stresses the importance of market resilience. Long-term, the 100-day simple moving average at $8.21 supports an uptrend, but if breached, it could lead to a test of the second support at $5.55, revealing the need for cautious optimism.Optimism Price Steady, Potential for GrowthOptimism’s current price of $3.72, closely aligned with its 10-day simple moving average of $3.64, suggests a stable short-term trend, which could entice buyers. Its recent one-month minor increase of 0.34% indicates a potential for slow yet steady growth in the coming weeks. The coin’s resistance at $4.32 may cap near-term gains, but breaching this could signal stronger buyer confidence, pushing towards the $4.95 level. However, short-term traders should be cautious, as a drop below the nearest support at $2.95 could lead to further declines towards $2.20, though current indicators lean towards buying.Considering Optimism’s remarkable six-month surge of 176.73%, long-term prospects seem bright. This performance, paired with a solid support above $2.00, offers a cushion against significant downturns, suggesting a resilient market sentiment. With its all-time high at $4.87 within sight, a bullish outlook is supported, especially if the 100-day simple moving average at $3.61 continues to trend upwards. Long-term risks include the coin failing to uphold momentum, which might result in a pull-back below the key support levels.  Jupiter’s Price Surges Amid Market OptimismWith Jupiter’s price up by 158.67% in the past month and an incredible 4247.33% over six months, we’re seeing strong short-term growth. Its current price is $1.30, just above the 10-day average of $1.29, suggesting consistent demand. If it can break through the nearest resistance at $0.677 and aim for $0.807, this momentum could continue for some time.Longer-term, the substantial increase in value requires caution. If a pullback occurs, the levels at $0.424 and $0.300 could provide safety nets, but the market can be unpredictable. Balancing the rapid recent increases with the potential for future corrections is key, and watching the support and resistance levels will be crucial in navigating Jupiter’s price journey.ConclusionIn conclusion, while other emerging altcoins like Avalanche, Polkadot, Optimism, and Jupiter show signs of promise and potential growth, BlastUP stands out with the most compelling upside. The project’s integration into the wider Blast ecosystem, innovative use of AI and Web3 tools, and its strong community-driven approach position it as a particularly attractive investment. With its presale grabbing the attention of discerning investors, BlastUP is poised to capitalize on the current market and could soar to impressive heights, marking it as the altcoin with the highest potential as we look ahead.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Pushes 'Positive-Sum' Vision for Meme Coins - Decrypt

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a "positive-sum" vision for meme coins, arguing that the current crop of meme-inspired cryptocurrencies do little more than "go up and down in price and contribute nothing of value in their wake."In a recent blog post, Buterin argued that "many people feel uneasy" about the current crop of meme coins, and outlined how the "financialized games" that underpin them can be made to support public goods and charities.He took aim at a recent wave of "openly super-racist" meme coins on blockchains such as Solana, adding that, "I have zero enthusiasm for coins named after totalitarian political movements, scams, rugpulls or anything that feels exciting in month N but leaves everyone upset in month N+1."Buterin seemed to be referring to a rash of blatantly racist tokens that appeared on exchanges last week, many that used the n-word, a token called "Jews did 9/11," and "NAZI," which appears on exchanges with a swastika as its trading symbol."One answer to this conundrum is to shake our heads and virtue-signal about how much we are utterly abhorred by and stand against this stupidity," Buterin said. A more productive step, he argued, is to create a "more positive-sum version" of the whole concept of meme coins.Buterin envisions meme coins being more like GiveWell Inu (which is no longer active), which promised to donate a portion of its proceeds to the Give Well organization.Back in 2021, after Buterin had been gifted half the Shiba Inu (SHIB) supply he swapped them for Ethereum.

Short squeeze alert for next week: Two cryptocurrencies with potential to skyrocket


The cryptocurrency market is in a consolidation range after a remarkable bull rally, followed by a bearish correction. Meanwhile, the latter has favored an increased open interest in short positions for some cryptocurrencies that could short squeeze.
Essentially, a short squeeze happens when a sudden price increase forces multiple opened shorts to close, liquidating the bearish traders. This event fuels the uptrend, driving prices even further.
Therefore, identifying large liquidity pools to the upside could help cryptocurrency traders spot valuable opportunities in the derivatives market.


Finbold gathered data from CoinGlass on March 29 and spotted a short-squeeze potential for Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX).
Solana (SOL)
First, Solana’s open interest has maintained historical highs in the past few weeks, following its native token’s, SOL, price action. There are currently over $3 billion in Futures contracts while traders speculate on SOL’s volatility.

Interestingly, much of this interest is allocated to short positions, which has created large liquidity pools to the upside. In particular, with meaningful accumulation at $192, $194, and $197, making those potential targets in a short squeeze next week.
As of writing, SOL trades at around $185 and a run to these targets offers a possible 6.5% gain.

Avalanche (AVAX)
One of Solana’s most promising competitors, Avalanche, is also presenting a potential short-squeeze opportunity for next week. However, AVAX’s open interest is lower than $500 million, with a significantly lower capital flow than its leading competitor.

Like SOL, the majority of the market’s interest in Avalanche seems to weigh towards short positions. In particular, creating a massive liquidation target at the $59.5 price level, with over 11.5% potential gains from $53.35 registered at the time of publication.

Despite the relevant potential, short-sellers futures liquidations do not guarantee a short squeeze will occur. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and drastically changes every minute with news and technical analyses.

                        The crypto exchange HKVAEX, linked to the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, has withdrawn its virtual asset trading platform license application from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) post-deadline.The Hong Kong securities regulator asked crypto exchanges and firms to apply for the license before the deadline of February 29.HKVAEX Withdraws Application for Virtual Asset Trading Platform License in Hong Kong
The Virtual Asset Trading Platform (VATP) is a license provided by the government of Hong Kong that allows crypto exchanges to operate within the region’s bounds.Although the license has been available for several years now, only two exchanges—HashKey and OSL—currently possess one. HashKey secured its approval in November 2022, with its competitor getting the nod a month later in December 2022. Several applicants have been on the waitlist for a while, including HKVAEX, linked with Binance, until yesterday, when the firm withdrew its application.
Source: sfc.hk
HKVAEX, which reportedly shares technical and other resources with Binance, according to Chinese state media SCMP, submitted its application on January 4. However, the exchange appears to be missing from the list of companies whose license applications are on Hong Kong’s SFC website, which confirms that HKVAEX withdrew its license application nearly three months after the filing. Notably, the SFC publicly maintains a list of crypto platforms that will receive operational licenses to raise public awareness of safe crypto trading.The reasons behind the withdrawal are unclear. Some believe it may be due to a request to change the audit company, insufficient materials, or other reasons. The Hong Kong SFC stipulates that crypto trading platforms apply for regional operational licenses by February 29, also setting a May 31 deadline for non-compliant exchanges to cease operations. Consequently, HKVAEX must close their businesses in Hong Kong by May 31.In addition to HKVAEX, three other virtual asset trading platforms withdrew their license applications in 2024, although the reasons remain undisclosed. This includes Huobi, a prominent global crypto exchange.HTX (Formerly Huobi) Resubmits License Application in Hong Kong After Initial Withdrawal
In February, HTX, formerly known as Huobi, withdrew its license application in Hong Kong and then resubmitted it. HTX initially submitted the exchange license application in early February, only to withdraw three days later on February 23, citing the Securities and Futures Commission’s list of license applicants. The company, however, resubmitted the application on February 27, according to the SFC’s website.Unlike its neighbouring Chinese mainland’s broader crypto trading and mining crackdown, Hong Kong rolled out the welcome mat for crypto firms last year. In June 2023, Hong Kong officially started its crypto licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms, allowing licensed exchanges to offer retail trading services. Many global exchanges have applied for the retail trading licenses.According to its website, the financial regulator is officially reviewing applications from 19 crypto firms, including OKX, Bybit, Bullish, and Crypto.com. The SFC urged investors to verify trading platforms using its public register of licensed persons and registered institutions and the list of licensed virtual asset trading platforms for relevant information on licensed entities, including their official websites.

Dogwifhat flips Pepe as WIF hits new ATH - CoinJournal



                    

                    Dogwifhat (WIF) strengthened its position as the top Solana-based meme coin. 
With a 20% spike on Friday, the popular meme coin hit $4 to reach a new all-time high. This came after WIF price pushed past the previous all-time high reached in mid-March.
Chart showing dogwifhat price. Source: TradingView
The gains saw dogwifhat flip Pepe in market cap after it reached $4 billion. Pepe, which had weekly gains of just 6% compared to WIF’s 64%, had its market cap at around $3.3 billion at the time of writing.
At current prices of $3.63, WIF is way up on its all-time low of $0.001555 in mid-December 2023.
Dogecoin breaks above $0.2
Dogwifhat’s recent surge has it poised behind meme coin heavyweights Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. 
DOGE has had a decent run of its own, with Dogecoin price hitting highs of $0.22. The original dog-meme coin has jumped more than 120% in the past 30 days.
This upside has come as bets on DOGE futures rose to a record $2.2 billion amid bullish sentiment around potential listing of Dogecoin futures trading on Coinbase.
The exchange recently revealed it would launch futures trading for Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.

Crypto Expert Publishes A Run-Down Of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Lesser Known Activities | Bitcoinist.com


								Coinbase’s Director of Product Strategy & Business Operations and On-chain Sleuth Conor Grogan recently highlighted some of Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) lesser-known activities. These were primarily on-chain transactions that the FTX founder carried out, but they were never brought to light during his trial. 
How Sam Bankman-Fried On-Chain Transactions Harmed Crypto
Grogan revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bankman-Fried, through Alameda Research, sold $75 million of staked ETH (stETH) in January 2022. This led to a massive depeg event, which triggered the bank run on bankrupt crypto lender Celsius. That was also the tail event that brought about the collapse of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).

Bankman-Fried is also said to have used FTX customer funds to purchase a bunch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that didn’t necessarily have any utility, including CarolineDAO NFTs. CarolineDAO proudly claimed to be “SimpDAO for Caroline Ellison,” the former CEO of Alameda Research and Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend.   
Grogan further revealed that Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research engaged in thousands of wash-trading transactions to boost the visibility of SBF’s holdings. Wash trading is a form of market manipulation in which the same trader buys and sells an asset to give the impression that there is demand for it. 
Alameda, being a market maker and with FTX customers’ funds at its disposal, had enough capital to manipulate the market. At some point, the trading firm was said to have had more trading activity than MEV bots. 
Another way Sam Bankman-Fried tried to play the market was when the FTX founder’s ‘test’ NFT was created and sold for $270,000, with Grogan speculating that it was most likely bought by SBF himself using customers’ funds. Bankman-Fried was also at it again when he received 2 million RAY tokens and proceeded to sell part of them, even though they were meant to be vested. 
More On Bankman-Fried’s On-Chain Activity
Shiba Inu (SHIB) was also caught in the mix as Bankman-Fried is said to have helped the token’s price skyrocket while building a large position. He eventually offloaded his SHIB tokens, which caused the meme coin to plummet. Interestingly, this happened when FTX had just expanded its SHIB perpetual, meaning SBF possibly shorted the meme coin, too. 

SHIB wasn’t the only crypto token that Sam Bankman-Fried aggressively dumped. Grogan revealed that the FTX founder offloaded 35,000 SUSHI tokens while lying about not having dumped or shortened the coin. 
The FTT token he “invented” also played a massive role in his on-chain transactions as he wrapped and rewrapped the exchange’s utility token to gain more liquidity. That explains why Sam Bankman-Fried, almost every week, publicly shilled FTT and pretended to TWAP the token. 
Grogan also mentioned that Bankman-Fried wasn’t active on-chain until the crimes started. Alameda wallets, in particular, weren’t very active until FTX’s Director of Engineering Nishad Singh created the bug, which enabled the trading firm to withdraw unlimited sums from FTX’s account.

Bitcoin bulls await $15 billion options expiry: Is $80K inevitable?


With the arrival of the deadline for the cryptocurrency options exchange Deribit to settle its $15 billion contracts in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin bulls in particular have a strong reason to rejoice, as early as this weekend or next week, with a possible $80,000 waiting around the corner.
Specifically, Bitcoin is still trading above its 2021 all-time high (ATH), with the possibility of a breakout this weekend or next week, against the backdrop of the expected expiration of $15 billion in digital assets, as the crypto analyst CryptoJelleNL noted in an X post on March 29.
Bitcoin price prediction
On top of that, the pseudonymous crypto trading expert has shared the BTC price prediction that sees the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset hitting the target at $80,000 in “a matter of time,” as it has recently broken out of its descending broadening wedge and above its weekly support.

Earlier, this crypto expert also highlighted that Bitcoin was breaking out of its cup & handle chart pattern, a movement that typically happens after an uptrend and suggests that the market is preparing “for a new move higher,” which in Bitcoin’s case is a “target of roughly $80,000.”

Meanwhile, the maiden crypto asset was at press time changing hands at a price of $70,140, recording a decline of 0.86% on the day but nonetheless increasing 9.19% across the past week, and adding up to the more significant 18.08% gain in the last month, according to the latest charts on March 29.

It is also important to mention that Bitcoin might be looking at even more impressive gains in this cycle, at least where crypto specialist TradingShot is concerned, deriving a BTC price prediction target at $200,o00 on the basis of the asset’s remarkable resistance and previous patterns, as Finbold reported on March 28.
All things considered, things are looking great for the future price of Bitcoin, but the cryptoverse can sometimes be a volatile place, and making a definitive Bitcoin price prediction is a difficult task, so doing one’s own research is critical when investing.

Telegram Mini Apps are ‘Trojan horse’ for mass blockchain adoption - TON investments director

The blockchain-based mini-decentralized applications (DApps) on Telegram, also known as Mini Apps, could be a “Trojan horse” for mass blockchain adoption.That’s according to Justin Hyun, the director of investments at TON Foundation, who told Cointelegraph:“That’s our thesis for bringing in more users onto the blockchain without even needing to educate them about the blockchain. It’s a Trojan horse way to say: look, you’re letting in all these user-friendly DApps, and we won’t even necessarily call them DApps [...] It’s just Telegram Mini Apps that they’re using whether that’s inside their channels.”Telegram Mini Apps launched in 2020 as an open platform allowing Web3 businesses to deploy crypto-friendly apps directly within the Telegram messaging app. They were launched in partnership with The Open Network (TON) Foundation and Tencent with the intention of creating a super-app platform.Bringing the next 500 million users on-chain will require simple initial use cases where users aren’t necessarily aware of the underlying blockchain interaction. Hyun says:“We believe mass adoption really comes in the form of simple use cases in the beginning, and then there will be drop-offs of more sophisticated users going into different types of use cases. But bringing 500 million people on-chain by 2028 — which is our goal — is going to require use cases that interact with the blockchain without the user knowing that in the front end.”Some Telegram Mini Apps will also offer Web3-specific financial incentives for users, Hyun explained.VIDEOJustin Hyun talks about the mechanics of Mini Apps.

Acura Capital and $100M Patex Unite to Launch a New Digital Bank



                    
Acura Capital, a distinguished investment fund from Brazil with assets under management worth $1.8 billion and $3 billion in assets in custody, is launching an innovative financial product. The idea comes from a collaboration with Patex, Latin America’s leading developer of blockchain ecosystems. By joining their efforts, Acura Capital and Patex aim to debut a digital banking platform designed to transform the financial sector.



Services That Will Revolutionize the Latin America Banking Sector



A new digital banking platform is set to revolutionize the Latin American market. This innovative platform harmonizes the trusted reliability of traditional banking services with cutting-edge advancements in cryptocurrency technology. Acura Capital and Patex’s collaboration is poised to bridge the region’s unique economic gaps, leveraging Acura Capital’s extensive financial expertise and Patex’s profound insights in the blockchain sector.




The jointly developed product will serve over 670 million people living in Latin America. Uniting banking solutions with blockchain technologies, the project will offer the following solutions:




Digital wallet. This wallet is fortified with cutting-edge encryption methods, ensuring the secure storage and management of user assets. Its user-friendly interface facilitates swift financial transactions across a diverse array of currencies.

Exchange platform. It is where users may convert different currencies – fiat and crypto – seamlessly and swiftly. The exchange platform offers low conversion rates and allows for the implementation of efficient trading strategies.



Tokens for payments. Patex tokens can now be used in transactions on the Pix platform. It is a popular instant payment platform released by the Central Bank of Brazil. Patex tokens serve to facilitate efficient transactions on Pix without having to deal with traditional financial go-betweens.

It carries out the transformation of physical assets into tradable securities listed on traditional exchanges. These securities form the basis for creating tokenized assets, which will be issued through security token offerings and subsequently traded on secondary markets.



Floating services are designed to adapt to changing market conditions. They do this by dynamically adjusting the interest rates on savings and loans to provide customers with the most favorable conditions.



Personal loans are tailored to meet the needs of its customers, offering flexible repayment plans, competitive interest rates, and a straightforward application process.

Got $500? Buy these cryptos


March has been an exciting month for cryptocurrencies, with a rally that led to a new Bitcoin (BTC)  all-time high near $73,000 and then a correction that saw a significant crash across the board.
As the month is drawing to a close – and the month of the highly-anticipated BTC halving is drawing ever nearer – the crypto market is again eying a rise in value, especially given few of the big coins and tokens in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are in the red on both the daily and weekly charts.
Since there is likely to be much excitement in the coming weeks – and likely several major surges – Finbold decided to take a look at a couple of cryptocurrencies that may well be worth investing $500 or more in April.


Polkadot (DOT)
While Polkadot (DOT) has remained relatively under the radar in 2024, the cryptocurrency has actually offered multiple exciting developments that are either already live or are actively in the works.
For one, the Polkadot network logged a new non-fungible token (NFT) minting speed record through its parachain – Unique Network – having reached nearly 5,000 NFTs per minute.
Additionally, a dedicated team is actively working on a new meme coin – DED – which has already gained significant traction within the community and might not only provide a boost for DOT itself but could also constitute the latest such project to explode once released.
Finally, Polkadot appears to be readying itself for its next big rally based on its recent performance as it has recently started breaking out of a correction it entered following the previous surge.
The last 30 days saw DOT trade with significant volatility but remain 12.70% in the green while the token is 9.06% up on the weekly chart. Polkadot price today has also changed in a positive direction as it climbed 1.25% to $9.64.

DOT’s relative quietness during the ongoing rally and the fact that is still well below its all-time highs near $53 also make it a good candidate for a continued surge – particularly with the recent string of developments in mind.
Dogecoin (DOGE)
The oldest meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE) also appears like a strong buy at April’s doorstep. Not only has the month historically been at least somewhat kind to the cryptocurrency type, but there has been a growing interest in the coin.
Indeed, in the last two weeks, whales accumulated approximately $280 million worth of DOGE helping its market cap surge approximately $7 billion in the time frame and creating new higher support zones with a likely continued Bitcoin rally nearly guaranteeing a continuous Dogecoin surge.
On the price side, Dogecoin has also been doing well in recent times and is up 140.03% since the start of 2024. Most recently, it has been on a rampage breaking above $0.2 and retesting the resistance at $0.22.

The uptrend has been particularly strong in the last 30 days of trading which saw the meme coin surge 66.34% and the most recent time frames have also been generally strong with DOGE climbing 45.15% in the last 7 days to $0.216 – highest it has been since November 2021.

Another Approval for Bitcoin from Brazil! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin continues to reach wider audiences after the spot BTC ETFs approved by the SEC in January, another approval came from Brazil.
Brazil's popular cryptocurrency exchange B3 announced that the country's securities regulator has given permission to offer Bitcoin futures to its customers, Reuters reports.


Accordingly, the exchange will start Bitcoin futures trading on April 17. The exchange said that the BTC futures contract allows transactions without the need to buy or sell actual Bitcoin.
Accordingly, Bitcoin futures will be pegged to the Nasdaq Bitcoin Reference Price, and each contract will represent 10% of Bitcoin's BTC value priced in Brazilian reals.





Speaking to Reuters, B3 senior executive said the following about the new Bitcoin development:

“The launch meets demand for a derivative that provides a hedge against Bitcoin price fluctuations or directional risk to the asset.”

With the latest BTC decision, Brazil continues to be one of the countries that attract attention with its positive attitude towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin Will Hit $150,000 By 2025, According To Investment Firm CEO's Crypto Crystal Ball


								With the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving just weeks away, industry pundit Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, is fueling the fire of investor excitement with a daring price prediction: Bitcoin reaching a staggering $150,000 by 2025.

Will Bitcoin Register A New ATH?
Yusko’s bullish outlook hinges on a combination of factors. He cites Metcalfe’s law, a network effect model, to estimate the top crypto’s current “fair value” at $50,000.
The upcoming halving, which cuts miner rewards in half, is expected to disrupt supply dynamics and historically has been followed by price surges. However, Yusko acknowledges the emergence of transaction fees as a new wrinkle, potentially mitigating the immediate impact of the halving on miner profitability.
VIDEO
This cycle might be a bit different, Yusko says, referring to the transaction fees generated by Ordinals and Inscriptions, a recent development allowing users to embed data onto the Bitcoin blockchain.
Bitcoin’s ‘Fair Value’
Despite this, he anticipates a fair value of $75,000 post-halving due to factors like increased investor interest and the “fear of missing out” (FOMO) that often accompanies such events.
Yusko isn’t alone in his optimism. Big names like Robert Kiyosaki and Standard Chartered bank share his belief in a potential $150,000 price target. This sentiment echoes the broader bullish trend in the crypto market, fueled by increasing institutional adoption and the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation.

But not everyone is convinced. Bitcoin’s price history is notoriously volatile, and external factors like regulatory changes or economic downturns can quickly derail even the most well-reasoned predictions. Critics also point out limitations in applying Metcalfe’s law, originally designed for communication networks, to a complex system like Bitcoin.

Exact Price Trajectory Unclear
The road to $150,000 also remains unclear. While Yusko predicts a significant price increase after the halving, with a potential peak around nine months later (end of 2024), the exact trajectory hinges on a delicate balance between supply and demand.
Increased demand from institutional investors, particularly through vehicles like Bitcoin ETFs, could propel the price upwards. However, this needs to be met by a constrained supply due to the halving.
The price has to rise with more demand than supply, the analyst emphasizes, suggesting a potentially parabolic price movement towards the end of the year. Historically, Bitcoin price peaks have occurred around nine months after halving events, before a subsequent bear market sets in.

Three Weeks Left till Bitcoin Halving 2024, Big Boost for Bitcoin ETF | Coinspeaker



Historically, past Bitcoin halving events have proved to be bullish for the Bitcoin price, with analysts expecting a rally to $200,000. 

The much-awaited Bitcoin halving 2024 is exactly three weeks or 21 days away from here scheduled to happen on April 19, depending on the block time average of the last 20,160 blocks. The next Bitcoin halving shall occur at block 840,000. However, some market analysts also believe that the exact date of halving might vary by a day more at around April 20.
The Bitcoin halving cycle represents a programmed reduction in BTC rewards. This reduction involves the halving of the mining rewards awarded to Bitcoin miners approximately every four years, which occur at every 210,000 blocks. In the upcoming Bitcoin halving, the miner rewards will reduce from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.




Several Bitcoin miners have already begun preparations to set the next course of action after halving. Most of the Bitcoin miners have been liquidating their holdings in the past few months and using the proceeds to upgrade their mining equipment.
Historically, Bitcoin halving events have been considered good for BTC investors as the supply reduction drives prices higher in the long term. Thus, many are expecting history to repeat once again with some giving Bitcoin price targets of $200,000 by 2025 end.
Bitcoin Halving 2024 Potentially Boosts ETF Momentum
Popular broker Canaccord Genuity recently released a report talking about Bitcoin’s remarkable 60% surge in the first quarter. The broker noted that this rally came primarily on the backdrop of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launch, the impending reward halving, and a growing appetite for risk in financial markets.
The analysts, led by Michael Graham, highlighted that while the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain, the forthcoming halving event could further bolster the tailwinds for Bitcoin ETFs. They further emphasized that activity levels across the cryptocurrency ecosystem have been rebounding from the lows seen in 2023.
As said, the fourth halving event, which slashes miner rewards by 50%, thereby reducing the supply of Bitcoin, is anticipated in April. Canaccord expressed optimism about the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in the quarter, foreseeing a sustained tailwind as retail investors seek to incorporate crypto exposure into tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs.
Furthermore, the report states that publicly traded Bitcoin miners underperformed BTC during the first quarter. This clearly highlights their decoupling from the BTC price. As a result, many are also questioning the profitability of the miners after the upcoming halving.
On the other hand, spot Bitcoin ETFs provide equity investors an alternative to seek exposure to Bitcoin. Canaccord suggested that if historical patterns repeat, a potentially more bullish period for Bitcoin could unfold in the months following the halving event.

AI and crypto worlds merge to become ‘Artificial Superintelligence.’

What if artificial intelligence combines with cryptocurrency? The answer would be perhaps the future of everything. Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?One such merger actually happened earlier this week, when blockchain networks Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol combined their tokens into one and created an alliance for decentralized AI — or “ASI,” which stands for “artificial superintelligence.”Their partnership aims to provide an alternative to tech giants’ growing control of the AI industry.Here’s what to know.What’s the purpose of the alliance?All three blockchain networks will continue to operate as before, but the new agreement will enable the platforms to collaborate to create blockchain-based decentralized AI protocols, which cannot be controlled by large stakeholders or centralized parties. The goal is to provide a viable alternative to tech giants’ control over AI development, usage, and monetization.Read more: Big Tech is swallowing up AIFetch.AI is a blockchain network that provides tools to build innovative AI apps and services. Its native token is FET. Ocean Protocol is a blockchain-based marketplace that acts as a bridge between data providers and data consumers, and its native token is OCEAN. SingularityNET, on the other hand, offers a blockchain-based AI marketplace, and its native token is AGIX.Tokens jumped almost 30% in a weekAccording to crypto tracking site CoinGecko, Fetch.ai’s FET token has a market cap of $3.3 billion. Following that are SingularityNet’s AGIX token, with a market cap of $1.7 billion, and Ocean Protocol’s (OCEAN) token, with a market cap of $856 million. The merger will bring the new token ASI to a fully diluted valuation of $7.5 billion.Over the past seven days, FET shares rose 28%, AGIX shares soared 31%, and OCEAN shares jumped 28%.From chip to blockchain, AI is everywhereIn the past few years, artificial intelligence has gained widespread acceptance across all sectors of technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple — everyone is betting on AI. As blockchain companies strive to make data more decentralized and transparent, it’s no wonder they want to join the AI space.

Markus Thielen Forecasts Bitcoin (BTC) to Surge 12% in April | Coinspeaker



While historical data and current market sentiments suggest that BTC will likely rally after the halving event, other analysts have cautioned inventors against relying on past performance to forecast future price movements.

As March gradually comes to a close, Markus Thielen, a senior analyst at 10x Research, has shared his insights on potential Bitcoin behavior for the upcoming month.
According to a recent social media post on X, the top crypto analyst said that Bitcoin (BTC) has had a massive rally of seven consecutive months and could continue in the trajectory to rally 12% from the current price of $70,000 to $84,000 in April.




Bitcoin’s Historical April Performance
Thielen noted that April could be a particularly favorable month for BTC, especially with the industry anticipating Bitcoin halving 2024 to occur within the month.
Referencing historical patterns, the analyst said that the month April has the tendency to deliver positive returns for Bitcoin, with six out of the last ten years experiencing significant price increases.


This historical data aligns with BTC past performance after previous halving events. For example, the crypto asset jumped over 30% in the first few months that followed 2020 halving before recording an all-time high of nearly $70,000 in 2021.
Thielen suggested that BTC could follow the same pattern of previous performance to soar 12% come next month. The analyst predicted that with this historical pattern, the upcoming halving could be a significant catalyst for another bullish rally, potentially driving the price to new all-time highs.
Market Sentiment and Institutional Interest
In addition to the historical data, market sentiment also seems to be another factor that could potentially drive the rally, with several indicators pointing towards a positive outlook for BTC.
The recent introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, bringing an influx of institutional investors into the industry, has added legitimacy to the crypto asset as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.
Industry executives like Matthew Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer said in a recent memo distributed to industry professionals that investors could potentially invest as much as $1 trillion into BTC through ETFs as they start to enter the crypto market.
Apart from the ETFs, financial companies are also entering the market. Banks such as HSBC are also entering the crypto market, bringing a range of real-world assets (RWA) onto blockchains. The financial institution recently launched its tokenized gold token dubbed HSBC Gold Token for retail investors.
Additionally, the growing interest in Bitcoin futures and options markets indicates that institutional investors are increasingly looking to hedge their positions and take advantage of potential price movements.
While historical data and current market sentiments suggest that BTC will likely rally after the halving event, other analysts have cautioned inventors against relying on past performance to forecast future price movements.

The Shiba Inu community has been issued a critical warning following the exposure of fraudulent airdrop bot scams.Shibarmy Scam Alerts, an X handle tasked with uncovering scams and protecting the Shiba Inu community, issues warnings on fake airdrops and group bots while flagging two of such fraudulent schemes. The scam, which promised free tokens through an airdrop from a fake social media channel, has been debunked, with another that promoted a fake Shiba Inu airdrop bot. These deceitful schemes have prompted a critical warning to the SHIB community, urging caution and vigilance against such fraudulent endeavors.In this light, Shibarmy Scam Alerts reminds the Shiba Inu community that there are no official SHIB airdrops to claim; nor are there Shiba Inu group bots for channels. In another tweet, it warns about fake reward claim sites and groups that are currently proliferating.Shiba Inu holders are also cautioned that there is no rewards program and that K9 Finance does not offer any airdrops.Scammers often use the allure of free tokens to trick individuals into giving away sensitive information or access to their funds. Victims are lured to provide personal information or transfer cryptocurrency to participate in the airdrop. After obtaining the victim's assets, the scammers disappear without fulfilling their promises, leaving behind a trail of financial damage.Thus, as a critical warning, Shiba Inu holders are urged not to join any fake Telegram groups or connect their wallets to any site to gain airdrops or rewards.The recent incident underlines the importance of remaining vigilant and skeptical of any offers or promotions claiming to distribute free tokens. Cryptocurrency holders are advised to conduct thorough research, verify the legitimacy of any airdrop or giveaway and exercise caution when sharing personal information or transferring cryptocurrency.

Despite Warren Buffett's Warnings Calling Bitcoin 'Rat Poison,' Berkshire Hathaway Continues Profiting Off Crypto - Benzinga

Though many of the top asset managers and investors are investing in, or at least open to crypto and Bitcoin, a few remain hesitant to adopt the asset. Most prominent among the anti-Bitcoin camp is legendary investor Warren Buffett. Buffett's strategy of investing in solid companies that continuously generate cash and value has been hugely successful. This has allowed his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to sustain itself through market peaks and troughs. Don't Miss:Buffett is notorious for his anti-Bitcoin stance, saying in a 2018 interview with Yahoo! Finance, "If you buy something like Bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more." At the 2022 Berkshire shareholders meeting, Buffett explained his stance on Bitcoin saying, "If you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn’t take it because what would I do with it? I’d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn’t going to do anything." Buffett is against Bitcoin and crypto in general. However, this stance does not entirely translate into his company's investments. Berkshire Hathaway is heavily invested in Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings Ltd. The investment was its strongest performer in 2023.Founded in 2013, Nu initially offered low-cost bank accounts and personal loans through a format that was much more digitized than its competitors. In 2022, the company launched Nucripto, which allows users to buy and sell more than 15 tokens. While its crypto business makes up a somewhat small portion of its revenue, it still operates in the crypto sphere, and its customer base continues to grow. It also launched its own cryptocurrency called Nucoin. Buffett had invested $500 million in Nu Holdings through a series G funding round before the company went public in December 2021. A few months later, Buffett increased his stake by another $250 million, resulting in a total investment of $750 million. The investment has paid off. Nu is up nearly 50% in 2024 alone and recently set all-time highs. This is also coming off a strong 2023, in which the stock was up nearly 100%. These huge gains could shift Buffett's focus toward crypto. Seeing the profits earned on a crypto-related business could cause the investor to rethink his strategy and stance on crypto. Bitcoin has outperformed most major indices so far in 2024. The token is up nearly 70% in 2024, well above the S&P 500, which is up just over 10% in 2024. With Bitcoin and crypto entering the spotlight again, lots of eyes are on Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett as they contemplate whether to continue investing in Bitcoin-adjacent businesses or even the tokens themselvesRead Next:

PCE Price Index Up 0.3% in Feb, in Line with Expectations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported a 0.3 percent increase in personal income for February, amounting to a $66.5 billion rise from the previous month. Disposable personal income (DPI) also saw a 0.2 percent increase, equating to a $50.3 billion uptick.



The primary drivers of the personal income growth were increases in compensation and personal current transfer receipts, which were partially offset by a decrease in personal income receipts on assets.



Personal Consumption Expenditures Increase 0.8% in February



Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) increased by 0.8 percent in February, to $145.5 billion, up from the previous month. The service sector accounted for a substantial portion of this growth, with spending increasing by $111.8 billion.



Financial services, insurance, transportation services, housing, and utilities were the primary contributors to this increase. Goods spending also saw a notable rise of $33.7 billion, primarily driven by increased spending on motor vehicles and parts.



Personal outlays, encompassing PCE, personal interest payments, and personal current transfer payments, grew by $149.9 billion in February. Despite this increase in spending, personal savings remained at $745.7 billion, with a personal saving rate of 3.6 percent





PCE Price Index Up 0.3% in February



The PCE price index, a measure of inflation, rose by 0.3 percent from the previous month, with goods prices increasing by 0.5 percent and services prices by 0.3 percent. The PCE price index still showed a 0.3 percent increase when excluding food and energy.



Real PCE, which adjusts for inflation, grew by 0.4 percent in February. This growth was primarily driven by a 0.6 percent increase in spending on services, with international travel, transportation services, and financial services and insurance being the main contributors.



Spending on goods saw a more modest 0.1 percent increase, largely due to increased spending on motor vehicles and parts. 







How do you think the Fed will see the latest PCE data? Let us know in the comments below.

Crypto Sensation WIF Flips PEPE to Become the Third-Biggest Meme Coin: Details


																TL;DR

WIF hits a new ATH, while other meme coins such as DOGE and SHIB are also well in the green.
Despite the impressive gains, investors are cautioned to be careful when dealing with assets of that type due to their infamous volatility.


The trending Solana-based meme coin – dogwifhat (WIF) – seems to have no limitations, charting a new all-time high price of $4 (per CoinGecko’s data). Its market capitalization touched a whooping level of $4 billion.
WIF Price, Source: CoinGecko
WIF’s market cap currently stands at approximately $3.7 billion, making it the 40th-biggest cryptocurrency and the third-largest in the meme coin realm. Pepe Coin (PEPE) dropped to the fourth position with a capitalization of around $3.3 billion. 
WIF’s latest resurgence coincides with a significant revival of the meme coin niche. The leading asset of that type – Dogecoin (DOGE) – exceeded the $0.20 mark, witnessing gains of 32% on a weekly scale. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also well in the green, albeit in a more modest fashion.




It is safe to say that WIF’s success is more than impressive considering the fact that it entered the market at the end of last year. Its price is up over 2,000% since the beginning of 2024 and the rally caught the eye of some prominent industry participants.
One example is Arthur Hayes – BitMEX’s co-founder – who posted a photo of himself wearing a hat (referring to the token’s name and logo). Here recently said “the hat stays on while I count to $10.”
Another factor possibly contributing to WIF’s price increase is the support from leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance, BitMEX, Coinbase, and Kraken are some of those that enabled trading services with the asset.
Dogwifhat’s upswing has been more than welcomed by savvy traders who hopped on the bandwagon in its early days. As CryptoPotato reported, one particular investor bought more than 2.5 million tokens at the end of 2023, spending just $310. Currently, the stash is worth over $9 million.
On the other hand, traders should be aware that dealing with meme coins could also lead to crucial losses due to the infamous volatility of the asset class. Those about to enter the ecosystem should check our video below to avoid some common mistakes:
