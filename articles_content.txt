                        OpenAI’s ChatGPT’s absence in China has created a unique opportunity for a new wave of artificial intelligence startups in China, each vying to fill the void and establish themselves as leaders in the generative AI space.Backed by major regional investors, these startups are developing advanced AI systems capable of producing various content, from images and text to music, posing a major challenge to OpenAI’s global supremacy.Chinese Startups Challenging the Reign of OpenAI
Four key startups have become leaders in China’s AI sector, each achieving unicorn status with valuations exceeding $1 billion. Zhipu AI, backed by giants like Alibaba Cloud and Tencent, is leading with a valuation of $2.5 billion. They focus on providing comprehensive AI solutions and have amassed a team of 800 employees.Moonshot AI, also valued at $2.5 billion, targets students and office workers with its text summarization technology. Their AI chatbot, Kimi, experienced explosive growth, with over 12 million visits in March alone.OpenAI Alternatives
MiniMax, based in Shanghai, takes a unique approach, employing anime-themed characters to engage the gaming market. Their interactive avatars, valued at $2.5 billion, can generate responses, jokes, and even flirt with users. Meanwhile, 01.ai, with a valuation of $1.2 billion, focuses on open-source models tailored for the Chinese market, such as the productivity-focused Wanzhi.“There is no winner of foundation models yet in the China market. These are some of the names leading the charge to claim that title,” Charlie Dai, Vice President and principal analyst at tech-focused consultancy Forrester, told the Financial Times.This diverse range of approaches demonstrates China’s AI startups’ adaptability as they compete with OpenAI.With approximately 262 AI-focused startups offering ChatGPT alternatives to the Chinese market, the race for AI dominance is heating up. As these Chinese startups continue to advance and grow, they can reshape the future of generative AI, challenging OpenAI’s position and offering new possibilities for the industry.

DOJ charges former Cred execs over $783M fraud and money laundering scheme - Crypto Briefing




The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced charges against three former executives of the now-bankrupt crypto lending and investing firm Cred, alleging their involvement in a scheme that led to customers losing crypto holdings currently valued at over $783 million.The accused individuals include Cred co-owner and former CEO Daniel Schatt, former CFO Joseph Podulka, and former CCO James Alexander. IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Mosley described the defendants’ alleged activities at Cred as a “predatory, deceptive scheme.”According to the indictments, the executives made numerous false statements starting no later than March 2020, claiming that Cred only engaged in collateralized and guaranteed lending, utilized hedged crypto investments, and had all-weather protection against volatility. Marketing materials also allegedly falsely advertised Cred as a licensed lender with comprehensive insurance.“The indictments levied demonstrate the investigative capabilities of IRS Criminal Investigation and our commitment to pursuing justice against financial criminals,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Mosley.Even after a 2020 flash crash, the executives allegedly portrayed Cred as solvent and promised that insurance would make customers whole. Despite Cred’s General Counsel admitting potential insolvency, the executives allegedly sought new customer funds instead of disclosing the firm’s true financial situation.The executives also allegedly failed to disclose that nearly all customer yields were generated by a single company making micro-loans to Chinese gamers.A federal grand jury charged each of the three individuals with varying counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering, with combined maximum sentences amounting to decades in prison and millions of dollars in fines.Schatt and Podulka made their first court appearance on May 2 and are scheduled to return on May 8, while Alexander’s initial appearance is pending. The case is proceeding in the Northern District of California.“This prosecution demonstrates our determination to keep our markets free of fraudsters and safe for investors,” said U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey.The DOJ’s announcement comes amid a series of recent cases targeting individuals in the cryptocurrency industry, including charges against Bitcoin proponent Roger Ver for alleged tax evasion and against the founders of the privacy-enabled crypto wallet Samourai Wallet.At the time of Cred’s bankruptcy filing on November 7, 2020, customers had suffered losses of cryptocurrency assets with a market value of $150 million, which has since risen to a potential maximum market value of over $783 million.

Memecoins Resurgence? POPCAT And MEW Surge 20%


                            As the crypto market settles in on this new phase of the crypto cycle, some memecoins have shown remarkable performance over the last couple of days.
Cat-theme tokens have significantly grown in popularity during this bull run, with some, like Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW), making it to the top 10 memecoins list. Other feline-inspired tokens like Popcat (POPCAT) and Wen (WEN) have had a stellar week after recent partnerships that caused the price to surge by 20% overnight.

Was The Memecoin Surge Fueled By Bitcoin?
The memecoins sector has been dominated by dogs, with tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) being the flagship memecoins for the last few years. During this bull cycle, dog-themed tokens like Bonk (BONK) and dogwifhat (WIF) have been the talk of the town, and some of the tokens with the strongest performance.
Since its launch in January 2023, Bonk has surged around 4291%, while WIF has soared about 1512% since December 2023. Moreover, the sector has shown stellar performances with cryptocurrencies like PEPE and Book of Meme (BOME).
Bitcoin (BTC) has dominated this cycle alongside memecoins, as highlighted by top crypto analysts like Alex Krüger and Altcoin Sherpa. However, their performance has been strongly co-related to BTC’s in most cases.


The rest of the market has gone down with Bitcoin whenever the flagship cryptocurrency faces a strong retrace. Consequentially, when BTC has recovered, most sectors, including memecoins, have regained their levels. It’s worth noting that some tokens like Popcat have continued to perform well, even during the recent rally slowdowns.
On Thursday, Bitcoin successfully tested the $59,000 resistance level after spending most of May’s first days hovering between $57,000-$58,000. In the last hours of the day, the largest cryptocurrency seemingly turned the resistance level into a support zone, pumping the price of several memecoins.
As a result, the memecoin market was 9.46% up on Thursday night. Similarly, cat-themed tokens were up by 22.09% with a market capitalization of $1.581 billion, per CoinMarketCap data.
Cat-Themed Memecoins Take The Lead With Popcat
Despite dominating the memecoins market, canine-inspired tokens have lost some ground against the increasing popularity of feline-inspired ones. While the cats’ tokens had increased over 20% in the previous 24 hours, the dogs’ sector only surged 3.7% in the same timeframe.
Over the last few days, cat-themed memecoins have been among the top gainers in the crypto market. For instance, Popcat has remarkably maintained its upward trajectory during the recent retrace and also joined the top 10 memecoins list.
Popcat, which seems to be building a loyal community, has continuously shown double-digit gain percentages this week. As reported by SolanaFloor, the token momentarily flippled BOME with its $570.3 million market capitalization.
Moreover, as Bitcoin reclaimed the $59,000 level, the cat-themed token saw a 31% price increase in the daily timeframe. This made Popcat the largest gainer among the top ten memecoins.
According to memecoin analyst Murad, Popcat will surge to $5-10 in the short-term as “the Crowned Top Cat.” As the token reached its all-time high (ATH) of $0.618 on Thursday, the trader highlighted several targets, including a long-term $20 scenario.

Murad's prediction for POPCAT. Source: X
Murad expects the token “to go to $1 quickly” next time it closes above $0.63. Per the analysts, “It’s Cat Season baby and $POPCAT is in control.”
MEW Remains A Popular Cat
A month ago, MEW joined the dogs’ pack after becoming the eighth largest memecoin by market capitalization. Since then, the lonely cat’s performance has struggled, with a 51.8% and 28.4% price decrease in the monthly and weekly timeframes.
Despite the recent drop in performance, the token has remained one of the hottest topics among altcoins. On Monday, crypto exchange Bidget crowned MEW as the most searched altcoin on the exchange, beating PEPE and SOL on the “#BidgetTrendingSpot.”
At the time of writing, the token has shown a remarkable 12% price recovery in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $0.00424.

Cardano's latest buy signal - Why it could mean a relief rally for ADA's price - AMBCrypto



ADA could potentially see a relief rally over the next 1-4 days
ADA whales can be seen buying the dip en masse

Cardano [ADA], at the time of writing, showed signs of recovery following a 2% hike over a 24-hour trading period, according to CoinMarketCap. This, after the crypto bled heavily in April, recording losses of more than 23% on the charts.
According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, the aforementioned market slump narrowed the percentage of ADA’s total supply in profit from 73% towards the beginning of the month to 51% by the time it ended.
Source: Santiment
Rebound incoming?
However, the corrective phase might end soon, going by the predictions of popular on-chain analyst Ali Martinez. On ADA’s daily chart, Martinez spotted a buy signal on the TD Sequential indicator, suggesting a potential relief rally for the next 1-4 days.
To make better sense of the forecast, AMBCrypto examined other key technical indicators of ADA.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) rose steadily in the last 2-3 days, a sign that selling pressure has been easing. That being said, the broader sentiment was still bearish and the RSI needed to rise above 40 to justify the prospect of a sustained rally. A move above neutral-50 would strengthen bullish sentiments.
The buying pressure was also apparent in the rise of On Balance Volume since the beginning of May. At press time, it mirrored ADA’s price action on the charts, raising hopes of a sustained rally.

Assessing whales’ response
Cardano’s downturn in price caught the attention of whale investors. On 30 April, transactions worth more than $100k spiked to their highest levels since November 2023.
On analysis of different whale cohorts, intriguing observations came to light. Smaller whales, with ADA holdings ranging from 1,000 to 1 million, decreased in number, suggesting that they have been selling off.
Larger whales, on the other hand, were accumulating, as addresses holding between 1 million to 100 million coins increased in number. Hence, it was evident that significant capital was flowing from smaller whales to bigger whales.

Former Cred execs face wire fraud and money laundering charges

Three former executives of bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Cred have been charged over allegedly engaging in wire fraud and money laundering prior to the firm declaring bankruptcy in November 2020.“This prosecution demonstrates our determination to keep our markets free of fraudsters and safe for investors,” the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California wrote in a May 3 statement.Former CEO Daniel Schatt and CFO Joseph Podulka face 13 charges of wire fraud and money laundering, while CCO James Alexander is charged with four counts.“It highlights a predatory, deceptive scheme defrauding potential victims of hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency at market value,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Mosley.The three executives maximum sentence per count, if convicted. Source: United States Attorney's Office for Northern District of CaliforniaWhen Cred declared bankruptcy in November 2020, Cointelegraph reported that numerous users turned to social media to voice their concerns and ask if “their funds are safe.”Prosecutors allege that the three executives were misleading customers about Cred’s lending and investment practices. Cred allegedly claimed to only engage in “collateralized or guaranteed lending,” that Cred’s cryptocurrency investments were “hedged,” and that Cred maintained an “all weather approach” to investment to protect against volatility.However, the prosecutors claimed that Cred engaged in lending that “was neither collateralized nor guaranteed.”Related: Bankrupt crypto lender Genesis seeks approval to sell $1.6B of trust assetsSchatt and Podulka appeared in court for the first time on May 2 and must return to enter a plea on May 8.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank Holding $7,427,000,000,000 Off-Balance Sheet in Potentially Dangerous Cocktail of Unknown Assets: Report - The Daily Hodl


								JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank are keeping trillions of dollars in unknown and potentially risky assets off of their balance sheets, according to new data from the US government.
The new numbers – compiled by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and first reported on by Wall Street on Parade – show JPMorgan Chase holds $3.227 trillion off-balance sheet, Bank of America holds $1.6 trillion off-balance sheet and Citibank holds $2.6 trillion off-balance sheet.










The Federal Reserve defines off-balance sheet activities as “quite diverse in nature” and says they may include such instruments as firm loan commitments, standby letters of credit, foreign exchange, financial futures, forward contracts, options, interest rate swap contracts and other derivative products.
Off-balance sheet accounting has been a common practice in the banking industry for years and as Wall Street on Parade notes, it played a major role in the 2008 financial crisis.
“More than other banks, Citigroup held assets off of its balance sheet, in part to hold down capital requirements… if those had been included, leverage in 2007 would have been 48:1, or about 53% higher…
Citigroup, of course, blew itself up in 2008 and received the largest bailouts in global banking history. By March of 2009, its stock was trading at 99 cents.”
In July of last year, the Federal Reserve announced a proposal that would impose higher capital requirements on banks to ensure their balance sheets are more resilient in economic downturns.
CEOs at JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon and State Street argued against the proposed changes in a Senate Banking Oversight Committee hearing in December.
In a prepared statement, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the changes would damage the banking industry and the economy at large.
“Despite zero evidence that large U.S. banks are undercapitalized today, the proposed Basel III Endgame rule, if enacted, would unjustifiably and unnecessarily increase capital requirements by 20-25% for the largest banks. 
Banks would be limited in their ability to deploy capital in the times we’re most needed, and the rule will have a harmful ripple effect on the economy, markets, businesses of all sizes and American households.”

How L2s like Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum are shaping up for May - AMBCrypto



Blast recorded explosive month-on-month growth in terms of new addresses
OP’s daily active addresses rose in May, while others saw their numbers fall

Layer 2s have made quite a buzz over the last few months because of their high network activity. As the first month of Q2 came to an end, Coin98 Analytics shared a monthly report highlighting the states of multiple top L2s, including Optimism [OP], Arbitrum [ARB], zkSync Era, and Base. 
L2s’ state in April 
Coin98 Analytics’ report revealed that OP dominated others in terms of total addresses, as its value stood at 138 million. Base and ARB trailed behind, with values of 71.9 million and 22.3 million, respectively. 
Moreover, OP also hit an all-time high on certain days this month, with over 450k new addresses per day. In April, Optimism recorded the highest number of new addresses created. Though OP’s numbers were the highest, Base and ARB also saw significant growth in April. 
Source: X
While the aforementioned L2s’ performance was commendable, Blast took the limelight because of its explosive growth. Coin98 found that Blast’s number of addresses grew by a whopping 42% in April, while OP, Base, and ARB’s growth rates were 2%, 4%, and 12%, respectively. 
The report additionally looked at L2s’ transactions in April. opBNB nabbed the first spot with over 872 million transactions. ARB, zkSync, and OP followed behind as their total transactions stood at 472 million, 346 million, and 257 million, respectively. 
Interestingly, Blast noted the highest growth rate in terms of transactions as well, with a hike of 112% month-on-month. 
Also, the top 4 Layer 2 protocols with the largest TVLs have seen significant shifts in money flows, with ARB sitting on top. Base recorded a 24% MoM hike with figures of over $284 million. On the contrary, Arbitrum registered a decline of over $371 million in TVL.
Source: X
How is May looking?
Since the month of April was pretty active for L2s, AMBCrypto then checked the latest data to find out how these aforementioned L2s have done so far in May. However, our analysis of Artemis’ data revealed that ARB, Base, and zkSync’s daily active addresses have started to fall.
Optimism acted differently as its active addresses rose. While Base and zkSync’s daily transactions declined, Base and OP’s numbers moved up slightly.
Source: Artemis

Realistic or not, here’s ARB market cap in BTC’s terms   

As far as captured value is concerned, Base had the highest revenue when May began, followed by OP. The declining trend was also true in this regard, as Base and zkSync’s graphs started to decline. 
On the other hand, ARB and OP’s revenue gained upward momentum in May. 
In light of these metrics, it seems likely that OP and ARB might see promising growth in May while Base and zkSync face some trouble.

MakerDAO announces launch of two new tokens | Cryptopolitan

MakerDAO has announced that it will launch two new tokens. The two tokens were announced in March and named NewStable and NewGovToken. These two tokens are intended for the broader participation of users in governance activities.  MakerDAO and announcement of new tokensMakerDAO is a global financial system that claims to have brought the first unbiased currency DAI. The mentioned currency is one of the leading stablecoins that is overcollateralized. Furthermore, the mentioned ecosystem is known for its decentralized governance adding to its value. Though there was a great controversy regarding algorithmic stablecoins MakerDAO’s DAI was able to steer clear.MakerDAO stablecoin is stabilized through cryptocurrencies as well as stablecoins like USDC. This protocol was launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain and its stablecoin is pegged to the US dollar. The protocol works by allowing loans in DAI while they have to use other cryptocurrencies as collateral.If a user wants to get a $100,000 DAI, they would have to collateralize $170,000 worth of ETH, thus providing it protection against potential problems. According to available information, DAI has been backed by the worth of about $10.6 billion assets in crypto while assets in the real world amount to $100 million.   In a big leap, MakerDAO has announced that it will launch two new tokens to further improve its governance model. The two tokens have been named NewStable and NewGOV. These two will be introduced to the ecosystem after the upcoming brand reveal. NewStable and NewGOVNewStable is an upgraded version of Dai which has been enhanced for broader adoption and improved stability. According to the official statement on X, the official name of NewStable will be unveiled in the upcoming brand reveal. The NewGOV token has been designed to improve the governance approach in the ecosystem. It has been designed in order to ensure that more users participate in the governance and the decision-making becomes robust. The process of the conversion of the tokens is simple where the users can upgrade to NewStable from Dai while they have an option to revert. In the case of NewGOV, 1 MKR can be converted to 24,000 NGT. The redenomination has been announced in order to improve the participation of users in governance. Furthermore, the statement has clarified that the two tokens will not replace DAI and MKR, rather they represent an expansion. The users will have the option to transition to the newly announced tokens.As per available information, NST holders can engage in the farming of NGT. 600 million NGT will be available on an annual basis to the participating NST holders. Farming won’t be available to US users while those accessing the services on VPN won’t be able to farm. According to the official sources, the strategic supply of NewGOV tokens has been redenominated in comparison to MKR.  What’s next?Those who participate in the farming or conversion to the new tokens will be able to utilize a range of benefits. These include access to new features and opportunities. Those who transition to the latest tokens will be able to gain access to the latest functions in the ecosystem. There is flexibility and choice as the new tokens are introduced, thus the users will be able to choose between the available options. These tokens are a gateway to future products and services and will provide entry to the evolving ecosystem. Interested users can stay connected to the Maker Ecosystem to get new updates. ConclusionMakerDAO has announced the launch of two new tokens, which have been codenamed NewStable and NewGOV. The two tokens will be officially revealed in the upcoming brand reveal event. The two tokens are aimed at bringing ease and facilitation to the users.

BTC-e operator has pleaded guilty to money laundering | Cryptopolitan

The US Department of Justice has continued to hunt those who have been involved in the criminal use of crypto. In a recent development, it announced that it had held a Russian national for his involvement with BTC-e. The mentioned person had been found involved in the use of crypto exchange for money laundering and has pleaded guilty. BTC-e and its operationsBTC-e was a cryptocurrency trading platform that had been in operation from 2011 to 2017. Its servers were based in the US while it served Russian nationals. The US government found out about the servers and other details in 2017 and seized its funds as well as the website. It was founded by Alexander Vinnik and Aleksandr Bilyuchenko.  The website held a considerable amount of Bitcoin exchange volume, amounting to about 3%. Later it was taken over by someone else and it was used for the financing of war in Donbass. The mentioned website was charged with money laundering in 2017 and the significant event was alleged involvement in the money laundering of the funds of Mt. Gox. In order to repay its customers, BTC-e created WEX tokens which were later presented as proof at court. These tokens presented a value of $1 and were issued to customer accounts to present the value of customers’ investments.Money laundering and BTC-e involvementOne of the leading persons behind the BTC-e was Alexander Vinnik who operated the mentioned cryptocurrency exchange. As the allegations of money laundering and other activities surrounding the mentioned website grew, Vinnik was arrested. Vinnik had worked as an operator of BTC-e from 2011 to 2017 and had processed a considerably big chunk of transactions. The number of processed transactions was about 1 million while the amount processed using these transactions in crypto amounted to $9 billion. The mentioned person was arrested in Greece in 2017 and it took a long process to extradite him to the US. Vinnik had initially denied that he was an operator at BTC-e, rather he claimed to have been only an employee. BTC-e hadn’t been registered as a money business service in the US. In addition to that, it hadn’t any KYC policy nor had it any rules to collect customer data to prevent money laundering. According to the press release from the US DoJ, the mentioned website received funds from different criminal activities. These activities included hacks, ransomware attacks, and other scams. Though France, Russia, and the US tried to ensure that Vinnik was extradited to their respective states, the US was able to make it. The US DoJ has said that this case shows their commitment to prevention and combating crypto crime. Furthermore, the guilty plea shows that DoJ has used all available resources and tools to fight money laundering. Transactions and losses caused by BTC-eAs said above, BTC-e processed transactions worth more than $9 billion from 2011 to 2017, which has caused huge losses. The number of transactions shows the huge number of crime perpetrators who have been involved in money laundering.  According to the press statement, Vinik had direct involvement in losses of more than $121 million. Alexander Vinnik had been proven guilty of willfully violating US AML laws while a $12 million civil penalty was pending. The affected might get restitution of their funds with the resolution of this case.  ConclusionUS DoJ has said in a statement that Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national, has pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering. The mentioned person had been involved in money laundering through the virtual cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e. The mentioned exchange was seized in 2017 by US authorities.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Whale Alert: Massive 1.75 Trillion Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Purchase on Robinhood Draws Speculation | Cryptoglobe


                                
A major anonymous Shiba Inu whale wallet executed a series of large transactions on the popular Robinhood exchange, accumulating a staggering 1.75 trillion $SHIB tokens, valued at roughly $40 million.



The whale’s accumulation was first spotted by whale monitoring service Whale Alert, which pointed on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to two massive SHIB transactions off of Robinhood’s wallets to unknown wallets. Both transactions were of 875 billion SHIB, worth nearly $20 million.







This whale activity coincides with a potential bullish signal for SHIB. According to a recent post by Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency trader, Shiba Inu’s daily chart appears to be forming a “bull flag,” a technical indicator suggesting an imminent price surge. 



Anticipating this breakout, Martinez revealed plans to place buy orders around the $0.000018343 mark, aiming to capitalize on a potential rise in SHIB’s price.







As CryptoGlobe reported, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has according to blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant seen its reserves on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges drop to their lowest level since February 2022.



CryptoQuant’s data also shows a predominantly negative SHIB exchange netflow over the past week, showing a large movement of tokens from centralized exchanges to self-custody wallets that suggests a decrease in immediate selling pressure, which is generally considered a bullish signal.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Beyond these exchange-related metrics, other developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem also hint at a potential price rise, with a growing SHIB burning rate helping remove tokens from circulation and reduce circulating supply.



SHIB’s cryptocurrency community has helped it maintain a strong social activity, with social intelligence firm Lunar Crush noting earlier this month SHIB is “signaling bullish” as it has been seeing increasing social activity paired with accelerating market volume and rising price action.



As CryptoGlobe reported, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency could, according to an analyst, surge in the near future based on technical analysis, as the analyst suggested its chart shows a symmetrical triangle pattern, often interpreted by traders as a bullish signal.



A symmetrical triangle pattern is formed by drawing trendlines, one falling and another one rising, along a converging price range. To confirm a valid break and not a false one, traders should look for a surge in volume and at least two consecutive closes beyond the trendline, according to Investopedia.



Symmetrical triangles usually indicate that the price will continue in the same direction as before the triangle formed. Therefore, traders would expect the price to break upward if a symmetrical triangle follows an uptrend.

The $1 Trillion Power Couple Reshaping Finance - The Daily Hodl


								
 
The DeFi (decentralized finance) market has staged an impressive comeback over the past 12 months – with the TVL (total value locked) across all protocols doubling to $93 billion.
Meanwhile, excitement surrounding the capabilities of generative AI continues to build.
A Bloomberg report suggests this industry could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032 and “fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates.”
DeFi and AI (artificial intelligence) are set to go from strength to strength in their respective fields over the coming decade.
But there’s been little discussion about the seismic impact these technologies can have if applied together – delivering exponential growth and revolutionizing finance on a global scale.
In the seven years since DeFi protocols came into existence, a blossoming ecosystem of financial applications and services have been built on top of blockchain networks, offering a modern, real-time parallel to the outdated and slow infrastructure relied upon by traditional institutions.
Smart contracts now offer self-executing agreements that eliminate the need for intermediaries and open up access to lending, borrowing, trading and saving – all with much more competitive interest rates.
When you peel away the complicated jargon and talk of liquidity pools and yield farming, the opportunities that DeFi presents are nothing short of mind-blowing.
In a world where access to banking services is governed by strict eligibility criteria that billions of people are unable to meet, these protocols can secure financial inclusion for unbanked and underbanked populations around the world.
Now, anyone can manage their money through a smartphone.
Funds can be sent and received instantly and cheaply without depending on gatekeepers who charge punishing fees, while those shut out of receiving a credit score can now build a reputation on the blockchain.
By bringing DeFi and AI together, a multi-trillion-dollar power couple begins to form with truly transformative use cases.
But what does this look like in practice – and what are the opportunities and challenges on the horizon as we redefine the future?










DeFi done right
AI’s ability to digest vast datasets in the blink of an eye, make intelligent predictions and connect the dots between trends is going to supercharge the world of DeFi.
We’re barely scratching the surface when it comes to the potential applications.
Algorithms powered by AI can analyze market trends, bringing together news coverage, social media posts, historical data and brand-new figures in the time it takes a human to get a cup of coffee.
Applied correctly, this allows traders to stay ahead of the curve, enables businesses to detect changing behaviors and helps forward-thinking entrepreneurs spot compelling opportunities for new goods and services.
What’s more, all of these in-depth insights can be delivered with full automation, saving time and boosting productivity.
Together, AI and DeFi will also reinvent the way we interact with money, personalizing financial services like never before.
Imagine an algorithm that makes bespoke recommendations on the products you’ll love based on past purchases or uncovers discounts for car rentals and accommodation when you’re booking flights.
While the barriers to entry surrounding investments and financial planning have started to come down in recent years, many consumers still lack the means and the know-how to prepare for a brighter future.
In the coming years, all of that will change, with AI-enriched platforms enabling investors to save regularly, invest wisely and budget meticulously.
And instead of adopting a ‘one size fits all’ approach, each user would be able to benefit from specific plans based on their income and outgoings – with investment portfolios and trading strategies tailored to an individual’s risk tolerance and long-term goals.
Broadening access to fintech can be done safely as AI and DeFi converge.
Both technologies will also prove invaluable in the fight against identity fraud, which cost Americans a staggering $23 billion last year.
Advanced analytics, fueled by machine learning, have the power to detect complex patterns of fraud in multiple locations instantaneously – while the cryptographic security offered by blockchain platforms helps remove some of the attack vectors commonly exploited by malicious actors.
This, when coupled with faster and more accurate KYC (know your customer) checks, can prevent funds from being stolen in the first place, and make DeFi platforms an even safer environment for storing assets.
A win-win situation for consumers and lenders also starts to emerge, thanks to a revolution in credit underwriting.
Applications can be scrutinized using alternative data points – enabling self-employed individuals to access capital rather than suffer arbitrary rejections – with users building a reputation score on immutable blockchains.
This leads to more informed lending decisions for DeFi platforms and the development of robust risk management strategies.
Leveraging machine learning, AI can automate the creation and execution of smart contracts, streamlining operations and eliminating the potential for human error.
We’re already starting to see innovative new projects take advantage of these capabilities like Zircuit, a layer-two blockchain with AI-enabled security, and Ritual, the network for open AI infrastructure.
Innovating responsibly
There’s so much to be excited about – and a lot to be working on. But against this backdrop of innovation, careful consideration must be paid to the potential pitfalls of a close integration between AI and DeFi.
Data quality, privacy and security are three crucial themes that innovators need to focus on as they build new products.
Robust safeguards need to be in place to shield protocols against adversarial attacks.
The complexities of regulatory compliance are another hurdle to overcome, with jurisdictions worldwide set to pay closer attention to both technologies in the years ahead.
There are also ethical implications to reflect on. The purveyors of AI tools need to ensure they mitigate the risk of algorithmic bias that leads to unjust outcomes.
State-of-the-art cybersecurity is required to ensure that the personal data processed by up-and-coming platforms isn’t misused for malicious purposes.
And as AI models are developed, transparency is needed to ensure potential errors can be remedied – and that the public has confidence in the systems they’re interacting with.
Let’s not forget that new technology also represents a steep learning curve for consumers, who can be resistant to change.
DeFi and AI have the potential to redefine finance as we know it.
By democratizing access, promoting inclusion and fostering a more transparent and secure ecosystem, this technological marriage could usher in a new era of empowerment for all.
But to truly unlock their potential, we must address future challenges head-on and ensure these tools are responsibly implemented.
The future of finance rests on our ability to harness the power of AI and DeFi for good.

DOGE, SHIB, PEPE Among Top Performers Daily, BTC Rises to $63K (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin’s recovery tour continues as the cryptocurrency jumped from under $59,000 yesterday to a multi-day peak of over $63,000 earlier today.
Most altcoins have followed suit with impressive gains once again, including the ever-volatile meme coin sector.
BTC Goes After $63K
Bitcoin had a highly adverse trading week as its price dumped hard on a few occasions. It all started positively on Monday morning when BTC pumped to almost $65,000, but the bears took control of the market immediately and pushed it south to $62,000.
The declines were far from over as the asset further slumped to and below $60,000. The correction culminated in a two-month low of $56,500 charted on Wednesday, ahead of the latest US FOMC meeting.
Once that was completed and the Fed said it will not raise the interest rates soon, BTC reacted with a $2,000 pump and dump and returned to its starting position. It started to recover more ground in the following hours and neared $60,000 yesterday, as reported.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


It was stopped there at first, but managed to break through that psychological resistance later that day. The bulls kept the pressure on and pushed BTC to a multi-day peak of $63,500. Despite losing some ground since then, bitcoin currently sits at around $63,000.
Its 6% daily increase means that its market cap has risen to $1.240 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands at 50.5%.

DOGE, SHIB, PEPE on the Rise
The top gainers from the largest altcoins come from the volatile meme coin sector. Dogecoin, the first and largest of the cohort, is up by over 12% and now trades at $0.15. PEPE has followed suit with an 11.7% jump, while SHIB has gained 8% and is above $0.000025. The other highly impressive gainer is STX, which has soared by 14% to $2.4.
Ethereum and Binance Coin have increased by similar percentages of around 3.5%. Consequently, ETH has soared past $3,100, while BNB is at $585.
The rest of the larger-cap alts are also in the green, including TON, BC, AVAX, NEAR, and HBAR. The total crypto market cap has recovered more than $200 billion since the low of Wednesday and is up to $2.460 trillion on CG.

Grayscale’s GBTC stops bleeding: First inflow since launch

Grayscale Investments has achieved its first day of net positive inflows for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). This comes after nearly four months of continuous outflows since its conversion to a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January.On May 3, Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $63 million in inflows after recording approximately $17.5 billion of outflows since the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs launched on Jan. 11, according to Farside preliminary data.Among the other funds reported so far, Franklin Templeton's Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) saw its highest ever inflow with $60.9 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the day's inflows with $102.6 million, followed by Bitwise Bitcoin Fund (BITB) with $33.5 million and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) with $33.2 million.Grayscale's GBTC recorded its first day of inflows on May 3. Source: Farside The crypto community has been speculating how the turn in events might impact Bitcoin’s (BTC) price. Pseudonymous crypto investor DivXman told his followers that the GBTC was the “primary source” of sell pressure across all spot Bitcoin ETFs, but “the tides” could be turning.“That effectively means a significant decrease in sell pressure and additional increase in demand while ETFs collectively are buying more BTC than miners can create,” he explained to his 20,800 X followers in a May 3 post.Crypto trader Jelle predicted to his 80,300 X followers on the same day that Bitcoin's new all-time high is on the horizon.“60 million dollars worth of inflows for Grayscale's ETF. The halving chop will come to an end, and 6-figure Bitcoin will follow shortly after.”Related: Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF ‘halves’ before BTC halvingMeanwhile, crypto trader Jordan Lindsey responded to the news by pointing to Bitcoin’s price saying it is “obviously responding both to outflows and inflows.”Bitcoin’s price has increased 4.91% over the past 24 hours to $62,840 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.Bitcoin has recovered after trading below a key support level at $58,926. Source: CoinMarketCapSeveral factors contributed to Grayscale’s ongoing outflows since the launch of the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. One reason is GBTC's high fees compared to other available ETFs. GBTC's fee is set at 1.5%, whereas the fees for other ETFs are all below 1%.The cheapest is currently Franklin Templeton with a 0.19% fee. Another main driver is bankrupt crypto firms FTX and Genesis selling off large amounts of GBTC shares in an effort to repay creditors.On April 6, Cointelegraph reported that Genesis liquidated approximately 36 million GBTC shares for the amount of $2.1 billion to purchase 32,041 Bitcoin. Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?

Explaining Toncoin's [TON] 2x hike - Telegram, USDT, and Pantera - AMBCrypto



TON’s non-zero wallets more than doubled in six months
Growing user activity helped TON defy the broader market downturn in April

Telegram-linked Toncoin [TON] recorded the fastest network growth among the market’s leading cryptocurrencies in the last six months, according to a recent analysis.
TON’s user base doubles
As per Santiment’s report, non-zero wallets on the network more than doubled in the aforementioned time period to 16.8k. In comparison, blue-chip cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] noted a growth of ‘just’ 10% and 11%, respectively.
Here, it’s worth remembering that Bitcoin and Ethereum are much bigger networks and have a higher base vis à vis TON, a shorthand for The Open Network. Regardless, the parabolic growth in user base is a sign that the project has been gaining traction.
Source: Santiment
TON’s on-chain activity exploded last month, with daily active addresses hitting an all-time high (ATH) of 981 on 11 April. On average, around 500 addresses started interacting daily with a network that had not seen the count exceed 100 until as late as mid-March.
The number of new addresses entering the network also picked up pace, peaking at 613 on 11 April.
Source: Santiment
Telegram-powered growth
The sudden jump in usage stemmed from its increasing proximity to social messaging giant Telegram, which has made significant efforts to integrate the native token into its ecosystem.
The original developer of TON, Telegram introduced an ad revenue-sharing system wherein owners of public channels with at least 1,000 subscribers would get payouts in TON. Given Telegram’s monthly user base of 800 million, this is a significant market for TON to tap into.
TON also enabled minting of USDT, world’s largest stablecoin, on its network, allowing Telegram users to send it to each other’s wallets.
TON’s price shoots up in response
These integrations were reflected in TON’s price as it defied the broader downturn in April to log gains of 3.75%, according to CoinMarketCap.

Read Toncoin’s [TON] Price Prediction 2024-25

In the last 24 hours alone, TON was up by more than 12% to trade at $5.39. The latest surge was spurred by investments by Pantera Capital, one of the biggest digital assets-focused venture capital firms in the world. The company is betting big on TON’s utility on the Telegram app and its potential to go mainstream.

‘Inevitable’ That Bitcoin Surges Past $100,000 This Year, Says Quant Analyst PlanB - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								Closely followed quant analyst PlanB believes that Bitcoin (BTC) can reach six figures before the end of 2024.
In a new strategy session, the on-chain analyst tells his 157,000 YouTube subscribers that based on prior history, Bitcoin’s price is likely to double the current value to restore BTC miners’ revenue losses due to the April halving.










“What’s next for 2024? 
It is inevitable that we reach $100,000, in my opinion, because miner revenue has to recover. Mining revenue, because of the halving, did halve. All the miners, the entire industry, has seen its revenue drop by 50% and it has to recover. 
Usually, the last three halvings, it did recover within four to eight months. So that’s well within this year, 2024. And the only way for mining revenue to recover is the price doubles. So estimating from current price of $60,000, we should be well above $100,000 this year.” 
PlanB also says his stock-to-flow model, which compares the amount of a commodity in circulation divided by the amount produced every year, suggests that BTC will hit a price target of $500,000 within the next four years.
“I updated the [stock-to-flow] model, parameters did not change much. The 2024-2028 target is still around $500,000 on average.
Also note that the error always goes down after the halving. So there is a halving, the model value goes up. And of course, it takes some time, the Bitcoin price has a lag to catch up with the model value. Every halving it’s the same. It will also be true this halving in my opinion. 
So, we see the error already going down. It will go down again because the price will not be $500,000, of course, in May. It will slowly over the months go into that model price… 
2025, I think the top will be then. Because historically, the top of the bull market has been after the halving, about one and a half years after the halving. So that brings us in 2025. And the big question, of course, is will the price follow diminishing returns, and a price around $200,000 for the top will be in line with diminishing returns; or will price, indeed, follow the stock-to-flow model again and will there be exponential returns again? 
You know my answer. I think stock-to-flow is still valid. I think we will have exponential returns at least until 50% adoption and we’re now at somewhere between 1% and 10%. So far away from that 50% adoption. I think exponential returns are what we’re going to see.”

Ethereum NFTs on Blast - Should ETH holders worry now? - AMBCrypto



Blast overtook Ethereum in terms of NFT volume
While ETH’s price fell, network growth and velocity grew significantly on the charts

Ethereum [ETH] has largely been dominant in most sectors across the crypto-space. On a certain front, however, it would seem that the tides have shifted in favor of the Blast network.
NFTs on full Blast
Recent data suggests that over the last 24 hours, Blast NFT collections like PAC REKT, Blastopians, and Plutocrats have collectively generated more volume than the entire Ethereum NFT market across all exchanges.
Source: X
Now, even though Blast outperformed Ethereum in terms of NFT volume, a significant portion of this volume can be attributed to wash trading. For context, Wash trading in NFTs inflates trading volume by buying and selling between controlled wallets, creating fake popularity, and misleading investors. It undermines the NFT market by distorting prices and reducing real liquidity.
Even though a large part of Blast’s NFT volume can be due to wash trading, the declining interest in Ethereum NFTs does raise concerns about the state of the network. In fact, AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the number of NFTs being traded has fallen significantly.
Source: Santiment
Taking a deeper look
NFT collections on other networks such as Bitcoin and Mythos managed to outperform Ethereum NFTs. According to CryptoSlam’s data, popular Ethereum NFT collections such as BAYC and Crypto Punks were not able to get into the top 5 most sold NFTs over the last month. The number of Crypto Punk buyers fell by an alarming 20%, whereas the number of BAYC buyers fell by 2.78%.
If this trend continues, Ethereum may lose its top spot in the NFT sector soon.
Source: Crypto Slam
ETH holders bleed
As far as ETH’s price is concerned, at press time, it had climbed back above $3,000 on the back of Bitcoin’s recovery. Additionally, the network growth for ETH continued to rise as well.
Rising network growth is a sign that new addresses have been showing interest in ETH. Velocity climbed too, implying a surge in transaction activity on the Ethereum network.
Rising interest from new addresses and growing velocity could help ETH see green and push the altcoin to the levels it was trading at prior to the latest market correction.
Source: Santiment
However, the size of the addresses showing interest in ETH will also play a key role in Ethereum’s future price movement.
For instance, addresses holding 100-10,000 ETH were declining at press time, according to Santiment’s data. Substantial purchases made by large addresses can play a huge role in ETH’s price trajectory in the future.

Bitcoin Spot ETF: SEC Delays Decision On 7RCC’s Eco-Friendly Fund | Bitcoinist.com


								The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended its review period on the launch of crypto asset management company 7RCC’s Bitcoin spot ETF (exchange-traded fund). 
SEC Extends Deadline For 7RCC’s Bitcoin Spot ETF
In a notice published on Thursday, May 2nd, the SEC said it will now decide to approve or disapprove the 7RCC Bitcoin spot and Carbon Credit Futures ETF by June 24, 2024. This represents an almost two-month (45 days) extension from the initial deadline, which was set for May 10.
The financial regulator said in the filing:
The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change. 

The application submitted to the SEC in December 2023 shows that 7RCC’s fund is designed to provide direct exposure to Bitcoin alongside carbon credits. The firm’s filing revealed that the ETF will track the changes in the premier cryptocurrency’s price and carbon credit futures based on the Vinter Bitcoin Carbon Credits Index.
The ETF intends to invest 80% of its assets in Bitcoin and 20% in financial instruments, such as swaps, that provide exposure to carbon credit futures contracts tied to emissions allowances. Based on 7RCC’s application, the carbon credits are related to the European Union Emissions Trading System, the California Carbon Allowance, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
Crypto exchange Gemini has been named as the custodian of the Bitcoin Spot ETF. If approved, this fund will offer a new dimension to the ETF market, especially after the launch of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January.
SEC To Deny Ether Spot ETFs: Michael Saylor
Another exchange-traded product awaiting the greenlight of the SEC is the Ether spot ETF. Unfortunately, conversations around the potential approval of the investment product have not been optimistic in the past few weeks.
MicroStrategy Executive Chairman and Co-founder Michael Saylor is the latest personality to dampen any hopes of seeing the ETH spot ETF launch in the United States. Speaking at MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin For Corporations conference, the Bitcoin advocate speculated that the SEC would label Ether as a security.

Saylor mentioned that the financial regulator could also designate other tokens, including BNB, SOL, XRP, and ADA as unregistered crypto asset securities. The MicroStrategy CEO said:
None of [these tokens] will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, and none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets.
Michael Saylor is a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, as shown by his firm’s consistent BTC acquisition. As Bitcoinist reported on April 30, MicroStrategy holds 214,400 BTC – worth roughly $13.5 billion as of this writing.

New Solana Memecoin Homo Pepe to Rally 8,000% and Take On Shiba Inu and Bonk



                    

Homo Pepe (HOMPEPE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK).



Homo Pepe (HOMPEPE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK).




Early investors in SHIB and BONK made astronomical returns, and Homo Pepe presents a similar opportunity.



Homo Pepe has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Homo Pepe could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Homo Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Homo Pepe on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – HmnxTLpi2QYp9LCB1p8yFgR3X5xqVmE4eAnWU4xMYGe1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, BONK and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMPEPE.

Io.Net: the DePin project announces a crypto airdrop campaign

If you are a former Ethereum miner and have a graphics card, currently the crypto airdrop of the Io.Net Depin project will be right for you.
Participating is free as well as very simple: all you have to do is create your own working node, and connect it to the Io.Net network to provide computing power in exchange for future rewards.
From May 1st, the “Season 2” of the incentive campaign for this project has been launched: we have until May 31st to obtain the highest possible token allocation.
All the details below.

What is and how does the DePin Io.Net project work?
Io.Net is a DePin (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) project that is building a decentralized computer network aimed at offering low-cost computing power.
It operates similarly to Grass, acting as an intermediary for the buying and selling of hashpower, but with a more complex structure.
With the emergence of the trend of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the amount of verified data and the ability to process them are becoming very important factors for the future growth of a suite of new applications.
Io.Net supports this sector by encouraging owners of graphics processing cards, the same ones used for mining ETH during the “Proof of Work” era, to offer part of their computational power to the network.
It is no coincidence that on the official website’s home page, the project defines its infrastructure as “The Internet of GPUs“.
Already today over 550,000 GPUs are connected to the Io:net network, and many AI developers and engineers can take advantage of the computing power absorbed with a simple click, at a discounted price of 90% compared to other cloud providers. The team’s stated goal is to reach 1 million integrated hardware.
From a more technical point of view, it is worth mentioning how the network supports batch inference, parallel training, hyperparameter optimization, and reinforcement learning, optimizing performance on a GPU network for AI/ML workloads.

We remind you that Io.Net is a platform that lives on the Solana blockchain, being able to take advantage of the cost-effectiveness and fluidity of transactions. Solana
From May 1st until the end of the month, a crypto airdrop campaign is ongoing that will reward all users who have created their own working node and shared it with the rest of the network with a token allocation.
A total of 7,500,000 IO tokens have been allocated for this session, which will be assigned exclusively to ecosystem participants who have passed the proof of work verification (automatically performed every 6 hours) and to those who are active during the snapshot.
This will be randomly selected at any time during the month of May.
Regarding the specifications of graphics cards, you can delve into the requirements for bandwidth and other details on this doc.

We remind you that the DePin project is supported by VCs such as HackVC, Multicoin Capital, Sandbox, Delphi Digital, and Aptos, and has recently received funding for 30 million dollars.
Overall Io.Net is valued at 1 billion dollars. Most likely, the IO token’s FDV will be around this figure on the day of its launch on the crypto markets.

How to participate in the crypto airdrop by installing your own working node and using an unused graphics card
As already mentioned, participating in the Io.Net crypto airdrop is free, unless you don’t own a graphics card and have to spend money to buy one.
Actually, even without having a specific processor, it is possible to participate in the campaign in its social part, but we do not expect any particular economic rewards if a node is not created. 
If you are still interested in “social farming” you can take a look at the initiative of Galxe X Discord: complete activities, participate in AMAs and get verified roles on Discord.
For former ETH miners, for gamers, or in general for owners of a GPU with specifications valid for the purpose in question, creating a working node and connecting it to the rest of the network is a piece of cake.
First of all, you need to go to the official website of the project and create your account. Then click on the logo “Io/worker” in the top left corner and select “worker“. Then proceed to “connect new worker” by adding the data of the device you are going to use.
Configure everything by indicating the operating system (Mac OS, Windows or Linux), the provider (Io.net or Render) and, finally, assign a unique name to your device and choose the type of device (GPU or CPU)

Once this is completed, to be eligible for the crypto airdrop you will need to download and configure Docker Desktop (guide for MAC), then start the binary.
In the mobile window, click on “containers“, then open the terminal and paste all 3 commands found on the previously opened web page and start each of them.
Wait for the configuration and click “refresh” occasionally: it may take about 48 hours. 
After completing the configuration, simply type “docker ps” in the terminal and you’re good to go. The “CPU%” column will show the processing power of your processor.
Last advice, to set up the payment account click here and set up a Solana address using a wallet like Phantom.
Below is a guide (prepared directly by the Io.Net team) that shows step by step how to perform the steps just presented on a Windows operating system. In the same Youtube channel there is the same guide for MAC

Hurry up and join the Ai revolution with Io.Net: the crypto airdrop campaign ends on May 31st!

Encryption and encrypted passwords in the world of blockchain and crypto

The storage and secure management of data and passwords is one of the most important aspects in the crypto and blockchain world, and more generally in all online environments.
Encryption, intense as the art of “hidden writings” capable of converting plain text into encrypted text and vice versa, comes to our aid making it difficult for hackers to allow unauthorized access to certain networks and transactions.
Let’s delve into the different methods through which encryption can protect valuable information and safeguard passwords.

Symmetric and asymmetric password encryption in the crypto sector
Generally when talking about password protection in cryptography, reference is made to two encryption methods: symmetric and asymmetric.
That symmetric one refers to a type of text encryption that uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt information: 
The encryption key is shared between sender and recipient and is usually agreed upon in advance: it represents the central element that in cryptocurrencies allows users to access and manage their digital resources.
Symmetric encryption with a single key is one of the most common means to protect passwords, transactions, and communication between operating nodes.
When performing, for example, a funds transfer from one wallet to another, it ensures that the information is read and shared only by two parties involved in the transaction, keeping the data safe from prying eyes.
However, despite the advantages it brings, symmetric encryption has limitations in terms of scalability and key management.
Indeed, the need for communication in pairs greatly limits the expansion of this practice in a system with many more users. At the same time, more users imply human errors in the management and conservation of the so-called “private key”, which if lost leads to the loss of crypto or data stored in the virtual wallet.
To overcome these limitations, asymmetric cryptography comes to our aid by providing a pair of separate keys (public and private) in the encoding and decoding of passwords.
This additional level of security instantly increases data protection: the public key can be shared with anyone on any network (like when we share our address to receive a payment in crypto), while the private key must be kept secret.
Both keys are generated by an algorithm that uses large prime numbers to create two unique and mathematically linked keys. 
Anyway, whoever possesses the public key can encrypt a message, but only the holder of the private counterpart can decrypt the text. We can imagine this as if it were an email inbox: whoever holds the public key can send a message, but only the owner of the private key can open the email and read the messages.
Non-custodial software wallets like Trust Wallet or MetaMask use asymmetric cryptography to offer the highest possible security to their users.

The most common formats of encrypted passwords
Password encryption in the crypto and blockchain sector occurs according to different formats that can be used for different purposes and offer different levels of security:
MD5 (Message Digest 5):
The MD5 algorithm, developed by Ronald Rivest in 1991, generates a 128-bit hash (32 hexadecimal characters) from a variable-length input.
It is no longer considered secure due to vulnerabilities discovered in its algorithm. However, it is still used in some legacy contexts, for example to verify the integrity of files.
SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1):
SHA-1 generates a 160-bit hash (40 hexadecimal characters).
It is no longer considered as secure as it once was, having shown several vulnerabilities: it is now generally replaced by more robust algorithms such as SHA-256 and SHA-3. However, it is still used in a wide range of systems and new applications.
Salt:
The salt is a random sequence of bits that is added to the password before calculating the hash.
It solves the problem of collisions (two different passwords generating the same hash) in hashing methods.
By adding a salt, even identical passwords will have completely different hashes. This makes it harder for attackers to decrypt passwords through brute force attacks.
Bcrypt:
Bcrypt is a hashing algorithm specifically designed for password encryption.
Use a salt and a number of iterations to slow down the hash calculation. It is widely used to protect user passwords in the field of databases.
The choice of encryption format depends on the specific needs of the reference system. Nowadays, it is advisable to use hashing algorithms such as bcrypt or SHA-2 to protect passwords and mitigate cyber attacks.
Hash functions and digital signatures
Another way to protect passwords and valuable information in cryptocurrencies is to rely on hash functions, that is algorithms that transform any form of data into a string of characters of fixed length.
By using robust hashing algorithms, we can effectively protect sensitive information and prevent cyber attacks.
Hash functions are irreversible: it is not possible to convert a hash back into its original data. They are essential in data management on the blockchain because they allow structuring information without compromising its initial integrity
Hashes can also act as fingerprints for all encrypted passwords, protecting the user against unauthorized actions on their account.
Indeed, any modification to the original data would result in a new hash, which would no longer correspond to the original source and therefore would not be verifiable on the blockchain.

Another method to ensure password security, and more specifically the authenticity and integrity of data in a message, is to use the so-called “digital signatures” (asymmetric cryptography technique).
This is simply a method to ensure that the owner of those specific data is approving the transaction. Generally, the sender creates the digital signature using a private key to encrypt the signature data, while the recipient obtains the signer’s public key to decrypt the data. This code represents irrefutable proof that a message has been created solely by the sender and has not been tampered with online.
When talking about digital signatures, one immediately thinks of signature devices like Ledger, Trezor, and Bitbox that allow to validate a transaction before it is broadcasted to the rest of a cryptographic network.
However, be careful not to consider these devices as wallets: they do not contain your cryptocurrencies but only allow you to approve the transactions necessary to spend them.

LayerZero tackles sybil activity with self-reporting mechanism

LayerZero Labs has unveiled a solution to address sybil activity, also known as “airdrop farming.” The creator of the cross-chain communication protocol introduced a self-reporting mechanism, offering sybil users 15% of their planned token allocation for honesty within a defined 14-day period.LayerZero stated in a May 3 post on X that it believes it’s important for its protocol to distribute tokens to genuine, committed network users rather than individuals who engage in sybil farming. Sybil farming refers to the practice of creating multiple fake accounts to unfairly acquire tokens or rewards. The developers want to ensure that their token distribution benefits those who contribute positively to the network’s growth and sustainability rather than those who exploit it through deceptive tactics like sybil farming.Source:  LayerZero LabsIn the hopes of curbing the negative effects of sybil activity, LayerZero Labs is also providing an incentive for users engaged in such activity to come forward and admit it voluntarily. The incentive is that these users can self-report within a specified period and receive 15% of the tokens they were originally allocated without facing further questions or penalties. “We are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked.”The self-reporting process requires connecting a wallet associated with sybil activity and signing a message to confirm ownership. Related: Coinbase's Base could make it the NVIDIA of DeFiLayerZero Labs will enforce consequences for those who don’t self-report by May 17. The first phase involves publicly identifying sybil users who don’t come forward voluntarily, and the second phase allows community members to report suspected sybil activity.The proposal comes on the heels of the first snapshot taken on May 1 related to a potential airdrop distribution to community members. This snapshot marks the deadline for eligibility in the upcoming token airdrop, as confirmed by the team in a graphic shared on X.Airdrops are widely employed by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to create more traction by rewarding early users with newly issued cryptocurrencies. LayerZero Labs did not provide further specifics about the airdrop, but earlier indications suggested they were gearing up for a token launch in early 2024, as per a Dec. 7, 2023, X post. LayerZero’s ZRO was the first Hyperp (Hyperliquid-only perp) to launch on the HyperLiquid perpetual futures decentralized exchange in September 2023.

Hong Kong Asset Management Company Takes Huge Bitcoin (BTC) Move - Bitcoin Sistemi


Yong Rong Asset Management, a major asset management firm based in Hong Kong, has made a significant investment in the Bitcoin Spot ETF, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The firm purchased $38 million worth of the IBIT Bitcoin Spot ETF, which now accounts for 12% of its reported assets.
The move is particularly notable considering Hong Kong has its own ETFs, according to Balchunas. However, with their irresistible combination of low fees and high volume, U.S. ETFs continue to attract international investors.


According to Balchunas, Yong Rong's portfolio is diverse, with his top four holdings consisting of Nvidia, Meta, Tesla and Bitcoin. While Yong Rong's single $30 million ETF investment in IBIT is significant, another Hong Kong firm, Ovata, owns four of the spot BTC ETFs with a total value of $74 million, making it the largest total investor to date .

The total trading volume of six Hong Kong spot ETFs for virtual assets was HK$48.91 million, or approximately US$6.26 million, as of the close on May 3. Among them, the trading volume of Bitcoin ETF was 43.41 million Hong Kong dollars, while the trading volume of Ethereum ETF was 5.5 million Hong Kong dollars. In comparison, trading volume for 11 US Bitcoin spot ETFs on May 2 was a staggering $1.72 billion.

What Does Lower Than Expected US Employment Data Mean? Will there be a Rate Cut? - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to the note of Olu Sonola, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, the US Federal Reserve (FED) will refrain from making any immediate changes to US interest rates. This emerged as a response to lower-than-expected employment figures for April.
Sonola suggests the Fed will need more evidence before it can be confident that the U.S. labor market is showing signs of cooling. Sonola says, “This slowdown in employment growth is good news for those who expect an interest rate cut as soon as possible.”



However, Sonola cautions against drawing conclusions based on a single month's data. “One month doesn't make a trend, so the Fed would probably need to see a few more months of this kind of moderation and better inflation numbers to reintroduce rate cuts (sooner),” he adds.
In its statement after its meeting concluded last Wednesday, the FED decided to keep interest rates constant, as expected. However, it was noteworthy that Jerome Powell made a speech that could be described as 'dovish' at the press conference after the decision.

Bitcoin Back In The Bullpen: Whales Spark Rebound With Massive $2.8 Billion Purchase


								The past few weeks have been a rollercoaster ride for Bitcoin investors. Fears of inflation and geopolitical tensions sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, dragging Bitcoin and its altcoin brethren down to depths not seen since early 2024. Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, plummeted to as low as $56,500 this week, a far cry from its record highs of over $70,000 in March.

However, amidst the carnage, some analysts are seeing signs of a potential short-term recovery. This optimism stems from a confluence of factors, including renewed accumulation by major investors, favorable technical indicators, and historical price patterns.
Whales Dive In: Buying The Bitcoin Dip
One of the most interesting developments is the recent buying spree by Bitcoin whales. These large-scale investors, with wallets holding significant amounts of Bitcoin, have been accumulating the digital currency at a rapid pace.


According to Ki Young Ju, founder of crypto analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin whales amassed a staggering 47,500 BTC tokens, worth over $2.8 billion, in just 24 hours. This aggressive buying behavior suggests that these whales view the current price slump as a buying opportunity, a sentiment often interpreted as bullish for the market.
Technical Indicators Flash Green
Technical analysts are also scrutinizing on-chain data for clues about Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Dan, another analyst at CryptoQuant, is focusing on the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric, which gauges the profitability of Bitcoin transactions.

When the SOPR dips to the lower Bollinger Band – a volatility indicator – it can signal oversold conditions and a potential price rebound. According to Dan, this is precisely the scenario playing out currently, suggesting that Bitcoin might be poised for an upswing.
Investor Sentiment Cools: A Sign Of Things To Come?
Another interesting observation comes from market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock (ITB). They’ve noted a significant decrease in positive sentiment among investors during the recent correction. While a bearish outlook might seem like a negative sign, ITB argues that this cooling-off period could be a precursor to a rebound.


Historically, periods of lowered investor enthusiasm have often been followed by renewed buying activity as the market finds its footing.

Price Action Confirms Analyst Predictions?

Interestingly, Bitcoin’s price action seems to be validating these analysts’ predictions. As of this writing, BTC is trading at around $63,309, reflecting a 6.3% increase from the previous day’s price point. While this doesn’t guarantee a sustained upward trend, it does suggest that a short-term recovery might be underway.

Bitcoin Whales Bagged $2.8B Worth of BTC in a Day: CryptoQuant


																Bitcoin’s recent market correction that dragged the world’s largest cryptocurrency near the low of $56,500 turned out to be a good opportunity for high-profile investors.
Data shared by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revealed that whales have accumulated a whopping 47,000 BTC – worth more than $2.8 billion in current price – over the past 24 hours alone. This shopping spree signals the beginning of “a new era” for the primary cryptocurrency, according to the exec.
Bitcoin whales increasing their holdings may indicate growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory among institutional investors or high-net-worth entities.
The CryptoQuant founder also revealed that the whale wallets in question are mostly custodial ones, including ETFs, but clarified that the recent spike is not ETF-related.

There appears to be a change of heart as just a week ago, long-term bitcoin whales saw a substantial increase in their unrealized profits, especially as the price remained above $60,000.
Although their profits had risen significantly, these whales hadn’t yet cashed out, indicating they were holding onto their positions.
This aligned with a notable increase in bitcoin exchange inflows, mostly attributed to whales, which subsequently led to a market-wide slump.
Following the latest whale accumulation, however, bitcoin climbed by over 6% to surge above $62,000 on Friday, staging a modest relief rally.
The whale known as “Mr. 100” bought over 4,100 BTC worth over $242 million at around $58,000 on May 2nd, marking the wallet’s first bitcoin purchase since April 19, just before the 2024 halving.

This Week in Coins: Bitcoin Battered But Rebounds As Meme Coin Mania Abides - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.It was a rough week for Bitcoin—and the wider crypto market—but as of yesterday, things were looking brighter. The price of Bitcoin is now at $63,107. It’s effectively where it was seven days ago, barely down a fraction of a percent, according to CoinGecko data. That's an improvement from when it was trading for below $57,000 per coin earlier in the week. Bitcoin’s mid-week plunge was exacerbated by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posting their worst day on record on Wednesday. And that was after a bad week last week, too.Even BlackRock’s hugely successful iShares Bitcoin Trust experienced outflows for the first time since its January launch, putting downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.The sell-off came as investors were spooked by news that the Federal Reserve was not in any rush to slash interest rates. On Wednesday, the central bank’s chairman confirmed just that—saying there wouldn’t be another hike even though inflation was proving sticky. The Fed decided to keep its key interest rate steady.It wasn’t all bad news, though: on Friday, the U.S. government’s Nonfarm Payrolls report showed that the unemployment rate for April was higher than expected, leading to a jump in Bitcoin’s price. When unemployment is high, the Federal Reserve is more likely to cut interest rates. Low unemployment typically means people spend more, leading to increased prices—or inflation. Lower inflation could lead to a cut in interest rates, whetting investor appetite for risk assets like crypto.The jobs figures may have been what lifted BTC back out of its trough. Investors who were betting against the top cryptocurrency saw their short positions liquidated to the tune of $100 million yesterday.Elsewhere, meme coins continued their run, with Ethereum-based PEPE striking big gains and Solana-based BONK having a good week too. Despite a bumpy seven days, they are up over 20% and 15%.Other alts, like Ordinals-based ORDI and Toncoin, started a rally on Friday. ORDI is now priced at $41, a 24-hour jump of 10%, and Toncoin at $5 is up 9%.Perhaps more newsworthy—certainly more shocking—was when a young boy and his mother performed a sordid live spectacle to pump Solana-based meme token LIVEMOM to a $300,000 market cap before disappearing in what looks like a classic rug-pull scam.Even after the duo ghosted, the coin's market cap surged past $500,000. Never a dull moment in the crypto world. Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

BTC-e founder pleads guilty in $9 billion laundering conspiracy

Alexander Vinnik, the Russian co-founder of an allegedly illicit crypto exchange, BTC-e, has admitted guilt in a money laundering conspiracy involving cryptocurrency exchange. This admission follows a broader investigation revealing extensive illegal activities on the exchange from 2011 to 2017.The United States Justice Department (DOJ) reported that during Vinnik’s leadership, BTC-e processed more than $9 billion in transactions and had a user base exceeding one million globally, with many users from the United States. A federal district court judge will determine his sentence in accordance with the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.The U.S. Department of Justice highlighted that the platform was utilized to launder funds acquired from various criminal activities, including computer hacking, ransomware attacks, and drug trafficking.Source: United States Department of Justice Crime DivisionAccording to the DOJ, an investigation revealed that BTC-e operated without essential legal compliance measures, including registration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the implementation of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) or Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols. These deficiencies made BTC-e popular among individuals seeking to conceal money transactions from law enforcement. Additionally, Vinnik was discovered to have established numerous shell companies and financial accounts globally, enabling the illicit transfer of funds through BTC-e. This activity resulted in criminal losses totaling at least $121 million.Vinnik has been embroiled in legal battles over the past five years for his alleged role as the mastermind of BTC-e. The cryptocurrency exchange is said to have profited from various illicit activities that used the platform to launder some $4 billion worth of Bitcoin.Related: FBI busts $43M crypto and Las Vegas hospitality Ponzi scheme Vinnik was arrested on money laundering charges in Greece in 2017 through a U.S. warrant and was extradited to France in 2020. In France, Vinnik was cleared of ransomware allegations but convicted on money laundering charges and was sentenced to five years in prison. Vinnik’s lawyers launched an unsuccessful appeal, maintaining that Vinnik was just an exchange employee and had no involvement in illicit activities at BTC-e. After serving two years in a French prison, he was extradited to the U.S. on Aug. 5, 2022.The Justice Department recognized the Greek government’s cooperation in extraditing Vinnik to the United States. Vinnik had earlier tried to secure a prisoner swap deal for him to be considered as part of a prisoner trade deal between Russia and the United States.U.S. authorities have brought similar criminal charges against crypto exchanges and their executives. On March 28, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years for seven felony charges.Magazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime

XRP Surged Amid Increased Activity In The Ongoing Case Between the SEC and Ripple


							

Increased litigation activity triggered investors’ interest in XRP this week.



XRP gained 4.52% on Friday by moving from a daily low of $0.51459 to a high of $0.53683.



The court might reject Ripple’s opposition filing but allow the firm to depose Andrea Fox.




Increased activity in the ongoing case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple triggered investors’ interest in XRP this week. The embattled altcoin experienced notable volatility, returning consecutive profits for three days. TradingView data shows that on Friday alone, XRP gained 4.52% by moving from a daily low of $0.51459 to a high of $0.53683.



Friday’s XRP price movement rounded up a busy week for the altcoin following a series of events between the SEC and Ripple. Both parties involved themselves in motions and countermotions, arguing over the ongoing case and seeking the court to rule in their favor.



Earlier in the week, the SEC filed against Ripple’s “Motion to Strike,” which sought the court to discount the testimony and exhibit from Andrea Fox, the SEC’s enforcement accountant. The fintech firm cited several reasons for its motion, including the late inclusion of new expert materials.



In its filing, the SEC argued that Fox’s testimony did not amount to the inclusion of new expert material and asked the court to strike out Ripple’s motion. Later in the week, Ripple countered the SEC’s filing with an opposing motion, pleading with the court not to entertain it.









Industry stakeholders like Bill Morgan, a renowned crypto lawyer, did not see the possibility of the court granting “Ripple’s Motion to Strike.” However, he foresees a situation where the Judge will allow the firm to depose her based on some expert evidence she provided.



The back and forth between both parties rekindled investors’ interest and generated a buzz around the crypto space. It injected some volatility in XRP, especially as users expect the case to reach a conclusive end soon.



The SEC filed for the court to penalize Ripple with a fine of up to $2 billion for selling XRP as a security to institutional investors. Ripple is defending its position, aiming to convince the court of a lower penalty in the ongoing litigation.

Synthetix Founder Kain Warwick Shares Crucial Fundraising Advice for New Crypto Teams


Renowned blockchain entrepreneur and investor summarizes his thoughts on capital formation incentives in crypto, natural rivalry between VCs and retail investors, evergreen indicators for seed round participants and tough times for early-stage fundraising.Teams are constrained by dominant meta, Kain Warwick admitsIn 2024, even the most successful Web 3.0 teams looking for fresh funds are constrained by the current meta if they want to raise big rounds, Warwick shared in his latest thread on X with 123,000 followers. From the seed investor's point of view, the signals of project's traction — in terms of user base, potential customers, airdrop farmers — remain unchanged: VCs are looking for products with growing TVL, large numbers of X and Telegram followers and so on.That said, investors are still using these primitive indicators of social engagement to calculate the potential number of retail token buyers.As such, introducing points, pioneered by Blast, an overhyped OP Stack L2, became the natural way for teams to prepare for fundraising:So when points meta pops up everyone kind of has to do it. Because competition in early stage raises is intense. If you can incentivise activity and TVL at zero cost you can raise bigger roundsSeed rounds completed at $10 million-$50 million in FDV are "pure cope" for investors, and almost each of them is in profit at the end of the day, Warwick admitted.Crypto fundraising 101 by Synthetix founderPersonally, he recommends to reveal a token for retail at $10 million-$1 billion valuation after three rounds of private/seed funding with VCs:In order to break the current anti-retail meta you need to be face the wrath of VCs and regulators. No 1st time founder is going to do this. The incentives are too strong. Do a low float token launch after 1-3 private rounds and have paper 8 to 9 or even 10 fig networth. Or try to shift the meta and get rekt most likelyAlso, he admitted the role of retroactive airdrops of 2021-2023 as a way to introduce tokens to a large percent of retail owners.As covered by U.Today previously, Warwick estimated the euphoria of meme coins as a natural catalyst for Ethereum's L2s adoption.

Circle's USDC Surpasses Tether in Stablecoin Transactions, Visa Data Reveals



                    

In a surprising turn of events, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) has surpassed Tether’s stablecoin in transaction volume, according to recent data from payments giant Visa. 



In April 2024, USDC recorded 166.6 million transactions, outpacing USDT’s 163.6 million monthly transactions.




Since the end of 2023, USDC has steadily gained ground in the stablecoin transaction market. 



December of that year marked a milestone when USDC’s 145 million monthly transactions exceeded USDT’s 127 million transactions for the first time.



This development comes as a significant surprise to industry observers, given that Tether has long held the title of the world’s largest stablecoin, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $110 billion and accounting for over 68% of the total stablecoin market share. 




Tether’s market dominance makes its stablecoin more than three times larger than Circle’s USDC, currently valued at $33.5 billion.



While USDC has overtaken USDT in transaction volume, Tether maintains a substantial lead in terms of total users.

In April 2024, USDT was utilized by over 34.2 million unique wallets, whereas USDC only saw 9.57 million unique users.




Overall, there were 27.3 million unique stablecoin users and 21.4 million unique stablecoin sending addresses in the past 30 days. 



Visa’s stablecoin analytics dashboard, launched in April, tracks four stablecoins, including USDC, USDT, Paxos dollar (USDP), and PayPal USD. 



According to Visa’s data, these stablecoins recorded over $2.3 trillion in total transaction volume across more than 352 million transactions during the same period.



Stablecoins play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, facilitating swift transactions in and out of digital assets. 



With a total market capitalization exceeding $161 billion, stablecoins constitute 6.63% of the overall crypto market cap, as reported by CoinGecko. 



Visa’s introduction of its stablecoin analytics dashboard aims to provide accessible and comprehensive data on stablecoin transactions across multiple blockchains, cutting through the complexity for industry stakeholders.

Bitcoin and Other Cryptos Set To Begin ‘Slow Grind Higher,’ Says Arthur Hayes - Here Are His Top Altcoin Picks - The Daily Hodl


								BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is saying that crypto assets are likely to benefit from the US monetary policy going forward.
In a new essay, Hayes says that the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve are engaging in “stealth money printing policies.”










According to the BitMEX co-founder, the “slow addition of billions of dollars of liquidity each month will dampen negative price movement” for crypto assets.
“While I don’t expect crypto to fully realize the recent US monetary announcements’ inflationary nature immediately, I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher.”
Hayes says that the recent fall in the prices of crypto assets has offered an excellent opportunity to accumulate.
“I’m buying Solana and doggie coins (memecoins) for momentum trading positions. For longer-term sh*tcoin positions, I’m upping my allocations in Pendle and will identify other tokens that are ‘on sale.’ 
I will use the rest of May to increase my exposure. And then it’s time to set it, forget it, and wait for the market to appreciate the inflationary nature of the recent US monetary policy announcements.”
The BitMEX founder is an advisor and investor in Pendle (PENDLE), a decentralized finance crypto project that lets users tokenize and sell future yields.
On his Bitcoin (BTC) forecast between now and August, Hayes says,
“A rally to above $60,000 and then range-bound price action between $60,000 and $70,000 until August.”
Bitcoin is trading at $62,726 at time of writing.

Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) Launches on Solana, Will Surge 7,300% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Skinny Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Skinny Doge has market cap below $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Skinny Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Skinny Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Skinny Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Skinny Doge by entering its contract address – 913qkdtENF3qvSBZjtoNxETZi93xHgRDuHNGvdzkECF4 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SKINDOGE.

Dogecoin's 280K new addresses - Traders, is this a buy signal for you? - AMBCrypto



New demand for DOGE peaked during the week
Memecoin’s MVRVA ratio hinted at a buying opportunity too

According to IntoTheBlock, the crypto-market’s leading memecoin Dogecoin [DOGE] has recorded a major spike in new demand. On 2 May, 28,000 new addresses were created to trade DOGE. This figure marked a 102% hike from the monthly low in DOGE’s new demand that was set on 29 April. 
As new demand grew, the daily count of addresses involved in DOGE transactions also rallied over the past week. In fact, data from Santiment revealed that the memecoin’s daily active addresses hiked by 27% in the past seven days alone.
Source: Santiment
Here is how DOGE reacted
An uptick in an asset’s network activity often precedes a rally in its price. However, this has not been the case for DOGE. The sustained demand for the altcoin over the past week failed to initiate any significant jump in its price.
At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.15. According to CoinMarketCap, it recorded a price appreciation of just 2% over the week, with most of it seen over the last 24 hours. DOGE’s minor price rally in the last seven days mirrors the general market decline seen during that period. In fact, the low trading recorded during the period under review pushed the cryptocurrency market’s capitalization below $2.3 trillion on 1 May, before it rebounded. 
However, DOGE’s hike over the last 24 hours is a sign of bullish sentiment.
Also, according to Santiment, DOGE’s weighted sentiment is now poised to breach its center line on an uptrend. This metric tracks the general market sentiment about a crypto-asset. When it returns a value above zero, market sentiment is positive. Conversely, market sentiment is predominantly bearish when its value is below the zero line.
At press time, DOGE’s weighted sentiment was -0.348. This metric’s value will rise if trading activity increases and DOGE extends its gains in the short term.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s DOGE’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Now might be your time
AMBCrypto’s assessment of DOGE’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio revealed that it is now flashing a buy signal. This metric, assessed over the 30-day moving average, returned a negative value of -12.83% at press time.

Source: Santiment
An asset’s MVRV tracks the ratio between the asset’s current market price and the average price of every coin or token acquired for that asset. 
When its value is above one, the asset’s market value is significantly higher than the price at which most investors acquired their holdings. When this happens, the asset is said to be overvalued. 
On the other hand, when it returns a negative value, the asset is said to be undervalued, as its market value is below the average purchase price of all its tokens in circulation. 
Traders interpret a negative MVRV ratio as a sign to “buy the dip” in anticipation of a price rally.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse defends Ethereum against SEC scrutiny

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, has gone on a public defense of Ethereum in response to heightened scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) In one of the events held in Las Vegas, Brad Garlinghouse questioned SEC’s approach to Ethereum and Ripple (XRP). He argued that the regurgitative stand of the regulatory body is not very fruitful. These comments were made at a fireside chat at the XRP Las Vegas 2024 event where Michael Arrington, the founder of Arrington Capital, took the moderating role.Following the comments made by Michael Saylor, the MicroStrategy CEO, the debate on whether Ethereum is classified as a security has gone up a notch by labeling ETH and the other major cryptos as unregistered securities. In contrast with Saylor, Brad Garlinghouse has been a constant proponent of Ethereum, demonstrating the winning of Ripple against the SEC when a judge stated that XRP was not a security.Brad Garlinghouse’s statement was tweeted by pro-crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett in an X post, indicating his criticism of SEC chair Gary Gensler. He labeled Gensler as an “immoral human being,” saying he was overstepping the boundaries in his unitary roles.Consensys sues SEC over Ethereum regulationThe SEC has not yet ruled whether Ethereum is a Security. Instead, the regulator is looking into ETH-related trades to find out if those are solely investment contracts. This intrusion leads to the already current debate about how such virtual currency systems are integrated into existing financial regulations and whether they should be classified as securities.With regard to SEC’s initiatives, Consensys Inc., which is one of the important development components of Ethereum, sues the SEC in Texas. The corporation stated that the SEC is over-jurisdictionally encroached by attempting to govern ETH as a security. They evidenced their claim in support of the fact that Ethereum is not subject to SEC regulations as indicated in the previous statement.The legal fight starts with a 2020 case in which XRP was labeled a security issued by the SEC. In this case, Ripple, rejecting the ruling, went through a legal process which ended in a Federal Judge’s decision last year that XRP is not a security, however, Ripple had violated the law when institutional customers were initially served.Ethereum ETF hangs in balance amid probeThe SEC investigation is contributing to delaying the approval of the Ethereum ETF that will allow investors to buy Ethereum directly on the stock exchange. Investors greatly awaited such a decision. The scenario may be history, as the SEC’s ultimate decision will direct Ethereum’s regulation and its influence as a carrier of funds in the financial sector.Earlier William Hinman, the former head of the SEC’s Corporation Finance division, pointed out that Ethereum was not regarded as a security, a previous statement had mentioned this. This family history makes today’s regulatory environment more complicated, which is the dilemma for both the SEC and those who are for cryptos.

Tesla CEO and the new owner of the Twitter platform (now rebranded as X) Elon Musk has shared with the X and crypto communities that there is now a better tool to beat deepfake scams on this social media giant.Musk stated this while quoting a tweet from Community Notes – a feature on the X app that offers corrections to posts, often warning readers about fake or misleading information in them or simply providing updates.The Community Notes has rolled out an update, which includes improved image matching. It will help to show Notes on a larger number of X posts (roughly 30% more) that contain similar or identical images. Elon Musk commented on this update, saying that “This should make a big difference in defeating deepfakes (and shallowfakes).”This tweet of Musk brought up multiple comments from the crypto community. A lot of X users overall were excites about this new rollout and thanked Musk and the Community Notes. An XRP activist @XRPcryptowolf once again jokingly asked Musk when XRP payments would be made available on X. As reported by U.Today earlier, an XRPL validator who goes under the name Vet, dismissed rumors about XRP payments being tested on the X platform. Still, the company plans to launch internal payments later this year.The Dogecoin community hopes that Musk, as a big fan of DOGE, will add this meme cryptocurrency to the payment options, even though no recent statements from Musk about that have been spotted yet. Still, one thing is clear – X is not going to launch its own cryptocurrency “Xcoin”, according to Elon Musk’s tweets.

Why is the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Surging? Here's Why and a Renowned CEO's Comment - Bitcoin Sistemi

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, is increasingly aligning with the traditional views of investors new to the digital asset space through U.S. ETFs, analysts say.
Bitcoin on Friday surged after a report showed a smaller-than-expected increase in US employment. This situation revived interest rate cut expectations and increased the attractiveness of speculative assets. This rally managed to offset most of the losses incurred earlier in the week due to growing concerns that Fed officials were adopting a more hawkish tone and that demand for ETFs was decreasing.


FRNT Financial CEO Stéphane Ouellette commented on the week's events:

“What this week has taught us is that Bitcoin is at an all-time high and the new development of Bitcoin ETFs is opening up Wall Street participation in the Bitcoin market in a way we have never seen before. Previously, there was no clear correlation with other asset classes. “But this week, especially during the sell-off ahead of the Fed on Tuesday night, it was very clear that Bitcoin was trading in line with other risk assets.”

On Friday, Bitcoin rose nearly 7% to $63,257, contributing to price gains of smaller cryptocurrencies like Ether, Solana, and even memecoins like Dogecoin. On May 1, Bitcoin fell to $56,527, its lowest level in nearly two months.






On Wednesday, investors withdrew a net $564 million from U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETFs, marking the largest decline since these products launched in January. The prospect of prolonged high interest rates has also put pressure on other markets, including stocks.
However, yesterday, for the first time since its launch, Grayscale's GBTC product experienced a net inflow of $63 million.


Bitcoin's decline from its record high of almost $74,000 in March suggests investors are feeling some concern. Youwei Yang, Chief Economist and Vice President of crypto miner BIT Mining Ltd, suggested that traders “may see some risks in the global macro environment that the Fed or general investors have not yet seen.”

Top Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions as of Late


																TL;DR

XRP has remained resilient amidst a general market downturn, with analysts predicting substantial future gains.
The ongoing Ripple v. SEC lawsuit could significantly influence the asset’s price, depending on the outcome.


XRP Future Outlooks
The latest correction in the cryptocurrency market, which resulted in multi-month low prices for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many other digital assets, was not so devastating for Ripple’s XRP. Despite briefly plunging below $0.50, the token is up 3% on a two-week scale (per CoinGecko’s data).

XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko
Multiple analysts believe this could be a great starting point for substantial gains in the near future. One person who outlined such a prediction is the X user Mikybull Crypto. The trader argued that XRP’s “bottom has been confirmed,” adding that the asset is gearing up for an “explosive move.”
Another bullish analyst is Dark Defender, who forecasted that the asset’s price remains poised to reach $1.88 based on the weekly time frame.
EGRAG CRYPTO gave their two cents, too, observing some essential technical indicators. The analyst claimed that XRP has been “dancing around” the 21 exponential moving average (EMA) for quite some time, forming “several shy monthly candles.”




The trader thinks there will be a positive change once “the Kaboom or God Candle” occurs. “We need to stay steady because the big move is just around the corner,” they concluded.
Last month, EGRAG CRYPTO presented two potential paths for the XRP’s price trajectory in the following months. The first scenario depicts the token trading in the $1.20-$1.80 range by June-July, whereas the second option suggests an ascent to an all-time high of $4 by September this year.
Awaiting for News on the Ripple v SEC Front
One major event that could positively influence the price of XRP is a resolution of the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The trial between the entities started at the end of last month, and so far, it has only offered additional confrontation instead of an outcome.
It remains unclear when the case will officially be closed due to potential delays and appeals from both sides and the complexity of the legal process. One person who envisioned a possible settlement in the near future is the American lawyer Jeremy Hogan. He believes a $100 million agreement may occur this summer.

Money laundering allegations fall heavily on the former managers of Cred

In the bankruptcy of the former lender Cred, three actors of managers were charged with allegedly engaging in wire fraud and money laundering charges related to the bankruptcy filing in November 2020.Crypto lending fraud chargesAfter the preliminary hearing on May 2, the ex-CEO of Cred must state admission or denial of the offense by May 8. A press release a few days ago declared they are committed to demonstrating that those engaged in deception and fraud on markets will be prosecuted with the same zeal. Therefore, they can deliver safe markets for investors.The case involves the two former CEOs, Daniel Schatt and Joseph Podulka, who are the respondents to 13 wire fraud and money laundering charges. The charges also go against current chief commercial officer.Source: United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of CaliforniaMark Mosley, the criminal investigation special agent in charge at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, commented, “Its scheme was harsh, unjust, dishonest, that Crypto-Investors were fraudulently deceived out of hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency at the prevailing market price.”Cred reportedly said he engages in nothing but “collateralized or guaranteed provided lending” and that its cryptocurrency investments are “hedged.” They alleged that it maintains an “all-weather approach” to investment to counteract the volatility.Alleged investor deceptionOn the other hand, the prosecutors alleged that Cred extended numerous loans that “neither required collateral nor guarantees.” Schatt and Podulka were the first to show up in court and set to enter their plea on May 8, while Alexander’s booking date has not been set yet.On the same day that Alex Mashinsky, the former chief executive officer of a failed crypto lender, is set to be sentenced in September 2024, he faces seven felony accusations after the firm collapsed in July 2022.Simultaneously, Genesis, another clapped-out crypto loaning company that declared bankruptcy in early 2023, is striving to satisfy its debts with its creditors. On 2nd April, Genesis, a crypto-financial institution, dumped 36 million shares of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into the market, amounting to as much as $2.1 billion.

Three Former Executives of Cred LLC Charged for Misleading Customers


							

A recent press release states that three former Cred executives have been charged for misleading investors.



The charges against the defendants include conspiracy, wire fraud, and engaging in illicit financial transactions.



The executives charged by the Federal grand jury are Daniel Schatt, Joseph Podulka, and James Alexander.




A recent press release revealed that a Federal grand jury charged three former executives of Cred LLC, a San Francisco-based financial services firm that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020. The executives, Daniel Schatt, Joseph Podulka, and James Alexander, were charged with conspiracy, wire fraud, and engaging in illicit financial transactions.



The allegations against these executives were set out in two separate indictments. The first indictment charged Daniel Schatt, Cred’s co-founder and former CEO, and Joseph Podulka, former CFO. They were charged with conspiracy, thirteen counts of wire fraud, and money laundering.



Similarly, the second indictment charged James Alexander, former Chief Capital Officer, with conspiracy, money laundering, wire fraud, and other charges. According to the press release, these executives began making false and fraudulent statements, misleading customers and investors.









Notably, United States Attorney Ismail Ramsey, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp, and IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Michael Mosley of the Oakland Field Office announced the charges against the defendants. U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey stated,




 “The Northern District of California is home to many of the nation’s most innovative businesses. Maintaining a market for continued prosperity requires rooting out those who use fraud as a substitute for success. This prosecution demonstrates our determination to keep our markets free of fraudsters and safe for investors.”




As per the indictments, the defendants lured customers to make investments through false promises. They reportedly promised to return a significant yield on the crypto investments. At the time of Cred’s collapse, the customers reportedly suffered a total loss of $150 million in crypto.

Crypto's Volatility Summer | Bankless


Bounce with it. Crypto markets were jostled about by macroeconomic factors this week, meanwhile the degens were basking in new tokens after the arrival of numerous high-profile airdrops! What happened in markets this week?Bitcoin started out the week at $63k and attempted to break above the $65k open from the week prior before rejecting from the level on Tuesday and plunging below the key $60k boundary that had supported price throughout the prior two months.Risk assets ground steadily upwards throughout Thursday and exploded higher on Friday after poor employment data suggested that rate cuts may be imminent, allowing BTC to reclaim its key support level at $60k.Source: TradingViewWhile the total crypto market cap (TOTAL) only narrowly avoided its fifth red week in a row, many degens were recapitalized by a slew of major airdrops this week, potentially providing the fuel needed to send prices higher.Ethereum liquid restaking protocol Renzo and Solana money market Kamino both launched claims for their initial airdrops on Tuesday, April 30, distributing a combined $200M to early users at current market prices.Late Thursday night, friend.tech launched FRIEND, a platform utility token that accrues fees from swaps and can be used to purchase new “Club” keys, to coincide with the release of its V2. With 100% of the FRIEND supply going to users, the token launched at its fully diluted valuation and traded as high as $160 per coin during the early illiquid stages of price discovery, implying a mind-boggling $11B FDV!Unfortunately, FRIEND plummeted back to orbit this morning as users decried the quality of the V2 upgrade and jeeted their holdings from the application in a rush for the exit, draining a net 20k ETH from the application and leaving the token at a much leaner $120M FDV at the time of analysis.Source: @cryptokoryo_research on Dune AnalyticsAlso unveiled this week was the EigenLayer airdrop. While the token is not yet transferable or tradable, its arrival certainly sent shockwaves across the crypto market…Onchain yields continued to compress this week after the announcement, with the implied yield on the most liquid LRT pool on Pendle falling over 700 basis points since last Friday, down to 23.8%.While the promise of airdrops has fueled bull market narratives and inspired many to seek out leverage to best capitalize on the opportunity, their arrival has lessened speculative activity and caused yields to come in significantly during the month of April. Should yields continue to decline, there is a substantial risk that prices will trade lower, considering that holders may begin to sell crypto assets once the returns they can generate are no longer great enough to compensate them for their opportunity costs.Source: Pendle

WIF, DOGE, PEPE, FLOKI, BONK, SHIB: Comparative Price Analysis


							

WIF might hit $4.36 while DOGE might produce a 19.17% increase.



A bullish flag on the FLOKI and PEPE charts suggested a further upside.



BONK was overbought while SHIB might fail to retrace.




Like previous times, meme coins were stars of the show after the market recovered between May 3 and 4. As usual, dogwifhat [WIF] led the cohort with a 24-hour 20.58% increase. Dogecoin (DOGE) also climbed by 13.80% while Pepe (PEPE) increased by 12.93%.



The likes of Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) also joined the rally as their prices outperformed most of the other assets in the market. 



WIF vs. DOGE 



WIF’s price at press time was $3.32 with the 4-hour chart showing no resistance in sight. If this continues to be the case, bears might be unable to stop WIF’s bullish momentum.



The 1.618 golden ratio indicated that the meme coin could target $4.36 as its next support level. Meanwhile, DOGE also correlates with WIF. Should this correlation remain the same, a 19.17% increase awaits DOGE. From its press time price, DOGE might climb toward $0.18 within a short period.







WIF 4-Hour Analysis Against DOGE (Source: TradingView)



However, traders might need to watch out as the RSI showed that WIF was overbought and DOGE was close to a similar spot. If profit-taking begins, the prices of the cryptocurrencies might retrace. On the other hand, a bullish scenario could hand them a higher value.









PEPE vs. FLOKI



PEPE’s market structure was similar to WIF, and FLOKI too was not left out. According to the 4-hour chart, the breakout PEPE and FLOKI experienced was due to the bullish flag formation.



This happened as a result of sellers’ exhaustion. As such, if PEPE’s price rises, there is a high chance the FLOKI will do the same. Also, if the price of PEPE falls, FLOKI might dump. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) was positive, indicating an increasing upward momentum.







PEPE 4-Hour Analysis Against FLOKI (Source: TradingView)



Therefore, the price of the PEPE might continue to rise as well as that of FLOKI. In addition, the On Balance Volume (OBV) increased suggesting that buying pressure was intense to keep the price up.



BONK vs. SHIB



Comparing the BONK and SHIB charts showed that there was a difference in the trend. While prices moved together at some point, they decoupled on other occasions. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) on the BONK/USD 4-hour chart showed that the token was overbought.







BONK 4-Hour Analysis Against SHIB (Source: TradingView)



This was because the MFI reading was 89.99. Reading over 80.00 indicates that an asset is overbought. Although the reading also signaled that capital flow was high, traders might soon begin to take their money out, leaving SHIB and BONK prices to fall.

Opportunity? Here's Bitcoin's 'most optimal buy' entry before parabolic rally


The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has surged above the $60,000 mark, coinciding with a rise in the stock market amidst a weaker-than-expected US jobs report. 
Consequently, there is a consensus that Bitcoin is poised for further gains, and cryptocurrency trading expert TradingShot has identified potential entry points for investors in BTC. 
In a TradingView post on May 3, the analyst first suggested that Bitcoin’s recent drop to as low as $56,000 brought it close to a critical support level at around $59,000. This movement signals an ideal moment for investors to buy in before a parabolic rally.

Notably, the expert pointed out the behavior of the one-week commodity channel index (1W CCI), which is currently testing the top of its bull cycle support zone. This behavior resembles previous instances, such as September 07, 2020, and March 20, 2017, which preceded parabolic rallies, making them optimal entry points for buyers.
Importance of one-week moving average
The analyst also focused on Bitcoin’s proximity to the one-week moving average 20 (1W MA20), which is significant for the asset. According to the expert, this level has historically served as consistent support during bull cycles. 
At the same time, TradingShot examined past cycles, noting that the 1W MA20 has been breached only three times, none occurring during the 2015-2017 bull run, twice during the 2019-2021 period, and once during the current 2023-2024 run. 
This suggests that the 1W MA20 is technically the strongest support level Bitcoin encounters before the ultimate 1W MA50, typically only breached during bear cycles.
Bitcoin cycle top 
Elsewhere, with Bitcoin recovering, crypto analyst CryptoCon suggested that the maiden digital asset cycle top could be approaching by year-end, echoing patterns seen in 2017. Comparing current market dynamics to 2017, the analyst observed both periods witnessed Bitcoin surpassing all-time highs in March.
However, in 2017, new ATHs emerged by late April or early May, indicating a potentially accelerated trajectory compared to the present.
The market expert indicated that an extended correction around record highs could postpone the cycle top, with projections targeting mid to late 2025.

“To see our top late 2025 as normal, price would need to not make new ATHs for 7 months, or until after November 28th this year,” the expert said. 

Indeed, with most of the market anticipating a Bitcoin rally in the coming months, analysts believe that maintaining gains above $60,000 remains crucial. The asset has rebounded after dropping to as low as $56,000 amid uncertainty surrounding the next Federal Reserve monetary policy.
The latest Bitcoin gains came as the US jobs report revealed a shortfall. Employers added 175,000 jobs last month against expectations of a 243,000 increase. Wages rose by 3.9% in the 12 months through April, below the anticipated 4.0% gain following a 4.1% increase in March. 
This disappointment could pressure the Federal Reserve to cut rates sooner, potentially boosting risk assets like Bitcoin by reducing borrowing costs and weakening the value of fiat currencies like the US dollar.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $63,170 with daily gains of almost 8%. On the weekly chart, BTC is up less than 1%.

In conclusion, for Bitcoin to initiate a sustained rally, the cryptocurrency requires bullish momentum to drive the asset to $65,000. However, Bitcoin currently remains vulnerable to a potential drop to $60,000.

Airdrop Season's Main Event | Bankless


1️⃣ Rocky Airdrop DebutsTwo of the largest, if not the largest, airdrops, EigenLayer and Friend.tech, debuted this week. EigenLayer's Monday token launch details release largely disappointed users with plenty of quibbles over geo-blocking, governance, equity distribution, and non-transferrable tokens. However, EigenLayer proved responsive to feedback, adjusting their plans to, among other things, give 100 EIGEN to all past protocol users. U.S. users, it's time to schedule your international travel!Friend.tech, on the other hand, faced token claim issues and glitches with their new update. Users also had to interact with V2’s new features to claim most of their tokens, which proved difficult due to errors that hindered transactions going through. Yet, with FRIEND plummeting since launch, some have speculated it has already been oversold.2️⃣ Bitcoin's ReboundBitcoin had a shaky bulk of the week, with U.S. spot BTC ETFs seeing a record $534M in outflows, dropping prices to ~$56K. However, as the week progressed, Bitcoin recovered sharply, nearing $63K after the FOMC meeting and recent employment data. The unexpected soft job data and higher unemployment stand as testaments to the rate hikes working, which could influence the Federal Reserve's next moves. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's new BTC and ETH ETFs debuted strongly, gathering $292M and surpassing some early expectations.3️⃣ LayerZero Goes After Fake UsersThis week, LayerZero's community welcomed the snapshot announcement for their upcoming airdrop. Adding intrigue, the team introduced a 'Sybil turn-in' program, offering individuals who self-report fake accounts 15% of their potential airdrop to combat fraud instead of zero if they get caught. Around 500 wallets have already turned themselves in.4️⃣ ZKasino Team Member Arrested Over Rug PullZKasino, an onchain casino that recently rugged its community but claimed innocence, already looks to be paying the price. On Friday, Dutch authorities arrested a team member and seized ~$12M of his assets, with many speculating that the team member was the project's founder.5️⃣ CZ Skates with a 4-Month SentenceChangpeng Zhao, known as CZ, the former CEO of Binance, faced the music in a Seattle court, receiving a four-month prison sentence for money laundering charges. Initially facing 36 months, the final conviction showcased the positive reputation that CZ had built up over the years, with a judge specifically highlighting the volume of letters he had received pleading for a lenient sentence for Zhao. Seems like it worked.

Friend.tech’s Token Plunge 98% Amid Chaotic Airdrop Claim Process


							

Crypto users have decried the drop in the price of the recently launched FRIEND token.



FRIEND dropped by 98% shortly after its debut amid glitches in the airdrop claim process.



An analyst identified a significant imbalance between the added liquidity and collected fees Friend.tech.




Several crypto users have decried the unprecedented drop in the price of the recently launched FRIEND token of the blockchain SocialFi project friend.tech. Most users involved in the project’s airdrop complained about the claim process as they watched the newly launched token drop by 98% shortly after its debut.



Friend.tech launched last year on Base, the Coinbase Ethereum L2 network, offering an invite-based community via a custom ERC-20 social token, “Keys.” However, the project’s native token, FRIEND, debuted on May 3 with an airdrop to users.



Data from DEX Screener showed that FRIEND/WETH dropped from $169.09 to $0.5293 shortly after launching. In addition, users observed a significant drop in the token’s liquidity, exposing it to massive price swings and increased volatility.



Following the unusual behavior, a Messari analyst identified as Average Joe’s Crypto on X noted an imbalance between the added liquidity and collected fees on the newly launched platform. According to the analyst, the friend.tech’s team added a liquidity level disproportionate to the amounts collected in fees. He highlighted that users paid $30 million in farming costs for a token that has a liquidity of $3 million.



Some other users complained about the clunky nature of the tokens claim portal. Hence, it allowed successful claimants to sell large chunks of the tokens, resulting in plunging prices while others struggled with claiming their airdrops. One user noted that he watched the value of his airdrop go from seven figures to five figures within two hours while watching others cash out significant claims. 









Conditions appear to have improved for FRIEND as of the time of writing, as the token’s price posted a rebound to trade for $1.68, according to data from DEX Screener. The token’s liquidity also reflected significant improvement, showing a value of $17.5 million, with a market cap of $140 million.

Crypto Trader Says Top Ethereum Rival Primed for Massive Bull Run Ahead, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist believes that one Ethereum (ETH) competitor is ripe to witness steep bursts to the upside.
Trader Ali Martinez tells his 61,400 followers on the social media platform X that he is bullish on Cardano (ADA).










According to the analyst, ADA “seems ready for a parabolic bull run” after seeing its value drop by about 50% over the past month. Martinez points out that in 2020, Cardano saw an over 50% correction before going on a vertical rally.
“In 2019, Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel, signaling an end to the bear market.
Following the stagnant phase, ADA broke out of the channel with a 75% surge, then underwent a 56% price correction, setting the stage for an impressive 4,095% bull run.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Martinez says that a similar pattern may be playing out this time around.
“Recently, in 2023, something similar happened! Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel, marking an end to the bear market. Following this period of stagnation, ADA broke out of the channel with a 72% surge.
Now, ADA has undergone a 50% price correction, setting the stage for an impressive bull run ahead!”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that Cardano will appreciate by roughly 2,080% from current levels.
Cardano is trading at $0.467 at time of writing.
As for Bitcoin (BTC), Martinez says that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator is flashing a bullish signal for the crypto king.
Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles.
Says Martinez,
“The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Bitcoin daily chart. It anticipates a one to four daily candlesticks rebound for BTC.”

Bitcoin is trading at $62,750 at time of writing, up over 6% in the past day.

Bitcoin ETF breaks 80-day losing streak with bullish BTC inflow


As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to recover, United States spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to the cryptocurrency have registered record net inflows.
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) has successfully ended its 80-day losing streak, capturing a significant $63 million inflow on May 3. This milestone marks the first net inflow since GBTC’s transformation into a Bitcoin ETF back in January.
Recent data from Farside highlights this dramatic shift, with Grayscale’s GBTC securing $63 million in inflows, a stark reversal from the approximately $17.5 billion of outflows it has suffered since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11.


Despite intense competition, GBTC remains the largest Bitcoin spot ETF, managing over $18.7 billion assets under management (AUM) and about 297,000 BTC. However, this continued outflow has allowed newer competitors like the BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which now boasts $16.9 billion in AUM as of May 3.
One of the main challenges for Grayscale has been its fees. The crypto fund manager charges a 1.5% management fee for GBTC holders, which is significantly higher than the fees charged by many other ETF providers, including BlackRock and Fidelity.
This has been a critical factor in the ongoing outflows since January. In an effort to regain its competitive edge, Grayscale is considering launching a “mini” Bitcoin ETF with lower fees to compete with the array of new, highly popular ETFs.
Competing Bitcoin spot ETFs

Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) topped the chart for daily inflows with $102.6 million, followed by the Bitwise Bitcoin Fund (BITB) which garnered $33.5 million, and the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) close behind at $33.2 million.
Interestingly, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded inflows of only $12.7 million, placing it second-last for the day. This indicates that other market players, particularly Fidelity, are gradually catching up to BlackRock.
Additionally, there has been a noticeable increase in investment from Hong Kong-based companies in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, signaling a signaling a growing optimism among institutional investors in these funds.
Prominent crypto influencer DivXman noted on Twitter that GBTC had been the “primary source” of sell pressure across all spot Bitcoin ETFs, but suggested that “the tides” might be turning.

Bitcoin’s price has surged with a one-day gain of 1.65%, reaching $63,930 at press time. This increase coincides with the growing positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, potentially spurred by the encouraging developments in the ETF sector.

Russian Admits to $9B Crypto Laundering Scheme in US Guilty Plea


							

Russian national Alexander Vinnik has admitted to crypto money laundering via BTC-e.



U.S. prosecutors said BTC-e facilitated over $9B in transactions and catered to over 1 million users globally.



Vinnik is now facing the possibility of a 20-year prison sentence at his upcoming sentencing in the U.S.




Russian national Alexander Vinnik has admitted to participating in a crypto-related money laundering scheme, U.S. prosecutors disclosed. Vinnik admitted his involvement with BTC-e, one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges active from 2011 to 2017.



According to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s office in San Francisco, Vinnik was among the operators of BTC-e until law enforcement intervened, closing the exchange and arresting him. Prosecutors revealed that BTC-e facilitated over $9 billion in transactions and catered to over 1 million users globally.



The prosecution has characterized BTC-e as a major conduit for cybercriminals worldwide. It enabled them to transfer, cleanse, and hide illicit proceeds from criminal activities, including hacking, ransomware offenses, and drug trafficking. 



Additionally, the platform is implicated in processing Bitcoin that has been linked to a Russian military intelligence unit accused of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election by leaking Democratic Party emails. 









According to official statements, Vinnik deliberately managed BTC-e to support criminal activities, contributing to financial losses estimated at a minimum of $121 million. He is now facing the possibility of a 20-year prison sentence at his upcoming sentencing in San Francisco. Previously, in 2020, Vinnik was convicted of money laundering charges in France, where he was handed a five-year prison term.



The latest announcement from the U.S. follows the country’s intensifying efforts to combat cryptocurrency-related fraud. Notably, Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of FTX, received a 25-year prison sentence in March for his role in a multibillion-dollar fraud. 



Similarly, Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon were recently found liable for fraud in a civil trial regarding the firm’s collapse. Terraform’s crypto projects LUNA and stablecoin UST imploded in May 2022, which resulted in the loss of $40 billion in investor funds.



Additionally, this week, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison. This is due to lapses that permitted illicit actors, including criminals and terrorists, to utilize the services of Binance, the world’s preeminent crypto exchange.

Senate Hopeful and Crypto Lawyer John Deaton Supports Coinbase in SEC Battle



                    

John Deaton, a crypto lawyer currently vying for a Senate seat against Elizabeth Warren, has filed a brief supporting Coinbase in its appeal against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



In a filing dated April 26 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, John Deaton lodged an amicus brief backing a motion for interlocutory appeal on behalf of 4,701 Coinbase customers. 




The document, filed pro bono, aims to advocate for the interests of these customers rather than the exchange itself.



Deaton cited past SEC enforcement actions as evidence that the regulator “does not speak on behalf of digital asset users and investors and intends to offer no regulatory guidance beyond citing the Howey case.” 



He referenced the SEC’s civil cases against Debt Box, suggesting the SEC prioritized harming a crypto company over truth and justice, leading to a judge sanctioning the commission in that instance.




While an April 26 X post directly linked Deaton’s actions to his Senate campaign, he initially positioned himself as a legal representative for Coinbase customers in June 2023, predating his campaign announcement, following the SEC’s lawsuit. 



An April 19 filing indicated the success of his latest motion to file an amicus brief.



Deaton emphasized the importance of representing end users of the technology, asserting that a biased and politically motivated agency shouldn’t speak for them, nor should Coinbase.

According to Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, the interlocutory appeal questions whether the term “investment contract” necessitates contractual obligations post-sale, a key legal issue in the SEC’s case against the crypto exchange.



The potential impact of Deaton’s legal actions on his Senate campaign remains uncertain, given the upcoming election in less than six months. 



Both candidates for the Massachusetts Senate seat hold contrasting views on digital assets, with Senator Warren recently urging authorities to combat the use of crypto in transactions involving child sexual abuse material, as evidenced by an April 25 letter she signed.

84%+ SUI’s Staked Supply Is Held By Founders, Says Analyst


							

Analyst Justin Bons criticizes SUI for its centralized control, alleging that 84%+ of its staked supply is held by founders.



The analyst asserts that SUI’s chart representing its supply over the next seven years is a lie.



While Cyber Capital demanded SUI to reveal their address, the latter reportedly refused.




Justin Bons, the Founder of the crypto research platform Cyber Capital, criticized SUI’s centralized control, highlighting that almost 84% of the staked supply is under the control of its founders. Bons targeted SUI, asserting, “SUI has a great design, except for its token economics.”







Reportedly, SUI boasts a capped supply of 10 billion, with 52% unallocated until 2030. While more than 8 billion SUI tokens are staked at present, over 84% of the supply is held by the founders. Highlighting this crucial point, Bons pointed out, “SUI is centralized.” Further, he added,




“The founders control the MAJORITY of supply without lock-ins & ZERO legal guarantees! The legal fine print protects them, as the truth is sobering…The staked SUI implies there is no lock-in at all!”




Moreover, Bons posited that the SUI chart representing its supply over the next seven years is a “lie.” He added that all legal documents surrounding the fact prove their chart wrong. The analyst chastised the platform for being “extremely deceptive,” alleging a “clear lack of disclosure coupled with lies & unbridled greed.”









Bons also unveiled “someone’s” legal ownership over the unallocated supply. While the researcher demanded SUI to disclose their address, the platform reportedly refused to accept the demand. Instead, they stated that SUI was with custodians like BitGo, Anchorage, and Coinbase Prime. He wrote,




“The sheer greed of SUI’s distribution is mindblowing. As SUI still refuses to give full disclosure on the MAJORITY of SUI supply… This presents us with extreme risk, as the SUI leadership effectively controls network consensus.”




Meanwhile, the SUI token is experiencing a downward trend, aligning with the prevailing trend of the crypto market despite fluctuations. Currently trading at $1.10, SUI has shown a marginal decline of 1.92%. However, the token has exhibited substantial falls over the past week and month, marking dips of 6% and 35%, respectively.

3 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading this week


The cryptocurrency market has shifted from bearish to bullish as the week has developed, following nonfarm payroll data worrying data. However, three cryptocurrencies will go through inflationary events, and speculators should avoid trading them this next week for risk management.
Notably, TradingView‘s total crypto market cap index increased by over $245 billion month-to-date from a local bottom on May 1. Traders suddenly became more optimistic about 2024’s forecasts, as April’s nonfarm payroll data suggests favorable macroeconomics for risk-on assets.
Nevertheless, scheduled token unlocks for this next week will create extra supply inflation pressure for three specific cryptocurrencies. In particular, Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA), Galaxy (GAL), and Hashflow (HFT) will dominate the 7-day cliff unlocks from May 4.


Overall, $56.24 million worth of tokens will be unlocked in the next seven days with a high weight toward the mentioned projects.

Avoid trading Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA)
First, MAVIA dominates the 7-day inflation by 55%, with $30.79 million worth of 6.328 million tokens unlocked on May 6. It is noteworthy that this amount equals 25% of the current circulating supply, potentially having a huge impact on price in the short term. 
Of that, 2.33 million is from vesting contracts from Heroes of Mavia’s pre-sale, worth $9.38 million. 4.35 million MAVIA will be under the team’s control for investments in the community and ecosystem, worth $17.48 million. While slightly less than 1 million tokens will be paid as gameplay rewards, worth nearly $4 million.

Galxe (GAL)
Second, Galxe will release 5.17 million worth around $19.20 million, which represents 34% of this week’s unlocks and 5.8% of the project’s capitalization. Similarly to MAVIA, this is a strong signal for a cryptocurrency to avoid trading, facing such significant supply inflation.
Interestingly, most of the tokens will be unlocked to early investors or strategic sales from the team as profit realization. Only $2.18 million worth of GAL will go for community endeavors and reinvestment in the ecosystem for further growth.

Hashflow (HFT)
Finally, Hashflow has the third-largest cliff unlock this week, scheduled for May 7, with a value of $4.20 million. In total, 13.326 million HFT will enter circulation, heavily weighted toward early investors, ecosystem development, and team profits.

However, despite the above economic analysis, these cryptocurrencies could still display positive price performance in the next few days. Still, a solid risk management strategy also requires cryptocurrencies to avoid trading amid relevant supply pressures.

Moonbirds Copyright Controversy Exposes Flaws in Crypto's IP Obsession - Decrypt

It’s not much of a secret: When NFTs broke out as a coherent asset class in 2021, their value proposition was, chiefly, rampant speculation. Since then, NFT projects have spent untold millions attempting to pivot their brands towards more serious-sounding, sustainable futures; most opted to go all-in on the ephemeral, provocative concept of intellectual property, or IP. It has never been resolved, however, what exactly IP means in such a context, nor to what extent NFT projects can bestow IP rights onto their holders. Those unanswered questions bubbled back to the surface this week, when Yuga Labs—the multi-billion dollar company behind Bored Ape Yacht Club—announced that it planned to bestow exclusive commercial rights onto holders of Moonbirds, an Ethereum NFT collection it acquired in February. There was just one snag with the plan: In 2022, Moonbirds’ original creators filed the collection under Creative Commons 0 (CC0), an extremely firm legal tool that relinquished any copyright claims to Moonbirds NFT artwork, and released the pixelated owl characters into the public domain. Moonbirds’ official statement on the matter, posted Monday, came across like an attempt to sidestep this reality. “If you’ve made stuff during the CC0 era—cool,” the company wrote. “But from now on, you’ll need to own a Moonbird to keep doing so.”Twitter users immediately pushed back. Several, including copyright attorney Alfred Steiner, argued the company’s position was legally invalid—Moonbirds were in the public domain now, and nothing could put that toothpaste back in the tube. It wasn’t long before Yuga appeared to adjust its position. Within hours of the initial announcement, the company’s co-founder and CEO, Greg “Garga” Solano, wrote that Moonbirds-related commercial rights would only be attached to new, 3D versions of the Moonbirds artwork, which would be given exclusively to current NFT holders. Those commercial rights, Solano said, would be akin to those enjoyed by Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT holders. For years, Yuga has allowed BAYC holders to create and sell Bored Ape-themed endeavors like burger restaurants and canned water companies. The implication was that Moonbirds-themed chocolate bars and plush animals might be around the corner—but only current NFT holders would be allowed to create them.So what’s the truth? Can anyone freely riff on the Moonbirds copyright until the end of time? Or does Yuga have the power to control who creates Moonbirds-themed goods?According to Brian Frye, a law professor at the University of Kentucky specializing in NFTs and intellectual property, both statements can be true at the same time—a fact that exposes key issues with how IP is currently understood and discussed within crypto. For Frye, it all comes down to the crucial difference between copyright and trademark. When Yuga says that Bored Ape or Moonbirds NFT holders have special commercial rights, the company is implying that those source from an individual NFT’s copyright.Copyrights protect the content of a work, like the plot of a book or the unique characteristics of a painting. Yuga would therefore maintain that each individual Bored Ape or Moonbird possesses its own copyright, which a holder can wield to their own benefit.But Frye—and other legal scholars including Alfred Steiner—do not believe that commercial experiments like a Bored Ape burger joint actually rely on copyright. Instead, Frye maintains, they’re leveraging the generalized Bored Ape brand, which falls under trademark law. To put it simply: People line up to eat a Bored Ape burger because its affiliated with the Bored Ape Yacht Club brand, not because it happens to depict Bored Ape #6184 specifically. That distinction is a double-edged sword. In the case of the Moonbirds controversy, it means that Yuga likely can police who commercially leverages the Moonbirds brand. But it also means that the entire notion of individualized, copyright-based commercial rights controlled by NFT holders is somewhat fanciful.In practice, Yuga is just saying that it will selectively choose not to sue current NFT holders for trademark infringement. But little would protect said holders if the company changed its mind. The original Moonbirds filed under CC0, meanwhile, will remain in the public domain. But that CC0 distinction does not bestow any rights to the Moonbirds trademark. Any member of the public who tries to open up a Moonbirds ice cream shop in the near future will likely be in for a legal ride, should they get a stern call from Yuga’s attorneys.Decrypt reached out to Yuga Labs multiple times regarding this story, but never received a response. To Frye, the Moonbirds episode reveals how much of a buzzword—and supposed value-add—that IP has become for NFT brands, despite the lack of legal clarity surrounding the topic.“There's a certain subset of [Yuga’s] customers who are really fixated on the idea that IP is important,” Frye told Decrypt. “They don't really even know what it means, but it’s talismanic: ‘IP! I want to own the IP, whatever that is.’”Indeed, in the hours following Yuga’s announcement about Moonbirds this week, the collection jumped almost 30% in floor price—or the cost of the cheapest-listed NFT on a marketplace—according to NFT Price Floor. But that short-term victory could be a pyrrhic one. Ever since the 2022 crypto winter cratered NFT prices, Yuga has struggled to find a way back to the cultural dominance it once enjoyed. It once cost nearly $430,000 to join the BAYC at the project’s April 2022 peak; now it takes just $42,000.Last week, while announcing that Yuga had just undergone a wave of layoffs, CEO Greg Solano said the company had “lost its way.”Getting more aggressive about policing the Moonbirds trademark—which it appears this week’s announcement really boils down to—could temporarily boost holders’ perception of Yuga’s value. It may have already. But in the long run, Frye says, that sort of self-imposed limiting of who can engage with the Moonbirds brand might backfire in crypto—where what’s cool is everything.“The one thing they have going for them is some form of goodwill with their customers,” Frye said. “And to now come back and be like, ‘We're going to try to claw back intellectual property rights that are largely illusory anyway,’ just seems like an incredible ‘L’ for them.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kitty With Hat (KITHAT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KITHAT will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kitty With Hat.



Currently, Kitty With Hat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KITHAT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – 3Wdkgv1iTBQQ9MnvA4TkAefe2SLdtSKfHwZbhKcEMZk8 – in the receiving field.




KITHAT currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Cred Executives In Wire Fraud And Money Laundering Charge...


                                Wire Fraud And Money Laundering Charges Against Former Executives                                What’s the NewsIn November 2020, Three Former CEOs, CFOs, and CCOs of a Crypto lender company, Cred are alleged for wire fraud and money laundering charges, respectively. The Cred company is basically a financial services assisting company in San Francisco that is specialized in investments in cryptocurrency. The CEO Daniel Schatt, CFO Joseph Podulka, and CCO James Alexander are accused of wire fraud and money laundering charges in 2020. However, the Cred crypto lender company is already declared bankrupt before the charges. The CEO and CFO are facing 13 charges while CCO is charged with 4 counts. Although, the initial date still needs to be confirmed. The other two former executives Daniel and Joseph appeared in court on 2 May 2024 for the first time. However, they have to be present in the court for further arguments on 8 May 2024.Arguments By Prosecutor and DefendantWhen the case proceeds in court the prosecutors castigate the three executives by clearly stating that Cred crypto lender company is deceiving the customers by misinforming them about Cred’s lending and investment practices in Cryptocurrency. The defenders of Cred crypto lender Company affirm that they are involved solely in collateralized or guaranteed lending. They also added that Cryptocurrency investments are kept within bounds and they have maintained their investment regularly in every aspect against in every dynamic situation. However, prosecutors averted that Cred was neither collateralized nor guaranteed.On 3rd May 2024, The United States Attorney's Office of the Northern District of California averted that they were demonstrating this case to keep the markets free and safe from fraudsters and scammers. They also focus on investors' safety and security.Mark Mosley, in Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent, highlights a predatory and deceitful strategy aimed at defrauding potential victims of cryptocurrency valued at hundreds of millions of dollars based on market valuation.Another Bankruptcy Genesis is a crypto lending platform that filed its bankruptcy in January 2023 and then the company moved on to settle its debts with the creditors. Finally, on 2 April 2024, the company liquidated its assets and liabilities of around 36 million GBTC shares generating $2.1 billion in Bitcoin. Another bankrupt Cryptocurrency lending platform where the Former CEO Alex Mashinsky is alleged with 7 conviction charges in July 2022. The CEO of this crypto lender falls for the charges and now the hearing for the case will be held in September 2024. ConclusionAs per Coin Gabbar's information, the regulatory bodies act strictly in such cases to maintain the safety and security of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These cases reveal the loopholes in regulatory compliance and organizational functioning. Also the awareness of users and investors in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This case has become a social media sensation and users are anxious about their fund's security and safety. Hence, the executives have to contend with this situation because regulatory norms are taking strict action with context to such frauds and scams. Also Read: Dorsey’s Block Alleged For Violating Regulatory Norms

Bitcoin ETFs Record First Weekly Inflow of $343M Amid Bitcoin $63K Rebound


							

U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF sees first positive fund flow in seven days, with $343M.,



Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust records its first-ever inflow since inception, after draining over $12 billion.



Institutional interest rekindles as Bitcoin reclaims the $63,500 threshold.




The U.S. Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) has witnessed the first positive fund flow after seven consecutive days of trading with negative flow. More remarkable, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded the first-ever inflow since its inception after draining over $12 billion.



According to public records, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs ended Friday trading with a net inflow of $343 million. This influx was influenced by Fidelity’s FBTC, which alone witnessed a positive flow of $102.6 million. 



Coming next on the ranking was the fund inflow from Grayscale. In particular, Grayscale ETF saw a positive flow of $63 million for the first time since the January approvals. Meanwhile, the firm recorded an outflow of over $12 billion since the approvals.



Other U.S. issuers that saw positive flow on Friday included BlackRock (IBIT), Bitwise (BITB), Ark Invest, Franklin (EZBC), and Invesco Galaxy (BTCO). On the other hand, the ETFs of Valkyrie (BRRR) and WisdomTree (BTCW) saw zero influx.



Source: Spot On Chain 



Notably, before Friday, the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market last saw inflow on April 25. The flows dropped to negative as BlackRock’s ETF saw consecutive trading days with zero influx. Furthermore, the flow to the ETF market dried up amid Bitcoin’s price correction over the past few weeks.  









For instance, after Bitcoin crashed to $56,555 on May 1, these ETF issuers saw a staggering outflow of $564 million the following day. Essentially, institutional investors adopted a cautious approach in their investment towards Bitcoin products amid the market dips.



Meanwhile, in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin reclaimed the $63,500 threshold. Interestingly a renewed interest in Bitcoin ETFs emerged as the U.S. ETFs saw an inflow of $343 million after multiple consecutive days of outflows.

Analyst with 53 Years of Experience Evaluates Bitcoin and Shares Price Target - Bitcoin Sistemi

Veteran commodity trader Peter Brandt made a bullish prediction about the future of Bitcoin (BTC) in a recent article. As Brandt enters the 53rd anniversary of his first futures market trade, he praised Bitcoin as “the trade of a lifetime” and said, “There has never been, and there may never be, another market like Bitcoin.”
Brandt's trading career began in 1971 at the New York Mercantile Exchange, trading pre-1964 silver quarter and dime futures contracts. Over the years, he has traded futures contracts ranging from corn to gold, treasury bills to copper, sugar to palm oil, lumber to cattle, and even iron ore to Idaho potatoes.


Brandt has also added some other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to his investment portfolio in recent years. However, he frequently criticizes altcoins and is a firm believer in BTC as an asset.
In a blog post linked to his tweet, Brandt stated that the BTC market is unique. He described altcoins and memecoins as “imitations” that owe their existence to Bitcoin. According to Brandt, several factors make Bitcoin unique. These include its unhackable structure, limited quantity, global acceptance, traceability and almost instantaneous transaction ability. He also highlighted BTC's price behavior as an important factor. Overall, he sees Bitcoin as “an attempt to take over the world's monetary system by force.”






Brandt also summarized the large increases in Bitcoin prices since its inception, stating that increases in Bitcoin have often been parabolic in nature.
The Bitcoin chart shared by Brandt shows that Bitcoin has risen irreversibly since its inception, and even major corrections have failed to break the rising BTC line. According to the analyst's chart, the current bullish period started in late 2022 and continues now. Brandt's price target here is to go up to $125,000.

PEPE Primed For A Big Leap: 80% Price Increase Incoming?


                            The cryptocurrency market may be experiencing a cool down, but one meme coin is refusing to catch a cold. PEPE, a token emblazoned with the internet’s famous frog, has defied recent bearish trends with a surge in price and trading activity. This resilience has fueled speculation of a potential “bullish breakout” in the coming days, with some analysts predicting astronomical gains.

PEPE Weathers The Storm
While Bitcoin and Ethereum have taken a breather in recent weeks, PEPE has exhibited surprising strength. Unlike its more established counterparts, PEPE hasn’t succumbed to the broader market chill. In fact, the meme coin has managed to inch up slightly this week and even enjoyed a nearly 10% price jump in the last 24 hours. This resilience has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike.

Trading Frenzy: PEPE Ignites Investor Interest
The newfound bullishness surrounding PEPE is further bolstered by a surge in trading activity. The coin boasts a 24-hour trading volume exceeding a staggering $1.26 billion, placing it firmly in the spotlight. Additionally, PEPE’s market capitalization currently sits at a healthy $3.23 billion, a testament to its growing presence within the crypto landscape.
Technical Analysis Paints A Bullish Picture
Adding fuel to the fire, crypto analyst World Of Charts has identified a bullish flag pattern in PEPE’s recent price action. This technical indicator often precedes a price breakout, suggesting that PEPE might be on the cusp of a significant upward trajectory.

World Of Charts predicts a potential price surge of 80-90% in the coming days if the coin manages to break free from its current resistance level.

Meme Coin Frenzy: A Double-Edged Sword?
Despite the optimistic outlook, a cloud of caution hangs over PEPE’s future. The coin falls under the category of meme coins, a notorious sector within the cryptocurrency market known for its volatility and often lacking strong fundamental backing.

Total crypto market cap currently at $2.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Unlike established projects with real-world applications, meme coins often rely on community hype and internet trends to propel their value. This can lead to sharp price spikes followed by equally dramatic crashes.

While the prospect of an 80-90% return on investment is undeniably enticing, experts urge potential investors to approach PEPE with a dose of healthy skepticism. The analyst prediction, while optimistic, should not be taken as financial gospel. The cryptocurrency market, especially the meme coin segment, is inherently unpredictable.

Friend.tech Fiasco: Token Tanks 98% After Airdrop Fails To Deliver


								Friend.tech, a social media platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, aimed to celebrate the launch of its version 2 protocol with an airdrop of its native token, FRIEND. However, the well-intentioned initiative turned into a cautionary tale, with the token’s price experiencing a dramatic nosedive and user frustration reaching a fever pitch.

Friend.tech: Building A Social Network On Blockchain
Launched in 2023, Friend.tech positions itself as a Web3 social media platform that leverages blockchain technology to foster a more “authentic” and “decentralized” online experience.
The platform utilizes a unique “key” system, where users gain access through exclusive invites. These “keys” are essentially social tokens built on the ERC-20 standard, allowing communities within Friend.tech to establish their own governance and economic structures.
FRIENDly Faux Pas: Airdrop Chaos And Price Plunge
On May 3rd, Friend.tech airdropped FRIEND tokens to its user base in conjunction with the version 2 protocol rollout. Initial excitement was quickly dampened as the token’s price exhibited a dizzying rollercoaster ride. Soaring to a high of $167 shortly after launch, FRIEND then plummeted to a value under $2 within a matter of hours.


Analysts point to two primary culprits behind the crash: liquidity issues and a sell-off frenzy. Friend.tech’s initial liquidity pool, the readily available funds for buying and selling tokens, appears to have been insufficient to handle the trading volume.
This lack of liquidity meant that even small sell orders had an outsized impact on the price, pushing it down rapidly. Further exacerbating the situation, a significant number of users who received airdropped tokens opted to sell them immediately, likely capitalizing on the initial price spike. This mass sell-off further depressed the price, creating a vicious cycle.


Claiming Challenges Add Fuel To The Fire
Adding insult to injury, the process for claiming airdropped FRIEND tokens reportedly proved cumbersome for many users. Technical glitches and an unintuitive interface hampered the claiming process, leading to user frustration and accusations of a poorly designed launch.

A Silver Lining, Or A Statistical Mirage?
Despite the initial chaos, there have been some signs of life for FRIEND. Liquidity has improved somewhat, and the number of token holders continues to grow. However, this growth might be misleading.

Bitcoin is now trading at $63.274. Chart: TradingView
With the token price so low, the barrier to entry is minimal, potentially attracting new holders who are simply curious or hoping for a rebound. More importantly, the number of sellers continues to outpace buyers, indicating a lack of long-term confidence in the token’s value.

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) Coin to Rally 7,000% Within 48 Hours, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Pension Funds Are Eyeing Opportunities in Crypto Investment - Fidelity


							

According to Manuel Nordeste, defined benefit plans are talking about crypto assets.



Nordeste thinks small-scale but sophisticated investors are more likely to buy into crypto.



Fidelity’s survey showed that 80% of high-net-worth individuals viewed digital assets positively.




According to Manuel Nordeste, vice president at Fidelity Digital Assets, defined benefit plans and other pension funds have started talking to their investment committees about crypto assets. Nordeste made the statement during an event in London. In his opinion, small-scale but sophisticated investors like family offices and high-net-worth individuals are more likely to buy into crypto. 



Meanwhile, the investment expert noted that his company, Fidelity Digital Assets, is starting to have conversations with larger, real-money institutional investor types, compared to the smaller-scale investors they focused on in their early days. He explained that in the past, Fidelity worked with small specialized asset managers, hedge funds, and the big blue-chip hedge funds.



However, Nordeste highlighted that Fidelity is getting some of the high-end clients and other corporate establishments. Citing a survey conducted by the investment firm, Nordeste noted that 80% of high-net-worth individuals viewed digital assets positively, compared to 23% of pension plans. Furthermore, 48% of those respondents invested in digital assets, with just 7% of pension plans invested in the same.



Explaining further, the Fidelity vice president noted that smaller firms are more prone to taking risks since they either have no investment mandates or the mandates they have are easy to navigate. Comparing them to pensions, he observed that it takes longer for the latter to adjust, and there are fundamental requirements to be in the market.









Last Thursday, BlackRock, one of Fidelity’s rivals, said it expects to see institutions, including pension funds, start trading the Bitcoin spot market. The ETF provider noted that it expects the institutions to access the products through the ETF products approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January.

Michael Saylor has something to say on Ripple's XRP case outcome

Michael Saylor has come under fire from pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan for his recent comments on ADA, Solana, XRP, the native crypto of Ripple, and other cryptos. Reacting to comments made by MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, Bill Morgan has published a number of pieces on the X platform that attack the pro-bitcoin individual.Accordingly, in the midst of the continuous legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has made some daring comments. As the token vs. securities debate intensified, the Ripple CEO not only supported XRP but also Ethereum (ETH) in his most recent comments. Michael Saylor goes up against XRP lawyerAt the Bitcoin for Corporations 2024 event, Michael Saylor, a well-known figure in the crypto industry and executive at MicroStrategy, discussed the potential regulatory challenges that various altcoins may face. According to Michael Saylor, it is possible that the SEC will categorize Ethereum, BNB, Solana, XRP, and Cardano as unregistered securities.Meanwhile, this prediction, shared in early May, has ignited a lively debate within the crypto community. If this classification were to be implemented, it could have a substantial impact on the trading and regulatory environment of these coins in the United States.On the other hand, XRP lawyer Bill Morgan expressed his disagreement with Michael Saylor’s perspective on altcoins, highlighting Saylor’s limited understanding of the crypto market. Morgan highlighted the difference between Ripple, the company, and XRP, the token. It’s worth noting that a judge has previously ruled that XRP is not considered a security, despite Saylor’s prediction of increased regulatory scrutiny for altcoins. Morgan raised doubts about Saylor’s ability to accurately predict Bitcoin’s future, considering his apparent lack of knowledge about the legal status of XRP.Furthermore, Bill Morgan raised concerns about Michael Saylor’s endorsement of Bitcoin as a better investment option than altcoins. Morgan suggested that Saylor’s support for Bitcoin might be seen as promoting an investment contract. In addition, he highlighted the possible contradiction in Micahel Saylor’s position, suggesting that if MicroStrategy were to sell or offer Bitcoin, it could be seen as an investment agreement, much like altcoin transactions on secondary markets.Saylor attacks EthereumOn Thursday, May 2, 2024, while speaking at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference, he made some remarks concerning ETH that have not sat right with the crypto community. Michael Saylor, who also criticized Ethereum and referred to it as a security, stated that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would almost certainly never approve a spot Ethereum ETF. Twenty days prior to the final deadline of May 23, his remarks concern whether the SEC will grant or deny spot Ethereum ETf applications.Additionally, he predicted that BNB, Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA), which are lower-ranking cryptocurrencies, would be categorized as unregistered securities.Saylor underscored: “None of them will be included in a spot ETF, none of them will ever gain acceptance on Wall Street…”He said quite clearly that Bitcoin (BTC) is the only cryptocurrency that has achieved complete institutional adoption. As there won’t be another one, he dubbed Bitcoin the “singular universal” crypto asset appropriate for institutional-grade investing.The man who started MicroStrategy is well known for his unflinching dedication to Bitcoin. Saylor made his comments soon after MicroStrategy disclosed that it had added $1.65 billion in Bitcoin to its corporate reserves for the first quarter.Two days earlier, MicroStrategy also debuted MicroStrategy Orange, a decentralized identity (DID) system based on Bitcoin. Apart from maintaining a sizable Bitcoin holding on its balance sheet, the business has been putting up a lot of effort to strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem.

What does Shiba Inu's price surge today have to do with PayPal?

Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens are now available for purchase by PayPal users in the United States as a result of a recent partnership with the industry’s preeminent crypto payment processor, MoonPay.MoonPay announced its important partnership with PayPal on Thursday. The fundamental objective of the collaboration is to facilitate seamless migrations from fiat currency to crypto assets, such as Shiba Inu.Shiba Inu’s price rally – Everything you need to knowShiba Inu is up today. According to CoinMarketCap, Shiba Inu trades at $0.00002553, a 12.1% surge in the last 24 hours. Thanks to this collaboration, PayPal users in the U.S. now have a convenient way to buy cryptocurrencies such as Shiba Inu using the crypto payment processor MoonPay.In addition, the official report emphasized that the integration streamlines the process of acquiring crypto coins for MoonPay customers who have a PayPal account for online transactions. When choosing PayPal, users have the option to fund their crypto purchases with their PayPal balance, debit cards, or direct bank transfers.It’s worth noting that existing PayPal users don’t have to manually enter any of these details when making crypto purchase transactions.Interestingly, this development follows the increasing excitement among the Shiba Inu Army regarding PayPal’s acceptance of SHIB payment.What other crypto coins can you buy through PayPal?In addition, MoonPay highlighted that users in the United States can take advantage of this new integration to access more than 110 supported crypto coins. MoonPay supports several crypto assets, including SHIB, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana. These assets can be conveniently purchased using your PayPal balance.Unfortunately, certain assets that the payment processor initially supports cannot be purchased through PayPal, as they are not accessible to users in the U.S. Some of the cryptocurrencies I’m interested in are PEPE, BNB, Cosmos (ATOM), AAVE, UNI, and TON, among others.It is important to mention that crypto purchases through PayPal are currently accessible to MoonPay users in the U.S. However, the report highlights that this solution is anticipated to be implemented across MoonPay’s partner networks by the end of the year.In addition, MoonPay has announced that in the coming months, users in the United States will be able to sell cryptocurrencies through PayPal. The payment processor also announced plans to expand this service to users in the U.K. and the EU.Interestingly, the DEX Marswap, built on the Shibarium platform, has recently introduced a new feature that allows investors to conveniently purchase and trade the BONE token from the Shiba Inu ecosystem using PayPal.SHIB also charges on the back of the token burnIn spite of recent substantial selloffs, the price of SHIB has displayed impressive resilience, going against market expectations and continuing its upward trend above the crucial resistance level of $0.00002315 at the current moment.According to data from the tracker Shibburn, there has been a remarkable 1009% increase in Shiba Inu’s burn rate in the last 24 hours, resulting in the destruction of 29.11 million SHIB tokens. This substantial rise in the token’s burn rate, a mechanism aimed at improving SHIB’s tokenomics, has further reduced the crypto’s market supply.The SHIB burn rate experienced a significant surge of 1009%, causing the price trajectory to maintain its upward momentum, rising in sync with the broader market trends. Today, SHIB once again reached the significant level of $0.000025, which holds psychological importance for the token, as the burn rate continues to rise. Investors are showing a great deal of interest in Shiba Inu, as they eagerly speculate on the coin’s potential price movements in the future.It’s worth noting that despite the significant number of coins sold by wallets in the past day, Shiba Inu has shown impressive resilience by maintaining its upward movement.Coinglass data showed SHIB liquidations totaling $90.39K, indicating a notable decrease in selling pressure compared to previous data. In addition, the open interest surged by 13.73%, reaching a total of $64.76 million, indicating a growing interest from investors in the dog-themed meme token.Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu crypto community has decided against a hard fork upgrade for Shibarium, which has further fueled optimism for its cryptographic journey. The data mentioned above provides a glimmer of hope for the future of SHIB, as crypto market enthusiasts remain interested in the token.

Legendary trader predicts Bitcoin price will 'pump' if this pattern plays out


Veteran trader Peter Brandt has sparked significant discussions in the cryptocurrency sector with his latest forecast, suggesting that Bitcoin (BTC) could potentially approach its previous highs if it continues to follow a classic bullish pattern.
In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter) on May 2, Brandt presented a scenario where, by sustaining its current stability and upward momentum, Bitcoin might witness a substantial price increase, nearing  its historical peak values.

This optimistic outlook, however, has not been well embraced. Some skeptics have questioned Brandt’s credibility, given his previous predictions suggested both a correction to $40,000 per BTC and the possibility that Bitcoin had already reached its peak.


Despite these criticisms, he remains optimistic in his belief that Bitcoin is on a bullish path.
Peter Brandt’s perspective on Bitcoin’s attributes
In his latest blog, Peter Brandt highlighted several unique aspects of Bitcoin that set it apart: non-hackable, limited quantity, globally accepted, trackable, and almost instantly transactional. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price behavior is notably distinct, according to him.

Not only have the major advances in BTC been of a parabolic nature, but of parabolic on a log scale. I can find no other stock, commodity, or publicly traded asset that can make the same claim.
Peter Brandt

This assertion underscores his confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and distinctive market behavior.
Market reactions and analyst perspectives
Critics of Peter Brandt‘s forecast recall his earlier inconsistent predictions, but he holds firm on his current bullish stance, underscoring the importance of adaptability in successful trading. On the supportive side, Marco Johanning, a noted crypto analyst, reiterated a bullish sentiment on social media:
 “We are in a bull market, and this is merely a correction, not a rally in a bear market,” suggesting confidence in the market’s potential for a rebound.
Contrarily, Scott Melker presents a more cautious perspective, highlighting the lack of key support levels, which, if not maintained, could precipitate a further drop to as low as $52,000.

By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $63,870, marking daily gains of almost 6%. On the weekly chart, BTC showed a modest increase of less than 1.5%. For Bitcoin to initiate a sustained rally, it requires bullish momentum to push the asset towards the $65,000 threshold. However, Bitcoin currently remains vulnerable to a potential drop to $60,000.
This period of uncertainty is critical for traders and investors alike as they weigh the mixed signals and brace for potential shifts in the market’s direction.
Whether Brandt’s bullish scenario will materialize remains an open question, but the ongoing debate illustrates the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency landscape.

JUST IN: Bitfinex Responds to Allegations that Data and Passwords of Hundreds of Thousands of Users were Leaked - Bitcoin Sistemi

About 30 minutes ago, allegations that user data of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex had been compromised by hackers and that 2.5 TB of data had been leaked were made by the research company Shinoji Research.
The alleged hack in question was claimed by the ransomware group called Fsociety.However, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino, who is also Tether CEO, responded to the issue by saying that the hack 'appears to be fake' and the funds are safe:

Everyone is panicking about a possible database breach at Bitfinex.
Long story short, it looks fake.
The alleged hackers published 2 mega links with sample data containing 22.5 thousand email and password records.
We do not store plaintext passwords or 2FA information in cleartext.
Only 5 thousand of 22.5 thousand emails match bitfinex users
The so-called hackers did not contact us. If they had any real information, we would have a bug bounty, a customer support ticket, etc. They would ask for a ransom through We couldn't find any requests.
Different security researchers rushed to spread the word about the breach. From what we can gather though, hackers have likely collected a database of emails/passwords from different crypto leaks. Unfortunately most users use the same email/passwords on multiple sites.
We are conducting a deep analysis of our systems and currently no breaches have been detected.
Also, the KYC platform has heavy rate limitation which will not allow bulk downloading.
While we believe this is pure FUD, we will continue to review the information to make sure nothing has been overlooked.
Funds are safe.

Stay tuned for other details regarding the hot development.*This is not investment advice.

Google moves offices from USA to countries with ties to the BRICS Bloc

As part of its cost-cutting initiatives, Google U.S. terminated over 200 “core” employees and offshored the positions. The employment positions will be relocated from Google’s U.S. headquarters to BRICS nation India and Mexico. Since the 1990s, the United States has outsourced employment to developing nations featuring comparable talent for lower compensation.Asim Husain, vice president of Google Developer Ecosystem, wrote in an email to his team last week that “announcements of this sort may leave many of you feeling uncertain or frustrated.” Google lays off employees and moves to Mexico and IndiaAs reported by CNBC, Google terminated at least 200 members of its “Core” teams on April 25, just prior to the release of its enormous first-quarter earnings report. As part of a reorganization, some positions will be relocated to India and Mexico.Per Google’s website, the core unit is tasked with establishing the technical framework that supports the organization’s most prominent products and ensuring users’ online security. The core teams comprise diverse engineering roles, technical infrastructure, security foundation, application platforms, and essential technical units from information technology, as well as the Python developer team.According to court documents, the company’s Sunnyvale, California offices eliminated at least fifty engineering positions.Since the turn of the millennium, the rate at which the United States outsources employment has accelerated, with Mexico and BRICS member India placing first. A plurality of Google’s U.S. workforce has been laid off as a result of the lockdowns imposed in response to PCV-19.Although India is home to a wealth of skilled individuals, its remuneration is half that of Google’s American staff. In developing nations such as India and Mexico, software and technology professionals are abundant. As a result, although outsourcing proves advantageous for India, it imposes the greatest burden on American employees.Concurrently with BRICS’s effort to generate revenue by exploiting talent, Google has decided to outsource American employment. In addition to the challenge of de-dollarization, American employees are also confronted with the quandary of job outsourcing, which lacks governmental intervention.Further advancing the de-dollarization agenda, Mexico has also contemplated joining BRICS. It is BRICS countries that benefit from the development, while corporations such as Google in the United States disregard global market shifts in favor of profits and inexpensive labor.Alphabet planned job cuts stay the courseSince early last year, when it announced intentions to eliminate approximately 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its workforce, due to a decline in the online advertising market, Alphabet has been reducing its headcount. Despite the recent recovery in digital advertising, Alphabet has continued its reduction efforts this year by laying off employees from several organizations.Midway through April, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat stated that the organization’s finance department would be restructured, including the relocation of positions to Bangalore and Mexico City and the implementation of redundancies. At an all-hands meeting in March, the organization’s search chief, Prabhakar Raghavan, informed staff that Google intends to construct teams in key markets, such as India and Brazil, where labor is more affordable than in the United States, in closer proximity to users.The most recent reductions have been implemented in conjunction with improving profit margins and the company’s highest growth rate since early 2022. Alphabet posted its first-quarter revenue increase by 15% year-over-year and declared its inaugural dividend in addition to a $70 billion buyback, all within the past week.The reorganization teams have played a crucial role in the development of Google’s developer tools. The area in question is undergoing optimization in preparation for the increased integration of artificial intelligence into its products. Google unveiled a significant redesign of its chatbot, Gemini, in February, which matched the name of the suite of AI models that operate it (Bard to Gemini).Google I/O, the company’s yearly developer conference, is approaching on May 14. During this event, Alphabet customarily unveils developer products and tools that have been in development since the last year.

5 things to keep in mind as crypto responds to the US Jobs data

Unlike the historic weekend crypto negative sentiments, the crypto markets have started to recover into the weekend. Earlier in the week, Bitcoin tanked below $60K for the first time in a month.

Fed Chair Powell expressed concern about the lack of progress in achieving the 2% inflation target.The cautionary note bolstered waning investor expectations of several interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve in 2024. Nevertheless, the Fed Chair dampened speculation regarding a potential Fed interest rate hike.On Friday (May 3), the US Jobs Report sparked increased interest in riskier assets among buyers. The overall crypto market cap experienced a significant rally of 5.35%, effectively overturning the previous day’s loss of 4.95% on Wednesday (May 1).MicroStrategy and Coinbase carry the weekMicroStrategy (MSTR) released its earnings results on Monday (April 29), which resulted in a decline in the share price for the week.

Fox’s status as an expert or summary witness, as well as whether the Fox Declaration introduced new evidence, must be determined by the court.Ripple has contended that the SEC was unable to depose her because her identity and testimony were not furnished during the discovery. Andrea Fox, according to the SEC, was a summary witness who failed to disclose any new information.

When Bitcoin falls, BTC miners suffer - Post-halving's chronicles

Bitcoin halving came and went. Did it meet the crypto market expectations? Sure as hell, no!! The Bitcoin price soared to the moon as promised. Are you joking? Of course, NO!! Who is left to suffer? BTC miners and the suffering is to no end. Why? These miners put in all they had to mine the blocs as designed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Some argue that BlackRock is the very entity holding the industry together.Bitcoin miners suffer, and a big oneThe recent halving event did not meet the expectations of many investors, as the price of Bitcoin experienced a 3.4% decline over the past seven days as of 2:30 p.m. ET. The industry narrowly avoided a more severe collapse thanks to a 4.7% recovery in the last 24 hours.Based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Riot Platforms experienced a decline of 13.8% over the course of the week. Marathon Digital also saw a decrease of 11.8%, while Cleanspark experienced a larger drop of 16.2%. At the time of writing, the stocks have experienced significant declines of 12.5%, 10.1%, and 15.2%, respectively.This week’s major news included an inflation report that exceeded expectations and the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates on Thursday. The Fed has expressed concerns about the possibility of inflation resurfacing. And with rates staying elevated, that could potentially dampen economic activity and limit the available funds for individuals to invest in non-essential or high-risk assets such as Bitcoin.There is a decrease in optimism regarding the influence of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Bitcoin market due to lackluster demand for launches in Hong Kong and a significant slowdown in U.S. fund flows.Miners are bearing the brunt of this week’s move for a few reasons. Similar to a quantitative analyst, companies rely on BTC to generate revenue. Therefore, a rise in price is beneficial for business, while a fall in price leads to a decrease in revenue and margins.Another significant factor is the presence of Bitcoin on these companies’ balance sheets, amplifying the effect. It can be quite advantageous when Bitcoin is on the rise, but it has a significant impact when it experiences a drop.Following the halving event, the decrease in the mining reward for Bitcoin has prompted speculation among investors about a potential surge in the price. However, Bitcoin miners may experience margin pressure if that scenario fails to materialize.Understanding BTC mining – Where do miners go from hereHistorical data indicates that in bullish market conditions, BTC miners consistently generate higher returns compared to the crypto itself. However, in recent months, Bitcoin miners have faced significant challenges due to the increasing popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs among investors. Adding to the challenge, BTC recently experienced its fourth halving, which reduced the block reward given to miners by half, significantly impacting their primary income stream.Miners are currently grappling with the daunting task of staying afloat and maintaining their stock prices, unless there is a substantial price surge. Investing in this industry can be quite challenging, as history has demonstrated that halving typically occurs before significant increases in BTC’s price, often causing mining stocks to rise as well. It will be important to monitor in the future whether these companies can generate profits with only half of the Bitcoin reward. Expect an increase in costs, which will likely result in a decrease in margins. However, a potential positive scenario suggests that the remaining players in the market could potentially gain a larger market share and experience advantages from the upward trend in Bitcoin prices.If BTC fails to increase in value in the near future, there is a concern that miners will face more challenges in the financial landscape. They will experience an additional financial burden due to the rising electricity costs and the impact of BTC’s price and the halving.

'Wild swing': Jack Dorsey's company stock erases staggering gains on Friday


Block Inc. (NYSE: SQ), Square’s and Cash App’s parent company, opened May 4 with staggering gains following a positive earnings report. However, Jack Dorsey’s company stock retraced its gains as the day went on, closing the Friday with 10% losses.
Remarkably, Block Inc. shares closed May 3 at $70.30 but jumped 8.81% on Thursday’s extended session. Thus, SQ opened Friday trading at $76.49, gaining the stock market‘s spotlight with positive Wall Street forecasts.
Yet, further development suggests it was a bull trap, as the stock retraced on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). By the end of the day, SQ was trading at $69.47 per share, losing nearly 10% on May 4.


Block In.c (NYSE: SQ) daily price chart. Source: TradingView
In a post on X, Gurgavin Chandhoke, CEO of uINVST and stock market commentator, described this as a “wild swing.” This highly volatile price action happened after Jack Dorsey’s company reported positive results for the first quarter of 2024.

Block Q1 2024 earning report
Overall, Block Inc. surpassed expectations in the first quarter of 2024, achieving a gross profit of $2.09 billion. The company’s main business segments, Cash App and Square, demonstrated strong growth and exceeded analysts’ projections. Cash App’s gross profit rose 25% to $1.26 billion, while Square’s increased 19% to $820 million.
The Cash App saw a 6% increase in monthly transacting active users, reaching 57 million. Inflows per transacting active user also grew by 11% to $1,255, reflecting healthy trends in customer engagement. Block focused on enhancing Square’s product portfolio, particularly in the food-and-beverage vertical, and simplifying merchant onboarding.
Despite noting moderating same-store-sales growth for U.S. customers, Block remains watchful of broader trends. The company’s adjusted EBITDA reached $705 million, surpassing analysts’ expectations, partly due to discipline and efficiency in expense management.
Block raised its full-year outlook, anticipating $8.78 billion in gross profit and $2.76 billion in adjusted EBITDA. For the second quarter, the company expects gross profit between $2.165 billion and $2.185 billion and adjusted EBITDA ranging from $670 million to $690 million. The improved outlook reflects Block’s outperformance in Q1 and increased expectations for the remainder of the year.
Wall Street analysis on Jack Dorsey’s company stock: SQ
Analysts maintained positive ratings on Block, with many citing the company’s solid performance and cost discipline. 
In particular, JP Morgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang maintained an Overweight rating and a price target of $90 per share for SQ. Other Wall Street forecasts reported on TradingView range from $92 to $106 per share despite Friday’s negative closing.
Nevertheless, JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone took a more cautious position, highlighting the importance of further data and positive developments.

“While we acknowledge Cash’s progress in winning deposits, we look for greater confirmation in the sustainability of these before we become more positive.”
– Andrew Boone

This cautious stance is valuable, considering Federal prosecutors are examining Jack Dorsey’s company due to allegedly processing crypto transactions for terrorist groups and nations subject to economic sanctions, as reported by NBC News on May 1.

Grayscale ETF Records First Day of Inflows Ever


The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets, experienced a net inflow of new money from investors for the first time since its debut in January, according to Farside Investors. On Friday, May 2, a net $63 million was added to the trust. GBTC has long been a popular financial instrument for investing in Bitcoin (BTC) without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency. However, it faced increased competition in January when it was converted into an easier-to-trade ETF, coinciding with the launch of nine rival spot Bitcoin ETFs.Due to its relatively higher fees, investors withdrew billions of dollars from GBTC, resulting in a streak of 78 consecutive days of outflows that ended last Friday.Currently, GBTC holds $18.1 billion in assets, while IBIT, which now ranks second, started from zero in January and currently holds $16.9 billion. GBTC's assets have declined from over $26 billion previously.Perfect Friday for Bitcoin ETFsAccording to SoSoValue, the Bitcoin spot ETF experienced a total net inflow of $378 million on May 3, marking the first net inflow after seven consecutive days of net outflows. Additionally, the Grayscale ETF GBTC saw a rare single-day inflow of $63.0112 million.Source: SoSoValueIn Hong Kong, the total net assets of the three Bitcoin spot ETFs amount to approximately $250 million, with holdings of approximately 4,225 BTC. Similarly, the total net assets of the three Ethereum spot ETFs in Hong Kong are approximately $48.52 million, with holdings of approximately 16,000 ETH.Bulls return?BTC ETF flows By May 2, every ETF recorded outflows for the first time, totaling $563.7 million — the largest losses since trading began in January. This decline has persisted for nearly two months, with funds experiencing approximately $6 billion in losses over the past four weeks, representing a 20% drop in assets under management.

What are tokenized commodities?

                            Tokenized commodities, explained                                        Tokenized commodities, which include energy resources, agricultural products, precious metals and other tangible things, are digital representations of real-world assets. These assets go through a process known as “tokenization,” in which their ownership rights are converted into blockchain-based cryptographic tokens. Partially owned and accessible, each token usually represents a portion or entirety of the underlying commodity.Tokenization offers efficiency, divisibility and liquidity, transforming the asset ownership structure. An example of this would be the tokenization of a $10,000 gold bar into 10,000 tokens, which would allow investors to transact smaller units easily without the logistical burden of physical storage of gold or delivery.                                                                    How do tokenized commodities work?                                        Tokenized commodities are created through tokenization, with tokens issued on a blockchain network, followed by secure storage, decentralized trading facilitated by smart contracts and, finally, redemption facilitated by issuers or smart contracts.Step 1: IssuanceTokenized commodities are created by dividing the ownership rights of actual assets into digital tokens, a process known as tokenization. In this process, tokens are issued on a blockchain network, frequently with the help of exchanges or specialized tokenization platforms.Step 2: Storage and custodyCustodianship of the underlying assets assumes paramount importance in tokenized commodities. Custodial services or smart contracts ensure the secure storage and management of physical assets, assuring tokenholders of asset authenticity and security.Step 3: TradingOnce commodities are tokenized, they become prime assets for decentralized exchange (DEX) or peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. Blockchain technology promotes global liquidity and accessibility by facilitating efficient and transparent trading. Smart contracts are essential to ensure seamless transactions while upholding security and trust.Step 4: RedemptionTokenholders are still able to exchange them for the underlying physical good. Issuers or smart contracts facilitate this redemption procedure, which preserves transparency while giving investors the freedom to transform their digital assets into tangible products.                                                                    Types of tokenized commodities                                        Precious metals, energy resources, agricultural products and real estate are examples of commodities that can be tokenized using blockchain technology.Precious metalsPrecious metals such as gold, silver and platinum can be tokenized because they allow investors to have fractional ownership without the inconveniences of physical storage. Precious metals that have been tokenized make these priceless assets more accessible, encouraging hedging and portfolio diversification.Energy resourcesOil, natural gas and renewable energy certificates are examples of tokenized energy resources that give investors exposure to the energy market’s volatility. Tokenization removes logistical barriers to investment opportunities in the global energy sector.Agricultural productsTokenized agricultural commodities such as soybeans, corn, wheat and coffee enhance investor portfolio diversification by providing exposure to the agriculture sector. Agricultural products that have been tokenized utilize the efficiency and accessibility of blockchain technology to act as tools for diversification and a hedge against inflation.Real estateFractional ownership and liquidity in the real estate market are made possible by tokenized real estate, which redefines property ownership. With little initial outlay, investors can acquire profitable real estate assets, promoting a more diverse range of investing opportunities.                                                                    What are commodity-backed cryptocurrencies?                                        A type of digital asset called commodity-backed cryptocurrencies is intended to provide greater stability than conventional cryptocurrencies. They accomplish this by pegging their value to a tangible good such as gold, oil or real estate. The physical commodity is held by a business or organization, which also releases tokens denoting a specific amount of that commodity.The token’s value varies in tandem with the price of the underlying commodity. With the help of these cryptocurrencies, investors may combine the convenience of digital assets with the traditional commodities market. Examples include Tether Gold (XAUT) and Paxos Gold (PAXG), both backed by physical gold, or OilCoin (OIL), backed by oil reserves.However, be aware that they frequently entail some degree of centralization and that you should always investigate the security and issuer of the actual asset that underpins the cryptocurrency.                                                                    Advantages of tokenized commodities                                        Within blockchain ecosystems, tokenized commodities provide a number of advantages by utilizing the built-in capabilities of distributed ledger technology and revolutionizing conventional commodity trading.Fractionalizing commodities into digital tokens improves liquidity by allowing investors to buy smaller units, which expands the market for available investment options. Additionally, because of this fractional ownership, trading and transferability are made simpler, which lowers entry barriers and boosts market efficiency.Tokenization records ownership and transaction history on an immutable blockchain, increasing transparency and lowering the risk of fraud. Market participants’ trust is increased because every transaction is transparently audited and safely recorded. The possibility of fake products is also reduced by this transparency because every token is uniquely identified and validated on the blockchain.Real-time settlement is made possible by tokenized commodities, eliminating the need for intermediaries and lowering transaction costs and turnaround times. Smart contracts simplify the settlement process and lower counterparty risk by being programmed to automatically execute trades upon fulfilling predetermined circumstances. Furthermore, tokenization makes commodity markets more inclusive and accessible by enabling investors (who were previously unable to participate in traditional markets because of financial or geographical limitations) to engage in trading activities around the clock from any location in the world as long as they have access to the internet.                                                                    Challenges associated with tokenized commodities                                        Blockchain technology has made tokenized commodities possible, but to reach their full potential in commodity markets, various issues need to be resolved. Since tokenized commodities are frequently real assets, they are governed by the same legal frameworks that apply to securities, commodities trade and financial markets. To ensure adherence to these standards, one must navigate intricate legal environments and put strong governance frameworks in place to reduce the risk of fraud, market manipulation and regulatory infractions.There are many obstacles, including liquidity and market depth. Although tokenization can potentially improve liquidity by allowing for round-the-clock trading and fractionalizing ownership, there is still a barrier to building up enough market depth to handle large-scale transactions. Liquidity and price discovery in tokenized commodity markets are contingent upon establishing trust between institutional investors and traditional market players.Standardization and interoperability are necessary for a smooth integration with the current financial infrastructure. Efficient transaction settlement and asset transfer are made possible by interoperability, which makes it possible for token standards, smart contracts and data formats to be compatible across various blockchain platforms and commodities markets.Additionally, because blockchain technology is decentralized and unchangeable, cybersecurity threats are increased in tokenized commodity markets. Strong cybersecurity procedures, such as encryption, two-factor authentication (2FA) and ongoing monitoring, are necessary to protect digital assets, private keys and sensitive transaction data against theft, hacking and exploitation.

BREAKING: A Data Breach Allegedly Occurred on Bitfinex - 2.5 TB of Data and 400 Thousand Users' Data Allegedly Leaked - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to data claimed by Shinoji Research, there was a data breach on the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and the data of 400 thousand users along with 2.5 terabytes of data may have been stolen.
The information has not yet been confirmed by the exchange and users have to wait for the official announcement.


According to Shinoji Research, the FSociety ransomware group, known for its malicious activities, claimed responsibility for the attack. They loaded a page with two mega links to their Onion site. These links lead to a text file containing a partial dump of usernames and plaintext passwords.
Shinoji Research said that the review found that the list did not contain any known accounts belonging to trading firms such as Alameda Research. However, the sheer size of the data indicates that hackers have been able to access every KYC document since Bitfinex's inception.





The hackers issued a warning stating that they would leak the KYC documents of all users if their demands were not met.
In a surprising development, a follower of Shinoji Research tried one of the passwords in the file and received a 2-factor authentication (2FA) warning. This situation was later confirmed by Shinoji Research, confirming the reality of the violation. Bitfinex has not yet responded to these allegations.


However, these are all claims by Shinoji Research and an official statement from Bitfinex should be awaited.

Biggest Video Games Releasing in May 2024 - Decrypt

With so many games coming out across so many platforms, it can be tough to sort through them all. This month's gaming menu offers up something for just about everyone: demanding strategy, intense action, horror, and family-friendly games appear on PC, consoles, and handheld systems.If you want something that will last you hundreds of hours or just an afternoon, then this list has those, too. This list even includes three games that fans have been waiting on for well over a decade. Here's what you can look forward to this month as you look for something new to play.Animal WellRelease Date: May 9Platforms: PC (Steam), PS5, Nintendo SwitchThis is the first game published by YouTuber Jason "Dunkey" Gastrow's studio Bigmode Games, and the buzz has been consistent since the first previews hit. Animal Well features visuals inspired by old-school games and platforming action that promises to match up alongside games like Celeste and Super Meat Boy. Animal Well is full of puzzles, secrets, and demanding platforming.Homeworld 3Release Date: May 13Platforms: PC (Steam, Epic Games Store)Dragon's Dogma 2 fans thought they’d been waiting a long time when the 2012 game finally got a sequel earlier this year—but they don't have anything on fans of this upcoming real-time strategy game. Homeworld 2 released in September 2003, just over two decades ago. Like its predecessor, Homeworld 3 is a real-time strategy game set in space and has players managing their fleet in three dimensions as they battle The Anomaly, a new threat from the outer edges of space.Senua's Saga: Hellblade IIRelease Date: May 21Platforms: PC (Steam, Windows Store, Game Pass), Xbox Series X|SAction studio Ninja Theory's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice garnered praise for both its action and its approach to its main character Senua's mental illness, which figured heavily into her story and the player's experience. Senua's Saga: Hellblade II was one of the very first games announced for the Xbox Series consoles and is a graphical showpiece for the systems. This new chapter takes Senua to Viking Iceland in the 10th Century, where Senua will battle both Vikings and her own mind to save "those who have fallen victim to tyranny."Duck Detective: The Secret SalamiRelease Date: May 23Platforms: PC (Steam), Nintendo SwitchWhile some games on this list could take up dozens and dozens of hours, sometimes you just want a fun game to last an afternoon or two. Duck Detective: The Secret Salami promises about 2-3 hours of silly, adorable mystery as you interview suspects and put clues together to solve the case. Duck Detective has bright, bold art and is fully voiced, promising an entertaining few hours when it hits later this month.Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year DoorRelease Date: May 23Platforms: Nintendo SwitchSometimes the best games are the ones we know and love. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door released for the Nintendo GameCube back in 2004, and even now it's still a beloved entry in both the Paper Mario series and the greater collection of Mario games. This remastered edition promises to bring the original to the Nintendo Switch, updating the visuals and music. The gameplay will reportedly run at 30 frames per second as opposed to the original's 60, but we're hopeful the change won't affect the classic gameplay too much.World of Goo 2Release Date: May 23Platforms: PC & Mac (Epic Games Store), Nintendo Switch, LinuxWorld of Goo is still a fan favorite over 15 years later, thanks to its goofy, oily art style and engaging physics puzzles. The original World of Goo used little googly-eyed balls of goo to create lovingly engineered structures that probably aren't up to anyone's version of code. This new entry promises updated visuals and many more puzzles.Honorable MentionsThere are too many games hitting digital shelves this month to cover them all. If none of these games strike your fancy, then you might want to check out the religious horror game Indika, the survival horror game Crow Country, the full public release of vampire-themed action RPG V Rising, the aquatic exploration game Endless Ocean Luminous, or the variety of other re-releases including the upcoming console release of the System Shock remake, Braid Anniversary Edition, and the PC version of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut.Edited by Andrew HaywardEditor's note: These are all "Web2" or traditional video games with no expected crypto or blockchain elements.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Charles Hoskinson Refutes Michael Saylor's Cardano Claims


As in every criticism made by the crypto community towards Cardano, its founder, Charles Hoskinson, came to its defense. This time, he defended ADA from Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy.
MicroStrategy’s executive president believes that Bitcoin “will be the only institutional asset in the world” and that there will be no other, which he described as “securities.”
Charles Hoskinson Refutes Saylor’s Claims
Michael Saylor opined that BNB, Solana, Cardano, and Ripple will never have spot exchange-traded funds and that large Wall Street banks will never accept them. He even bet that these altcoins will be classified as “securities” by this summer.

“When Ethereum [ETF] is not approved sometime this summer, it will be very clear to everyone that Ethereum is considered a security, not a commodity, after that, BNB, Solana, Ripple and Cardano will be considered securities this summer. They will never be wrapped up in a spot ETF. None of them will be accepted by Wall Street. Bitcoin is the only institutional asset,” Saylor said.

As a result, Charles Hoskinson criticized the stance of MicroStrategy’s CEO. He suggested Saylor is a traditional “Bitcoin maxi” who views all cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin as scams.

“Bitcoiners: ‘Why is Charles attacking Bitcoin? Altcoiners are so Toxic.’ Bitcoin Maxis: ‘Literally everything but Bitcoin is illegal and a scam,'” Hoskinson wrote.

Kadan Stadelmann, CTO at Komodo, agreed with Hoskinson’s stance. He told BeInCrypto that Saylor’s Bitcoin maximalism does shine through most when he notes that most other cryptos are essentially securities. Especially because it is “really easy” to create securities but very difficult to create a commodity, which Satoshi Nakamoto did in Bitcoin.
Moreover, Stadelmann added that nobody knows what the future holds. But it is important to recognize that major companies like BlackRock and FIdelity have done due diligence and applied to roll out spot Ethereum ETFs to the market. If the SEC rejects these applications, the companies could sue the regulatory agency because similar products in the futures markets have been approved.


“Bitcoin is far more established than altcoins. Big companies have conducted a thorough review of Bitcoin – not other crypto assets – and it took them a very long time to do so. However, many people have not heard about Cardno or Ripple, and many know nothing about Ethereum. The unclear regulatory guidelines – due to US Congress’ failure to act – makes the future of Ethereum and other altcoins ETFs uncertain. Without a clear framework an entire industry has been left waiting for clarity,” Stadelmann told BeInCrypto.

It is worth noting that Cardano is on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) list of securities, along with tokens such as Solana, Polygon, Cosmos, Sandbox, Decentraland, and Algorand, among others.

MakerDAO Prepares Launch of Upgraded DAI Stablecoin and Gov Token


							

MakerDAO announces NewStable and NewGovToken to improve stability and governance.



Token holders can easily upgrade from DAI to NST and MKR to NGT, with a 24,000:1 redenomination for NGT.



The launch includes farming opportunities for NST holders, excluding U.S. residents and VPN users.




MakerDAO, the pioneering Ethereum-based protocol known for its DAI stablecoin, is gearing up for a significant evolution in its ecosystem. As anticipation builds for the upcoming launch season, the protocol has announced the introduction of two new tokens. Specifically, MakerDAO is introducing NewStable and NewGovToken to enhance the platform’s stability and governance.







Notably, the proposed new tokens are part of Maker’s broader strategy to foster adoption and participation. NewStable, codenamed NST, is an upgraded version of DAI that promises to offer improved stability features. The official name will be disclosed during the eagerly awaited brand reveal.



In parallel, NewGovToken (NGT) is being introduced as a sophisticated governance token to incentivize greater community involvement. The final name for NGT will also be announced in the upcoming launch season.



After launch, DAI holders can upgrade to NST, with the added benefit of being able to revert to DAI if they wish. Similarly, Maker token (MKR) holders can convert their tokens into NGT at 24,000 NGT per MKR.



According to the team, these new tokens are not intended to replace the current DAI and MKR tokens. Instead, they seek to expand the ecosystem’s offerings. Users will have the flexibility to choose between the existing and new tokens.









Key functionalities of the coming NewStable include the ability for new and existing users to engage in farming to earn NGT from launch. Six hundred million NGT is distributed annually to NST holders participating in farming. However, this farming feature will not be available to U.S. residents or those using VPNs.



For NewGovToken, the redenomination to 24,000 NGT per MKR is a strategic move to encourage broader participation in governance. The upgrade process is reversible.



Ultimately, MakerDAO is introducing new features and opportunities, including Farming products and the Lockstake Engine, to boost user engagement and attract new and existing users to the Maker ecosystem.

Trader Updates Outlook on Altcoin That’s Exploded Over 900% Year-to-Date, Maps Path Forward for Solana Rival Sui - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist is updating his outlook on one red-hot altcoin amid a crypto market correction.
Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 215,800 followers on the social media platform X that he is long-term bullish on Ondo Finance (ONDO), a project focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs).










“ONDO: still one of the best-performing coins and has held up the best. Still also the leader in RWA right now. I think that this looks strong. Not a great active trade though. Better to just buy and hold for now.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
ONDO is trading for $0.839 at time of writing, up more than 920% from its low of $0.082 this year on January 18th.
Next up, the trader predicts that layer-1 smart contract platform Sui (SUI) will turn bearish due to an upcoming token unlock. The next unlock for SUI is in late May when the crypto project plans to distribute 999.23 million tokens among five stakeholders.
Unlocks are often perceived as bearish given the new sellable supply.
Says Altcoin Sherpa,
“Doesn’t matter how good/strong a coin is from a tech perspective. SUI will nuke to Hades once investors start getting their tokens. This thing will have exit pumps though so you can probably buy green box, wait for it to mini-pump, then short it.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
SUI is trading for $1.11 at time of writing, down more than 2% in the last 24 hours.

Google Cloud Unveils Web3 Portal for Blockchain Developers Amidst Mixed Industry Reception



                    

Google Cloud has recently unveiled a Web3 portal tailored for blockchain developers, offering an array of resources ranging from datasets to tutorials on crafting nonfungible tokens (NFT). 



Despite this move, the response from the cryptocurrency sphere has been a blend of enthusiasm and skepticism.




Unchained’s vice president of product marketing, Phil Geiger, expressed concern over the absence of native Bitcoin and lightning support, deeming it a crucial oversight. 



In a post on X dated April 25, Geiger remarked, “No native Bitcoin and lightning support? Seems like an oversight to ignore the most important cryptocurrency.”



Similarly, a pseudonymous crypto trader, MartyParty, conveyed disappointment to his 80,700 X followers on April 26, asserting, “Not impressed Google is way behind.”



Contrastingly, some embraced the launch with optimism. 



Ivaibi Festo, founder of Mitroplus labs, hailed the Web3 portal as a “comprehensive resource” in a post on X dated April 25.



The portal offers developers access to various products and provides testnet tokens for deploying and testing decentralized applications on Ethereum testnets Sepolia and Holesky. 



Additionally, it hosts a learning program featuring tutorials on NFT development, Web3 loyalty program implementation, and securing digital assets through multi-party computation.

This initiative follows Google’s recent strides in the Web3 realm. 




Notably, Google enhanced its capabilities to enable users to search wallet balances across multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, and Fantom.



Moreover, Google revised its advertising policies at the outset of 2024, permitting certain crypto products to be promoted on major search engines, encompassing Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. 



Preceding the portal’s launch this year, Google focused on forging partnerships to fortify its position in the Web3 landscape.



In October 2023, Google Cloud’s BigQuery data warehouse integrated with MultiversX, facilitating valuable insights for Web3 projects and users through advanced data analytics and AI tools. 



In September 2023, Google’s BigQuery expanded its data warehouse to include 11 blockchain networks, encompassing Avalanche, Arbitrum, Cronos, Ethereum’s Görli testnet, Fantom, Near, Optimism, Polkadot, Polygon’s mainnet, Polygon’s Mumbai testnet, and Tron.

Here's why you should closely watch these 2 cryptocurrencies


The overall cryptocurrency market is experiencing sustained short-term buying pressure, with most digital assets endeavoring to recover from recent losses. While Bitcoin (BTC) garners much attention as it aims to reclaim the $65,000 resistance, altcoins are also attracting significant interest.
In light of this, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies worthy of monitoring. These cryptocurrencies are notably influenced by significant on-chain developments and metrics, which will likely impact their prices amid the prevailing bullish sentiments.
Solana (SOL)
Following the ongoing rally, Solana (SOL) aims to surpass the crucial $150 resistance zone, which is pivotal in achieving another record-high price. Undoubtedly, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform continues to be the activity center.


It’s worth noting that Solana previously experienced a rally, fueled in part by the growing interest in meme coins launched on the platform. Currently, meme coins are gaining attention again, making Solana a noteworthy asset to watch.
To recap, meme coins on Solana, including Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK), gained prominence as they sought to compete with established players like Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, the spotlight on dog-themed meme coins appears to wane, with a new class of themed around cats emerging. Recent activity surrounding cat-themed tokens has contributed to the SOL price spike.
For instance, Solana-based Popcat (POPCAT) experienced double-digit gains on May 2, skyrocketing by over fivefold in just two weeks. It will be intriguing to observe whether more cat-themed tokens can replicate the performance of their dog-themed counterparts and potentially influence the value of SOL.
Furthermore, the Solana network has seen a notable increase in its locked value, reaching $4.013 billion at the time of writing, according to DefiLlama data. This figure marks a growth of over 160% in 2024.

The escalating TVL indicates expanding user engagement and confidence in the platform and heightened liquidity and trading volume within the protocol. 
By press time, Solana was trading at $147, gaining almost 4% in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, SOL has been up over 7%.

Shiba Inu (SHIB)
In the short term, Shiba Inu stands out among cryptocurrencies with notable gains, surging by over 10% in the last 24 hours. Beyond the overall bullish sentiment in the market, SHIB appears to benefit from factors such as increased trading activity, token burns, and ongoing network developments.
Of particular interest is the network development, which could be the main driver behind SHIB’s price movements. Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution, Shibarium, underwent a successful hard fork. This upgrade addresses user concerns regarding network usability and transaction efficiency, which are crucial factors supporting SHIB’s price growth.
The development seeks to promote faster transaction speeds by reducing processing times on the Shibarium network. Additionally, it introduces a system for predictable gas fees, making transactions more cost-effective. Security is also prioritized, with enhancements implemented to safeguard user assets and bolster network security.
Furthermore, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted technical indicators suggesting that SHIB was forming a bull flag, indicating a potential bullish breakout. Martinez suggested that the formation could propel SHIB to $0.000072323, representing a growth of almost 180%.

As of the latest update, SHIB is valued at $0.000026, having rallied almost 6% in the last seven days.

In summary, it’s worth noting that besides the underlying fundamentals, the two cryptocurrencies will likely be influenced by the overall market sentiment.

It said that 28,000 addresses were created on May 2 alone, a 102% increase from the monthly low set on Monday. On-chain data also highlights the growth in non-empty addresses for Dogecoin. Santiment, an on-chain analytics startup, revealed a 27% increase in Dogecoin non-empty wallets over the last six months, totaling 6.6 million wallets.This spike in non-empty wallets could indicate renewed interest and engagement in the Dogecoin community.Dogecoin's price has risen by 13% in the previous 24 hours as a result of increasing demand and favorable sentiment towards the cryptocurrency. This price surge demonstrates the impact of network growth on the value of Dogecoin, as increased adoption is frequently correlated with upward price momentum.The Dogecoin price increase coincides with the general crypto market comeback following the release of weaker-than-expected job data. Cryptocurrencies rebounded on Friday, headed by Bitcoin's (BTC) rise, raising expectations that the worst of the fall may be over.The U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, falling short of the expert estimate of 245,000 and the previous month's 315,000 increase. The latest Nonfarm Payrolls data also showed that the jobless rate increased to 3.9% from 3.8% in March.Dogecoin posted a sharp rise consequently, extending its recovery from its May 1 lows of $0.1198. At the time of writing, Dogecoin still sustained gains, up 13% in the last 24 hours to $0.15. If today closes in the green, Dogecoin will mark its third consecutive day of gains.

Gaming needs tokenization - Blockworks


Imagine spending countless hours upgrading your race car in your favorite game, fine-tuning every detail and unlocking new features as you play to make it both beautiful and blazingly fast…only to lose it forever when you stop playing the game. 
What if you could truly own and monetize your in-game creations? Enter the world of tokenized user-generated content (UGC).
Throughout history, humans have prized self-expression and individuality. And in the gaming sphere, this desire has reached new heights with the rise of UGC. Games like Roblox and Minecraft — which average hundreds of millions of players monthly — have revolutionized the industry by empowering players to create worlds, characters, and experiences.
Yet, one key aspect is missing in the majority of these types of games: true ownership. 
While players can create and share content, they have little control over how it’s used or monetized. They spend hours making worlds and upgrading in-game items that add massive value for a studio, driving player retention and enjoyment, without benefiting from the rewards. 
Think about it. The average Fortnite player spends a whopping ten hours a week playing, and some of the most popular builds in the game are player-created. Epic Games (its creator) is directly benefiting from the time these players put into playing and building in the game.
How can we address this challenge and empower players with real ownership and fairer rewards for their creations? 
Tokenization offers a transformative solution.
By representing in-game assets as unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain, players can assert ownership rights and track their creations’ provenance securely. Smart contracts can automate royalty payments, ensuring fair compensation for player contributions. 
To demonstrate this further, imagine if my daughter’s Lego car creation was tokenized. By creating a digital token or NFT of the car, she can formally certify it as her own and earn rewards when it’s traded. She could even receive royalties if someone used her car in their own game. Tokenization makes this possible in the digital realm.
The billion-dollar opportunity
Deloitte predicts that UGC gaming platforms will pay out nearly $1.5 billion to content developers in 2024. But to realize tokenized UGC’s full potential, we must address negative perceptions surrounding blockchain technology in gaming.
To begin, we need to address the user experience issue. Many early blockchain games suffered from clunky interfaces, complicated wallet setups and a lack of intuitive design. Layer this with exploitative microtransactions (think Axie Infinity), and it’s no surprise mainstream gamers were left wary. 
Imagine a gamer having to manually manage private keys or decipher cryptographic hash functions just to play. That’s a surefire way to deter adoption. 
Instead, the focus should be on creating immersive worlds where the blockchain functions invisibly in the background, enabling ownership and monetization without compromising the gaming experience.
The NFT market has also been prone to wild speculation, with some assets selling for eye-popping sums while others go to zero. While this has generated buzz, it has also led to concerns about market stability and the potential for bubble-like behavior. 
For tokenized UGC to gain mainstream acceptance, it’s crucial to foster a more stable, sustainable market driven by the inherent utility and value of the assets rather than mere speculation. This means designing in-game economies with balanced incentives, sinks and faucets to ensure long-term viability. By shifting the focus from speculation to utility, we can build trust and stability in the market.
Read more from our opinion section: Memecoin mania can teach us something
As more games embrace tokenized UGC, blockchain networks will need to handle a massive influx of transactions. If the infrastructure can’t scale to meet demand, we risk congestion, high fees and a degraded gaming experience. 
We want to avoid another Crypto Kitties-style Ethereum network breakdown. To prevent this, developers must choose scalable blockchain architectures that can grow with their player base. This may involve using layer-1 solutions that can bridgelessly connect to other blockchains, sharding or other techniques to increase throughput without sacrificing decentralization or security. It’s also crucial to optimize smart contracts and game logic to minimize unnecessary transactions and reduce the load on the network. 
One of the most important prospects of tokenized gaming is the ability for a users’ in-game assets to move seamlessly between different game worlds. Imagine being able to take your hard-earned sword from one game and use it in another, or having your spaceship navigate through various universes. This level of interoperability would unlock incredible possibilities for player expression and engagement.
The road to mainstream adoption
Achieving this vision requires overcoming significant technical and coordination challenges. Different games may use different blockchain networks, token standards and data models. Bridging these gaps requires robust cross-chain communication protocols and standardized metadata formats.
It will take a concerted effort from developers, players and the wider blockchain community. But if we get it right, the future of gaming will be a more open, collaborative and rewarding space for all.
And we’re on the right track. Over the past two decades, the UGC gaming landscape has undergone rapid transformation, with what once seemed improbable now on the brink of becoming commonplace, thanks to the integration of blockchain technology. 
Tokenization is the catalyst for creating this billion-dollar gamer-driven economy, where players have unprecedented control over their creations. 
The ownership revolution is here; it’s up to us to seize it.

Optimism's Superchain is a $6 billion hit - What does that mean for OP? - AMBCrypto



Optimism Superchain collected massive amounts of revenue for the protocol over the last few weeks
Despite the protocol’s performance, interest in the OP token tanked

Despite the growing competition in the Layer 2 sector, Optimism[OP] has continued to exhibit growth across various fronts.
Super chain brings in the dough
One of the reasons for the same is the Optimism Superchain. Optimism Superchain recently become a magnet for capital, attracting over $6 billion in deposits from Ethereum L1. This surge in popularity can be further underlined by the fact that assets bridged to the Superchain account for a significant portion – 25%, of the total value locked (TVL) bridged from Ethereum L1.
For context, the Optimism Superchain is like a collection of L2s. It bundles multiple L2s together, both technologically and economically. This combined approach offers several advantages, including streamlined operations and potential cost efficiencies.
As an incentive for participating in the Superchain, Optimism furnishes developers with access to a valuable toolkit, the OP Stack & Governance framework. This common set of tools simplifies development and streamlines governance processes for L2s within the Superchain.
In April 2024, Base demonstrated its commitment to the Superchain by paying $1.86 million in Superchain membership fees to Optimism. This financial contribution helps to ensure the ongoing development and maintenance of the Superchain.

However, there were some concerns that arose when it was seen that Base had a higher number of monthly active users than the OP mainnet. In fact, Token Terminal’s data indicated that despite having a higher number of monthly active users, Base doesn’t necessarily undermine OP Mainnet’s position within the Optimism Superchain.
OP Mainnet can retain its role as the Superchain’s Hub by providing a shared governance framework for all member chains. Strong performance by individual member chains, like Base, can be beneficial for the entire ecosystem. This, because high-performing chains contribute more fees back to OP, further supporting the Superchain’s development.
How is OP doing?
Despite Optimism network’s progress, overall interest in the OP token declined. Additionally, the price of OP has fallen by 5.59% in just 24 hours. At press time, OP was trading at $2.96. The volume at which OP was trading also fell by 22.75%.

 Realistic or not, here’s OP market cap in BTC’s terms

Also, network growth around the OP token declined significantly, indicating that the number of new addresses showing interest in OP fell.
If the waning interest from new addresses continues, the price of OP could see a correction in the near future.

Jack Dorsey makes $21m commitment to Bitcoin and open source | Cryptopolitan

Jack Dorsey, the guy behind Twitter, just threw a massive $21 million towards OpenSats. This money is meant for pushing forward with open source and Bitcoin development. As we all know, Dorsey is big on Bitcoin, seeing it as a revolutionary financial instrument. I mean:“Bitcoin changes absolutely everything. I don’t think there is anything more important in my lifetime to work on.“Jack DorseyOpenSats said they got this cash in May 2023. It’s part of Dorsey’s giving nature through his #startsmall thing, which had already put $10 million into their coffers for similar projects, including something called Nostr, which is all about decentralized social media. Money Where It MattersThe breakdown of this $21 million Dorsey donation is pretty strategic: $15 million is going straight into the General Fund, another $5 million is earmarked for The Nostr Fund, and a cool $1 million is for operational costs. This isn’t just throwing money around; it’s about fuelling ongoing and new stuff that makes a difference in the Bitcoin space and the broader arena of tech that lets people do what they want without interference.Recently, Nostr got a huge boost. We’re talking about integrating Bitcoin payments for developers, which has sparked a user surge to 16 million, with 500,000 folks logging in daily. That’s not small potatoes.With all this cash flooding in, OpenSats didn’t just sit on it. They’ve brought in new brains and brawn to their committee and board. Now, there’s a user named @Fiatjaf and another, NVK, who are eyeing future projects. NVK, along with Gigi, is also stepping up on the board. This squad is about creating a space where open-source software can thrive, keeping digital big brother at bay, as OpenSats put it—they’re fighting “digital totalitarianism.”A Look at Past EffortsOpenSats isn’t new to this game. They’ve been backing projects that sync with their mission to beef up the Bitcoin ecosystem and other open-source ventures. Before this latest cash infusion, they had already supported 21 teams, like the Bitcoin Policy Institute and the BTCPay Server, which is a DIY payment processor. They’ve handed out nearly $10 million in grants to over 100 grantees.This time around, Dorsey’s money is also setting aside some for legal defense funds, helping Bitcoin developers who might get into legal scraps over their work. While they’re keeping the details under wraps, it’s clear that Dorsey’s backing isn’t about the money, but rather having the backs of those in the trenches of Bitcoin development.It’s not just Dorsey who’s into OpenSats. The group has been pulling in donations from the public and other philanthropic bodies. The Reynolds Foundation also kicked in $1 million last month. OpenSats is all about getting more folks to chip in, helping push high-impact projects across the tech world.So here’s the deal. Last year, Dorsey already handed over $10 million to OpenSats, and now, with another $21 million, he’s keeping his position as a major player in the movement towards more open, free tech infrastructure.OpenSats has a lot on its plate, but with financial injections like these and a clear focus on impactful projects, they’re set to keep the momentum going. Remember, this is about shaping a future where technology enhances freedom rather than restricts it. Dorsey and OpenSats are on a mission to make sure that future comes to pass, with Bitcoin right in the middle of it.

2 Reasons Why Polygon (MATIC) Could Enter a Bull Rally


Polygon (MATIC) price awaits strong bullish cues that could propel the altcoin out of the consolidation it is currently stuck in.
Given that the altcoin is among the lowest profit-bearing assets, it is likely that investors will push for a price rise to book profits.
Polygon Investors Hint at Accumulation
MATIC price could see a breakout above the $0.74 barrier if only investors act accordingly. As long as these MATIC holders refrain from selling, consolidation could continue, and accumulation could enable an upswing.
This is the likely outcome for MATIC’s price, which is observing a surge in buying pressures. The supply held on the exchanges has seen a 20 million MATIC decline in the last three days. Although compared to other values and market capitalization of the altcoin, this supply is not much, it is a testament to the investors’ sentiment.

In the past, such instances of buying have been followed by short-term price spikes. If MATIC price witnesses the same outcome this time, it could invalidate the consolidation.
MATIC Exchange Supply. Source: Santiment
Less than 34% of the entire circulating supply of MATIC is in profits, which is relatively uncommon. Despite the recent corrections, at least 50% of most of the cryptocurrency supply is in profit.
This suggests that Polygon investors are likely desperate for profits, which could keep them from selling their holdings. Since MATIC has considerable room to grow, it could also witness extended bullishness.

MATIC Price Prediction: Reclaim $0.80 
MATIC price is consolidated between $0.74 and $0.64. This range has been unbroken on both ends for the past three weeks. Since mid-April, the Polygon native token has attempted multiple times to breach the upper limit, acting as resistance. 
Now, the altcoin is close to doing the same this time around. A push from Polygon investors’ accumulation could help MATIC breach $0.74, pushing it towards $0.80. Successfully flipping the resistance of $0.81 would initiate a recovery rally.

On the other hand, if the breach fails, MATIC’s price could remain rangebound and slip back down to $0.64. Losing this support could send the altcoin to $0.60 and lower, invalidating the bullish outlook.

5 Solana Memecoins That Will Skyrocket Over 9,000%, Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Ripple's XRP Can Avoid Another Price Dip Under One Condition


Ripple (XRP) price recovery rally largely depends on the broader crypto market and the investors’ behavior.
However, neither party favors a price rise, which could cause considerable damage to XRP holders.
Ripple Investors Take a Step Back
XRP price attempts to move upward, but by the looks of it, this effort will be thwarted. This is because Ripple is noting bearishness at the hands of its investors, particularly traders.
Bearish bets against XRP have increased in the futures market, which is evident from the funding rate. 

The funding rate in cryptocurrency futures trading is the fee paid or received by traders holding leveraged positions overnight. Market conditions determine it and serve to balance the market between long and short positions. Generally, positive funding rates suggest the dominance of long contracts, whereas negative rates hint at short contracts’ taking the preference. 
XRP is witnessing negative funding rates, which suggests traders are betting on a price decline.

At the same time, the broader market is also exhibiting bearishness, as can be seen in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movement. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in an asset.
Given that XRP is struggling to secure the neutral line at 50 as support, a bearish outcome seems rather likely.

XRP Price Prediction: Another Dip
XRP price trading at $0.51 notes a potential breakout of the symmetrical triangle pattern in effect since early April. 
A symmetrical triangle pattern is a technical analysis formation characterized by converging trendlines. It indicates a period of consolidation before a potential breakout. It typically signifies indecision in the market and can lead to a bullish or bearish move. 
Considering the aforementioned conditions, the chances are that the XRP price could face a bearish move, which could bring it down to $0.47. Falling through this support will extend the losses by a mile toward $0.42.

On the other hand, flipping $0.51 into a support floor can represent a significant milestone. Indeed, it will enable the altcoin to invalidate the bearish thesis and allow the XRP price to eventually secure a 27% rally to hit the target of $0.65, as derived from the triangle pattern.

Michael Saylor warns these popular cryptocurrencies will be deemed securities


Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) and a prominent Bitcoin (BTC) advocate, recently stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to classify major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) as securities, not commodities. He anticipates that this classification will result in the denial of all spot Ethereum ETF applications this summer.
Saylor’s comments extended beyond Ethereum, predicting a similar future for other prominent cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA). This announcement was made during his speech at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference on Thursday.

“Ethereum is deemed to be a crypto asset security, not a commodity. After that, you’re gonna see that Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano, everything down the stack is just crypto-asset securities unregistered”



Michael Saylor on BNB, SOL, and XRP ETFs
His remarks reflect a broader skepticism about the potential for these assets to gain mainstream financial products such as spot ETFs, which are often seen as a bridge to institutional investment. 
“None of these tokens will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” Saylor added.
Contrasting sharply with his views on Ethereum and others, Saylor reaffirmed Bitcoin’s status as the premier cryptocurrency, uniquely recognized as an institutional-grade asset.
According to Saylor, Bitcoin stands as the “one universal” crypto asset that has achieved full institutional acceptance. This distinction highlights the potential for Bitcoin to remain largely unaffected by the regulatory challenges that might beset other cryptocurrencies.
Diminishing prospects for Ethereum ETF
The prospects for an Ethereum ETF are currently bleak, as evidenced by recent developments and expert opinions. 
Justin Sun, the CEO of Tron (TRX), voiced a similar sentiment regarding the challenges ahead for Ethereum’s acceptance by regulators, emphasizing the need for “long-term education with regulators.” 

This aligns with the cautious stance of the SEC, which recently postponed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF to June 11, 2024.
James Seyffart, an analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence, also indicated skepticism, noting that the current batch of Ether ETF applications might ultimately be rejected.
The public comment period initiated by the SEC in April, seeking opinions on proposals from various firms, including Bitwise Ethereum Trust and Fidelity Ethereum Fund, further underscores the regulatory uncertainties surrounding Ethereum.
Despite the prevailing pessimistic outlook, some industry figures like Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, remain optimistic. Fink suggested that an Ethereum ETF might still be feasible even if ETH is classified as a security, with BlackRock actively exploring the possibility of launching such a product.

The forthcoming SEC decision on May 23, which includes considerations for VanEck’s ETF proposal among others, will be crucial in determining the future landscape for Ethereum and potentially setting a precedent for how other cryptocurrencies are perceived and regulated.

Why Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price May Drop This Weekend


Shiba Inu (SHIB) is threatened to note a decline due to the lack of recovery observed in the broader market cues.
SHIB investors are not keenly bullish either, which could translate into losses for the meme coin.
Shiba Inu Whales Are a Problem
Shiba Inu’s price could experience a price correction due to the waning support from SHIB holders. These meme coin enthusiasts have been losing optimism toward a rally, which is visible in their increasing selling pressure.
In the last two months, the addresses holding more than $1 million and $10 million worth of SHIB have sold off a huge chunk of their supply. Nearly $10 billion worth of SHIB has left their wallets, creating a bearish impact on the meme coin.

Such major selling tends to counter any potential an asset has at rallying, which could be the case with Shiba Inu.

Furthermore, the correlation this meme coin shares with Bitcoin also threatens its gains. SHIB shares a high correlation of 0.81 with BTC. A high correlation indicates a strong statistical relationship between the two assets. This implies that changes in one of them are closely associated with changes in the other.
Given Bitcoin is the bigger asset and is also noting bearish cues, it is difficult to predict a bullish outcome for Shiba Inu. Thus, there is a good chance that the meme coin could have a bearish weekend.

SHIB Price Prediction: Support Could Fail
Shiba Inu’s price has been trading under a downward trendline for the most part since the beginning of March. Even though the meme coin attempted breakouts in the past, it failed to retain the rally.
Consequently, SHIB is now threatened to fail the breach of the downtrend line and fall back to $0.00002093. Losing this support would result in a significant correction to $0.00001491.

Shina Inu must print a daily candlestick close above $0.00002584 to invalidate the bearish thesis. Such upward movement could break the descending trendline SHIB has maintained since March and push prices toward $0.00002835 or higher.

Is the lack of liquidity in Bitcoin futures threatening price stability? | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin surged to $64,500 on May 4, with out-of-hours trading pushing it to new local highs of $64,522 on Bitstamp. This marked a significant recovery for the cryptocurrency, hitting its peak for May.Daily Market MovementsData from TradingView confirmed the spike, which rode on positive U.S. employment data and signals of crypto market recovery, notably the first cash inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in almost three months. Currently, Bitcoin’s price is up 5% for the month, starkly contrasting with a 15% drop experienced in April, according to CoinGlass.On Twitter, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades shared, “Had a great push into the market close yesterday.” He added, “I like how the charts are on the higher timeframes, but I’ll be patient and won’t start buying just because it’s green this weekend. We’ll see how it goes.”This weekend’s market did show some unexpected moves. There was a notable difference between the Bitcoin prices on spot markets and the closing prices of Bitcoin futures by CME Group, revealing a “gap” that tends to close later.Source: Daan CryptoMarket VulnerabilitiesHowever, some market watchers are skeptical about the rally’s strength, pointing out the lack of traditional finance (TradFi) involvement. Keith Alan from Material Indicators commented on the fragility of the market due to thin liquidity in the order books. “We need more bid liquidity to sustain this rally,” he said, warning that “it wouldn’t take much to trigger a sell-off through this thin liquidity.”Credible Crypto, another prominent voice, noted that the market setup might favor short sellers under certain conditions. “If we stay below the main resistance around $69,000, going short could be a good strategy,” he mentioned in a post, sharing a chart that predicted two potential paths for Bitcoin’s price.“The ideal path is we keep the gains we’ve made and push towards major resistance. That lets me set up shorts for several altcoins. The less ideal path is we drop these gains early, and I miss the short zones I’m watching,” he explained.Credible Crypto also pointed out that buying opportunities could arise if Bitcoin falls below $56,000, indicating a strategy to capitalize on potential dips.Institutional Engagement in BitcoinThe ongoing submissions of 13F filings are shedding light on institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Institutions managing over $100 million must disclose their quarterly holdings, and these filings have shown varied levels of engagement.BNY Mellon reported owning nearly 20,000 shares of the IBIT and about 7,000 shares of GBTC. In contrast, BNP Paribas holds around 1,000 shares of IBIT, indicating a more cautious stance.More aggressive positions are seen in smaller firms. Pittsburgh-based Quattro Advisors owns 468,200 shares of BlackRock’s ETF, while Legacy Wealth Management disclosed ownership of over 350,000 shares of Fidelity’s ETF. A significant stakeholder is Yong Rong, holding over a million shares of BlackRock’s ETF, making it a major part of their portfolio.Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas highlighted that Yong Rong is among several Hong Kong asset managers heavily investing in Bitcoin ETFs, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise, alongside IBIT.

Bitcoin Surges Past $64,000 as Altcoins Seek Recovery Amidst Weekend Momentum



                    

Bitcoin surged past $64,000 before the weekly close on April 28, while altcoins aimed for a rebound. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed increased momentum in Bitcoin’s price over the weekend. 



After hitting a weekly low of $62,400, BTC/USD reversed its course and maintained levels around $63,500 at the time of reporting. 




Altcoins also saw positive performance during off-hours trading, with the total altcoin market cap rising by approximately 1% for the day.



Popular trader Skew, commenting on recent market trends, noted the bounce in altcoins but expressed caution regarding their tendency to peak early in the week. 



Skew anticipated sell-side pressure on Bitcoin around its range highs, which could hinder further bullish advances.




Trader and commentator Moustache expressed optimism about an upcoming “altseason,” suggesting it could rival the market’s performance during the 2017 all-time highs.

He pointed to the monthly dominance chart of the stablecoin Tether, indicating a potential “backtest” after breaking below a rising trendline earlier in the year.



Market participants awaited the introduction of “TradFi” trading, such as Bitcoin futures, for additional insights into the crypto market’s trajectory. 




Fellow trader Daan Crypto Trades shared positive sentiments about weekend price action, anticipating limited movement in Bitcoin until after the reopening of CME.



Despite consolidating below previous all-time highs, Bitcoin’s monthly chart drew optimism from trader Alan Tardigrade. 



Tardigrade highlighted Bitcoin’s position above the Triangle Top on the monthly chart as a bullish indicator, emphasizing the necessity of consolidation for a sustained bull run in the future. 



He compared Bitcoin’s current situation to the pre-breakout period of the Nasdaq Composite Index in 2013, suggesting potential for significant growth ahead.

Short squeeze alert for May: 2 cryptocurrencies with skyrocketing potential


The cryptocurrency market shifted from bearish to bullish as the week ended, following nonfarm payroll data reported on May 3. After days of continuous short-selling pressure, some cryptocurrencies display skyrocketing potential within the possibility of a short squeeze.
Notably, TradingView‘s total crypto market cap index surged by over $277 billion month-to-date from a local bottom on May 1. On May 4, the index reached a $2.318 trillion capitalization local high, up over 13% in three days.

However, previous fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) led cryptocurrency traders to massively short Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. Thus, this increases the likelihood of short-squeeze events for BTC and targets higher prices, as reported by Finbold on May 3.


In addition, Finbold spotted two cryptocurrencies in a similar situation, with negative funding rates and accumulated short-position liquidations.
Short squeeze alert for BNB Chain (BNB)
The BNB Chain’s (BNB) current funding rate is the leading signal for a potential short squeeze to Binance‘s native token. We retrieved this data on May 4 from the CoinGlass 30-day funding rate heatmap.
In particular, BNB short-sellers are paying a 32.63% APR for long-position traders, which could fuel short liquidations. The BNB Chain has the sixth-largest open interest in the derivatives market, increasing this signal’s relevancy.

As for the price targets, BNB has short-position liquidity pools from $600 to $630, currently trading slightly below this level.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has an even higher negative funding rate of 35.96%, the 10th-largest cryptocurrency ordered by open interest.

While BCH’s liquidity pools are less concentrated than BNB’s, the coin’s current price is far below the pending liquidations. Interestingly, there are unbalances in a large range from $500 to above $700. This offers a skyrocketing potential that could result in over 40% gains if Bitcoin Cash suffers a short squeeze.

However, despite the above economic analysis, these cryptocurrencies could still display negative price performance in the next few days. Short squeeze technical indicators do not guarantee the event will happen. Things can quickly change as the market moves, so investors must remain cautious.

Here Are The Top 10 Altcoin Networks With The Most Users In April - Ethereum Ranks 6th - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the cryptocurrency market rose led by Bitcoin after the weak employment report from the USA, analysis company CryptoRank identified the altcoin networks with the highest number of users in April.
Bitcoin price has increased by approximately 7% in the last 24 hours and is traded at $ 63,257 at the time of writing this article.


Here are the altcoin networks with the most users and their number of users in April:

Tron (TRX) – 54.7 million
Near (NEAR) – 53.8 million
BNB (BNB) – 35.5 million
Solana (SOL) – 35.2 million
Polygon (MATIC) – 33.6 million
Ethereum (ETH) 12 million
Base – 10.7 million
zkSync Era – 9.8 million
Arbitrum (ARB) – 9.3 million
Linea – 5.6 million
Celo (CELO) – 4.9 million
Optimism (OP) – 4.2 million
Aptos (APT) – 3.2 million
Scroll – 2.6 million
Blast – 2.5 million


It is noteworthy that Ethereum, which has the largest market value, can rank sixth on the list. The reason why Ethereum's number of users remains lower than others is the high transaction fees required by the network to process transactions.





However, it is thought that the reason why Tron, which ranks first, has such a large number of users is that most of the USDT stablecoin transfers occur on the Tron network.

BTC-e crypto exchange operator pleads guilty to money laundering in the U.S.

Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national who operated the crypto exchange BTC-e, pled guilty to charges of money laundering conspiracy in the US on May 3, according to a Bloomberg report.BTC-e was one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges between 2011 and 2017. According to the prosecutors, it processed transactions worth $9 billion and had a customer base of over 1 million worldwide.The prosecutors added that BTC-e was used by cyber criminals to transfer, launder, and store criminal proceeds from illegal activities. This included proceeds from hacking, ransomware, and narcotics distribution.According to a statement by the US Attorney’s office in San Francisco, Vinnik operated the exchange until he was arrested and BTC-e was shut down by law enforcement. Vinnik, sentenced to five years imprisonment for money laundering in France in 2020, faces a maximum of 20 years in prison in the U.S.The statement noted:“Vinnik operated BTC-e with the intent to promote these unlawful activities and was responsible for a loss amount of at least $121 million.”Prosecutors claim that BTC-e did not have a vetting system and allowed criminals to convert illicit cash into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin anonymously. The prosecutors stated that the exchange was found to have handled Bitcoin traced to a Russian military intelligence hacking unit that was responsible for releasing Democrats’ emails during the 2016 U.S. elections in an attempt to sway votes.In recent months, there has been increasing scrutiny and regulatory action against cryptocurrency-related fraud in the U.S. Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to 24 years in prison in March for orchestrating a multi-billion dollar fraud scheme.Additionally, Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, was found liable for fraud in a civil case in April 2024. Terraform Labs collapsed in 2022, triggering a chain of bankruptcies and wiping out $40 billion from the market.More recently, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, was sentenced to four months in prison this week for failures that allowed illicit activities, including criminal and terrorist financing, to occur on the platform. CZ had previously pled guilty while Binance paid the biggest fine in history and agreed to being monitored.Furthermore, Former SEC Division of Enforcement Assistant Director Jennifer Lee said this week that if Donald Trump is elected President for a second term this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will continue to “define its space and reach over crypto.”Mentioned in this article

Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin’s price shows a robust ascent, now trading at approximately $63,200, with recent highs of $64,446. This activity is part of a wider trend that has seen the global crypto market cap increase to $2.36 trillion, up over 7% over the last day.
The uptick is influenced by the Federal Reserve’s decision, as indicated by Chair Jerome Powell, to halt further interest rate increases, a policy move that often favors investments like Bitcoin by enhancing their appeal.
The surge is also supported by significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and the successful launch of similar products in Hong Kong, highlighting a renewed and growing confidence among investors.
The combination of these factors indicates a possible increase in the price of Bitcoin.





Bitcoin ETFs See $378M Inflows, Marking Market Confidence Resurgence

Bitcoin ETFs have recently witnessed a notable surge in inflows, totaling $378 million on May 3, marking a recovery after a week of outflows.
This influx includes a significant $63 million investment in Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF (GBTC), its first since January. This is notable considering Grayscale’s previous $17.5 billion loss attributed to higher fees compared to competitors.


Other prominent Bitcoin ETFs, like Fidelity’s FBTC and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, also reported significant inflows.

Grayscale’s Surprise Recovery: GBTC secures $63 million, reversing previous declines.
Market Recovery: Indicators suggest rising institutional confidence and potential positive impacts on Bitcoin’s price.

These inflows reflect a renewed confidence in the crypto market, potentially signalling a broader recovery and rising demand for Bitcoin.
Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs Attract $258M, Fueling BTC Price Surge and Market Stability

Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs have made a remarkable entrance, attracting $258 million in just three days of trading. This surge in capital inflows highlights a growing investor appetite for Bitcoin and underscores the strength of Hong Kong’s crypto market, especially compared to the global landscape.
While the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced $860 million in outflows, Hong Kong’s market saw nearly $300 million in inflows, demonstrating its robustness during global market volatility.
This financial dynamism coincided with a 5.75% increase in Bitcoin’s price to $63,050.11, showcasing the market’s resilience.

Rapid Growth: Hong Kong ETFs quickly gathered $258 million, indicating strong investor confidence.
Market Contrast: Outshines US market dynamics with substantial weekly inflows.

The significant interest in Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs likely played a pivotal role in the recent BTC price uptick, reinforcing positive market sentiment amid broader economic uncertainty.








The technical outlook suggests a bullish Bitcoin price prediction, as BTC is holding around a pivotal price point of $61,651. Ascending beyond this mark, Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $64,565, with further resistance anticipated at $67,085 and $70,000.Conversely, if Bitcoin’s price falls, it encounters immediate support at $59,165, with subsequent levels at $56,675 and $54,335 poised to offer further stability.Recent trends on the 4-hour chart show Bitcoin surpassing the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $61,575, transitioning it from a resistance to a support level.As discussed in the morning story on Bitcoin price prediction, the ‘three white soldiers’ candlestick pattern suggests strong bullish momentum. Nonetheless, a resistance near $63,200 could temper the ascent, demanding a breakthrough for further gains.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewShould Bitcoin overcome this barrier, it is likely to challenge the next resistance at $64,564 promptly.Overcoming this could thrust Bitcoin towards $67,084 and potentially reach as high as $70,000, especially if it surpasses a distinct double-top pattern near $67,000.Supporting this bullish scenario is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63, signaling robust buying interest.Technical Indicators:
RSI: 63, reflects strong buying pressure.
50 EMA: $61,574, now provides support.
With these dynamics, Bitcoin’s prospects appear favourable above the $61,650 pivot. Remaining above this level could lead Bitcoin to test upper resistances. However, slipping below could trigger significant sell-offs, targeting lower support levels as the market reassesses its direction.Secure Early Advantages with the 99Bitcoins Presale

Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) to Surge 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kitty With Hat (KITHAT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KITHAT will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kitty With Hat.



Currently, Kitty With Hat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KITHAT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – 3Wdkgv1iTBQQ9MnvA4TkAefe2SLdtSKfHwZbhKcEMZk8 – in the receiving field.




KITHAT currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Venture Capitalists Funnel Nearly $2,500,000,000 Into Crypto in Q1 of 2024: Galaxy Research - The Daily Hodl


								New data from crypto insights firm Galaxy Research finds that during the first quarter of the year, venture capitalists poured in billions of dollars into the digital assets industry.
In a new article, Galaxy Research says that venture capitalists invested $2.49 billion into cryptocurrencies during Q1 of 2024, a 29% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) rise.










The analytics platform says that heavy investments during Q1 of 2024 signal that Q4 of 2023 could have been the bottom of the market.
“In Q1 2024, venture capitalists invested $2.49 billion (+29% QoQ) into crypto and blockchain-focused companies across 603 deals (+68% QoQ). 
This was the first rise in both capital invested and deal count in three quarters, perhaps signaling that Q4 2023 was the ‘bottom,’ although a continuation of QoQ increases – and a more meaningful increase – would confirm that over the coming quarters.”
Source: Galaxy Research
Galaxy Research goes on to note that while venture capitalist investments into the crypto space have correlated with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) in the past, the crypto king’s massive rise in 2024 caused them to decouple.
 “While venture capital investment in the crypto sector has typically correlated to the Bitcoin price, that correlation has broken down over the past year, with bitcoin rising significantly since January 2023 but VC activity mostly languishing. 
Q1 2024 saw a significant rise in BTC, and while capital invested also rose, the investment activity is still nowhere near the levels when Bitcoin last traded over $60,000. 
The combination of crypto industry-native catalysts (Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, new areas like restaking, modularity, Bitcoin layer-2s, etc.) and macro headwinds (rates) contributed to the notable divergence.”

Bitcoin is trading for $62,754 at time of writing, a 5.2% increase during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin's present price volatility points to the ETF mania

Bitcoin seems to be aligning with the viewpoints of traditional investors who have entered the digital asset space via the introduction of US exchange-traded funds. Furthermore, the price of BTC surged to $64,500 on May 4 due to fresh gains in out-of-hours trading.Bitcoin Wild West pricesThe largest crypto experienced a surge on Friday following a report that revealed a smaller-than-expected rise in US employment. This news has reignited expectations for interest rate cuts, which in turn has increased the attractiveness of speculative assets. The rally managed to recover a significant portion of the losses experienced earlier in the week due to increasing worries about the Federal Reserve officials adopting a more hawkish stance and a decrease in demand for the ETFs.Bitcoin experienced a significant 7% increase on Friday, reaching a price of $62,937. This upward movement also had a positive impact on other cryptocurrencies, including Ether, Solana, and even meme-based coins like Dogecoin. Bitcoin experienced a significant decline on May 1, reaching its lowest point in approximately two months at $56,527.On Wednesday, a significant amount of money, totaling $564 million, was withdrawn by investors from a group of nearly a dozen US ETFs. This marked the largest outflow of funds since these products were introduced in January. Higher-for-longer interest rates have also had a negative impact on other markets, such as equities.The drop in Bitcoin from the record of almost $74,000 reached in March has raised concerns among traders. According to some market analysts, some traders may perceive risks in the global macro environment that the Fed or general investors have not yet recognized.Bitcoin price movementCurrently, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) stands at $63,571.91. This represents a slight decrease of 0.2% compared to an hour ago, but a notable increase of 2.9% since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 1.0% higher than its value a week ago.The current global crypto market cap stands at $2.47 Trillion, with a 2.42% change in the last 24 hours and a significant 100.47% change compared to one year ago. Currently, BTC’s market capi stands at $1.25 Trillion, indicating a Bitcoin dominance of 50.63%. Meanwhile, the market cap of Stablecoins stands at $161 Billion, accounting for 6.51% of the total crypto market cap.The strength seen in the United States employment data gained momentum towards the end of the day, driven by positive signs of recovery in the crypto market, such as the recent inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) after a gap of almost three months.According to data from monitoring resource CoinGlass, BTC/USD has seen a 5% increase month-to-date at the time of writing, which is a significant improvement compared to the 15% losses in April.Despite the impressive weekend performance, there were concerns about the overall strength of the market without the participation of traditional financial institutions.One X user said, “Two main scenarios I am looking out for on $BTC at the moment. Green path is ideal. We hold the local highs we broke above and continue up to the major resistance. This will allow me to fill shorts on a number of alts across the board.”He ended by saying, “Red path is not ideal. We fail to hold this reclaim, see an “early” breakdown, and ideal short zones for most alts I’m eyeing up are not met.”

Vodafone looks to integrate crypto wallets with sim cards

Vodafone, a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider, hopes to bring blockchain technology to smartphone users by integrating cryptocurrency wallets with subscriber identity module (SIM) cards. The ambitious move comes amid a company finance plan that reportedly involves Vodafone Idea Ltd., a separate entity operating in India that Vodafone Group carries a 45% stake in, taking on nearly $3 billion in debt including $1.8 billion in loans over the next two years. In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance Future Focus, Vodafone Blockchain Lead David Palmer discussed the company’s plans to integrate blockchain technology into smartphone sim cards:“By 2030 we’re expecting more than 20 billion mobile phones to be in operation, many of those being smartphones. … So we’ve focused on linking the sim card to digital identity, linking the sim card to blockchains, and using the cryptography we have in those sim cards for that integration.” Palmer elaborated on the figures he presented, stating that he expected there to be some eight billion smartphones in use by 2030 and predicting a surge in crypto wallets to 5.6 billion in the same time frame — enough to account for nearly 70 percent of all people on Earth.Despite the financial wrangling occurring with India-based Vodafone Idea Ltd, which recently sold off $2.2 billion worth of shares ahead of a debt raising plan worth a reported $3 billion, Vodafone Group has had a busy 2024. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the company entered into a 10-year strategic partnership with Microsoft to bring generative artificial intelligence (AI) services to Vodafone’s customers. Upon announcing the deal, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took the opportunity to hawk the disruptive nature of his company’s AI technologies declaring that the “new generation of AI will unlock massive new opportunities for every organization and every industry around the world.”This isn’t the first time a company’s worked to combine cell phone technology with blockchain hardware. Back in 2019, U.S. startup VaultTel announced its ambitions to create a physical wallet that could be slotted into a smartphone's SIM slot.Related: Vodafone auctions world’s first SMS 'Merry Christmas' as NFT for charity

Ethereum Bounces Back Strongly After $2,871 Support Rejection | Bitcoinist.com


								On Wednesday, ETH, the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain experienced a significant rejection at the resistance level of $2,871. Since this rejection, the price of Ethereum has gained a significant upward movement of over 9% and showing signs of even moving further.
At the time of writing, the price is still showing strong signs of moving upward toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the trendline, both in the 4-hour and the 1-day timeframe. The price of ETH is currently trading around $3,116 and about 0.47% up in the last 24 hours.
A Further Look At The Ethereum Chart With The Following Technical Indicators
100-Day Moving Average and Trendline: As seen in the image below, although the price of ETH is currently moving toward the 100-day simple moving average and the trendline, it is still trading below these two indicators. This means at a certain point, the price of Ethereum could make a possible reversal and continue in its movement toward the downside.

The RSI Indicator: Also observing the chart with the help of the Relative Strength Index Indication (RSI), it shows that the RSI signal line is trending above the 50 line which strongly indicates that the price might still move upward, as seen in the chart.
The 4-Hour MACD Indicator: After a close look at the MACD indicator in the 4-hour timeframe, it can be seen that the MACD histogram has moved above the zero line. Also, the MACD line and the signal line have crossed and are heading toward the zero line. This suggests there may be sustained upward price movement until a potential reversal.
Final Thought On ETH Movement
Based on Ethereum’s previous movement, there are two resistance levels of $3,250 and $3,355, and a support level of $2,819. As the price of Ethereum is moving upward, if it manages to break above the resistance level of $3,250, it might continue to move even further toward the $3,355 resistance level. 
On the contrary, if Ethereum fails to break its previous resistance level, it might reserve and start a move downward toward its previous support level of  $2,819. Should ETH succeed in breaching this level of support, it may descend even further to establish a new low.

US Crackdown Prompts Acinq and zkSNACKs to Discontinue Services for American Crypto Users



                    

Amidst a recent crackdown on self-custodial cryptocurrency wallet providers by U.S. regulatory agencies targeting major players like Consensys and Samourai Wallet, Acinq’s Phoenix Wallet and zkSNACKs’ Wasabi Wallet have made the decision to discontinue services for customers based in the United States.



Expressing concerns over the legitimacy of self-custodial wallet providers as money service businesses in the wake of regulatory actions, both Acinq and zkSNACKs have taken steps to restrict access for U.S. users.




“In light of recent announcements by U.S. authorities, zkSNACKs is now strictly prohibiting U.S. users from using its services,” stated zkSNACKs in an April 27 release.



Similarly, Acinq highlighted uncertainties regarding the regulatory landscape in an April 26 post, explaining, “Recent announcements from US authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such.”



Acinq has set a deadline of May 2 for Phoenix Wallet users to adapt to the impending changes, while Wasabi Wallet’s new policy was immediately put into effect.

Advising Phoenix Wallet users to empty their wallets without force-closing them to avoid significant on-chain fees, Acinq provided guidance for the transition period.



Regulators worldwide have voiced concerns that self-custody crypto wallets might facilitate illicit activities like money laundering. 



This sentiment was underscored by recent actions taken against Consensys and Samourai Wallet.




Consensys received a Wells notice from the SEC, signaling potential enforcement actions related to its MetaMask products, while the co-founders of Samourai Wallet face charges of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business brought by the U.S. Justice Department.



In contrast, European regulators have taken a more relaxed stance on potential regulations concerning self-custody wallets. 



Scrapping a proposed 1,000 euro limit on crypto payments from self-hosted wallets, European Parliament’s lead committees emphasized the importance of due diligence measures by crypto exchanges for transactions exceeding this threshold.

Crypto startups see rapid growth through 'fluid valuations' and decentralized cap tables â Bloomberg - Crypto Briefing




Cryptocurrency startups are increasingly adopting an aggressive form of fundraising known as open-ended or rolling funding rounds.This approach allows startups to continuously raise capital and rapidly boost their valuations, in contrast to the traditional venture capital model of discrete funding rounds spaced over several years.According to a report from Bloomberg, the rise of open-ended funding rounds in the crypto industry reflects both the sector’s recovery from the 2022 bear market and venture funds’ desire to deploy previously static cash.With this fundraising model, earlier investors benefit from the rapid increase in a startup’s valuation driven by commitments from later backers.While some investors and industry experts view these “fluid valuations” as perplexing and potentially lacking in fundamental drivers, the report claims that the traditional approach to venture capital formation may not be suited to digital-asset companies.“Capital formation in crypto is always evolving — governance, liquidity, and other important concepts that we’ve figured out in traditional startups are often a little different,” said Matt Luongo, chief executive at Thesis.Thesis is a venture studio, which helped develop and launch Mezo, a Bitcoin L2 protocol designed as an economic layer. Ed Roman, managing partner at Hack VC, noted that crypto startups generally prefer “decentralized cap tables” to help with governance, making the traditional priced rounds with a single, large, lead investor less suitable.Michael Heinrich, co-founder of 0G Labs, a blockchain startup focused on decentralized and modular artificial intelligence, noted that this type of structure is becoming more common when a deal is highly oversubscribed.“Investors are still willing to pay higher prices because it is seen as a signal of market success, even if in rapid succession,” Heinrich said.0G Labs itself raised $35 million in March through a rolling fundraise, with offers exceeding its planned raise by 20 times. The company’s valuation ranged from less than $40 million to hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on the investor.According to data from The Block Research as cited by Bloomberg, the average Series A round in crypto reached $26 million in the first quarter of 2024, the highest since early 2022. Overall venture investment in the sector increased to $2.5 billion during the same quarter.

Recent unsettling news has erupted around Bitfinex, as the notorious ransomware group FSociety claims they have hijacked 2.5TB of data from the cryptocurrency exchange. They assert possession of not just trading data but also the personal details of 400,000 users.What’s more terrifying? They’re threatening to leak KYC (Know Your Customer) information of every user unless their demands are met. This alarming situation has sent waves of concern throughout the crypto community.Initial Leak DetailsFSociety has taken to the dark web, specifically their onion site, to broadcast their claim. They’ve even posted links to text files that supposedly contain a chunk of usernames alongside plaintext passwords. Interestingly, after scouring the list, some Bitfinex account holders, including individuals associated with major trading firms like Alameda Research, have reported that their details do not appear in the leaked data.The hackers have thrown down the gauntlet, stating that if their undisclosed requirements aren’t fulfilled, they will dump the KYC documentation for all users. The sheer volume of data they claim to possess suggests that they could potentially have every KYC record since Bitfinex’s inception.A deep dive into the leaked data reveals numerous email domains, predominantly public ones such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook, among a long list of others. A peculiar standout in the list is coinfarm.co.za, which could hint at targeted trimming of more sensitive or valuable accounts from the bulk data.Community Reactions and Official ResponseThe leak’s authenticity was inadvertently tested when an individual tried one of the passwords from the file, only to be met with a prompt for two-factor authentication—suggesting the data might be genuine. Adding to the chaos, Bitfinex’s CTO, Paolo Ardoino, has been tagged in ongoing discussions to address these claims.In response, Ardoino expressed skepticism regarding the breach’s origin, suggesting that the data might have been gathered from other sources rather than from Bitfinex itself. He mentioned that out of the 22.5k email-password pairs posted, only about 5k match Bitfinex accounts, which would be unlikely if the data were directly from their databases. Ardoino also pointed out that Bitfinex was never contacted by the hackers, which contradicts typical ransomware protocol where hackers would reach out to negotiate.Despite the lack of direct extortion attempts towards Bitfinex, the hackers have made the compromised data freely downloadable. This unorthodox approach has led to speculation that the true motive might be less about a direct ransom and more about promoting some dubious investment linked to the data breach publicity.Implications and Ongoing InvestigationsThe unfolding situation raises numerous red flags concerning digital security in the cryptocurrency landscape. Notably, Ardoino has reassured the community that an extensive analysis is underway to ascertain the integrity of Bitfinex’s systems. Furthermore, the platform’s KYC system, designed with stringent rate limits, theoretically prevents mass data exfiltration, suggesting that any large-scale data leak might be implausible.The incident has drawn the attention of various security experts and researchers, accelerating the spread of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) across the sector. It’s worth noting that many of the leaked account details correlate with data from previous breaches, like the one at Coinmarketcap, highlighting a common issue where users recycle credentials across multiple platforms.As investigations continue and the crypto community remains on high alert, the real challenge lies in discerning the true scale and impact of the breach. With funds reportedly secure, the primary concern now shifts to the potential misuse of personal data and the overarching vulnerabilities exposed by such incidents in the cryptocurrency exchanges.

MATIC Bullish Signals Abound: Technical Indicators Hint At Sustained Uptrend


                            MATIC is the native utility token of the Polygon blockchain and it is currently ranked 18th by market cap, with a total supply of 10 billion MATIC and a total trading volume of over $204 million in the last 24 hours. It has been moving upward since its last rejection at a $0.6342 support level.  
Following the recent bullish trend of the crypto market, MATIC has not been left behind as the price has been on an uptrend with very strong momentum for a while now. Since its last rejection point, MATIC has seen a price reversal of over 10%.
Technical Indicators Point Toward Sustained Uptrend For MATIC
To figure out where MATIC’s price might be headed next, several indicators can be used to examine the chart;
1-Day MACD: A technical look at the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, the MACD histograms are trending above the zero line, and both the MACD line and the Signal line have crossed and are heading towards the MACD zero line, indicating a bullish trend.

1-Day RSI: the formation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the above image also suggests an upward movement as the RSI signal line is seen moving toward the 50% level. This indicates that buyers are gradually becoming active in the market therefore overpowering the strength of sellers.
4-hour Alligator: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that the crypto asset is trading above the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth have both successfully crossed above the alligator jaw, suggesting that the price might continue to move in an upward direction.

Potential Price Movement
From the previous downward movement, the price of MATIC has managed to create one major resistance level of $0.7365 and one major support level of $0.6324. Currently, MATIC is moving toward this resistance level and if it breaks above this level, it might go even further to test the next resistance level of $0.7680. 
However, if it fails to break above this major resistance, it will reverse and start a downward movement toward its previous support. Also, if it manages to break below this support level, the price might move further downward thereby continuing on its downtrend. As of the time of writing the price of MATIC was trading around $0.7253 and about -0.94% down in the last 24 hour

Bitfinex CTO denies new allegations of user data hack, assures funds are secure - Crypto Briefing




Bitfinex has been thrust into the spotlight recently after a ransomware group, named “FSOCIETY,” claimed to have gained access to 2.5TB of the exchange’s data and the personal details of 400,000 users. In response to the allegations, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino clarified that the claims of a database hack appear to be “fake” and assured user funds remain secure.Ardoino found out there were data discrepancies and user data mismatches in the hacker’s posts.The hackers posted sample data containing 22,500 records of emails and passwords. However, according to Paolo, Bitfinex does not store plain-text passwords or two-factor authentication (2FA) secrets in clear text. Additionally, of the 22,500 emails in the leaked data, only 5,000 match Bitfinex users.According to him, it could be a common issue in data security: users often reuse the same email and password across multiple sites, which might explain the presence of some Bitfinex-related emails in the dataset.Another highlight is the lack of communication from the hackers. They did not contact Bitfinex directly to report this data breach or to negotiate, which is atypical behavior for ransomware attacks that typically involve some form of ransom demand or contact.Moreover, information about the alleged hack was posted on April 25, but Bitfinex only became aware of the claim recently. Paolo said if there had been any genuine threat or demand, the hackers would have likely used Bitfinex’s bug bounty program or customer support channels to make contact, none of which occurred.
“The alleged hackers didn’t contact us. If they had any real information they would have asked a ramson through our bug bounty, customer support ticket etc. We couldn’t find any request,” wrote Ardoino.
Bitfinex has conducted a thorough analysis of its systems and, so far, has not found any evidence of a breach. Paolo said the team would continue to review and analyze all available data to ensure that nothing is overlooked in their security assessments.After news of a potential breach surfaced, Shinoji Research, an X user, confirmed the authenticity of the leak. The user said he tried one of the passwords in the leaked information and received a 2FA.However, at press time, he removed his post and corrected the previous information.In a separate post on X, Ardoino suggested that the real motive behind the exaggerated breach claims is to sell the hacking tool to other potential scammers.The idea is to generate buzz around these high-profile (Bitfinex, SBC Global, Rutgers, Coinmoma) hacks to promote their tool, which they allege can enable others to carry out similar attacks and potentially make large sums of money.Additionally, he questioned why the hackers would need to sell a hacking tool for $299 if they had really accessed Bitfinex and obtained valuable data.

How stablecoins are shaking up parallel financial networks | Cryptopolitan

Imagine a world where monetary authorities might need to rescue cryptocurrency markets. We almost saw this scenario unfold with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last year. SVB’s downfall shook the stablecoin operator Circle, which had a whopping $3.3 billion uninsured at SVB. This crisis saw Circle’s USDC—a token touted for its stability—lose its peg to the dollar until the Federal Reserve stepped in to secure the bank’s deposits, averting a larger crisis. As the crypto market rebounds from its low in 2022, stablecoins are capturing widespread attention. These tokens, created by private firms, mimic digital cash, typically matching the U.S. dollar one-for-one. Their reserves are expected to hold equivalent U.S. dollar amounts. The push for stablecoins is gaining momentum with new entries from corporations like PayPal and Ripple. Legislative support is also on the rise, with Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand proposing laws to provide a solid framework for these tokens.The reemergence of Stripe marked another turn. After a six-year hiatus from crypto payments, Stripe’s return underscores a renewed interest in integrating cryptocurrency into mainstream finance. Jonathan Bixby, a notable figure in the crypto world, remarked that Stripe’s strategy mirrors the earlier U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which aimed to integrate traditional capital into crypto. He suggested that Stripe’s initiative might be a reversal, bringing crypto into everyday financial transactions.The use of stablecoins goes beyond just technological innovation; they are beginning to answer the critical question of crypto’s practical applications. These tokens are not just theoretical but are actively used in real-world transactions. Visa’s analysis revealed over $2.5 trillion in stablecoin transactions within just 30 days, with USDC outpacing its rival Tether. However, removing automated trading transactions drops the volume dramatically, suggesting a heavy reliance on programmed trading in decentralized finance platforms.This growing use of stablecoins positions them as potential major players in the shadow banking system, which includes various non-bank financial institutions like asset managers and insurance companies. If stablecoins can command large-scale transactions, they could become custodians of vast sums of money.Currently, most stablecoin holders invest in short-term U.S. Treasuries or keep funds in bank deposits, benefiting from returns or safekeeping. Some engage in reverse repo markets, lending out cash for short periods against secure collateral like Treasuries. This strategy safeguards against counterparty risks, essential in maintaining financial stability.However, Frances Coppola, a financial commentator, points out the drawbacks of these strategies. If stablecoin operators focus solely on short-term asset holding, they might struggle to generate significant profits. Moreover, the mismatch between the durations of their assets and liabilities could pose additional financial risks.There’s a broader fear among federal regulators that stablecoins might accumulate too many Treasuries, prompting discussions about potentially limiting their growth. Although concerns about their size and impact may seem distant, underestimating these factors could lead to significant issues as the market scale increases.The reintroduction of crypto payments, coupled with Stripe’s expanded service offerings allowing integration with competing payment solutions, shows a strategic pivot towards more open and versatile financial operations.John Collison, co-founder of Stripe, humorously noted that transaction settlements and costs with stablecoins are now far more manageable, unlike the epic scale of Christopher Nolan’s films. This comparison not only lightens the mood but also emphasizes the efficiency and user-friendliness of using stablecoins over traditional cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency investor loses $70 million in six hours: Address poisoning attack


A cryptocurrency investor has fallen victim to an address poisoning attack, resulting in a staggering loss of $70 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). The incident, which unfolded over the course of around six hours, has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community.
According to a post by Lookonchain on the X, the unfortunate investor created a new address, “0xd9A1b0B1e1aE382DbDc898Ea68012FfcB2853a91,” and transferred a small amount of Ethereum (ETH), approximately 0.05 ETH, to this newly generated destination.

This observed behavior is common in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, mainly due to the need for gas fees. Essentially, when cryptocurrency investors create new crypto wallet addresses, they need to fund them with the native token first to pay for future gas fees, in this case, Ether or ETH.


However, a scammer had been waiting unbeknownst to the investor, ready to strike at the opportune moment.
Address poisoning attack
The scammer, employing a technique known as address poisoning, generated an address that shared the same starting and ending letters as the investor’s new address. In a calculated move, the scammer transferred zero ETH to the investor, causing it to appear in the investor’s transaction history.
Many cryptocurrency wallets hide the middle portion of addresses with ellipses (“…”) to enhance user interface aesthetics. Therefore, when the investor attempted to transfer their 1,155 WBTC, valued at approximately $71 million, they inadvertently copied the scammer’s cleverly crafted address, believing it to be their own.
Notably, crypto users often only check the destination address by quickly glancing at the first and last four characters.
The devastating consequence of this mistake was the irreversible transfer of the investor’s WBTC holdings to the scammer’s address. The crypto community has expressed shock and disbelief at the magnitude of the loss, with many calling for increased awareness and education surrounding the risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions.

This incident underscores the critical importance of thoroughly verifying addresses before initiating any transfers, particularly when dealing with substantial sums of digital assets. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, it is imperative that investors remain vigilant and stay abreast of the latest security measures and best practices to safeguard their investments.

Weekend Market Watch - Altcoins soar as Bitcoin recovers above $64K

Following a week of declining trends, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin experienced a surge in trading on Saturday afternoon. Following the April 2024 jobs data release by the U.S. Labor Department, there was a significant surge in crypto values. Last month, the U.S. saw an increase of 175,000 jobs, resulting in a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 3.9%. Experts had predicted the addition of 235,000 new jobs and a 3.8% unemployment rate.Altcoins season dominates yet againBitcoin experienced a tumultuous trading week with significant price drops on multiple occasions. The week began with a promising surge as BTC reached nearly $65,000, but unfortunately, the market quickly fell under the control of the bears, causing it to drop to $62,000.The downward trend continued as the asset plummeted to and below $60,000. The correction reached a two-month low of $56,500 on Wednesday, just before the latest US FOMC meeting.After the necessary steps were taken and the Federal Reserve announced its decision to hold off on raising interest rates in the near future, BTC experienced a sudden surge of $2,000 followed by a rapid decline, ultimately returning to its initial position. It made significant progress in the subsequent hours and came close to reaching $60,000 yesterday, as reported.Initially halted, it eventually managed to overcome that mental barrier later in the day. The market bulls maintained their momentum and drove BTC to reach a multi-day high of $63,500. Despite experiencing a slight decline, the current value of Bitcoin is approximately $63,000.With a daily increase of 6%, the market cap of this asset has now reached $1.240 trillion, solidifying its dominance over altcoins at 50.5%.The top performers among the largest altcoins are found in the unpredictable meme coin sector. Dogecoin, the first and largest of the cohort, has experienced a significant increase of over 20%. Following the recent announcement, Tesla has decided to accept DOGE as a form of payment.PEPE has experienced a significant increase of 11.7%, while SHIB has also seen a gain of 8% and is now valued above $0.000025. Ethereum and Binance Coin have both experienced a notable increase of approximately 3.5%. As a result, the price of ETH has surged to over $3,127, while BNB is currently trading at $590.The remaining larger-cap altcoins are also showing gains, such as TON, BC, AVAX, NEAR, and HBAR. The crypto market cap has seen a remarkable recovery, surging by over $200 billion since Wednesday’s low. Currently, it stands at an impressive $2.4 trillion, according to CoinGecko.Bitcoin market performanceBitcoin’s price has experienced significant fluctuations over the past few weeks. The bulls are making a strong comeback, successfully reclaiming their dominance by surpassing the $60K mark. But can it be sustained in the long run? The price of BTC has experienced a significant rebound of over 12.50% within a span of three days, following a recent dip to a two-month low of around $56,550. It has now surged past $64,000 as of May 4.The recent upturn has been primarily driven by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates steady until 2024. In addition, the latest U.S. employment data shows a decrease in jobless claims to their lowest point since mid-February, which has contributed to the continued upward trend in Bitcoin’s price.Some members of the Bitcoin market are hopeful for a sustained BTC bull run in the upcoming months. One independent market analyst predicts that the price of BTC could potentially reach $85,000. The crypto market has experienced significant growth in 2024, despite the presence of higher interest rates and indications of a weakening economy. In addition, the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. provided a significant boost.However, it is important to note that certain factors that have been driving the market may be losing momentum, which could have a negative impact on valuations in the future. Unless there is a substantial improvement in the practicality of cryptocurrencies, this could pose a long-term challenge.Currently, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) stands at $63,636.10, reflecting a slight 0.1% increase within the past hour and a notable 3.3% increase since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 1.4% higher than it was 7 days ago.

Ethereum and XRP Statements from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse - Bitcoin Sistemi


Fox Business' cryptocurrency journalist Eleanor Terrett explained in her statement the details of the speech given by Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, the company behind XRP, at the conference called “the future of digital assets”.
According to Terrett, Ripple CEO said in his statement that Ethereum is not a security, and in addition, XRP is not a security either. Garlinghouse stated that the SEC was “very wrong” and called SEC chairman Gary Gensler “an unethical person.”


The SEC maintains that all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are securities and must be registered with the SEC. However, the institution, which previously had a more moderate attitude towards Ethereum, has recently been working on the fact that ETH is also a security.

However, in his tweet, Garlinghouse expressed his excitement at the increase in the amount of events held by the XRP community this year, including XRP Las Vegas and XRPL apex, as well as the XRP Gold Coast event in March.





Garlinghouse also expressed his welcome for new native capabilities for projects built on the XRP Ledger.

EXCLUSIVE: Trump-Themed MAGA Memecoin Plans To Rival Dogecoin And Shiba Inu With 'Four More Years Of Catalysts' - Benzinga

“I can't think of anyone else who is a greater source of meta than Donald Trump.”Steven Steele, chief marketing officer of MAGA Memecoin TRUMP/USD, the Trump-themed cryptocurrency that has been making waves for being the former president’s biggest portfolio holding, thinks it is “increasingly likely” the 45th president becomes the 47th president of the United States.In that case, we could be provided with “four more years of hilarity and catalysts,” Steele told Benzinga in an interview. Polls have the former and the current presidents neck-and-neck, as have prediction markets, which gave Trump a two-point edge over Joe Biden, as of May 4. Whether he secures a successful re-election bid or not, interest in Donald Trump will likely intensify between now and Nov. 5.And with it, the appeal of investing in TRUMP, Steele said. He told Benzinga he cannot think of any person that will be covered more than Trump going into the election season “and probably beyond.”How MAGA Memecoin Turned ‘The Most Covered Person’ Into A CryptocurrencyAndrew Kang, a crypto venture capitalist, sees Trump as “one of the best attention monopolizers in the world.”His fund Mechanism Capital announced on Feb. 6 that it had accumulated TRUMP — the first meme coin than can “rival Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD.”Indeed, among meme coins, MAGA Memecoin is somewhat of a pioneer. It was the first to successfully introduce a meme coin based on a real-world person or cultural phenomenon. Speculating on the attention created by certain events, such as the death of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, has since become a staple of the meme coin circus.Steele, who initially was just an investor in TRUMP, said the “enormous potential” made him join as chief marketing officer. Following its inception in August 2023, TRUMP grew to a preliminary peak of $448 million in market capitalization on March 5 and is currently trading around a valuation of $220 million.Steele attributes this rise in value to several key points:Consistent marketing: MAGA Memecoin holds weekly spaces for its community and publishes Trump-themed memes on its X account.Philanthropic action: The project has donated over $1 million in Ethereum ETH/USD for 37 straight weeks to support for homeless veterans and the prevention of child trafficking. Steele pointed out this was one of key points that drew him in, with the National Veterans Homeless Support being able to scale its operation thanks to the donations.Partnerships: MAGA Memecoin recently announced it had onboarded controversial political figure and self-proclaimed “agent provocateur” Roger Stone as a partner. But the inevitable consequence of success is competition, a rule that applies even — or particularly — to meme coins.Read Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Rally, As Market Sentiment Soars On Macro Data: ‘Above $67,000 We Fly Like A Bird,’ Claims Trader‘To Get Unprecedented Results, You Have To Do Unprecedented Things’In a March interview with Coindesk, Steele said he wants TRUMP “up there with a DOGE or SHIB, that kind of scale and market cap and popularity.” Asked how to make that a reality, Steele told Benzinga, “To get unprecedented results, you have to do unprecedented things.” Signing Stone is one example of that, Steele pointed out, as it brought MAGA Memecoin a lot of “normie” investors that bought TRUMP as their first cryptocurrency. But since Steele’s March interview, the political meme coin landscape has changed. TRUMP isn’t the only politicial meme coin anymore. In fact, it currently isn’t even the biggest one. BODEN BODEN/USD a meme coin parodying Biden with intentionally poor spelling and cartoons, has recorded an astronomic surge to over $700 million in market capitalization and is currently trading at a valuation of around $290 million. The emergence of a quasi-rival has even sparked a prediction market about which meme coin would get to $1 billion first (BODEN is leading TRUMP 54% to 46%).Steele told Benzinga he is aware of the coin — and others that have boarded the “PoliFi” meta — but isn’t worried by or interested in them.Indeed, a de facto rivalry between the two meme coins, similar to that between Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, could be positive and create more interest and loyalty among holders.But what does the man whose face is on the memes powering MAGA Memecoin think of all of this?Read Also: Dogecoin Is ‘Primed For Higher’ But Pepe Is ‘On A Moon Mission,’ Exclaims Trader‘More Than Enough Reasons To Believe’ Trump Knows Of TRUMPDonald Trump’s stance on Bitcoin BTC/USD and crypto has shifted from considering them a “disaster waiting to happen” and being “not a big fan” in 2021 to now expressing enjoyment with crypto and the “crazy new currencies” apart from Bitcoin.Steele thinks there are “more than enough reasons to believe” the former president is aware of the meme coin his personality started, especially considering Stone was a consultant for Trump’s 2016 campaign. He suggested that Trump may have been referring to MAGA Memecoin in his mention of “crazy new currencies.”Steele also shared that Trump is aware and a fan of Shawn Farash, the host of the project’s weekly spaces and a proficient Trump impersonator.Trump’s allocation of TRUMP was an intentional “strategically savvy and hilarious” move by the project to promote the coin. And, just as planned, it has since become Trump’s biggest holding.But what if Trump sells “his bag” of MAGA Memecoin? If the meme coin were to appreciate going into the election season, Trump’s current holdings of $2.73 million may prompt him to think about cashing out.Steele acknowledged the possibility but does not see it as a problem. Similar to the 2021 incident when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sold and donated his allocation of SHIB, Steele thinks it may even have a positive impact on MAGA Memecoin.Whether TRUMP can really become, as Andrew Kang said, the first meme coin to break the reign of dog-themed incumbents remains to be seen. Meme coins like Pepe PEPE/USD and dogwifhat WIF/USD — yet another dog coin — hold a substantial lead over political meme coins. But when considering the combination of the “memecoin supercycle” with the “weirdest campaign” the incumbent president has ever been in, who knows what may happen between now and November?Read Next: Trump Says London, Paris No Longer Recognizable: ‘We Can’t Let That Happen Here’Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney

Paolo Ardoino Says There Is No Evidence of Bitfinex Hack


Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino has confidently dismissed claims of a security breach at the cryptocurrency exchange. 
Ardoino’s clarification comes after rumors circulated about a potential database leak involving 22,500 records of emails and passwords purportedly from Bitfinex users.
Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino Denies Hack Rumors
According to Ardoino, the evidence presented by the alleged hackers does not align with Bitfinex’s data handling practices. He highlighted a significant discrepancy in the data. Consequently, noting that only about 5,000 of the 22,500 emails matched Bitfinex user accounts. 
This is a clear indicator, he suggests, that if these records were from Bitfinex, there would be a complete match.

“We don’t store plaintext passwords, nor 2FA secrets in clear text. [And] only 5,000 of 22,500 emails are matching with Bitfinex users. If that was part of our database, we would expect 100% matching,” Ardoino said. 

The timing and method of the hackers’ claim also raise questions about its legitimacy. Ardoino pointed out that the hackers did not contact Bitfinex directly. Their claim was made public on April 25, with a seven-day response window, which Bitfinex only discovered a day before the deadline. 


“If they had any real information, they would have asked for a ransom through our bug bounty program, customer support ticket, emails, or Twitter,” Ardoino explained.

Security experts quickly jumped on the bandwagon, hyping the breach without substantial evidence. For instance, Shinoji Research claimed that 2.5 terabytes of customer data was leaked. However, Bitfinex’s preliminary investigations suggest that the database is likely a compilation of information from various cryptocurrency breaches.
Ardoino noted that it is common for users to reuse email and password combinations across multiple sites, which might explain the overlap.

As Bitfinex continues its thorough review and system analysis, Ardoino reassured users and stakeholders, stating, “While we believe this is pure FUD, we’ll keep reviewing information to ensure no stone remains unturned.”

Fed's Williams insists that 2% inflation target 'critical'

According to New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams, maintaining price stability and achieving economic prosperity heavily relies on the U.S. central bank’s 2% inflation target.In the coming months, policymakers at the Fed are set to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the central bank’s policy framework, with several critics advocating for significant modifications.Fed set to go hard on rate cutsIn the face of ongoing demands for the Reserve to revamp its approach to guiding, setting, and communicating policy, he staunchly defends the importance of the inflation target.Theory and experience have also shown the importance of transparency and clear communication, including setting an explicit, numerical longer-run inflation target, and of taking appropriate actions to support the achievement of that goal […] These are critical in anchoring inflation expectations, which, in turn, help keep inflation at the target.
New York’s reserve President John WilliamsFor over two years, the Fed has been actively addressing the issue of high inflation. In March 2022, they made the decision to raise interest rates by over 5%  points, which is a remarkably bold move not witnessed in four decades.Although price pressures have eased since their peak in mid-2022, inflation continues to exceed the Fed’s 2% goal, which has been a key focus of the Fed’s policy since 2012. In fact, Lawrence Summers, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary, suggested at the same conference that the Fed should reconsider its 2% inflation goal.According to his prediction, retaining it would lead to a significant economic downturn in the United States in the near future. Summers also criticized other aspects of the Commission’s communication, particularly the variety of policy views expressed by central bankers in speeches and public events.Rate cuts effects on the crypto marketSpeaking on the same panel as Williams, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized the importance of diverse perspectives and highlighted the significance of effective communication.It would be beneficial for the Fed to enhance its quarterly “dot plot” of policymakers’ interest-rate-path views by incorporating the individual economic expectations that shape each projection.In a recent decision, the entityls policymakers opted to maintain short-term borrowing costs within the 5.25%-5.5% range, which has remained unchanged since July 2023. Goolsbee and Williams did not provide any recent insights into the direction of inflation this year or the timing of potential rate cuts by the Fed.Traders have been shaken by the recent decline in digital asset prices, which has been further intensified by ongoing macroeconomic challenges. How negative are the sentiments in the crypto market today?Fed and the crypto weekendIndicators of optimism, or the lack thereof, can be observed in betting markets such as Polymarket and Fed fund futures, which are actively traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. These vague yet combined predictions regarding the timing of potential interest rate cuts by the Fed Reserve highlight a noticeable difference.Traders on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, observed a 7% probability in March that the Commission would maintain interest rates unchanged until 2024. Currently, traders are estimating a 38% probability that the entity will not implement any rate cuts throughout the year.That’s significantly more negative than the 23% probability of no rate cuts calculated on Tuesday by investment analysis firm Bianco Research. The organization utilized data from the CME’s FedWatch Tool, which indicates that CME traders are predicting a 45% probability of a rate cut by the Fed in September.When interest rates rise, the appeal of riskier assets such as stocks and crypto tends to diminish. Investors find the returns on these assets less enticing compared to more stable options like cash and U.S. Treasury bills.Following its policy meeting in March, the Fed Reserve projected three rate cuts of a quarter-percentage point each for the remainder of the year. In light of recent indications of persistent inflation in the United States and unexpectedly robust wage growth, Fed Reserve policymakers and participants in the financial markets have become less confident.

Another Cryptocurrency Platform Developer Disappears with Investors' Money - Bitcoin Sistemi


LENX Finance, which had raised $10.22 million through LBP financing on January 7 this year, is now under suspicion of a rug pull scam. Many users reported that all treasury funds were transferred on March 27, and the official Twitter account also stopped updating since then.
Originally known as RenaissanceDAO, a fragmented NFT marketplace inspired by OlympusDAO, the LENX team closed a $250,000 seed round investment in Frax Finance on February 28, 2022.



In another development, the cryptocurrency space faced another rug pull claim about two weeks ago. This time, blockchain platform ZKasino was at the center of the accusations, with many investors claiming their money was stolen. Despite the allegations, ZKasino continued to post updates before disappearing from the public eye along with investors' money.
The latest development shows that a suspect was arrested by authorities in the Netherlands and over $12 million was seized in the process. A 26-year-old man was arrested earlier this week over a ZKasino rug pull, the Dutch Financial Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) announced on Wednesday.





According to the press release, Dutch authorities began investigating the $33 million crypto platform scam on April 25. The criminal investigation began with online reports from the crypto community and information from FIOD's intelligence departments.

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) Coin Will Surge 7,000% Within 48 Hours, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) Wallet Loses $69,300,000 Worth of Crypto in Apparent Address Poisoning Scam - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto wallet lost $69.3 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) in an apparent address-poisoning attack, according to the blockchain security firm CertiK.
Address poisoning usually involves a scammer sending a wallet a tiny amount of crypto via an address that’s designed to look similar to the wallet’s, according to an explanation provided by Ledger, a digital asset wallet provider.










The ploy is designed to trick wallet holders into mistakenly copying the scammer’s address from their transaction history and having funds sent to that wallet instead.
In this instance, CertiK notes that a scammer mimicked a transfer of 0.05 Ethereum (ETH), which tricked the victim into sending 1,155 WBTC worth $69.3 million to the wrong address.
WBTC is an ERC-20 token pegged to the price of BTC, allowing traders to speculate on Bitcoin while staying within the Ethereum ecosystem. The 16th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $62,953 at time of writing and is up nearly 7% in the past 24 hours.
The blockchain security firm Peckshield notes that the scammer swapped out the stolen WBTC for 23,000 ETH and then transferred them out.
Ethereum is trading at $3,116 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 4% in the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin Price Slides Amidst Crypto Market Correction: Down 4.82% to $0.15



                    

Dogecoin‘s value has taken a hit amidst a broader decline in the cryptocurrency market. On April 27, DOGE saw a decrease of 4.82%, settling at approximately $0.15.



This decline was more pronounced compared to the overall crypto market, which experienced a 2.25% drop on the same day. 




Over the past month, Dogecoin has plummeted by 38% from its recent peak of $0.229.



The recent downturn in Dogecoin’s price can be attributed to several factors, with one significant influence being the release of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) report on April 25. 



The U.S. economy’s growth in the first quarter of 2024 fell short of expectations, recording a 1.6% increase instead of the anticipated 2.5%. 




Additionally, there was only a 0.3% rise in personal consumption expenditures for March.



Consequently, expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024 have been revised down to just 33 basis points, a considerable reduction from earlier projections.



The anticipation of sustained high interest rates has led to a rise in the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note, reaching 4.739% on April 24, its highest level in five months. 



This increase has made riskier crypto assets less appealing to investors. For instance, on the day when the yield peaked, five spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced outflows totaling $217 million.

Furthermore, Dogecoin’s open interest (OI) has declined to $865.63 million on April 27 from its peak of $2.21 billion nearly a month ago. 



Additionally, the funding rate has dropped to 0.0063% per eight hours. 



These developments indicate a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market, with traders adopting a cautious stance due to uncertainty surrounding Dogecoin’s future price movements or reduced interest in high leverage trading.



Today’s decrease in Dogecoin’s price appears to be a continuation of a selling trend that started when the price encountered resistance marked by a descending trendline and the 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA). 



The descending trendline resistance has consistently hindered DOGE’s upward movements over the past 30 days. 



Currently, the cryptocurrency is testing its multi-week ascending trendline support, suggesting a potential rebound that could propel the price towards the descending trendline resistance at around $0.159 by the end of April.

Ukraine Unveils a 'Technological Leap That No Diplomatic Service in the World Has Yet Made'" | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to a report by The Guardian, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry recently a groundbreaking announcement on Wednesday, introducing an AI-generated spokesperson named Victoria Shi, a pioneering move in the world of international diplomacy. Dressed in a dark suit and presented in a video on social media, Victoria is designed to deliver official statements that are written and verified by human staff but presented through her digital persona.



The Foreign Ministry highlighted that this innovative approach is intended to optimize resource utilization and save time for its diplomats. Victoria’s introduction represents a significant shift towards integrating advanced technology in government operations, underscoring a commitment to modernization and efficiency.



According to the report, Victoria Shi, termed a “digital person” by the ministry, embodies a blend of technology and human effort. She gesticulates and moves naturally, adding a layer of human-like interaction that is often missing in digital communications. The statements she delivers are crafted by human experts, ensuring that the content remains accurate and trustworthy while the AI handles the visual representation.



Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the initiative as a “technological leap that no diplomatic service in the world has yet made,” pointing to the innovative use of AI in public administration. 







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The name “Victoria Shi” draws from the word “victory” and the Ukrainian phrase for artificial intelligence, “shtuchniy intelekt.” Her creators, a team known as the Game Changers who are also involved in virtual-reality content related to the war in Ukraine, designed her to embody a forward-looking, victorious image that resonates with the Ukrainian spirit.



Interestingly, the report went on to say that Victoria’s appearance and voice are modeled after Rosalie Nombre, a well-known Ukrainian singer and a former contestant on Ukraine’s version of “The Bachelor.” Nombre, born in the now Russian-controlled city of Donetsk, lent her likeness to the project without charge, contributing to a cause that blends national pride with technological innovation.



To maintain authenticity and prevent misinformation, all statements made by Victoria will be accompanied by a QR code linking back to the text versions on the ministry’s official website.

Economist Nouriel Roubini blasts Bitcoin’s decentralization as ‘nonsense'


Renowned economist Nouriel Roubini has once again delivered a scathing critique of Bitcoin (BTC), questioning its decentralization and doubts about security and scalability. 
Notably, Roubini has maintained a dismissive stance towards Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency space, often branding them as scams.
In a May 3 debate organized by financial news aggregator Zerohedge, where Bitcoin was pitted against gold, Roubini dismantled the foundational principles of the leading cryptocurrency. 


Drawing on his reputation for accurately predicting the 2008 financial crisis, he argued that Bitcoin’s security and scalability promises are less fulfilled than those of traditional monetary systems.
Roubini underscored the vulnerability of Bitcoin holders, stressing the irreversible nature of transactions once private keys are compromised. Unlike traditional banking systems that offer recourse options in case of theft, he pointed out that the loss of private keys results in permanent loss of funds, painting a bleak picture of Bitcoin’s security landscape.
Questioning Bitcoin’s decentralization 
Furthermore, Roubini challenged the concept of Bitcoin’s decentralization, dismissing it as “nonsense.” He highlighted the concentration of mining power among a few significant players, which, in his view, undermines any claim to decentralization. 

“In the traditional financial system, there’s massive scalability. Yes, we have a centralized system. Bitcoin, first of all, is not secure. <…> It’s not even decentralized. <…> This idea of decentralized is nonsense. It’s neither decentralized, secure, nor scalable. It’s three NOs,” he said. 

Roubini raised concerns about the dominance of mining operations, particularly in regions with tax regulatory oversight, which threatens the network’s integrity.
Alternative to traditional finance
In addition, he rejected Bitcoin as a viable alternative to traditional financial systems, citing its purported inefficiency in handling large transaction volumes. 
The financial expert also likened storing Bitcoin to burying gold in the ground, describing it as a cumbersome and impractical solution in the digital age.
His sentiment comes amid his continued bashing of cryptocurrencies. The economist has termed crypto “totally corrupt” and the “biggest criminal heist in human history.” 
The expert has also warned of a possible “crypto apocalypse” for the industry, mainly due to regulators cracking down on the sector.

Shiba Inu coin - Here's the roadmap for a 100% hike in SHIB's price - AMBCrypto



After a period of correction, SHIB surged by 8% in just 24 hours 
Most metrics supported the possibility of a 100% price hike 

Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] bulls took control of the market as the token’s price surged dramatically over the last few hours. This might be the tip of the iceberg, however, as if the latest data is considered, SHIB might be preparing for a whopping 100% price hike in the coming weeks. 
Shiba Inu bulls buckle up
After a month of sustained price corrections, the memecoin’s price chart finally saw some green on the back of Bitcoin’s recovery. According to CoinMarketCap, SHIB’s price appreciated by over 8% in 24 hours, injecting much optimism into the market. 
The hike in price also had a major impact on SHIB’s social metrics, as its social volume rose last week. Additionally, its weighted sentiment surged on the charts. Simply put, bullish sentiment seemed to have regained its market dominance as SHIB’s value climbed. 
Source: Santiment
This outcome seems likely as the memecoin’s price was moving inside a bullish flag pattern, at press time. World of Charts, a popular crypto-analyst, recently shared a tweet about this pattern. As per the same, if SHIB manages to break above the pattern, it could result in a 100%–120% rally in the following weeks. 
Shiba Inu has more to offer
The possibility of a 100% bull rally translating into reality increased when AMBCrypto checked Glassnode’s data. We found that the memecoin’s Network to Value (NVT) ratio dipped over the last few days. 
A drop in the metric means that an asset is undervalued, hinting at a price hike in the near term. 
Source: Glassnode
Apart from this, investors’ confidence in SHIB remained high as buying pressure on the altcoin increased. Shiba Inu’s supply on exchanges dropped slightly while its supply outside of exchange went up, indicating buying pressure on the meme coin was high. 
Our look at CryptoQuant’s data also revealed that investors have been buying SHIB as its exchange reserves dropped. 
Source: Santiment
A few indicators seemed to support the idea of a rally sustaining itself.
 For instance, the MACD projected the possibility of a bullish crossover. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick and at press time, had a value of 49.7. 
AMBCrypto then checked Hyblock Capital’s data to find the immediate targets SHIB might hit on the road if it initiates a 100% rally. As per our analysis, it will be crucial for SHIB to go above $0.000025 in order to sustain the same. 

Read Shiba Inu [SHIB] Price Prediction 2024-25  

If it manages to achieve that, then the next possible target could be $0.000027, as liquidation would rise sharply at that level. A successful breakout above that level could allow SHIB to hit $0.00003 soon.

SEC charges Trump Media auditor with ‘massive fraud’

An auditor associated with former president Donald Trump’s Trump Media is facing serious allegations of engaging in fraudulent activities and operating an illegitimate audit operation, as stated by the US’s leading financial regulator (SEC) on Friday.BF Borgers and its owner, Benjamin Borgers, who serves clients such as Trump Media, have been charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with a fraudulent scheme that impacted over 1,500 SEC filings. Borgers has also represented financial technology and cryptocurrency companies, as indicated by SEC filings.Trump’s media head under SEC’s reviewAs stated in the company’s most recent annual report filing, BF Borgers was named as the auditor for Trump Media on March 28. The company revealed during that period that BF Borgers had also conducted its audits prior to the company’s public debut through a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp, a shell company with substantial funds.BF Borgers has agreed to pay a $12m civil penalty, while Benjamin Borgers has agreed to pay a $2m civil penalty, in order to settle the SEC’s civil charges. They have also agreed to permanent suspensions from practicing as accountants on SEC filings, effective immediately.It was unclear right away which filings or companies had been impacted.The company had previously gone through at least two other auditors — one that resigned the account in July 2023 and another that was terminated by the board in March, just as it was re-hiring BF Borgers.In a statement, Trump Media expressed its anticipation of collaborating with new auditing partners in compliance with the recent SEC order.As per the SEC, Borgers failed to adequately prepare and maintain audit documentation, falsely claimed to have conducted audit planning meetings, and at times used previous audits as if they were for the current audit period.According to Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, Ben Borgers and his audit firm, BF Borgers, were involved in a significant failure by gatekeepers in our financial markets.As a result of their fraudulent conduct, they not only put investors and markets at risk by causing public companies to incorporate non-compliant audits and reviews into more than 1,500 filings with the commission but also undermined trust and confidence in our markets.
The SECSEC’s stand on BF BorgersOut of 369 clients served by BF Borgers, a significant majority of their filings from January 2021 through June 2023 included audits that did not meet the SEC’s regulations.BF Borgers’ shortcuts involved the unethical practice of duplicating audit documentation from a previous year, altering important dates, and presenting it as current documentation. Furthermore, the fabricated documentation not only included records of work that was never performed, but also falsely claimed that planning meetings with clients took place and misrepresented that both Benjamin Borgers and another reviewer had endorsed the audit work.During the period of the SEC’s complaint, BF Borgers represented Trump Media. In late March, Trump Media merged with a publicly traded shell company, Digital World Acquisition Corp, in a deal that valued the social network at close to $8bn. The company now trades under the ticker symbol “DJT,” using the initials of its founder.Shares of Trump Media have experienced a significant decline since their initial launch. However, despite doubts about the value of the social media platform and the company’s financial challenges, the stock has continued to greatly enhance the wealth of the former president.The share price of Trump Media experienced a decline of over 5% on Friday but ultimately closed the day with a decrease of 1.54%. However, it has shown an overall increase of nearly 14% over the past five trading days. The company’s current valuation exceeds $6.5 billion. As the company’s largest shareholder, Trump recently qualified for a bonus based on the company’s share performance. This boosted the paper value of his stake to $3.7bn.

More than half of the Fortune 100 uses Apple’s Vision Pro headset

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, a mixed-reality spatial computing device, has been adopted by a majority of Fortune 100 companies with more than half purchasing at least one. Company CEO Tim Cook relayed the information during Apple’s first quarter 2024 earnings call, citing Vision Pro adoption as a sign of increased enthusiasm for the company’s products:“For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before.”The Vision Pro launched in early February of 2024 with a price tag of $3,499 in the United States. In the time since, it doesn’t appear to have made much of a dent in the consumer market where much lower priced options such as Meta’s Quest line of VR headsets. As Cointelegraph recently reported, however, the Vision Pro headset and Apple’s lead in the spatial computing arena have it poised to bring the metaverse mainstream and become the default choice for enterprise adoption. Where the most popular headsets tend to offer virtual reality experiences featuring total immersion in a digital space, the Vision Pro is designed for mixed and augmented reality experiences combining the real world and digital imagery. Apple refers to this as spatial computing. VIDEOInstead of featuring the device as a gaming and social product, the companies adopting the Vision Pro appear to be using it for metaverse-related enterprise functions. One such example involves using the headset to help train doctors to perform surgeries when cadavers aren’t readily available. Cook also teased an upcoming update during the earnings call, stating that the Fortune 100 adoption is “just the beginning.” He then added that “Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love.” It’s unclear if this will be related to Vision Pro — rumors have the Vision Pro 2 launching in 2026 with a less expensive model arriving in the interim. If true, the timing of Apple’s next event, dubbed “Let Loose,” on May 7, could be perfect for the company to announce a cheaper Vision Pro for 2025.

Dogecoin’s Astronomical Flight To $1 Price Looks Nigh As Tesla Officially Adds DOGE Payment Option ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Elon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE), has formally been included on Tesla’s website as one of the EV maker’s official modes of payment.



The price of DOGE has soared double digits over the past day to cross $0.16 as the wider crypto market experiences a sharp recovery. The meme coin’s upswing today has led to enthusiasts questioning whether this marks the beginning of a full-fledged bull rally.



DOGE Appears Among Payment Methods On the Tesla Website



Tesla’s payments page has been updated to officially include the original meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE).



Notably, Elon Musk’s electric vehicle manufacturer only accepts DOGE for certain merchandise in the online Tesla Store. The addition notes that “Dogecoin may also be accepted on select products.” To purchase an item, buyers simply need to send DOGE to Tesla’s Dogecoin wallet address and make the payment.



On the website, Tesla clarifies that it supports only Dogecoin payments, and any other “non-Dogecoin digital assets sent to Tesla will not be returned to the purchaser.”

&nbsp



Dogecoin, with a market value of $23 billion, was created in 2013 as a mere joke, but the doggy-themed meme token has a semi-serious place in Musk’s heart. Tesla started accepting DOGE payments for its company merchandise in early 2022. Later that year, Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX also began accepting DOGE for merch. In March this year, he hinted that Tesla cars could be purchased using DOGE “at some point” in the future.



Though the eccentric billionaire no longer posts about Dogecoin as much, his cheerleading on X (formerly known as Twitter) spurred Dogecoin’s meteoric climb in 2021. DOGE hit its current all-time high of $0.73 on May 8, 2021, ahead of Musk’s appearance on SNL.



$1 Dogecoin Price In View



DOGE price has climbed over 15.9% over the last 24 hours to trade for $0.1623 at publication time on the major Tesla news.



Meanwhile, Musk’s “everything app” X is anticipated to integrate cryptocurrencies like DOGE in its upcoming payment feature, given his apparent infatuation with the canine-themed crypto.



Looking ahead, Dogecoin supporters remain optimistic about the meme cryptocurrency’s future price prospects. If it continues its recovery momentum, there is hope that DOGE could soon break past the $0.20 psychological resistance, paving the way for a potential rally to the coveted $1 mark and higher.

$83,000 Drained From Wells Fargo Accounts in Minutes - Customers Say Bank 'Rolling Their Eyes,' Blaming Them, Refusing To Reimburse - The Daily Hodl


								Two Wells Fargo customers are calling out the banking giant after scammers ripped tens of thousands of dollars from their accounts in a matter of minutes.
Jolinda Crocker says $60,000 was ripped from her account while she was teaching at her music school in Italy, reports the Daily Mail.










Crocker says she received a text message from the bank asking her to call and verify whether she had made two transactions, one for $24,973 and another for about $10,000.
She promptly called the bank, filed an online fraud report and thought everything was fine.
But a week and a half later, the bank began to blame Crocker stating she has initiated $60,000 in transactions herself, when her login history shows a login from Italy and another from California on the same day.
Crocker has now spent two years battling the bank to get her money back.
“It feels like everybody is just rolling their eyes. $60,000 is nothing to Wells Fargo but it’s my life savings.”
The story is similar to that of Judy Barr, who lost $23,865 to criminals pretending to be with Wells Fargo’s fraud department.
The scammers, who somehow had Barr’s social security number and personal banking details, sent an authorization code to Barr’s phone and asked her to repeat the numbers.
Now, the bank says Barr essentially initiated the transactions herself and refuses to reimburse.
“I was so embarrassed I didn’t even want to meet my friends for dinner. I felt like such an idiot. I was a Wells Fargo customer for over 20 years yet they have refused to take any responsibility. They put me through endless loops trying to get my money back.”
Wells Fargo is one of several large US banks facing lawsuits from customers who claim the financial giants have lax security measures, don’t properly verify large transactions and shrug their shoulders as fraudulent transactions are reported in real time.

Cardano (ADA) Historical Trends Suggest Parabolic Bull Run, Says Analyst | Cryptoglobe


                                
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently published an interesting thread on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) about Cardano (ADA), in which he analyzed historical price trends and compared them with the current market situation. According to him, the 50% price drop in ADA over the past month could be a great buying opportunity, as Cardano seems to be preparing for a parabolic bull run. Let’s take a closer look at his analysis.



In 2019, Martinez says Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel, signaling the end of the bear market. He went on to say that following this stagnation, the ADA price broke out of the channel with a 75% surge, followed by a 56% price correction, which set the stage for an impressive 4,095% bull run.



He also mentions that a similar situation occurred in 2023. Cardano again consolidated within a parallel channel, marking the end of another bear market. After this period of stagnation, the ADA price broke out of the channel with a 72% surge. Now, Cardano is undergoing a 50% price correction.







Martinez believes that while history doesn’t repeat itself, it often rhymes. Per his thread, if this rule holds true for Cardano, investors should prepare for what lies ahead. He adds that the current price correction could be one of the last opportunities to buy ADA at a low price before a new parabolic rise.



Of course, it’s important to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. Technical analysis is a powerful tool, but it doesn’t provide 100% certainty; as usual, investors should always conduct their own research and weigh potential risks and rewards before making investment decisions.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

On April 18, Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, revealed plans for a new governance structure for the Cardano blockchain, marking a critical development phase. The Cardano Foundation, headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, plays a vital role in overseeing the Cardano ecosystem. It focuses on various functions, including adoption, shaping policy, community expansion, ensuring stakeholder accountability, and fostering partnerships.



Gregaard announced the creation of an interim constitution aimed at laying the foundation for decentralized governance, underlining the importance of community involvement in determining the future of the ecosystem. This constitution encapsulates the core values of the global Cardano community, promoting transparency, openness, and responsible decision-making. It also ensures that every ADA holder has a voice in the ecosystem, making the governance structure inclusive and representative.



Additionally, the interim constitution outlines the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of all ADA holders, developers, and community members, emphasizing a fair voting system to maintain true ownership and participation. Gregaard also discussed the introduction of checks and balances within the governance system, involving delegates, stake pool operators, and a constitutional committee to reflect community will, uphold the constitution, and protect the ecosystem’s integrity.



The governance model is currently in a testing phase, with plans for a final constitution to be developed through global workshops and a constitutional convention in late 2024. These initiatives are intended to engage the community actively in refining governance strategies. Gregaard sees the constitution as evolving with the community and is enthusiastic about the future of Cardano’s governance, highlighting the blockchain’s model as an industry benchmark.

New York Resident Charged in $43 Million Crypto-Related Ponzi Scheme


																A New York court and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have revealed an indictment against Idin Dalpour.
The 39-year-old New York resident is accused of organizing a sophisticated Ponzi scheme that allegedly defrauded investors of $43 million.
$43 Million Ponzi Scheme
According to the indictment, he ran the Ponzi scheme from approximately 2020 through April 2024. He targeted investors in the United States and abroad, soliciting investments through an entity he controlled called “Entity-1.”
This entity had interests in two business ventures: a cryptocurrency trading operation and a Las Vegas hospitality enterprise. Dalpour falsely claimed to purchase cryptocurrency at wholesale prices and sell it at a profit to retail investors promising substantial returns with assurances of safety and insurance for their investments.
He also claimed Entity-1 had deals with a management company and a top Las Vegas hotel to rent condos to visitors.




Investors were lured into the scheme with promises of substantial returns, with initial rates advertised at 42% per year. Dalpour allegedly provided investors with fabricated contracts, email correspondence, and bank statements to support his false claims about the profitability and legitimacy of the ventures.
The indictment outlines that Dalpour did not use investors’ funds as promised. Instead, he used the money contributed by later investors to pay earlier participants their returns.
Dalpour also reportedly used investor funds for personal expenses, including gambling losses totaling approximately $1.7 million, expenditures from Art Direct amounting to over $400,000, and private school tuition for his children.
When investors sought to recover their investments, he reportedly provided false explanations, including claims of frozen funds due to a hack of the Hotel’s servers and non-existent bank accounts.
Dalpour Faces Upto 20 Years in Prison
The indictment also details a confrontation in November 2023, where Dalpour reportedly confessed to lying about the operation of the Las Vegas hospitality business, the misuse of investor funds, and the fabrication of contracts and bank records.
During this encounter, Dalpour said, “What you already have, you have, you can put me in jail now, like right now.”
Dalpour’s arrest marks a significant step in the investigation, If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for wire fraud.
The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force of the Southern District of New York is handling the case. Dalpour will appear in Manhattan federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Moses.

Automobile Giant Tesla Updated Payment Information: There is New Dogecoin Detail - Bitcoin Sistemi


Tesla, one of the world's largest electric car manufacturers, also included Dogecoin (DOGE) detail in an update made in the payment section of its official website.
According to the official website, American Express, Discover, Mastercard, Visa and Apple Pay payment options are used when purchasing Tesla products. However, Tesla also stated in the note he added that Dogecoin can be used for some products.


According to the cryptocurrency community, Dogecoin was not previously mentioned among the payment options. However, DOGE cannot be used to purchase Tesla cars. It can only be used to purchase certain products.

Users who want to purchase Tesla products with DOGE are given a price showing the DOGE equivalent of the product for a certain period of time, but this is valid for a short time. The price needs to be updated after some time. It is known that the reason for this is the volatility of DOGE.





However, it is not currently possible to purchase any of Tesla products with Bitcoin. For a while, even Tesla cars could be purchased with BTC.

Dogecoin Price Slides Amidst Crypto Market Correction, But Will it Bounce Back and Take on Shiba Inu?



                    

Dogecoin‘s value has taken a hit amidst a broader decline in the cryptocurrency market. On April 27, DOGE saw a decrease of 4.82%, settling at approximately $0.15.



This decline was more pronounced compared to the overall crypto market, which experienced a 2.25% drop on the same day. 




Over the past month, Dogecoin has plummeted by 38% from its recent peak of $0.229.



The recent downturn in Dogecoin’s price can be attributed to several factors, with one significant influence being the release of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) report on April 25. 



The U.S. economy’s growth in the first quarter of 2024 fell short of expectations, recording a 1.6% increase instead of the anticipated 2.5%. 



Additionally, there was only a 0.3% rise in personal consumption expenditures for March.



Consequently, expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024 have been revised down to just 33 basis points, a considerable reduction from earlier projections.



The anticipation of sustained high interest rates has led to a rise in the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note, reaching 4.739% on April 24, its highest level in five months. 



This increase has made riskier crypto assets less appealing to investors. For instance, on the day when the yield peaked, five spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced outflows totaling $217 million.

Furthermore, Dogecoin’s open interest (OI) has declined to $865.63 million on April 27 from its peak of $2.21 billion nearly a month ago. 




Additionally, the funding rate has dropped to 0.0063% per eight hours. 



These developments indicate a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market, with traders adopting a cautious stance due to uncertainty surrounding Dogecoin’s future price movements or reduced interest in high leverage trading.



Today’s decrease in Dogecoin’s price appears to be a continuation of a selling trend that started when the price encountered resistance marked by a descending trendline and the 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA). 



The descending trendline resistance has consistently hindered DOGE’s upward movements over the past 30 days. 



Currently, the cryptocurrency is testing its multi-week ascending trendline support, suggesting a potential rebound that could propel the price towards the descending trendline resistance at around $0.159 by the end of April.

$2,000,000,000,000 - $3,000,000,000,000 Wealth Transfer Happening This Year As ‘Largest Move of Assets in World History’ Approaches Climax: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY) says the greatest transfer of wealth in human history is in motion, with trillions of dollars in assets passed down this year.
In its Global Wealth Management Industry Report, EY estimates baby boomers will hand down up to $3 trillion in assets to their kin this year.










EY expects the “tidal wave” of wealth transfer from baby boomers to their families to continue until the dawn of a new decade.
“It can be estimated that US$2 trillion – $3 trillion will be inherited from wealthy donors during 2024; in many markets, tens or even hundreds of billions [of dollars] will change hands this year. In 2023, more billionaires were created by inheritance than by entrepreneurship.
The inheritance of baby boomers’ wealth is not only the largest transfer of assets in world history; it will also have a transformative effect on female and next-generation inheritors. Wealthy donors will pass a staggering US$18 trillion, roughly equivalent to the annual GDP of China, to beneficiaries by 2030.” 
The firm’s $18 trillion wealth transfer is significantly lower than estimates released by other firms. Global real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank believes baby boomers will pass down $90 trillion to millennials in the next two decades while others estimate the number to be between $53 trillion and $84 trillion.
Amid the “unprecedented” movement of assets, EY warns that the beneficiaries are not equipped with the necessary knowledge, experience and network to manage their new-found wealth.
“No two clients are alike, but many wealthy donors have features in common. Most are male, aged 70 or over, have benefited from decades of favorable markets and have long-standing wealth manager relationships.
In contrast, inheritors’ needs and values – and banking relationships – are far more diverse and underserved.
The first beneficiaries are often female, frequently with less exposure to managing wealth. This is a client segment whose requirements and preferences have often been less well-served than their male counterparts in the past. Younger generations, too, typically have very different goals from older donors. This includes factors such as the internationalization of wealthy families, less traditional family structures, lower financial literacy and more idiosyncratic investment beliefs.”

New Solana Memecoin Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) to Surge 7,100% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Skinny Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Skinny Doge has market cap below $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,100% in the coming two days, and Skinny Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Skinny Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Skinny Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Skinny Doge by entering its contract address – 913qkdtENF3qvSBZjtoNxETZi93xHgRDuHNGvdzkECF4 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SKINDOGE.

itcoin: The Teenage Prodigy of the Financial World? | Cryptoglobe


                                
Introduction In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, shared an intriguing description of Bitcoin, originally coined by Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg. The metaphor, “It’s like gold, but as a teenager,” sparked an engaging discussion among followers, shedding light on the unique characteristics and potential of the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency.



Balchunas’ comparison of Bitcoin to a teenage version of gold is a fascinating way to frame the digital asset’s position in the financial landscape. Gold has long been considered a reliable store of value, with a history of stability and resilience during economic turmoil. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a relatively new player in the world of finance, having emerged in 2009.



Much like a teenager, Bitcoin is still growing, learning, and experiencing the volatility that comes with maturation. Its value fluctuates more dramatically than that of gold, and it is subject to the whims and speculations of a rapidly evolving market. However, just as a teenager holds immense potential for growth and development, Bitcoin has the capacity to revolutionize the way we think about money and transactions.



One insightful reply to Geraci’s post took the metaphor a step further, painting a picture of Bitcoin as the son of gold, a father who “had issues and paid no attention to his son.” This poignant analogy highlights the challenges Bitcoin has faced in its journey to legitimacy and widespread adoption.



Unlike gold, which has the backing of governments and centuries of trust, Bitcoin had to forge its own path. It emerged from the shadows of the internet, born out of a desire for a decentralized, transparent, and secure financial system. Bitcoin’s growth has been marked by trial and error, with the cryptocurrency community learning from its mistakes and adapting to the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Balchunas’ response to the father-son analogy likened Bitcoin to Generation X in 1994. This comparison is apt, as it reflects the rebellious and innovative spirit that defines both Gen X and Bitcoin. In the early 1990s, Gen X was coming of age, challenging the status quo, and embracing new technologies that would shape the future.



Similarly, Bitcoin emerged as a disruptive force in the world of finance, offering an alternative to traditional banking systems and fiat currencies. Its decentralized nature and the underlying blockchain technology have the potential to revolutionize not only financial transactions but also various industries, from supply chain management to voting systems.



The metaphor of Bitcoin as a teenage version of gold resonated with many readers, with one commenter noting that it “not only makes Bitcoin more relatable but also encapsulates its dynamic and transformative nature in the financial landscape.” As Bitcoin continues to mature and gain acceptance, it has the potential to reshape the way we think about money and value.



Another reply highlighted the similarities between Bitcoin and gold as a store of value, stating that while gold is more established and stable, Bitcoin similarly appeals to those seeking alternative investments.

Shiba Inu Community Alert: TREAT Token Release Misinformation Sparks Urgent Caution



                    

The Shiba Inu community is currently on high alert due to the spread of misinformation surrounding the release of the TREAT token. 



Shibarmy Scam Alerts, a dedicated source for uncovering scams within the community, has issued an urgent warning. 




They emphasize that the TREAT token has not been officially launched and refute recent claims suggesting otherwise. 



According to them, the SHIB team has not initiated any official release of the token. As a precautionary measure, the Shiba Inu community is urged to exercise caution and refrain from participating in any transactions or investments related to TREAT until its official release is confirmed by legitimate sources. 



It is advised to safeguard assets by avoiding unauthorized TREAT-related activities and prioritizing financial security.




In recent developments, Shiba Inu has secured $12 million from strategic VC partners led by Cypher Capital to facilitate the launch of its next-generation Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) blockchain, which will be powered by the forthcoming TREAT token. 



READ MORE: Bitcoin Holds Firm Above $63,000 Despite Regulatory Scrutiny and Economic Turbulence



The FHE technology, enabling computations on encrypted data, promises significant advancements in privacy and trust within the cryptocurrency sphere. 



However, amidst the anticipation, there are considerable risks associated with the TREAT token, prompting the issuance of the urgent alert.




The Shiba Inu community is reminded to disregard any claims of the TREAT token’s release, as no such action has been initiated by the SHIB team. 



Official announcements should be relied upon for accurate information regarding the TREAT launch. 



In other significant news for the ecosystem, the decentralized exchange ShibaSwap has completed its migration to Shibarium from Ethereum, marking a milestone in its progress. 



This move is expected to bring forth innovations and new possibilities for the ShibaSwap platform within the Shibarium blockchain environment.

Crypto Venture Capital Trends: Q1 2024 Analysis by Galaxy Digital Research | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent research report titled “Crypto & Blockchain Venture Capital – Q1 2024” by Galaxy Digital, it was highlighted that while digital asset markets have shown significant recovery from the lows of 2023, venture capital investment in the sector has not kept pace with previous bull market trends. Galaxy Digital noted that venture capital dollars are trailing, unlike in the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, where there was a high correlation with liquid crypto asset prices. Several factors contribute to this stagnation, including high interest rates, which dampen risk appetite, a lingering reluctance in the crypto market following the 2022 blowups, and a scarcity of later-stage companies capable of absorbing large venture investments. As a result, early-stage companies have attracted the most interest, both in terms of capital and deal count, with a modest quarter-on-quarter increase in total capital invested and a 50% rise in deal count, mainly at the Series A stage or earlier.



Galaxy Digital’s report also points out that the trend towards early-stage investment is a positive indicator for the long-term health of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These companies are often at the forefront of developing new technologies, including scaling solutions, games, and tools that integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Despite challenges in raising capital for later-stage ventures, the flourishing of innovative projects suggests a vibrant and evolving landscape.



The introduction of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs in the United States is another focal point of the report. According to Galaxy Digital, these ETFs provide an accessible, low-fee, and highly liquid means for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. However, this ease of access could potentially divert interest away from crypto startups, as these ETFs fulfill some investors’ need for exposure to the crypto market, potentially impacting venture investments in crypto-linked equities.



With regards to specific blockchain technologies, Galaxy Digital highlights significant venture capital interest in Bitcoin Layer 2 projects during Q1 2024. The development of new token standards on Bitcoin, such as BRC-20 and Runes, and the application of technologies pioneered in the Ethereum ecosystem, like optimistic and zk rollups, have piqued investor interest. This shift views Bitcoin not just as a monetary system but as a platform network supporting a variety of applications.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The report by Galaxy Digital further explores the distribution of venture capital across different sectors within the blockchain space. While Web3 and Trading categories continue to dominate in terms of deal count and capital raised, the Infrastructure category has seen substantial growth, becoming the leader in capital raised and second in deal count in Q1 2024. This includes investments in tools like staking, re-staking services, and platform tools, with notable rounds such as EigenLayer’s $100 million financing.



Moreover, Galaxy Digital comments on the challenges faced by fund managers in the current economic climate, noting a downturn in the size of funds and the capital allocated to them since the tumult of 2022. However, a slight uptick in the number of new funds indicates emerging opportunities and continued growth in crypto prices and adoption could rejuvenate investor confidence and funding activities.



Finally, the United States remains at the forefront of the crypto startup ecosystem, though regulatory challenges could potentially drive some operations overseas. Galaxy Digital underscores the importance of thoughtful policymaking to maintain the U.S. as a hub for technological innovation and to support the continuing development of the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem.

Veteran Analyst Peter Brandt: 8 Trading Tips for Crypto Traders


A seasoned market analyst, Peter Brandt, offers a rigorous guide for those looking to dive full-time into crypto trading. 
With years of trading experience, Brandt outlines essential tips aimed at aspiring traders who wish to transition from day jobs to trading as their primary source of income.
8 Tips for Crypto Traders by Peter Brandt
Firstly, Brandt emphasizes the importance of genuine trading skills over luck. Aspiring crypto traders should rely on their abilities rather than hoping a single market bet will pay off. He advises traders to ensure they have substantial account capital. 
“Multiply your needed living expenses by five,” Brandt suggests, highlighting the need for financial stability derived from actual profits, not loans or savings.
Additionally, Brandt stresses the importance of having enough savings outside one’s trading account to cover living expenses for up to two years. This is crucial considering the possibility of losing money in the first year. 

“[Novice traders] risk way too much of the $100,000 per trade. Risking more much more than 2% per trade is a recipe for failure. The only solution in my mind is a commitment to a marathon and not a sprint,” Brandt added.

Brandt also recommends paper trading for at least a year to refine one’s trading approach, focusing on the minute details that often determine success or failure.
Understanding the low success rate among crypto traders is also vital. Only about 3% to 5% of those who try to trade full-time actually succeed, according to Brandt. He challenges traders, saying, “Prove me wrong, and then let me know where I was wrong after two years.”
Brandt also tackles a common misconception in trading. Especially the need for a large starting capital. He argues that success in trading does not correlate with the size of one’s capital. In fact, starting small can help traders quickly identify and rectify mistakes, which is crucial in the steep learning process of trading.


“There is a huge misconception that an aspiring trader needs a big account to be successful. Most “market wizards” would tell you that if you cannot be profitable with a small amt of capital, then you won’t be profitable with more. Actually, with a smaller account mistakes become self apparent sooner. Successful trading occurs when a person climbs a steep wall of learning by making mistakes,” Brandt concluded.

Brandt’s insights provide a robust framework for crypto traders aiming to make a significant shift in their professional lives, emphasizing that successful trading is about solving problems and learning from mistakes, not just having a strong start.

Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) to Rally Over 13,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kitty With Hat (KITHAT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 13,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KITHAT will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kitty With Hat.



Currently, Kitty With Hat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KITHAT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – 3Wdkgv1iTBQQ9MnvA4TkAefe2SLdtSKfHwZbhKcEMZk8 – in the receiving field.




KITHAT currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

The Top Layer 2 Networks by Development Activity in April


																While the crypto market witnessed significant bloodshed in April, layer-2 networks recorded substantial developer activity, signaling a strong belief in these projects despite the latest slumps in the value of their native tokens.
A tweet by crypto data analytics platform Santiment revealed that the top ten layer-2 networks were selected by counting each project’s non-redundant GitHub activity and averaging their daily activity over the past 30 days.
According to Santiment, analysts obtained the projects’ GitHub activities from their repositories through a back-tested process to ensure that only the teams’ efforts to improve and innovate were included. A project’s GitHub activity can be used to determine whether the team is actively working on the protocol. High developer activity could also reduce the probability that a project is an exit scam.
Through Santiment’s methodology, analysts discovered that Ethereum-based scaling protocol Optimism emerged as the top network with the highest developer activity of 541.33 commits, 146% more than the next project. Conversely, its native token, OP, plunged more than 17% in the last 30 days.
Following Optimism is the permissionless decentralized zero knowledge-rollup network Starknet, which recorded a developer activity of 220.23. Despite Starknet’s high activity, its native token, STRK, lost roughly 36% of its value in April.




Arbitrum came third with a developer activity of 110.77, while its native asset, ARB, fell 32% within the same period. Next is the modular scaling protocol Cartesi, Immutable X, and Skale Network, which came fourth, fifth, and sixth, with developer activities of 56.97, 49.07, and 28.07, respectively. Their native assets also witnessed notable declines, running into double digits.
The last four projects on the list are Bitcoin layer-2 sidechain MintLayer, and Ethereum-based networks Polygon, MetisDAO, and Mantle, with developer activities of 23.53, 20.43, 7.87, and 5.33. Like other projects, their native tokens also recorded substantial losses in April.

Shiba Inu Scores Another Major Listing That Could Send Price Flying


								Shiba Inu has scored another major listing as PayPal users within the United States can now buy the dog-themed cryptocurrency through MoonPay, opening up new avenues for adoption and potentially fueling a price increase. 
PayPal Teams Up With MoonPay For Shiba Inu Access
American multinational financial technology company PayPal has made a strategic partnership with MoonPay, a crypto payment platform, allowing US users to access cryptocurrency assets like Shiba Inu. MoonPay made the exciting announcement on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that PayPal can now offer seamless fiat-to-crypto transactions within the US. 

The integration of MoonPay’s services into PayPal marks a significant milestone in the democratization of cryptocurrencies in the US. MoonPay has disclosed that it will allow PayPal users to purchase over 110 cryptocurrencies, including doggy-themed cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu. 
Through the collaboration, millions of users in all 50 states of the US will be exposed to Shiba Inu tokens, presenting a step forward in the cryptocurrency’s vision for mainstream adoption. This could in turn potentially drive up the price of the cryptocurrency as it attracts new investors from different parts of the country. 
Moreover, after the announcement of the partnership, the price of Shiba Inu surged considerably. The cryptocurrency jumped from $0.000022 to $0.000024 in just a day, increasing by 7.72% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. 
MoonPay has outlined the process for users to access its extensive library of cryptocurrencies via PayPal, disclosing that new MoonPay users with a PayPal account can seamlessly conduct online cryptocurrency transactions.

The crypto payment platform disclosed that PayPal users can fund their crypto accounts through different channels including direct bank withdrawal, PayPal balance, and debit card. 
Welcoming the pivotal partnership, MoonPay’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Ivan Soto-Wright, emphasized the importance of the alliance, aimed at facilitating broader cryptocurrency adoption within familiar ecosystems. 
He disclosed that MoonPay’s integration into PayPal underscores the crypto platform’s deep commitment to expanding access to cryptocurrencies through trusted networks.
MoonPay Set To Transform PayPal Crypto Access
Including Shiba Inu, MoonPay will also grant PayPal users within the US access to top cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin (BTC), and others. Additionally, the crypto service platform has revealed that other crypto assets initially available on its platform such as Pepe (PEPE), Cosmos (ATOM), Toncoin (TON), Binance Coin (BNB) and a few more, will not be accessible to US users. 
MoonPay has also revealed key benefits it will be offering PayPal through its crypto services, including flexible payment methods, an extensive variety of cryptocurrencies, seamless onboarding, transactional speed, and other user-friendly features. 

Furthermore, the crypto platform has hinted that in the third quarter (Q3) of 2024, it plans to integrate PayPal into its partner networks, expanding opportunities for the adoption of cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu, which could potentially boost the token’s value.

New Global Currency Designed To Ditch US Dollar, Avert Sanctions Emerging As BRICS Leaders Prepare To Meet: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A group of economically-aligned nations known as BRICS is reportedly hammering out the details on a new currency designed to drop dependence on the US dollar.
South African Ambassador to China Siyabonga Cyprian Cwele says BRICS members will meet this month to discuss the specifics, reports the Chinese state-backed Global Times.










On the agenda is a debate on whether a digital currency would effectively facilitate global trade and settlement while reducing the risk of sanctions.
“The BRICS are advancing the progress of its common currency, while actively promoting the use of local currencies from member states to reduce the risks of solely relying on the US dollar…
Cwele stressed the importance of supporting the use of local currencies with open financial data sharing, while looking into digital currencies as ways to explore multiple and stable mechanisms for trade and settlement to reduce the risks such as sanction by just relying on a singular currency.”
The push for a new currency comes amid a period of expansion for BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
Last year, the organization added Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.
And according to Cwele, more than 20 additional countries have now “expressed an interest” in joining.
Cwele says BRICS leaders are working to create new guidelines for adding additional countries that are non-discriminatory and address issues aside from economics.

CZ gets jail sentence, Gensler viewed Ether as security, and FBI targets mixers: Hodler’s Digest, April 28 - May 4 - Cointelegraph Magazine


            
Top Stories This Week



Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao sentenced to four months in prison



Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has been sentenced to four months in prison for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at the cryptocurrency exchange. The sentence was delivered by Judge Richard Jones in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on April 30, following Zhao’s guilty plea in November. Although prosecutors initially sought a three-year prison term, Judge Jones decided on a shorter sentence, noting that there was no evidence Zhao was directly informed of specific illegal activities at Binance.



SEC and Gensler believed Ether was security for at least a year



The lawsuit filed by Consensys against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revealed details about the Commission’s view of Ether as a security. Based on court documents, the SEC and its chair, Gary Gensler, have reportedly considered Ether to be an “unregistered security” not in compliance with federal regulations for at least a year. The revelation is part of Consensys response to a Wells notice from the SEC with an unredacted complaint in a Texas federal court.



FBI warning against crypto money transmitters ‘appears’ to be aimed at mixers



An advisory issued by U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation against using unregistered cryptocurrency money-transmitting services may be targeting smart-contract privacy tools, according to legal professionals. On April 25, the FBI issued a public service announcement advising Americans to only use registered crypto businesses that adhere to Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations. The FBI highlighted that it had taken action against unlicensed cryptocurrency services, warning that users of such services could face financial disruptions, especially if their funds are mixed with those obtained illegally.







Bitcoin post-halving price consolidation could last 2 months — Bitfinex

According to the report, Bitcoin is expected to remain a key benchmark for price action in the crypto market throughout May and serve as a primary indicator for the overall market cap. Lastly, the report adds that any positive impact on Bitcoin’s price following the halving will be seen in later months.

Prediction of the week



Bitcoin bottom in, now headed for a ‘slow grind higher’ — Arthur Hayes



Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes believes Bitcoin has hit a local bottom and will slowly grind back up over the next few months. In a blog post on May 3, Hayes commented on the recent market slump, claiming that “The price action played out as I expected.”



Bitcoin hit a local low of around $58,600 earlier this week but will rally to above $60,000 and then remain rangebound between $60,000 and $70,000 until August, he said.



Hayes expects crypto markets to slowly grind higher after the recent sell-off, driven by increased dollar liquidity from the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening taper and the U.S. Treasury’s debt issuance plans.



“The slow addition of billions of dollars of liquidity each month will dampen negative price movement from here on out,” he added before predicting that prices will “bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher.”







FUD of the Week

Bitcoin Relative Strength Jumps To 40%: 10x Research Reveals Next Steps From Here


                            Crypto research platform 10x Research recently noted that the Bitcoin Relative Strength has jumped to 40%. In line with this, they provided insights into what major moves the flagship crypto might make soon enough. 
What Next For Bitcoin?
In their newsletter titled “Fake Dip?” 10x Research drew the crypto community’s attention to the fact that Bitcoin has historically experienced potential rallies whenever its relative strength index (RSI) drops to 40%. As such, there is the possibility that BTC could again rally following its recent decline. 

The research platform warned that a “line in the sand” at the $62,000 mark could keep the flagship crypto from rallying. However, Bitcoin has already broken above that level, which could mean there is still a bullish sentiment around the crypto token. 
Meanwhile, the research hinted that BTC would need a catalyst to enjoy a sustained rally. They highlighted four bullish events that helped Bitcoin enjoy a parabolic run soon after breaking a vital support level. These events included Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s bid for uncapped deposit insurance, BlackRock’s application for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, Franklin Templeton also filing for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, and when US Core PCE dropped below 3.0%.
This echoes the sentiment of Andrey Stoychev, Head of Prime Brokerage at Nexo, who previously mentioned that Bitcoin would need a catalyst to make a significant move to the upside. He predicts that Bitcoin will only continue to trade around the $67,000 range without this catalyst. 
10x Research didn’t sound optimistic about BTC enjoying a sustained rally, as their trend model indicates that the flagship crypto is in a downtrend. Despite that, they are not ruling out the possibility of BTC experiencing a bullish reversal. The research firm also revealed that they would look to buy the dip if Bitcoin drops significantly or rallies from here. 
BTC Still Destined To Hit New Highs
Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto recently suggested that Bitcoin will still hit new highs. He stated that Bitcoin’s current price action is meant to create “more fear across the market and then bottom for upward continuation.” Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also recently suggested that the bull run was far from over, bearing in mind that Bitcoin consolidated around this period in the last two bull runs. 

He claimed that BTC might be over 500 days away from hitting its market top for this cycle. As to how BTC could rise, Martinez mentioned that it could hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $92,190 if it breaches the resistance level of $69,150. It is also worth noting that crypto analyst PlanB stated that Bitcoin hitting $100,000 this year is “inevitable.”
At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around at around $63,500, up over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Solana Primed To Establish Itself As ‘Third Major Crypto Asset’ After Bitcoin and Ethereum: Franklin Templeton - The Daily Hodl


								Global investment giant Franklin Templeton thinks Solana (SOL) is primed to establish itself as the “third major crypto asset” after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
In a new analysis, the firm’s digital assets unit notes that the Solana network has witnessed significant increases in total fees and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes in the past year.










“We expect this growth to continue as Solana’s network effects grow stronger and its network performance improves even more, positioning itself to capture the next trends in crypto. The network has proven to have some of the lowest fees, lowest transaction latency and highest data throughput relative to other networks. This is where Solana really shines.”
SOL is trading at $143.34 at time of writing. The fifth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 3% in the past 24 hours but down more than 22% in the past month.
Franklin Templeton also believes Solana is “uniquely qualified” to serve as the focal point of adoption for several sectors in the crypto space, including decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN), payments, compression non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and centralized limit order books (CLOBs). In addition, the investment titan sees activity in the Solana network surging in the coming months due to potential airdrops and the resurgence of memecoin mania.
“Further, the Solana ecosystem has more expected airdrops in the coming months which should continue adding a wealth effect to the ecosystem. And memecoin activity has shown no signs of slowing down on the network.”

Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF Turns Positive After $17.5 Billion In Outflows, Sees Inflows For The First Time | Bitcoinist.com


								In a rather shocking development, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has recorded its first-ever inflow after witnessing significant daily outflows since its launch. 
Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Records Over $60 Million In Inflows
Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF has finally broken its 82-day streak of outflows since its launch on January 11, 2024. GBTC saw its first day of inflows on May 3, after witnessing approximately $17.46 billion in outflows. 

According to data from Farside, an investment management firm, Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF had amassed inflows of about $63 million, alongside other Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which had inflows of $12.7 million. 
The total inflows recorded in that single day amounted to approximately $378.3 million, with Franklin Templeton’s Spot Bitcoin ETF, EZBC, leading the pack with the highest inflows of $102.6 million. 
Expressing disbelief at Grayscale’s turnaround, Bloomberg senior analyst and ETF expert, Eric Balchunas remarked that he had to make thorough verifications to confirm the unexpected development. 
Moreover, the surprising influx comes after a recent occurrence which saw 10 US Spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT, collectively recording enormous outflows worth over $563.7 million in a single day. These outflows were possibly triggered by the Federal Reserve’s (FED) decision to keep rates unaltered, resulting in a broader downturn in the crypto market. 
BTC had also experienced significant declines around the same time, however, currently the cryptocurrency is up by 6.36% in the past 24 hours, jumping above $60,000 support levels to trade at $63,175, according to CoinMarketCap. 
Factors Behind GBTC’s Massive Outflows
Grayscale saw its first recorded inflow after experiencing hundreds of millions worth of daily outflows since its inception. The asset management firm’s Spot Bitcoin ETF had also experienced its highest outflow of approximately $589.9 million on February 29. 

Various factors have contributed to GBTC’s daily outflows, including its exorbitant annual management fee of 1.5%. Compared to all 12 Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States (US), Grayscale has the most expensive Spot Bitcoin ETF fee, exceeding even BlackRock, the second largest BTC ETF provider, which has an average annual management fee of 0.25%. 
Some of Grayscale’s outflows were also a result of a reported selling connection with insolvent crypto exchange, FTX and other defunct cryptocurrency companies. FTX had sold about $1 billion worth of GBTC while Genesis, a cryptocurrency brokerage for institutional investors had sold almost 36 million shares in GBTC to purchase 32,041 BTC worth more than $2.1 billion.

OpenAI Faces Privacy Complaint Over Chatbot Accuracy Concerns



                    

OpenAI, a leading developer in artificial intelligence (AI), finds itself embroiled in a privacy complaint brought forth by Noyb, a data rights protection advocacy group based in Austria.



Noyb launched the complaint on April 29, alleging that OpenAI has neglected to address erroneous information generated by its AI chatbot, ChatGPT. 




The group contends that this inaction may violate privacy regulations within the European Union (EU).



The complaint stems from an incident involving an unidentified public figure who sought information about themselves from OpenAI’s chatbot. 



Despite repeated requests, OpenAI purportedly declined to rectify or delete the inaccurate data, citing technical limitations. 




Furthermore, the company refused to disclose details about its training data and its origins.



Maartje de Graaf, a data protection lawyer at Noyb, emphasized the importance of adherence to legal standards in technology, stating, 



“If a system cannot produce accurate and transparent results, it cannot be used to generate data about individuals. 



‘The technology has to follow the legal requirements, not the other way around.”

Noyb escalated the complaint to the Austrian data protection authority, urging an investigation into OpenAI’s data processing practices and the mechanisms it employs to ensure the accuracy of personal data processed by its large language models.



De Graaf underscored the current challenges faced by companies in aligning chatbot technologies like ChatGPT with EU data protection laws.



Noyb, also known as the European Center for Digital Rights, operates out of Vienna, Austria, with a mission to support European General Data Protection Regulation laws through strategic legal actions and media initiatives.



This incident adds to a growing concern surrounding the accuracy and compliance of chatbot technologies. 



In a similar vein, in December 2023, a study revealed issues with Microsoft’s Bing AI chatbot, now called Copilot, providing misleading information during political elections in Germany and Switzerland. 



Additionally, Google’s Gemini AI chatbot faced criticism for generating inaccurate imagery, prompting the company to issue an apology and commit to model updates.

BitFinex Under Threat? Hackers Allege Access to 400K Accounts - DailyCoin


        
FSOCIETY sparked panic by claiming to have compromised BitFinex. 



Initially, security researchers authenticated the hack, citing a match with some leaked passwords.



BitFinex CTO Paolo Ardoino chimed in, casting doubt on the hack. 
Notorious hacking group FSOCIETY, styled after the crew in the hit TV show Mr. Robot, claimed successful hacks on several victims on its dark web homepage, which included crypto exchange BitFinex. Their hacking group claimed to possess terabytes of users’ data from the exchange and threatened to release it, plunging users into panic. Yet, as users scrambled to safeguard their accounts, FSOCIETY’s credibility waned, leaving many questioning if they were just another group crying wolf.BitFinex Hacked?On April 25, FSociety proudly announced on the dark web that it compromised over 400,000 BitFinex accounts, grasping over 2.5 terabytes of user data. The hacking group issued a seven-day ultimatum for the exchange to reach out, backing up their claim by leaking a text file containing a partial dump of usernames and plaintext passwords. 
But it didn’t stop there. FSociety upped the ante by threatening to unleash the KYC details of all users if their demands weren’t met promptly. As the clock ticked down, chaos rippled through BitFinex’s user base. In a frenzy to validate the breach, security researchers tested the leaked passwords, triggering 2FA prompts and sending a wave of urgency for users to change their credentials.Amid the panic, Paolo Ardoino, BitFinex’s CTO and CEO of Tether, chimed in, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the hack.BitFinex CTO Clears the AirAfter a week of panic, Ardoino offered some relief on Friday, clarifying that the data originated from another breach and not from BitFinex. The executive also revealed that the hackers never reached out for ransom.
The BitFinex CTO detailed that FSociety’s data contained 22,500 records of emails and passwords, of which only 5,000 were linked to BitFinex users. Ardonio also emphasized that the exchange didn’t store passwords in plaintext. He also highlighted that if any real information had been compromised, they would have been contacted through their bug bounty program, customer support ticket system, emails, or Twitter.https://x.com/paoloardoino/status/1786751936760312050Shinoji Research linked the emails to the recent CoinMarketCap breach, asserting that the compromised accounts had a significant presence on HaveIBeenPwned, a website that indicates if your email has been compromised.Ardoino maintained that BitFinex found no breaches after a deep analysis of its system. In a separate tweet, he unveiled FSociety’s motives, claiming the ransomware group aimed to promote its ransomware tool and share profits with subscribers.Ardoino questioned, "If they truly hacked BitFinex, do they really need to sell stuff for $299?"On the Flipside
The panic surrounding Bitfinex stems from its notorious hack in 2016. Two individuals pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in connection with the hack, surrendering over 95,000 Bitcoin to the government.



Losses due to crypto hacks dropped by 67% in April to $60.2 million, marking a notable reduction in crypto attacks, representing the first significant decline in 2024.
Why This MattersThe panic surrounding BitFinex’s alleged hack serves as why it is essential to do your research, talk to officials, and stay up to date with official communication from the team to keep yourself safe.Are altcoins under threat?Michael Saylor Warns SEC to Flag ETH, ADA, SOL as SecuritiesBitcoin pulls a surprise comeback:Bitcoin Reclaims $63,000 After Massive Liquidation Scare

Ethereum's $35 million shake-up: How ETH's 7% hike triggered a 2-month high - AMBCrypto



ETH’s price appreciated by over 5% on 3 May
This contributed to a hike in the number of short positions liquidated

Ethereum’s [ETH] 7% price rally during the intraday trading session on 3 May caused short liquidations on its derivatives market to rally to a two-month high, according to Coinglass. 
In fact, the on-chain data provider went on to reveal that on that day, $35 million worth of ETH’s short positions were liquidated. In comparison, long liquidations totalled just $7.16 million. 
Source: Coinglass
Liquidations happen in an asset’s derivatives market when a trader’s position is forcefully closed due to insufficient funds to maintain it. Short liquidations occur when the value of an asset suddenly rises, and traders who have open positions in favor of a price decline are forced to exit their positions. 
According to Santiment’s data, the altcoin closed on 3 May above $3000 after trading below that price level since the beginning of the month.
Derivatives market traders stay their hands
Still extending its gains at press time, ETH’s price was up by over 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the market-leading altcoin was valued at $3,104. 
Here, it’s worth noting that Coinglass data also suggested that the price rally has not instigated any significant activity in ETH’s derivatives market. In fact, trading volume in that market grew by just 2%.

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25

Similarly, the coin’s Futures open interest recorded a minor 3% hike over the same period. ETH’s Futures open interest was $10.68 billion at press time. Furthermore, ETH’s Options volume cratered by over 50% during the period under review.
 Options trading grants participants the right to buy or sell an asset at a specified date. Generally, when ETH sees a decline in its Options volume, it means that there is less speculation on its future price movements as market participants wait to see where the coin’s market might be heading next. 
A combined reading of the minor hike in ETH’s Futures trading volume and its declining Options volume suggests that the coin’s derivatives market participants have adopted a “wait and see” approach. Simply put, they are not placing significant bets on where its price might head next.

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Telegram Becoming Crypto-Based Everything App, What Will Happen to TON?


After months of Elon Musk teasing about turning X into an "everything app" and introducing peer-to-peer crypto payments in 2024, Telegram is now making waves as the first major platform to embrace the Web3 ecosystem.In a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, the founder of Telegram praised Musk for his innovative mindset and efforts to build the SocialFi platform, aiming to empower content creators with fair ad revenue returns.SocialFi represents a fusion of social media and decentralized finance (DeFi), offering users control over their content without reliance on central authority. Creators retain ownership of their content and data, unlike in Web2 platforms. Users can monetize their engagement and following without limitations, opening up new financial opportunities.With Telegram's recent adoption of TON, Tether and other features, the platform has garnered more attention from the crypto community than ever before.Does TON belong to Telegram?The Open Network (TON) was initially developed by Telegram, but a subsequent legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission saw the messaging application abandon its development efforts in May 2020.The blockchain was originally designed to integrate with Telegram, but its initial attempt was foiled by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Telegram was able to reunite with TON after the network was relaunched by independent developers, making it the only major messaging platform to incorporate Web3.In a post dubbed “What Was TON And Why It Is Over,” the Telegram CEO said that they made the decision in response to a U.S. court prohibiting Telegram from distributing its Gram tokens anywhere in the world. Durov wrote:“The US court declared that Grams couldn't be distributed not only in the United States, but globally. Why? Because, it said, a US citizen might find some way of accessing the TON platform after it launched,” Durov complained.Durov decided to part ways with TON, which became an independent community of validators, launched the TON blockchain independently from Telegram on May 7.However, Telegram endorsed TON in September last year, saying the blockchain and the associated token would be its "official Web3 infrastructure.""To limit Telegram’s share of TON at ≈10% of the supply, we’ll be selling the upcoming surplus of our TON holdings to long-term investors — under 1-4 years lockup and vesting plan, but at a discount to the market price. This way free-floating TON will get locked up, stabilizing the ecosystem and reducing volatility," he statedNew Web3 infrastructureIn September 2023, Telegram introduced its long-awaited crypto wallet built on the TON blockchain.The TON Foundation announced that projects operating on the TON blockchain would receive priority access to Telegram's advertising platform, Telegram Ads. While the wallet feature is currently available in settings for existing users, a global rollout is scheduled to commence in November, excluding the United States and select other countries.In February 2024, Telegram revealed a plan to share ad revenue with channel owners and pay rewards using the Toncoin (TON) token. Telegram recently implemented that plan and allowed users to purchase in-platform ads with TON.On March 31, Telegram introduced a reward system that would allow channel owners with substantial subscribers to earn 50% of the revenue from ads shown in their channels in Toncoin (TON), the project’s native cryptocurrency.Durov said that 50% of the revenue Telegram receives from displaying ads and broadcast channels would be shared with channel owners and content creators using TON’s network.To further extend the Web3 infrastructure, Telegram plans to tokenize its stickers and emojis by transforming them into NFTs on the TON blockchain. This announcement was made at the Token2049 event in Dubai, where Durov highlighted the potential of socially relevant NFTs integrated into human culture and communication.Tether joins TelegramIn a big move with potential game-changing repercussions, Tether recently launched its USDT token and Tether Gold (XAUT) on TON, marking a significant expansion to 15 blockchains. The integration with Telegram, boasting over 900 million users, is expected to enable seamless peer-to-peer (P2P) payments within Telegram's user base.By introducing USDT and XAUT on TON, Tether aims to enhance value transfer between users in the TON ecosystem and other blockchain networks, with increased speed and reduced costs. The addition of USD₮ and XAU₮ on TON is expected to enhance liquidity and activity while offering users a financial experience comparable to traditional systems, advancing Tether's mission of open financial infrastructure across blockchain technology.The Open Network claims to “revolutionize” global peer-to-peer payments, allowing Telegram users to send money instantly without needing a blockchain address or downloading a new app.Notably, USDT on TON will be complemented by fully integrated on-ramps supporting most fiat currencies globally. Additionally, integrated global off-ramps will facilitate users’ withdrawal of supported fiat directly to their bank accounts or cards.The TON Foundation has allocated 11 million TON tokens as incentives to drive adoption. Five million TON will be utilized to boost rewards in USDT/TON liquidity pools across TON decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like StonFi and Dedust.Another 5 million TON will be distributed to users who deposit USDT to the Earn campaign of Telegram’s wallet. Furthermore, withdrawals to TON from supporting exchanges such as OKEx, Bybit and KuCoin will be free for all users until the end of June 2024.The TON community lead urged other cryptocurrencies to join:
New investmentFollowing the news of Tether’s involvement in Telegram, Pantera Capital, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund and venture capital firm, announced its investment in the platform.Pantera sees TON as a platform to broaden cryptocurrency adoption, expecting TON's continued growth among Telegram users, highlighting its scalability and cost-effectiveness."We believe TON has the capacity to introduce crypto to the masses because it is used extensively within the Telegram network. Telegram has over 900 million monthly active users on its future-facing, fast, and secure messaging platform that is used for personal and group communications, large-scale community building, content sharing, and more," the company stated. Toncoin priceIn February, Toncoin embarked on a series of initiatives, demonstrating continued positive momentum. The most recent initiative involved distributing 30 million TON for user participation in ecosystem projects.In late March 2024, Toncoin (TON) surged by 31.83% to $3.68, hitting a two-year high, driven by anticipation of Telegram's upcoming IPO. Trading volumes for TON spiked by 301.96%, reaching $269 million.Source: CoinMarketCapThe integration of the TON wallet into Telegram led to a nearly 7% surge in the price of Toncoin upon the announcement. Following the disclosure of the partnership with Tether, the Toncoin price reached $8.02.

Bitcoin will 'propel the next leg up' if key trading pattern confirms - Traders

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price could see a bullish trend reversal and “propel the next leg up” if the popular trading indicator known as the inverse head and shoulders pattern is confirmed, according to a crypto trader."If we don't break straight through $67.5k then something like this forming over the next month would make sense for a bottom pattern reversal,” crypto trader Matthew Hyland explained in a May 4 post on X.He is referring to the inverse head and shoulders pattern — a bullish indicator which signals the downtrend is easing, and buyers are becoming more dominant in the market.“It would be a great setup to propel the next leg up,” he declares.Although it is crucial that Bitcoin holds above its short-term holder price of $59,500 to "maintain its bullish trend," pseudonymous crypto analyst and co-founder of CMCC Crest Willy Woo told his 1.1 million X followers on May 3.If the inverse head and shoulders pattern forms, Bitcoin's price could dip to $60,000 support levels before hitting new all-time highs. Source: Matthew HylandThe setup appears when Bitcoin’s price forms three troughs below a so-called neckline resistance, with the middle trough — otherwise known as the head  — deeper than the left and right shoulder. Bitcoin’s price has slightly rebounded from the “head" at $58,614 on May 1, and if the pattern continues as Hyland’s model suggests, it will find support around its second shoulder, at $60,000 — a key support level.The decline would represent a 5% from its current price of $63,350, as per CoinMarketCap data. Dropping to this level would liquidate $530 million in long positions, according to CoinGlass data.Bitcoin is currently trading at $63,340. Source: CoinMarketCapAccording to Hyland's model, Bitcoin may rise above the neckline and exceed its current all-time high of $73,800 by June.On top of this, buyer interest in the crypto market is slowly increasing, according to the Fear and Greed Index.The index is currently sitting on a "Greed" score of 69, a major recovery from three days ago when it indicated "Fear" with a score of 43.Related: Bitcoin opens $63K futures gap as thin liquidity threatens BTC priceMeanwhile, some traders expect Bitcoin's price to remain stagnant in the near term, but they don't necessarily view this as negative.“The longer the Bitcoin consolidation takes, the higher its price will meet the trendline,” added pseudonymous crypto trader Titan of Crypto.“Bitcoin’s previous cycle all-time highs tend to slow down price and make Bitcoin stall for some weeks,” pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Traders told his X followers in a May 4 post.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Bitcoin's bull cycle - Don't be 'fooled' by BTC price's 'April Turmoil' because... - AMBCrypto



Experts like Tom Lee believe Bitcoin will climb higher
Metrics suggested the market hasn’t bottomed yet in light of the persistent sell-side pressure

The last few weeks have been very critical for Bitcoin [BTC], with its price dropping below the critical $60,000-level too. However, following significant corrections, the coin recovered on the charts to trade at $63,167 at the time of writing.
BTC’s 6% hike over a period of just 24 hours points to a potential reversal in the cryptocurrency’s market trajectory. Needless to say, this has renewed a sense of optimism among investors and observers alike.
Is there a buying opportunity amidst volatility?
As volatile as Bitcoin may be right now, however, many execs believe this is an opportunity too. Specially, some see this as a good buying opportunity. Foremost among them is Tom Lee, with Fundstrat’s co-founder claiming during an interview, 
“I think that we’re kind of being fooled by the April turmoil and I think that’s why it’s a buying opportunity for both Bitcoin and stocks now.”
He added, 
“It doesn’t mean it’s going to turn around today but, I don’t think this is a top.” 
According to the exec, the most recent decline was a healthy correction, one possibly driven by profit-taking.
That’s not all, however, with another analyst – @el_crypto_prof – taking to X (Formerly Twitter) to draw a parallel with a historical market trend. 
“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. $BTC has touched a trend line that has played an important role since the beginning of 2023. 
Shedding light on Bitcoin’s future outlook he added, 
“The thing will be sent higher. It’s only a matter of time, imo.” 
Source: El_crypto_prof/Twitter
Crypto-analyst TechDev chipped in too, with the analyst stating,  
“The impulsive structure of the last 1.5 years says 90-100K is next. $BTC”
Source: TechDev/Twitter
Simply put, the general consensus among most analysts is that these market conditions are not the end of the bullish cycle. Rather, they are simply a temporary setback.  
What are the metrics hinting at? 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of BTC’s Age Consumed data echoed its previous findings. Since 3 April, there has been minimal activity, suggesting no indication of a price bottom.
Additionally, Bitcoin’s Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) data, which measures the difference between the last moved price and the current market price, also failed to show signs of a price bottom.
Source: Santiment
Ergo, both metrics contradict the sentiments shared by Lee and others, suggesting that the market may not have reached its bottom yet. 
Echoing the same, an analysis by Glassnode highlighted an uptick in Bitcoin outflows in April – A sign of selling pressure in the market.

Why Regulators Should Embrace DeFi - The Daily Hodl


								
 
Stress tests of major banks have repeatedly failed to uncover serious issues that have led to billions of dollars in losses – DeFi (decentralized finance) changes all of this.
Right now, the world’s financial system operates under a veil of secrecy.
Global banks currently undergo stress tests to examine whether they can withstand significant and sudden market downturns.
But in some cases, regulators only require these exercises to take place once every two years – and the outcomes can be unacceptably opaque.
It is only 16 years since Lehman Brothers spectacularly filed for bankruptcy in what was the world’s biggest commercial collapse ever.
Millions of high-risk mortgages had led to an unstable financial system, as well as a deep and punishing recession when the bubble burst.
Some lessons were learned back then. Scrutiny of major banks increased, and more aggressive affordability checks for home loans were imposed.
Yet despite tighter laws, closer oversight and more stringent stress tests, history keeps on repeating itself.
Just last year, yet another crisis unfolded – with the Bank for International Settlements describing it as “the most significant system-wide banking stress” since 2008.
Silicon Valley Bank, Signature and First Republic all suffered high-profile failures, while Credit Suisse endured a humiliating bailout and takeover by rival UBS.
In the space of 11 days, four banks with an astounding $900 billion in assets were shut down – creating a contagion effect and a crisis of confidence among consumers.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes exposed inadequate risk management procedures within these corporations, with losses on government bonds leading to large deposit outflows that dealt a fatal blow to their liquidity.
The fact that all of this could unfold so quickly painfully exposes the flaws that exist within stress tests.
Regulators are only getting a mere glimpse into the financial health of banks that billions of people rely on every day – and when things go wrong, they’re left playing catch up.
To make matters worse, inadequate levels of transparency are coinciding with an increasingly uncertain economic picture.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has once again admitted that inflation in the US is taking longer than expected to cool – and interest rate cuts may not come as soon as hoped.
The heightened cost of borrowing is causing mortgage defaults to tick upwards.
Widespread issues in China’s property market have also cast a dark shadow over the world’s second-largest economy, with effects that could be felt elsewhere.
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has warned ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could jeopardize growth prospects in the coming years.
Put it all together, and one thing becomes clear.
It’s never been more important for regular, in-depth stress tests to expose potential vulnerabilities in the financial system – but current methods are falling well short of what’s required.
DeFi offers a compelling alternative and should be embraced by regulators as a matter of urgency.
Lifting the veil of secrecy
When compared with the smoke and mirrors in the world of CeFi (centralized finance) – which means sizable risks to the health of an economy are only detected when it’s too late – DeFi delivers full transparency and in real-time.
DeFi protocols are self-contained ecosystems governed by smart contracts visible to all.
They’re powered by lines of code that dictate the rules for transactions, eliminating the prospect of human error and greed.
An open-source environment means anyone can access and scrutinize these smart contracts, allowing potential issues to be identified and acted upon quickly.
This is in the interests of all parties concerned – the regulators vying to achieve stability, the businesses that wish to avoid costly and reputation-damaging incidents and the consumers who want cast-iron assurances that their savings are safe.
So, what does this mean in practice? Well, it ensures that protocols can be continuously monitored.
Through online simulations, experts can examine how a platform’s liquidity and health are impacted by a multitude of factors – including changes to interest rates, mass withdrawals or a sudden decline in asset prices.
This delivers instant feedback on potential weak spots, meaning preventative safeguards can be put in place.
Never before have regulators been able to access such a vast wealth of data so quickly – and ascertain the financial fragility or resilience of an entire ecosystem with every passing transaction.
Fostering innovation and competition
All of this goes beyond helping regulators uphold high standards. DeFi also ushers in a new financial era – one of inclusion.
Anyone can participate and innovate in the many protocols that now exist today and see where their entrepreneurial spirit takes them.
Whereas old-fashioned firms have proprietary algorithms and complex structures that create barriers to entry, open protocols foster competition and prevent powerful incumbents from forming.
This already has real-world consequences – with banks quick to hike the cost of borrowing when interest rates rise but slow to reward savers.
In Australia, banks have been accused of ‘profit push’ pricing because there are few rivals in the market.
Over in Belgium, regulators have compared the financial sector to an ‘oligopoly,’ where competition is suppressed by major banks.
And in a recent poll, two-thirds of Irish adults said they believe that there’s a lack of competition within the banking industry, and it’s difficult to switch to other providers.
It’s time for change.
By embracing DeFi’s transparency and open architecture, regulators can gain a more holistic view of the financial landscape.
Real-time monitoring, coupled with a decentralized structure, offers the potential for a more resilient and inclusive financial system.
DeFi’s promise of interoperability – where different protocols seamlessly interact – further fosters innovation and paves the way for a vibrant ecosystem.
The time for opaque financial institutions and inadequate stress tests is over.
DeFi presents an opportunity for a more transparent, secure and dynamic financial future – and many existing protocols are keen to cooperate with regulators.
PwC recently said, “There is no investment without trust” – and achieving compliance can actually add value to a project, as well as encourage adoption.
The potential of DeFi to revolutionize financial systems is undeniable. Its core principle – radical transparency – offers a powerful tool to prevent future financial crises.
By openly recording all transactions on a public ledger, DeFi eliminates the opaque practices that fueled past meltdowns.
Regulators, instead of fearing disruption, should recognize DeFi’s potential as an early warning system, enabling them to identify and address risks before they snowball.

Uniswap founder talks about 8 ethical factors regarding token launch | Cryptopolitan

Ethical issues related to token launches have continued. There have been various tokens that were launched on a speculative basis and have brought nothing but losses to investors. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams has opened up about ethical issues related to the token launch and talked about the different aspects of this matter. Token launch and related issuesThe token launch has been one of the critical issues in the blockchain ecosystem. If the developers are clear and fair about the token, it can gain traction in a matter of less time. But if they deceive the investors through fake claims, it can result in a loss of trust in crypto. It has happened multiple times, affecting the trust of customers in the market. Hayden Adams is one of those leaders in the market who continue to ask for fair play in order to improve trust in the crypto market. He has been active in the market since the launch of Uniswap as its founder. He developed Uniswap as a decentralized app on Ethereum, making it one of the most used in the dApp world.  Uniswap is a decentralized crypto exchange that has a set of smart contracts that can be used for crypto trades. In contrast to centralized exchanges, it has certain smart contracts that facilitate crypto trades. Those who invest their crypto assets in this exchange and agree to not trade or sell them can earn UNI tokens. Hayden built one of the most robust protocols for cryptocurrency exchange and developed its token into a valuable one. Now, he has opened up about being heedful to certain issues related to token launches that can affect trust in the crypto market.  Hayden Adams’ (Uniswap founder) take on token launchUniswap founder Hayden Adams has been clear about the token launch. He shared his own perspective regarding them in a detailed Tweet where he covered eight different ethical issues regarding the launch of tokens. He clarified it in the tweet that it wasn’t aimed at any specific project or a developer but rather advice for all. He added that he had seen a growing discourse regarding this issue so he wanted to add his view to it. The first thing he talked about is that the developers should focus on tokens not points. He took a negative view of teasing the investors by creating ambiguity regarding the token distribution. Many developers don’t share the details and keep them delaying in order to grow numbers. He also said that there should be no speculation about a token if there is no clarity about it. He said that if the team doesn’t know what comes next for the token, they shouldn’t be speculating publicly about its value. The Uniswap founder believes in sharing details when ready and has the same advice for developers. Furthermore, he said that he didn’t like float tokens which are malicious. He added further, that developers don’t need exchanges and market makers for effective distribution of tokens. He also said that the developers shouldn’t make an absurdly high token supply which creates unit bias. He also advised against stinginess which will create problems. Further insights regarding tokensHe added that the token price shouldn’t be marketed. If influencers and celebrities are involved in the marketing of tokens, then it means that the developers aren’t building real value. He advised against it and said that they should focus on building real value for tokens. In his final advice, he said that market leaders should be careful about their decisions. He said that decisions shouldn’t be haphazard, making them laughing stock for crypto Twitter. ConclusionUniswap founder Hayden Adams talked about the problems related to token launch in a Tweet. He covered a range of issues in eight points. The narrative talked about building value instead of fanfare so that tokens launches don’t make market leaders a laughing stock.

WIF can flip PEPE in the memecoin race, but ONLY if... - AMBCrypto



WIF recorded a massive surge in market cap over the last few days, while also inching closer to PEPE
Social volume and sentiment around WIF fell, despite the hike in price

Dogwifhat [WIF] has been one of the market’s most popular memecoins over the last few months. While once the memecoin saw its fair share of ups and downs, it would seem that the altcoin is now well on its way to break into the memecoin sector’s top-3
A WIF of success
Over the last few days, the marketcap of WIF has surged significantly. Owing to the same, WIF is now exceedingly close to overtaking PEPE’s marketcap and rank.
Source: CoinMarketCap
However, for WIF to surpass PEPE and claim the number 3 position, the price of WIF would need to climb significantly higher. Also, while WIF did climb by a significant 25% in just 24 hours, it wasn’t able to reverse its prevailing market trend. In fact, until the most recent bout of price appreciation, the memecoin was on its way down, hitting multiple lower lows and lower highs on the charts.
For WIF to break past this bearish trend and possibly push itself to the $4.382-level, it would have to test and move past the $3.594-level.
Worth noting, however, that the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) for WIF was on its side and had risen significantly – A sign of rising money flow and buying pressure.
However, the RSI had a reading of 74.86, indicating that the price may be in the overbought zone despite all the bullish momentum. Ergo, WIF may see a correction in the next few days before rising higher again.
Source: Trading View
Looking at the socials
A huge majority of WIF’s price surge can be attributed to the social volume around the WIF token. However, over the last few days, the social volume around WIF declined, which may cause massive problems for WIF’s price in the future.
Additionally, the weighted sentiment around WIF fell too, suggesting that the number of negative comments around WIF grew.

On the flipside, social volume around PEPE continued to remain consistent, while its weighted sentiment grew. The positive outlook around PEPE on social media platforms may give PEPE the right amount of edge needed to retain its number 3 position in the memecoin sector. Especially since alongside WIF, PEPE also hiked by double-digits on the charts.

New Lawsuit Filed Against Coinbase: Affecting Solana and 7 Other Altcoins - Bitcoin Sistemi

Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume in the United States, is once again under the legal spotlight. A new class-action lawsuit has been filed against the company, claiming that its entire business model has been unlawful from its inception. This case mirrors a similar lawsuit the company is currently facing.
Plaintiffs in the new lawsuit claim that the ALGO, XLM, SOL, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, UNI and XTZ tokens traded on Coinbase are, in fact, securities. The lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California by west coast law firm Scott+Scott, which represents plaintiffs from California and Florida.


The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase has “knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly violated state securities laws since it began doing business.” In response to these allegations, Coinbase issued a statement denying the allegations as “legally unfounded,” expressing full faith in due process, and stating their intent to fully address the allegations at the appropriate time.

Interestingly, this case bears a striking resemblance to another case currently pending in the courts. This other lawsuit also alleges consumer damages resulting from the sale of securities on Coinbase's platform. The case, which was initially dismissed in February 2023, was partially revived following a recent decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.





This latest case differs from Coinbase's highly publicized legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on a similar issue, namely whether tokens sold on Coinbase are securities. In this ongoing case, Coinbase recently filed a temporary appeal challenging a judge's decision to allow the case to proceed.

                        Today’s Ripple price prediction is closely watched as XRP trades at $0.5283 with a 24-hour trading volume of $675 million. Despite a slight decline of 0.40%, Ripple maintains its position as the seventh-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, with a market capitalization of approximately $29.18 billion. The currency has a circulating supply of 55.24 billion XRP coins out of a maximum supply of 100 billion, highlighting its significant stake in the cryptocurrency market.860,000 Investors Flock to XRP Despite Price Drop
Over the past month, the number of XRP investors holding between 1,000 and 1,000,000 tokens has increased to 860,000, a rise of 0.23%, according to data from Santiment. This uptick in holders comes in spite of a decrease in XRP’s market value.Notably, this group of investors, often referred to as “whales,” experienced a decline early in the year, with numbers dropping from 867,000 to a low of 858,000 by April 3. However, the count rebounded shortly thereafter.This slight yet significant growth in investor numbers is remarkable given the broader context of a 7% loss in XRP’s value recently. Such an increase in whale activity typically suggests a potential price rally could be on the horizon.Despite the prevailing bearish market conditions, the resilience of the demand for XRP highlights its ongoing appeal among substantial stakeholders.
XRP whale count hints at a possible price rally.
Despite a 7% drop in value, investor interest in XRP remains high.
Key momentum indicators like the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) show positive signs despite the price decline.
Ripple Price Prediction
The four-hour chart demonstrates that XRP/USD is currently teetering near its pivot point of $0.5180. Should XRP manage to sustain its position above this level, the outlook could remain bullish.Conversely, a drop below this threshold may precipitate a sharp downward trend. This pivot point acts as a critical juncture for determining XRP’s short-term price movements.On the technical front, key resistance levels are established at $0.5555, $0.5957, and $0.6280, which Ripple would need to breach to confirm further bullish momentum. Support levels are identified at $0.4877, $0.4586, and $0.4361, which will provide cushions if the price falls.The presence of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the chart suggests that XRP is consolidating within these bounds.

Paolo Ardoino (Bitfinex CTO) has denied rumors of data breach | Cryptopolitan

There have been claims about a hacker group breaching the personal data of users from Bitfinex. The company has denied any such claims saying that the customer data is safe. They are carrying out investigations to ensure that no such event has taken place. Claims regarding rumors of Bitfinex data breachBitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange that is registered in the British Virgin Islands. It was founded in 2012 and has continued to be one of the biggest names of trust in the crypto market. Initially, it was designed to be a Bitcoin P2P exchange but was later modified to accommodate other cryptocurrencies.It faced a big data heist in 2016 when BTC worth more than $71 million was heisted in a matter of hours. This breach is considered one of the biggest heists in crypto history. Serious flaws in the Bitfinex security protocol were pointed out which were later remedied. Though the thief hasn’t been found, there have been individual developments where the stolen Bitcoins were recovered. iFinex, the owner company of Bitfinex, commissioned a report to find out the reasons for the heist. The commission found a number of reasons for this happening. There was a recommendation for some operational, financial, and technological controls to ensure that no such event takes place again.Since then, Bitfinex has continued to be safe for users as no such event has been reported again. But recently some hackers posted mega links about the data breach of Bitfinex. According to hackers, it contained the personal data of the users.  Paolo Ardoino’s response Bifinex’s CTO responded to the claims regarding the data breach saying that it was nothing but rumors. He said that everyone was panicking about the possibility of the data breach but it seemed fake for a number of reasons. He mentioned that the hackers have posted mega links that contain a sample of passwords and emails. He refuted the claim that they don’t store passwords in plaintext. In addition to that, nor are 2FA stored in clear text. Furthermore, the 22.5 emails contain only 5K of the Bitfinex users. He added further that if the emails were from their database, they would have matched 100%. In contrast, it is the opposite and makes sure that no data breach has taken place. Also, the hackers had posted about the data breach on 25 April 2024 but no one contacted the Bitfinex team regarding ransom. Paolo is of the view that if they had data they would have asked for ransom in the possible options available.He also chided data security experts for hyping the matter without getting enough information. He said that these emails are possibly from different crypto breaches that the hackers have collected to get hype for their claims. No need to panicPaolo Ardoino added consoling words for the customers saying that they don’t need to panic and no such breach has taken place. He said that they had analyzed their system and no such evidence regarding the breach was found. Furthermore, they were performing a deep analysis which will confirm whether any data has been lost to hackers. He assured the users that it was a FUD and they would ensure that no stone remained unturned to ensure the security of the platform. ConclusionBitfinex CTO has refuted the claims of a possible data breach. He assured the users that no such event had taken place and there was no proof regarding the data breach. His arguments were solid and he assured that they will continue investigations about the matter.

Horoscope crypto from May 6th to May 12th

New week, new crypto horoscope dedicated to the upcoming week from May 6th to May 12th.
This week will be characterized by the transit of the New Moon in Taurus on Wednesday 8/5.
For several months now we have been dedicating space to the crypto horoscope written by Stefania Stimolo, an expert in astrology and blockchain. It is a weekly column with the horoscope of each zodiac sign available every Sunday only on The Cryptonomist. 
In our slogan “Telling the Future”, we wanted to delve deeper into the topic, jokingly speaking, with this entertainment column. 

The crypto horoscope
We call it crypto horoscope simply because industry terminology is used. 
Words like NFT, metaverse, and Over-The-Counter to describe actions and scenarios, but also trading terminology like bullish, bull run, bear market, or dump to identify the mood of each zodiac sign during the days of the week.
Obviously, the famous to-the-moon cannot be missing to indicate the mood of that sign! 
In general, you could experience a period of “hard-fork”, intended as an “inner split”, or pass your lightning torch to the next zodiac sign, meaning that the Sun is moving into the next sign. 
Or, simply, you need to reflect on some situations that go into “verify“, that is when the planet is in dissonance with the zodiac sign. Moreover, with each new change of guard of the Sun through the constellations of the zodiac, the roadmap of each sign will touch a new step. 
Obviously no investment advice is given, in fact, it is pure entertainment, just like any other horoscope. It must be said that there are many beginners in the sector who have understood the specific crypto terminology also thanks to the horoscope on The Cryptonomist. 
“Don’t Trust, Verify”
Astrology is not an exact science, but it aims to predict the future in its own way. So why not associate the typical phrase of blockchain “Don’t Trust, Verify” here as well. 
And in fact, what the author wants to propose is her interpretation of the planetary transits that occur during the week, describing the reaction of each zodiac sign, following the “logic” of traditional astrology. 
For those who are astrology lovers, they could stay updated just on the transits that are communicated weekly and somehow influence us. A Mercury Retrograde, or the days of the Full Moon. 
Others, on the other hand, could access the dedicated page, which is updated every Sunday, and read the horoscope of their zodiac sign, their rising sign, or why not, even the horoscope of friends and loved ones. 
And so, just for entertainment purposes, don’t waste time and click here to read your horoscope for this week!

Bitfinex database breach 'seems fake,' says CTO

The claims by hacking group FSOCIETY that they hacked cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex's database and leaked 22,500 customer emails and passwords “seems fake,” according to Bitfinex chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino.“If they had any real information they would have asked a ramson through our bug bounty, customer support ticket, emails, Twitter, etc. We couldn't find any request,” Ardoino claimed in a May 4 post on X.“We don't store plaintext passwords, nor 2FA secrets in clear text,” he added.Adoino clarified that out of the 22,500 records of emails and passwords, only 5,000 matched with Bitfinex users. He suggested that it is more likely the hackers gathered data from various other crypto data breaches.“Most users unfortunately use the same email and passwords across multiple sites,” he explained.He also shared a message from a security researcher, who believes the hackers were claiming to have hacked Bitfinex as a way to promote a data retrieval hacking tool.“So by creating a buzz about successfully hacking wellknown companies / a university, it is an advertisement of how good their tool is and others should buy it so they can make millions of dollars by using it to exploit companies using this tool.”Ardoino assured users that they would keep investigating the situation, but no breach has been detected so far, and all "funds are safe."Related: Bitcoin post-halving price consolidation could last 2 months — BitfinexThis is not the first time Bitfinex has faced scrutiny over data breach concerns.In November 2023, Cointelegraph reported a minor information security incident at Bitfinex when one of its customer support agents was hacked.This resulted in a series of phishing attacks targeting Bitfinex users, though Bitfinex stated that little harm occurred.Meanwhile, in 2016, Bitfinex suffered a security breach resulting in the loss of 119,576 customers' Bitcoin (BTC), worth around $70 million at the time, and $7.6 billion now.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

PEPE 7-day price prediction - 3 key factors will help the memecoin - AMBCrypto



Rising active addresses propelled the significant price increase.
Circulation fell, and many old coins remained stagnant, indicating another upside.

The price of Pepe [PEPE] increased by 15.75% in the last 24 hours before falling 2%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
Though other memecoins also jumped, AMBCrypto found specific reasons why the hike was special for PEPE.
Price is tied up with activity
According to on-chain data from Santiment, PEPE’s 24-hour active addresses increased from 2669 on the 1st of May to 4470 at press time.
Active addresses show the number of distinct users transacting on the network. In the broader crypto market, this metric does not always correlate with price.
However, a look at PEPE’s situation showed the price has a strong correlation with network activity.
Source: Santiment
Should the metric continue to rise, the price of PEPE might also follow. On the contrary, a decline in active addresses might slow down the memecoin’s upward movement.
As a result of the price increase, Social Dominance jumped. Social Dominance shows the rate of discussions about a project when compared to others in the top 100.
Therefore, the increase implied that the market gave the memecoin the attention that others did not get. However, an extremely high social dominance might not be great for price as shown in the chart below.
A rise to $0.00001 may be next
For instance, when Social Dominance hit 2.21% on the 4th of March, the token reversed from its upswing.  A similar situation occurred on the 1st of April, as the metric indicated that PEPE was overhead.
Furthermore, Social Dominance was at a relatively healthy level. As such, the price of the token might hit $0.00001 before any retracement appears.
As for Social Volume, AMBCrypto noticed that it was not near previous peaks, indicating that the search for PEPE was not intense.
Following historical data, this means that there might be a buying opportunity available before it reaches the local top.
Source: Santiment
In the meantime, the one-day circulation fell from 11.50 trillion to 3.97 trillion. Regarding its price, the decline in circulation might help PEPE sustain the northward move.
This is because less circulation gives room for less selling pressure. However, this would only be the case if the buying momentum increases.
Another metric we evaluated was the dormant circulation. At press time, the 90-day dormant circulation decreased to 59.54 billion.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s PEPE’s market cap in DOGE terms

This decrease meant that old holders of the token refrained from moving their assets. Hence, most are unwilling to sell. Should this be the case going forward, another PEPE rally could be close.
This time, the token could drive toward a new high.

XRP Plunges Ahead Of The SEC’s Upcoming Reply Brief On May 6 - Coin Edition


							

XRP pulled back on Saturday as users anticipate the SEC’s reply brief on May 6.
The brief will follow up on the ongoing case between the SEC and Ripple.
The brief’s content will inform users of the strength of the SEC’s case against Ripple.




XRP made a slight pullback on Saturday as users look forward to the upcoming reply brief by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its case against Ripple. The court expects the commission to file a remedy-related reply brief on Monday, May 6, to argue why Ripple should be penalized.



The expected reply brief will be one in a series of filings between the SEC and Ripple, which started with the SEC’s opening brief in March. The commission had pressed for a punitive penalty and an injunction against Ripple, alleging that the latter breached U.S. Securities laws after the December 2020 complaint.



Following the SEC’s remedy-related opening brief, Ripple filed a remedy-related opposition brief to counter the SEC’s allegations. In its opposition brief filing, the fintech firm asked the court to strike the SEC’s filing, citing irregularities and lateness in the brief filing. Ripple also noted that it made the post-complain XRP sales to accredited investors through ODL agreements. Hence, it did not constitute an infraction.



Meanwhile, crypto investors, especially members of the Ripple community, look forward to the SEC’s upcoming reply brief on May 6. It will provide information on the strength of the SEC’s case for a punitive penalty and injunction on Ripple. XRP could come under selling pressure peradventure the SEC provides substantive for its claim that XRP breached the law after the December 2020 complaint.



An injunction prohibiting Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors would significantly affect Ripple’s plans for the U.S. market. It will also impact investors’ sentiment and induce a selling pressure on the altcoin.



XRP traded for $0.52661 at the time of writing, reflecting a 2.78% drop from its Saturday high, according to data from TradingView.

Bitcoin Maintains $63K, Dogecoin's Rise Continues With Another 6% Surge (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price recovery tour took it to a multi-day peak of $64,500 yesterday, but the asset failed to continue upward and has retraced by over a grand since then.
Most larger-cal alts are slightly in the red on a daily scale, with TON, ADA, and SHIB declining by 2-4%.
BTC Stopped at $64.5K
The start of May was quite painful for the bitcoin bulls as the cryptocurrency slumped hard after failing to pump above $65,000 a day earlier. The massive correction drove the asset to its lowest price tag in over two months of $56,500.
The Fed’s refusal to raise the interest rates any further brought more volatility, as BTC pumped and dumped by $2,000 in minutes on Wednesday afternoon. Only then started the gradual price recovery as bitcoin jumped to $59,000 by Friday.
The bulls initiated another leg up then that drove the asset to and beyond $62,000. This increase culminated yesterday with an increase to a multi-day high of $64,500.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


However, bitcoin failed to overcome that level and has retraced by more than $1,000 since then. Still, it trades above $63,000 and its dominance over the alts has neared 51%. In contrast, its market cap has declined to $1.244 trillion on CG.

DOGE Keeps Rising
The largest meme coin – Dogecoin – was among the top performers yesterday and it has only doubled down on its run. DOGE has jumped by another 6% in the past 24 hours and now trades at $0.16.
The other impressive gainer from the top 36 alts is RNDR, which has soared to $9 after an 8.5% daily increase. AVAX, LINK, and NEAR are also in the green.
In contrast, TON, SHIB, and ADA have declined by somewhere between 2-4%. ETH, BNB, SOL, and XRP are also in the red but in a less painful fashion.
The total crypto market cap has declined by around $40 billion since yesterday’s peak and is now down to $2.450 trillion on CG.

Bitfinex CTO Dispels FUD, Refutes Data Breach By Ransomware Group | Bitcoinist.com


								In an interesting turn of events, Bitfinex chief technology officer (CTO) Paolo Ardoino has dismissed rumors of the exchange being involved in a large-scale data breach. This came in response to claims of a significant security breach by the hacking group FSOCIETY a little over a week ago.
On April 26, FSOCIETY claimed on its dark web homepage that it had successfully breached the security measures and obtained sensitive data of several entities, including Bitfinex. Other organizations the group contacted include Rutgers University, SBCGlobal, and Coinmoma (likely a wrong spelling of the Coinmama crypto exchange).
FSOCIETY, in its messages to the supposed victims, gave an ultimatum of seven days for each organization to make a substantial payment to avoid the leak of sensitive data. Despite the one-week deadline elapsing, none of these establishments have confirmed a server breach or the payment of a ransom.
Bitfinex CTO Responds To Data Breach Rumors
On Saturday, May 4th, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino took to the X platform to share a message on a purported breach of the exchange’s servers and security. According to the CTO, the ransomware group never directly contacted the exchange about any data breach, as they only got to find out about the claim on Friday, May 3rd.



Ardoino, who is also the CEO of Tether, mentioned that only 5,000 of the supposedly stolen 22,500 emails match that of Bitfinex customers. The exchange executive claims that hackers merely collected a database of emails/passwords from various crypto hacks.
Ardoino added in his post:
Most of users unfortunately use same email/passwords across multiple sites. We’re performing deep analysis of our systems and no breach was found currently. Also the KYC platform has heavy rate limiting that would disallow downloading in bulk.
While labeling the data breach rumors as pure FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), the Bitfinex CTO reiterated that they will keep evaluating the situation to ensure that “no stone remains unturned.” Ardoino also assured the exchange users that all funds are safe.
Data Breach Claim Was A Marketing Strategy: Security Researcher
In a follow-up post on X, Paolo Ardoino revealed a message from an independent security researcher on the purported data breach incident. According to the unnamed investigator, the FSOCIETY’s claim of the data breach was a ruse to market their ransomware products.

Source: Paolo Ardoino/X
The researcher’s message read:
I believe I start to understand what is happening and why they are sending these messages claiming you were hacked. The message in the screenshot in the ticket came from a TG channel (not reporting here to avoid helping them with free advertisement). There it seems they are selling the tool used that supposedly was used to hack Bitfinex and Rutgers.

With this revelation, Ardoino questioned the credibility of their claims of hacking different organizations. “If they truly hacked Bitfinex, do they really need selling stuff for 299$?,” the CTO said.

Uniswap Founder Shares His Two Cents On Good Token Distributions


                            Hayden Adams, founder of the Uniswap protocol, has shared his opinion on what characterizes a good distribution or rollout of a token. In a recent post on the X platform, the prominent crypto figure listed 10 qualities of good token distributions, highlighting the complexities surrounding the launch of a cryptocurrency.
Uniswap Founder Gives Opinion On Good Token Distributions
Adams began his take on good token distributions by stating that projects should allocate “tokens, not points” to the community. This phrase implies that participants should receive actual tokens that hold value within a particular ecosystem or on a network, instead of receiving points that may have limited utility.


Secondly, Adams warned against creating ambiguity or being vague about a token distribution to increase the number of participants or to “farm the farmers.” A good token distribution practice includes sharing real details when ready, according to the Uniswap founder.

Additionally, Adams criticized “low float tokens,” while calling them malicious. The prominent DeFi figure urged project teams to ensure sufficient tokens are available in circulation to prevent manipulation and allow genuine price discovery.
Adams also discouraged hyping a token’s price and how it will skyrocket before it launches. The founder believes hiring an influencer or a marketing company to promote a token’s value only depicts a get-rich-quick scheme rather than a genuine attempt at building real value.
What’s more, the Uniswap founder stressed the importance of free token airdrops during token distributions. “Don’t be stingy – give a significant amount away. If you don’t think the community deserves a significant amount, don’t release a token,” Adams said in his post.
Ultimately, Adams advised new crypto projects to be careful and thoughtful in their decision-making to avoid making mistakes that might put them at odds with the crypto community. “Create something you’re proud of and stand behind it,” the Uniswap founder added.
A Jab At Friend.tech and its FRIEND?
At the beginning of his post, the Uniswap founder clearly stated that the opinion is not aimed at any specific project. However, the timing is interesting, especially after social media platform Friend.tech’s “unsuccessful” token airdrop.

On Friday, May 3rd, Friend.tech airdropped its new FRIEND tokens to users in conjunction with the launch of the protocol’s version 2. While the token’s value quickly rose to $167 after launch, FRIEND’s price nosedived to below $2 within a few hours.
Analysts pinpointed liquidity issues and a mass sell-off as the primary reasons behind the downturn of FRIEND and, ultimately, the ineffectual token launch. Moreover, many users complained about how challenging it was to claim the token airdrop, as technical drawbacks reportedly frustrated the process.

Sui Network clears up misunderstandings on token supply

Sui Network, a layer-1 decentralized platform, has responded to and corrected common misunderstandings about its token supply. This statement, posted on the X platform, refutes criticisms about its tokenomics, specifically addressing concerns about token distribution and founder control. The platform maintains that its token economics are sound, utilizing reputable third-party custodians to manage locked tokens. Tokens are released according to a predetermined emission schedule and are publicly accessible. The foundation emphasizes that founders cannot control the treasury or tokens allocated to investors, including the community reserve.According to feedback from the Sui Network, the Sui Foundation manages the primary wallet holding locked tokens, which are released under specific conditions to enhance the ecosystem. These allocations support various projects, including Move programming language development, network security enhancements, hackathons, and developer grants.Source: Justin BonsSui Network further explained the distribution of staking rewards circulating in the system. These rewards comprise stake derivatives and network commissions, all of which are returned to the community. This approach is a key aspect of Sui’s economic model, which aims to maintain balance and fairness.Despite Sui Network’s clarifications, Justin Bons from Cyber Capital expressed concerns about the founding team’s token holdings. Bons suggested that the founders may control a substantial portion of staked tokens, posing a centralization risk. This prompted calls for greater transparency and accountability from the network’s management, which the Sui team has since addressed.In contrast, Sui Network disputes this assertion as inaccurate regarding token distribution and management, emphasizing their commitment to transparency. They have disclosed that all tokens, whether distributed or not, are managed in compliance with legal and regulatory standards overseen by reputable custodial services like BitGo, Anchorage, and Coinbase Prime.Related: Can blockchain revolutionize digital securities management for stock exchanges?However, Bons challenged the Sui Network’s claim of transparency by urging them to accurately represent the status of the allocated stake and demonstrate that the founders cannot move or access it. Bons emphasized that his critique is motivated by a desire for SUI’s success. He suggested that misrepresenting these tokens’ status undermines transparency claims and that true transparency requires clear evidence that the allocated tokens are securely held and cannot be manipulated. In September 2023, Sui Network streamlined Web3 logins for users on its apps with Zero Knowledge login (zkLogin), enabling login via Google, Facebook, and Twitch details. Known for high transaction capacity with low fees since launch. Since its launch, it has built a reputation for handling high transaction volumes while maintaining low fees.Magazine: Memecoins make millionaires, Terraform and Do Kwon liable for fraud, and more: Hodler’s Digest, March 31 – April 6

Crypto Analyst Unveils Massive Bitcoin Price Target, Says BTC Flashing Bullish Chart Pattern - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist believes that Bitcoin (BTC) can skyrocket over 337% based on a classical chart pattern.
Pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 330,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly chart.










Cheds says that based on classical charting rules, Bitcoin could soar close to $300,000 in about two years.
“BTC visual of a bull thesis. Measured move for a weekly cup and handle would be roughly $280,000 BTC, likely sometime in mid-2026.”
Source: Cheds/X
The trader highlights that his price target and timeline go against the two widely held views on Bitcoin’s market cycles. One is that the Bitcoin bull market will likely end in 2025 based on the four-year cycle and the other one involves a theory that BTC is witnessing diminishing returns each cycle.
But in the meantime, Cheds implies that Bitcoin may have already seen the bottom of its latest correction after reclaiming $61,500.
“BTC decent volume cluster building on the four-hour chart… flip $61,500 and it gets interesting.”
Source: Cheds/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin looks bullish following a fakeout to the downside. The chart also shows a diagonal resistance at around $63,500.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $63,438, a fractional increase in the past day.

Bitfinex CTO Debunks Data Breach Rumors On The Crypto Exchange - Coin Edition


							

Bitfinex’s CTO has debunked rumors of a suspected data breach on the crypto exchange’s platform.
Ardoino highlighted irregularities contained in the claim by the acclaimed hackers.
According to Ardoino, only 5,000 of 22,500 broadcasted emails matched with Bitfinex users.




Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino has debunked rumors of a suspected data breach on the crypto exchange’s platform. In a recent post on X, Ardoino explained that information broadcasted by the acclaimed hackers is fake, and not derived from the crypto firm’s database.







After acknowledging the widespread panic among crypto users on the rumored database breach, Ardoino highlighted irregularities contained in the claim by the acclaimed hackers. According to the CTO, the alleged hackers have posted two mega links with sample data containing 22,500 records of email and passwords.



To substantiate his claims, Ardoino noted that Bitfinex does not store plaintext passwords nor 2FA secrets in clear text. Hence, no one can access such details from the platform. He further explained that only 5,000 of 22,500 broadcasted emails matched with Bitfinex users, insisting that only a 100% match rate can prove the broadcasted information was from Bitfinex. 



Meanwhile, Ardoino informed his followers on X that the alleged hackers did not contact Bitfinex. According to him, the hackers published the post on April 25, giving the firm a 7-day ultimatum to contact them. Yet, Ardoino noted that he and his team learned about the post on Friday, May 3.



Furthering his claims, Ardoino said the alleged hackers could have explored any available channels to demand a ransom. According to the CTO, they could have applied through Bitfinex’s bug bounty, customer support ticket, emails, or X account (Twitter).



According to Ardoino, initial investigations reveal the hackers collected a database of emails and passwords likely from different crypto breaches. He noted that most crypto users, unfortunately, use the same email and passwords across multiple sites. He assured users that Bitfinex is performing a deep analysis of its systems and hasn’t found any breach. The CTO also noted that his platform’s KYC has a heavy rate limit that would disallow downloading in bulk.

Oil King (OILKING) to Rally 8,300% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Oil King (OILKING) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Oil King (OILKING), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Oil King presents a similar opportunity.



Oil King has market cap below $25,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate massive returns in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,300% in the coming two days, and Oil King could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Oil King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Oil King on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Oil King by entering its contract address – H5LmDBec75DmGLwtALURVAtLuVDUX1GMh5CGQ8r5h5rU – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like OILKING.

Warren Buffett Warns About AI


Legendary investor Warren Buffett has issued a major warning about artificial intelligence, comparing the red-hot technology to nuclear weapons during a recent shareholder meeting, Axios reports.Buffett's concerns center around the rapid proliferation of AI-powered scams. The American financier has stated that the technology "scares the hell out of him."According to the "Oracle of Omaha," AI has developed to the point where it is hardly possible to decipher what's real and what's actually fake.Buffett, one of the richest people, jokingly described scamming as "the growth industry" of all time.At the same time, he has also acknowledged that his knowledge about AI is limited.The billionaire himself has already fallen victim to scammers. Buffett has recalled how someone used the AI technology to create a convincing deepfake video of him in order to part someone with their money.Of course, Buffett is far from being the only businessman whose identity has been exploited by nefarious actors. As reported by U.Today, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also repeatedly complained about AI fraudsters using his identity in order to promote XRP scams.Of course, plenty of prominent executives have also recognized the promise of AI technologies, with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently comparing it to the steam engine.

Coinbase faces new lawsuit over alleged investor deception

Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States by volume and its CEO, Brian Armstrong, is facing a new class-action lawsuit alleging investor deception into buying securities. The lawsuit is from customers who say the company’s business model was illegal. This lawsuit echoes one already faced by the company. The lawsuit, filed in California’s Northern District by law firm Scott+Scott, representing plaintiffs Gerardo Aceves, Thomas Fan, Edwin Martinez, Tiffany Smoot, Edouard Cordi, and Brett Maggard from California and Florida, alleges that Coinbase’s digital asset sales knowingly violated state securities laws since the company’s inception.In the filing, the plaintiffs asserted that Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Near Protocol (NEAR), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Uniswap (UNI), Tezos (XTZ), and Stellar Lumens (XLM) are securities.Class action suit by the plaintiff   Source: Court ListenerThe complainants claim Coinbase admitted it is a “Securities Broker” in its user agreement, making digital asset securities sold by the exchange as investment contracts or other securities. The plaintiff also took aim at Coinbase prime brokerage as a securities broker/dealer.The plaintiffs seek full rescission, statutory damages under state law, and injunctive relief through a jury trial. This lawsuit resembles another class-action suit alleging consumer harm from Coinbase’s sale of securities. However, Coinbase argued that secondary crypto asset sales didn’t meet securities transaction criteria, disputing the relevance of securities regulations. The court examined various aspects, ultimately overturning some of the lower court’s decisions while upholding others.Related: Coinbase's Base could make it the NVIDIA of DeFiThis new lawsuit is distinct from Coinbase’s highly publicized legal battle with the SEC, which also questions whether tokens sold on Coinbase should be classified as securities. Coinbase has recently filed an interlocutory appeal in response to a judge’s decision allowing the case to proceed.In an April 26 filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, John Deaton, the crypto lawyer currently running a Senate campaign to unseat Elizabeth Warren, filed an amicus brief in support of a motion for interlocutory appeal on behalf of 4,701 Coinbase customers. Coinbase reported a strong rebound in the first quarter of 2024, supported by an uptick in market performance and the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The exchange posted $1.6 billion in total revenue and $1.2 billion in net income for the first quarter, achieving $1 billion in Adjusted EBITDA — which measures a company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Six to Twelve Months of ‘Parabolic Advance’ on the Horizon for Bitcoin, According to On-Chain Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								Prominent on-chain analyst Checkmate is updating his outlook on Bitcoin’s (BTC) current market cycle and says that a parabolic move to the upside is likely in sight.
The pseudonymous analyst tells his 90,000 followers on the social media platform X that based on previous cycles, Bitcoin is most likely in for about six months of “chopsolidation” – or a choppy period of consolidation with no real trend shift.










After six months, Checkmate says that six months to a year’s worth of parabolic moves could be in store, based on historical precedence.
“Bitcoin history tends to rhyme, and thus far, this cycle is no different.
The song sung during the last two cycles paints around six-months of chopsolidation ahead of us, followed by 6-12 months of parabolic advance.”
Source: Checkmate/X
While some are speculating that Bitcoin’s bull run may have already seen its top, Checkmate says such a scenario would be a major break from the “norm” of BTC’s past market cycles.
“If we measure from the cycle high, we see the same chorus.
Establishing a bull market top here would no question be a major break from the Bitcoin norm. It could for sure happen, but we must dig deeper to investigate…
April so far has seen prices drop by over $8,250 MoM (month over month)
I’m expecting text messages from the sidelines saying ‘Hey man, what’s up with Bitcoin, it’s down a lot, I hope you sold it?'”
Checkmate isolates every year in which a Bitcoin halving takes place, and notes that corrections like the one BTC has had since March are par for the course. The analyst also notes that the end of halving years tend to be quite bullish for Bitcoin.
“If we isolate Bitcoin halving years only (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024) we can see MoM performance via table and chart.
MoM corrections of this magnitude are the norm, not the exception, and the end of the year is usually pretty powerful (as per first charts).”

US Authorities Are Going After These Crypto Entities


																Over time, the United States government, through its regulatory agencies, has filed cases against several crypto firms, demanding compliance for their products and services.
While the list is extensive, some cases have stood out, like lawsuits against decentralized protocols like Uniswap, crypto mixing platforms like Tornado Cash, and big firms like Binance and Coinbase.
The U.S. Fights Crypto
The U.S. government’s fight against crypto entities became more intense last year. Within 48 hours in early June, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance and Coinbase, the largest crypto exchanges globally and in the country. The allegations against the entities were similar: failure to register as brokers, national securities exchanges, clearing agencies, and violation of U.S. securities laws.
Two months after the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits, the  Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the co-founders of Tornado Cash, accusing them of laundering over $1 billion in criminal proceeds. This was a year after the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the crypto mixer for its ties to cybercrime groups.
Toward the end of last year, the SEC sued the crypto exchange Kraken on the same charges it brought against Binance and Coinbase. Around the same time, the DOJ charged Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), with willfully violating the Bank Secrecy Act. The case saw the crypto exchange pay a fine of $4.3 billion, while CZ resigned from the role of CEO with a $50 million penalty.
The War Against DeFi
In March 2024, the DOJ charged crypto exchange KuCoin and its founders with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.
Last month, the SEC filed a notice of intent to sue Uniswap Labs, the company behind the largest decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap, for reasons yet to be disclosed. Around the same period, blockchain software technology company Consensys received a Wells Notice from the agency signaling intent of enforcement action against the company for violations of securities laws through its MetaMask wallet.
Also, the DOJ arrested and charged the founders of privacy-focused bitcoin wallet Samourai in the same month, accusing them of enabling over $100 million in laundered funds. At the time of writing, the wallet’s services were shut down, and its websites were seized. In addition, the DOJ recently arrested early BTC investor Roger Ver, popularly known as Bitcoin Jesus, for allegedly evading up to $50 million in taxes.
Meanwhile, one remarkable case in the industry is the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which has helped the crypto community clarify crypto asset securities.

Bitcoin could drop further if this support zone is crushed


Bitcoin (BTC) has recently demonstrated a significant recovery, climbing above the $60,000 threshold, a development that follows a tumultuous week where its price dropped below $57,000 prior to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. 
This marked a surprising 8% drawdown, sending Bitcoin to its lowest in two months. However, amid a broader stock market rise and a weaker-than-expected US jobs report, Bitcoin’s price trajectory is looking optimistic.
In this context, RLinda, a prominent crypto analyst and professional trader, emphasized the importance of the key $64,500 level for Bitcoin in her May 5 TradingView post.

A breakout and consolidation above this key resistance could set the stage for further growth, potentially propelling prices towards $73,000. Such a movement would signify a shift in market dynamics from neutral to decidedly bullish.

“The trend is still strong and bullish. The price is in a sideways range and continues to collect liquidity. The range boundaries are 73500 – 60000K. The key level below which there is a huge pool of liquidity is 59300-59500, there is a high probability that Bitcoin can test this area before further growth. I am expecting a rise because Bitcoin’s technical and fundamental components look very promising: Bullish trend, liquidity gathering at the expense of sellers (potential for growth), buyers are very confident to keep the price in the range, introduction of BTC-ETF in Hong Kong, which will only attract new investors and their money.”- she said

RLinda‘s analysis points out that while the $64,500 level is a crucial hurdle for Bitcoin, it’s equally important to consider the support levels that underpin the current price structure.
Key liquidity pools are observed between $59,300 and $59,500. Breaching these levels could lead to a significant price surge. However, support levels at $61,500, $60,200, and particularly $59,300 must hold to prevent further declines. If these support zones are crushed, Bitcoin could face a sharp downturn, challenging the bearish thresholds.
Market trends and strategic outlook
With increasing institutional interest, as demonstrated by substantial investments in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) the bullish sentiment around Bitcoin continues to solidify. 
RLinda advises traders to closely monitor the market’s reaction to significant price levels and adjust their strategies accordingly, whether they are targeting bounce plays or preparing for potential false breakouts.
A crucial risk zone to watch is around $58,900. A breach here could indicate mounting downward pressure, confirming a bearish trend for Bitcoin. 
Conversely, maintaining momentum above the $64,500 resistance level could confirm the market’s bullish outlook, setting Bitcoin on a path toward higher valuations.

Elsewhere, a review of Bitcoin’s technical analysis shows a bullish momentum. A summary of the one-day gauges recommends ‘buy’ at 11; whole moving averages are for a ‘buy’ at 10. Despite Oscillators remaining  ‘neutral’ at 8,  there is a strong sentiment among traders anticipating an upward movement in price.
Overall, the market remains poised on the edge of a potential movement, likely setting the stage for an upcoming rally.

Bitcoin price can target $73,000 soon if this happens


Bitcoin (BTC) continues its recovery journey following a sharp decline that saw the flagship cryptocurrency plummet to as low as $56,000. 
Currently, Bitcoin is encountering resistance at the $65,000 mark, with market participants suggesting that breaching this level could propel the digital asset to above $70,000.
In this context, crypto analyst RLinda shared insights in a TradingView post on May 4, emphasizing the significance of monitoring a price target of $64,500.


According to the analysis, should Bitcoin break through and consolidate its price above this threshold, it could pave the way for further upward momentum, potentially pushing the price towards $73,000.

She highlighted that a breakout and consolidation above the $64,500 mark could signal a shift in market sentiment, transitioning from a neutral or bearish stance to a bullish one. This change in market dynamics could attract more investors, further fueling Bitcoin’s ascent.

“All eyes on 64500. Breakthrough and consolidation of the price above this level will be the reason for further growth to $73,000. A breakout and consolidation of the price above this zone ($64,500) may cause further growth,” the expert said. 

The expert also observed a local consolidation phase on the shorter timeframes, indicating that Bitcoin appears to be strengthening by 14% and testing a crucial area. This suggests a level of confidence in Bitcoin’s current trajectory.
Bitcoin’s risk areas to watch 
However, it’s important to note that the market expert pointed out that Bitcoin is not totally out of the woods yet, identifying a potential risk zone of around $58,900. 
Amidst the swirling projections surrounding Bitcoin’s price trajectory, the cryptocurrency faced a sluggish start to May, with bears seemingly gaining the upper hand over bulls. This resulted in Bitcoin’s price dipping to $56,000, marking its lowest point in approximately two months. 
The heightened volatility emerged following the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates.
Bitcoin found some resilience in the wake of lower-than-expected United States employment data. This development will likely pressure the Fed to consider initiating an interest rate cut.
Furthermore, activity within the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sphere appears to influence Bitcoin. Particularly noteworthy were the first inflows for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in nearly three months, signaling renewed investor confidence.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $63,779, boasting one-day gains of nearly 1%. On the weekly timeframe, BTC has seen an increase of about 0.26%.

Additionally, Bitcoin’s technical indicators, which are predominantly bullish, mirror the current market momentum. A summary of the one-day metrics retrieved from TradingView suggests a ‘buy’ rating at 11 while moving averages also indicate a ‘buy’ sentiment at 10. Oscillators are currently at a ‘neutral’ stance, tallying at 8.
Bitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView
In summary, all eyes are on Bitcoin bulls to sustain the cryptocurrency above the $63,000 mark and propel it towards the $65,000 threshold. Achieving this milestone would position the asset favorably for a potential resurgence towards the $70,000 mark.

Top Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Hit $150,000 In 2025, Here’s Why


                            In the last week, Bitcoin has shown much resilience bouncing back above the $60,000 zone after a significant decline to below the $57,000 price zone. As Bitcoin bulls gather momentum to possibly initiate the crypto bull run, top analyst and market expert Peter Brandt has backed BTC to attain a particular six-figure digit value by 2025.


No Other Market Like Bitcoin, Brandt Says
In a blog post on May 3, Peter Brandt shared some insights on Bitcoin in celebration of his 50th anniversary in future markets trading. The veteran analyst described his experience with the maiden cryptocurrency as a “once-in-a-lifetime trade, never to be equaled”.

Brandt states that Bitcoin is a unique asset in comparison to commodities such as gold, cattle, iron ore, copper,  and even other cryptocurrencies such as altcoins and meme coins. He claims that BTC owes this uniqueness to its operational nature as well as its price behavior.
Analyzing BTC price history, Brandt notes that the coin has repeatedly produced exponential gains in the past not seen with any other trading asset. And while these gains are followed by significant corrections, the overall price performance sets BTC apart from other assets. 
Another aspect of Bitcoin’s uniqueness as highlighted by Brandt is that the asset’s volatility is also evident in its downturns resulting in a decline of more than 50% and even 75%. Therefore, Bitcoin exerts a special ability to generate substantial profits while also causing significant losses.
Now, following BTC’s parabolic price nature, Brandt predicts the asset is on course to reach $150,000 by 2025. Interestingly, if the bulls maintain market control, the analyst believes Bitcoin could rise as high as $300,000 beyond 2026.


BTC Price Overview
At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $63,303 having encountered serious resistance in the $64,000 price zone. The maiden cryptocurrency currently looks to be in consolidation and could be preparing for another possible breakout. 
If Bitcoin embarks on a bull run, investors would be hoping for a return to its all-time high value of $73,750. However, in the advent of more selling pressure in the future, BTC could drop below $60,000 again. Nevertheless, Bitcoin remains the diamond of the crypto bull season with several analysts hyping the digital asset to trade above $100,000 within the next 12 to 15 months.

Kraken Pro Expands Margin Trading with Shiba Inu Cryptocurrency, Emphasizing Community-Driven Growth



                    

Kraken Pro, a prominent U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, has recently announced the addition of new margin trading pairs, featuring Shiba Inu (SHIB), a popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency. 



This new offering allows SHIB to be traded on margin against the U.S. dollar. 




The exchange has set the maximum leverage for these transactions at three times, with a limit of 1.5 billion SHIB for both long and short positions.



Shiba Inu, known as an Ethereum-based meme coin, was first launched in 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. 



The coin was conceptualized to explore what could happen if a cryptocurrency was entirely community-driven. 




This initiative poses the question: “What would happen if a cryptocurrency project was 100% run by its community?”



Four years after its inception, Shiba Inu has risen to become the 11th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which now stands at about $13.49 billion. 



Alongside SHIB, the Shiba Inu ecosystem comprises other cryptocurrencies such as BONE and LEASH, accumulating a market capitalization of approximately $180 million.

The ecosystem also includes Shibarium, a layer-2 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain, which was launched in August 2023. 



Since its launch, Shibarium has locked in a total value of $2.46 million. 



The blockchain statistics for Shiba Inu are notable, with 105,393 accounts, 1.79 million addresses, 415.52 million completed transactions, and 2,265 verified smart contracts, according to Shibariumscan.



The growth and development of Shiba Inu reflect its significant evolution from a mere dog-inspired meme to a substantial crypto ecosystem. 



Its primary token, SHIB, not only enjoys widespread acceptance as a payment method across various large platforms but also shows promise for further expansion with its continued inclusion on major trading platforms. 



This progress underscores the coin’s potential beyond the typical expectations of a meme-based cryptocurrency.

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) to Explode 12,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Dogecoin and Bonk Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK) made astronomical returns, and Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 12,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DOCPEPE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Doctor Pepe.



Currently, Doctor Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DOCPEPE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – 3n8HMVVfMF2uqdpts5TUETAHUrvD1AFg8V1XLahpeTT8 – in the receiving field.




DOCPEPE currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Analyst Says Bottom Is In for Altcoin Markets, Predicts Crypto Rally Following Weak Economic Data - The Daily Hodl


								Popular analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes that crypto is gearing up for a marketwide rally amid signs of slowing economic activity.
Van de Poppe tells his 716,300 followers on the social media platform X he’s bullish on crypto after the US labor market missed estimates in April.










With unemployment rising to 3.9% and average hourly earnings growing less than expected, the analyst believes that the Fed will be forced to turn on the money printers to support the job market.
“Terrible economic data -> DXY (US dollar index) down, additionally the case for QE (quantitative easing) and rate cuts will increase and therefore risk-on assets rally.
Bitcoin back [above] $61,600.
FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) was the low for the markets and the altcoin bull market has started.”
Looking at the market capitalization of all altcoins, the trader predicts that the alt market will witness a consolidation period before rallying to fresh all-time highs.
“The total altcoin market capitalization generally has seen the bottom of this correction. I think $880-$920 billion is the area where it’s going to stabilize, before a run towards the all-time high is on the horizon.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
The analyst also says that the return of retail traders is now in sight. He believes they will enter the crypto markets once altcoins print sizeable gains.
“Retail isn’t even in the markets, while Bitcoin is around the all-time highs.
When will they come back?
It will probably be after this summer when altcoins start to lift off.
They hold altcoins, so when they start to turn, they jump back in.

Token distribution tactics should focus on real value, not hype, says Uniswap founder - Crypto Briefing




While initial interest in blockchain projects might be sparked by marketing strategies like airdrops, what truly matters is what keeps users engaged with the project in the long run. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams shared his opinion on good token distribution, suggesting that token marketing should focus on providing real value, rather than merely building hype.“Don’t market token price – if you tweet about how your token is going to moon or hire influencers, or marketing firms to do so I assume you’re just trying to get rich quick vs build real value,” Adam noted in a recent discussion on the ethics of token distribution.Adam also outlined several principles he believes should guide token distributions, including the avoidance of ambiguous teasers and the necessity for real liquidity from day one.“Don’t farm the farmers – teasing and creating ambiguity around a token distribution to grow your numbers is bad behavior. If you don’t know yet, don’t speculate publicly. If you do know but are not ready to share full details, don’t tease them out. Just share real details when ready,” Adam stated.He additionally criticized the creation of low-float tokens, which he considers “malicious,” and the manipulation of token supply to exploit unit bias.“You don’t need to work with exchanges or market makers. It’s so easy. Just distribute enough tokens publicly that real price discovery happens on DEX. People should start thinking in FDV not [market cap] when valuing these things,” Adam noted. “Don’t create absurdly high token supply to farm people with unit bias, this is also bad behavior,” he added.Adam further advised against stinginess in token distribution. According to him, giving away a significant portion of tokens to the community shows a commitment to the community’s growth and trust. “If you don’t think the community deserves a significant amount, don’t release a token,” he stated.The Uniswap founder stressed the importance of making deliberate and well-considered decisions regarding token distribution. According to him, projects should be able to stand behind their choices with confidence and clear reasoning, without having to constantly defend themselves or apologize for their actions.“Put real thought and care into your decisions – so you can stand behind them and explain your rationale. Don’t end up in a situation where you’re fighting or apologizing to crypto twitter. Create something you’re proud of and stand behind it,” he stated.Adam’s comments follow recent debates surrounding token airdrops and distributions of several prominent projects, which attracted mixed opinions from the communities after announcing their tokenomics.A highly-anticipated token airdrop from LayerZero also received criticism and praise for its approach to Sybil behavior.

Binance-Listed Project Makes Official Statement on its Altcoin After Heavy Criticism - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a recent development, Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons expressed his concerns about the token offering of the cryptocurrency project Sui.
Bons criticized that more than 8 billion SUIs have been staked and more than 84% of the staked supply is controlled by the founding team. He also pointed out that the founders control most of the supply without any lock-in period and legal guarantees.


In response to these doubts expressed by the community, Sui clarified in his official response that the founders of MystenLabs do not control the Sui Foundation treasury, community reserve, staking allowances, or tokens allocated to investors. According to the statement, Sui Foundation is the largest owner of locked tokens.

In the official statement made by Sui, the following was emphasized:






“Recently, there have been some misleading posts about Sui's token offering. Let's clarify the situation, starting with the basics: locked tokens are locked by third-party custodians. They cannot be moved and are securely stored until unlocked according to Sui's token emission program. Additionally, 100% of the staking rewards earned by the Sui Foundation are returned to the community and included in the public emissions program.”

Brace for 'the biggest altseason' with $4 trillion altcoin market cap in sight


Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent surge to a record $73,750, followed by a pullback to $61,000, has set the stage for what many in the cryptocurrency sector believe could be the onset of an altcoin season. Diverse predictions from analysts hint at a massive upswing in altcoin valuations.
While Bitcoin traditionally kickstarts market cycles with a strong surge, the real action often unfolds during its consolidation phases, where other cryptocurrencies typically take the lead. This trend is expected to be more pronounced in the upcoming period, fueled by varying forecasts from leading analysts.
The integration of decentralized finance (DeFi), advancements in blockchain scalability, and the expanding use of smart contracts are key factors contributing to a potential altcoin rally, which could significantly alter the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.


Expert predictions on altcoin breakouts
Ted, an expert analyst, recently shared an analysis on X (formerly Twitter) suggesting a significant upturn in the altcoin market. 
He pointed out a potential breakout, underpinned by technical patterns like the inverse head-and-shoulders formation, hinting at a bullish trend that could push the total market cap to $4 trillion. 
This growth is expected to unfold over the coming months, potentially reigniting significant interest from retail investors.

Furthermore, another trader and analyst Moustache highlighted in a recent post that “we are entering the largest altcoin season in at least four years”, drawing parallels from historical data.

On April 24, he noted that the total market cap of altcoins, represented by TOTAL2, had completed the ABC-correction phases of the Wyckoff method and was experiencing a breakout. This has stirred anticipation among crypto investors, as altcoins often offer higher risk-to-reward returns.
Despite these optimistic assessments, there’s a contrasting signal from the altcoin season index by Blockchain Center.
According to this index:

“If 75% of the top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days), it is Altcoin Season.”

The index shows that only 51% of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. As the index is below 75, it suggests that it is not yet officially altcoin season, providing a more cautious perspective amid the enthusiastic forecast.
While the enthusiasm around an impending altcoin season is palpable, driven by technological advances and bullish analyst predictions, the more cautious altcoin season index reminds investors of the risks and uncertainties in predicting market movements. 
This blend of optimism and caution underscores the complex and dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets, where opportunities and risks coexist.

Bitcoin: Here's how long you should wait for BTC's rally to $71K - AMBCrypto



BTC’s price moved marginally in the last 24 hours. 
Metrics and indicators suggested that BTC might turn volatile in the next seven days. 

Several investors speculated a fresh bull rally for Bitcoin [BTC] as its price gained upward momentum on the 3rd of May. 
However, the growth dropped as the king of cryptos’ price only moved marginally in the last 24 hours. Does this hint at yet another price correction? 
Is Bitcoin actually bullish?
Moustache, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting a few developments that hinted towards a bull rally. 
For the uninitiated, BTC’s price plummeted under $61k on the 30th of April. However, the king coin managed to come back above that mark, turning it into a support and hinting at a further price uptick. 
The tweet highlighted that BTC bounded up after touching a key trendline. Historically, whenever BTC’s price rebounded after touching the trendline, its price has risen sharply. 
Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) broke above a falling wedge pattern. This indicated that the RSI would increase, which supported the possibility of BTC’s bull run. 
AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode’s data revealed yet another bullish signal. We found that Bitcoin’s reserve risk gained upward momentum inside the green zone. 
Each time this happened in the past, BTC’s price gained bullish momentum.
Source: Glassnode
What to expect from BTC
Though these aforementioned metrics looked bullish, BTC’s price action didn’t correspond. As per CoinMarketCap, BTC’s price only moved marginally in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, the coin was trading at $63,368.70 with a market capitalization of over $1.25 trillion. 
However, investors mustn’t lose hope yet, as a few metrics hint at an increase in BTC’s volatility.

 AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that BTC’s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days’ average, suggesting low selling pressure. 
The coin’s Coinbase premium was also green, meaning that buying sentiment was dominant among U.S. investors. 
Source: CryptoQuant
A few of the market indicators also suggested that BTC could turn volatile in a northward direction in the next seven days. 
Notably, the coin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick. Its MACD displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover.

If BTC manages to turn volatile next week, then it will be crucial for the coin to go above the $66.9k resistance level. A successful breakout above that level could allow BTC to touch $71k.
If everything remains bullish, then BTC can even cross its all-time high in coming days.

Uniswap CEO weighs In on ethical token distribution

Hayden Adams, Uniswap’s founder and CEO, has outlined his take on ethical considerations for effective token distribution. This comes a few days after the crypto community raised concerns about the transparency and fairness of token distribution on EigenLayer.In an X post, Adams emphasized that he was discussing tokens, not points. He then criticized the practice of teasing and creating ambiguity during token distribution to inflate engagement metrics.Adams cautioned against public speculation, mainly when the team is uncertain about future developments. He advised against teasing if one possesses information about a token distribution but does not plan to disclose the details.Source:  Hayden AdamsUsers who felt left out of the recently announced EigenLayer users who felt left out on a recently announced airdrop lashed out at the restaking protocol’s Monday announcement — highlighting its nontransferable token structure, aggressive geo-restrictions, and an apparently short snapshot period.The Uniswap executive strongly disapproved of low float tokens, considering them malicious and his biggest pet peeve. He believes that projects can effectively distribute tokens without relying on exchanges or market makers. He says the ideal approach is to distribute tokens openly, enabling genuine price discovery on decentralized exchanges (DEX).Adams also criticized the practice of creating an excessively high token supply to exploit people’s unit bias, stating that such an approach is unnecessary. Additionally, Adams advised token distributors against being too conservative, encouraging them to make a substantial portion of their tokens available for distribution.Related: SEC targets Uniswap Labs, raising concerns over open-source code liabilityHayden Adams cautioned against inadequate token distribution, particularly if the issuer does not believe the community deserves it. He also emphasized the importance of not revealing token prices during or before distribution. Any attempt to do so, whether through influencers or marketing firms, would raise suspicions about the project.According to Adams, this approach suggests that the issuer is prioritizing quick wealth over building real value. Token issuers and distributors are encouraged to maintain a straightforward distribution process, resonating with concerns raised due to recent industry rug pulls. Finally, the Uniswap executive urged token issuers to be thoughtful and transparent about their projects. He emphasized the importance of releasing a token they can be proud of and stand behind to avoid ridicule within the crypto community.EigenLayer, an Ethereum restaking protocol, distributed an additional 28 million EIGEN tokens to over 280,000 wallets following its initial airdrop, prompted by user concerns over the program’s restrictions.Magazine: The real risks to Ethena’s stablecoin model (are not the ones you think)

Vodafone Plans To Use SIM Card Tech For Blockchain-based Digital Wallets - Coin Edition


							

David Palmer underscored the importance of leveraging SIM card technology for blockchain integration.
Existing Reports show that 8 billion mobile devices will be in use by 2030.
Digital wallets on mobile phones will surge to 5.6 billion by 2030.




Vodafone Blockchain Lead and PairPoint CPO David Palmer has emphasized the pivotal role of mobile phones as the primary gateway to digital applications and commerce. In a recent interview, Palmer underscored the importance of leveraging SIM card technology for blockchain integration.







Discussing with Brian McGleenon, a renowned finance journalist, Palmer highlighted the sheer scale of mobile phone usage, citing a report predicting that 8 billion devices will be in use by 2030. He forecasted a mass adoption of blockchain-based digital wallets on mobile phones, predicting a surge to 5.6 billion wallets by 2030.



According to Palmer, the mobile phone is the touchpoint between people and accessing applications and doing business. With SIM cards as the soul of mobile phones, Palmer highlighted that his company is focusing on linking SIM cards to digital identity and blockchains.  The PairPoint CPO noted that his organization will use cryptography in the SIM cards for the planned integration.



Emphasizing the anticipated surge in digital wallets, Palmer identified the innovation as the gateway between people and financial services. He considers such wallets as tools to hold digital identity and other credentials. Hence, his company plans to link the wallets to SIM cards with the hardware needed for future transactional models.









In his view, Palmer believes the long-term pathway for the proposed innovation is to use public blockchains. He acknowledged that recent blockchain developments like Layer 2 protocols and the Ethereum fork are bringing about faster blockchains. However, he cited regulations in financial services as a factor that could prevent the use of public blockchains. 



For integration solutions, Palmer noted that PaiPoint provides a collaborative structure enabling big enterprises to use public blockchains by linking to PairPoint’s chain. That way, they can execute the Smart Contract, utilizing the private blockchain.

Dogecoin could be on the road to a 'long-term bullish rally' - Analyst’s take


Meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to dominate the spotlight amid the ongoing market recovery, posting significant gains as it strives to breach the $0.20 resistance.
In this regard,  a crypto analyst using the pseudonym Behdark in a TradingView post on May 5 suggested that, based on technical indicators, Dogecoin’s price could be poised for a ‘long-term bullish rally.
The chart analysis indicated that Dogecoin may be in the final stages of a bullish diametric pattern with the current market position. Diametric patterns are characterized by alternating waves of price contraction and expansion, often leading to significant price swings.

Notably, the expert identified a robust support zone at $0.10, which has consistently propelled the price upwards whenever tested. This pattern suggests bullish market sentiment favoring higher prices, a factor that could instill confidence in Dogecoin traders.
DOGE enters bullish wave
According to the expert, Dogecoin appears to have entered a bullish wave marked by a notable uptrend. Compared to previous market movements, the current bullish wave is anticipated to last more than 500 days, signifying a potential sustained upward momentum.

“A strong support zone has formed on the chart (shown in green). Every time the price returns to this area, it will be rejected to the upside. From where we placed the green arrow on the chart, the price has entered a bullish wave,” the expert said. 

Additionally, the market analyst referenced a significant correction period lasting nearly 900 days preceding the current wave. In this case, such extended correction phases are typical in cryptocurrency markets and often precede substantial price movements. 
Dogecoin records spike in network activity 
Indeed, Dogecoin continues to be dominated by bullish sentiments, a trend also reflected in on-chain data. Notably, amidst the ongoing rally, data from IntoTheBlock highlighted increased network activity, contributing to sustained buying pressure surrounding the token.
For instance, data shared on May 3 indicated a significant spike in new Dogecoin addresses, with the platform adding 28,000 addresses on May 2 alone, marking a 102% increase from the monthly low observed earlier in the week.

At the same time, according to on-chain data, the coin appears to be experiencing renewed interest and engagement, evidenced by a surge in non-empty wallets. Insights provided by Santiment revealed a 27% increase in Dogecoin non-empty wallets over the last six months, totaling 6.6 million wallets.
In addition to network activity, Dogecoin is counting on other perennial catalysts to drive its price toward $0.20, a crucial level that could potentially propel the coin toward the $1 mark. Notably, investors are closely monitoring events involving Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.
In the latest development, Tesla’s payments page has been updated to include Dogecoin formally. Under this development,  DOGE will be accepted as payment for select Tesla merchandise. Furthermore, the potential role of DOGE in X Payments is a topic that has piqued investors’ interest. 
DOGE price analysis
By press time, DOGE was trading at $0.16 with daily gains of approximately 1.5%. On the weekly chart, the meme coin has seen an increase of nearly 8%.

In conclusion, it is worth noting that DOGE has increasingly traded in tandem with Bitcoin (BTC). Therefore, in addition to technical indicators and network activity, the token’s trajectory significantly hinges on how the maiden cryptocurrency performs in the market.

Solana-Based Dogwifhat and Dogecoin Pare Gains as Bitcoin Struggles to Reclaim $64K


Some of the major meme coins have pared their gains, struggling to maintain their momentum, according to CoinGecko data.At press time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the only major cryptocurrency in the red, adding more than 1.5% over the past 24 hours.Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also in the red, losing 3% over the past 24 hours.Dogwifhat, a Solana-based upstart, is down more than 3% despite previously recording a double-digit gain.Bonk, another Solana-based cryptocurrency, is the worst performer among the leading altcoins, losing more than 8%.Greed returns to marketAccording to the "Fear and Greed" index, the market is once again dominated by greed.Yet, this excitement might be premature given that Bitcoin is still struggling to surpass the $64,000 level. The significant sentiment shift comes after the leading cryptocurrency succumbed to "fear" following a massive drop to the $56,000 level last week.Top performersWith Bitcoin being in consolidation mode, other major cryptocurrencies are also struggling to post significant gains.However, there are still some outliers. Monero (XM) and Avalanche (AVAX) are both up by almost 3%.Algorand (ALDO) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) are also in the green despite being named as unregistered securities in the recent class action lawsuit against Coinbase.

Coinbase Charged With Operating “Fundamentally Illegal” Crypto Empire - Coin Edition


							

Coinbase is sued in a class action, claiming its token sales violate securities laws.
The lawsuit questions Coinbase’s decade-long legality of its business model.
The outcome of Coinbase’s ongoing SEC battle could influence this lawsuit’s fate.




Coinbase, the leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is embroiled in a new class action lawsuit alleging its business model is fundamentally illegal. The suit was filed by Scott+Scott in the Northern District of California on Friday, April 3. It represents plaintiffs from California and Florida who claim Coinbase has consistently violated state securities laws.



Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that Coinbase has been operating in “a shady crypto ecosystem outside the law for over ten years.” They asserted that the company’s whole business model is based on a lie: that it does not sell securities. According to them, Coinbase’s strategy seems to be hoping to get forgiven later rather than asking for permission upfront.









Notably, the legal action mirrors a previous case against Coinbase, which was initially dismissed but has since been partially revived by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The core issue at hand is whether the digital assets sold on Coinbase’s platform are, in fact, securities.



Coinbase has dismissed the allegations as “legally baseless” and expressed confidence in the judicial process to resolve the matter. However, this is not the company’s only legal challenge. 



It is also in a high-profile battle with the U.S. SEC over whether its listed tokens are securities. Coinbase is currently appealing a judge’s recent decision that approved the case for trial. Legal experts anticipate that the SEC’s court case will determine whether digital assets are classified as securities rather than relying on class-action lawsuits. 



Attorney John Jasnoch, known for his involvement in class-action litigation against various crypto entities, filed the new lawsuit. His previous cases have targeted projects like Safemoon and Ethereum Max, the latter of which resulted in a hefty fine for celebrity Kim Kardashian due to promotional activities.

Cardano (ADA) Founder Floats Idea to Integrate Surprise Altcoin into Cardano - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson has initiated discussions on X about the potential to transform Bitcoin Cash (BCH) into a “Cardano Public Chain” with advanced blockchain technologies.
More than 10,000 votes have now been cast, with 65% supporting the proposal.


Hoskinson's proposal aims to increase Bitcoin Cash's functionality as a proof-of-work chain by integrating it with Cardano's technological features.
Bitcoin Cash, a fork of the original Bitcoin protocol, was launched in 2017 to address scalability issues by increasing the cryptocurrency block size. Over the years, it has developed a unique community and found its place in the world of digital assets. Despite the legal challenges faced by prominent supporter Roger Ver, the Bitcoin Cash community remains active with ongoing projects aimed at improving the usability and adoption of the network.






Roger Ver was recently arrested in Spain and the extradition process to the USA was initiated.
Hoskinson's interest extends beyond the proposal in question. Hoskinson recently expressed curiosity about Bitcoin Cash's current developments and future roadmap. In another social media post, he asked the community to share details of ongoing projects and priorities in the BCH ecosystem.

Are Ethereum And XRP Securities? Ripple CEO Weighs In On The Debate


								The US Securities and Exchange Commission has long been at loggerheads with the crypto industry, especially concerning the security status of some cryptocurrencies. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently had some strong opinions on the matter that he’s not afraid to share. While speaking at an interview, Garlinghouse noted that the SEC is “grossly wrong” in its approach of classifying both XRP and ETH as securities. 

Garlinghouse: XRP And ETH Are Clearly Not Securities
Garlinghouse’s take on the matter was first brought to light in a social media post by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett. His comments were made in a fireside chat that took place in Las Vegas to discuss the future of digital assets. 


It is no longer news that Ripple and the SEC have been in a legal tussle for the past few years regarding the security status of XRP, a cryptocurrency created by the payments technology company. Similarly, there have been recent reports that players at the SEC are now looking into Ethereum on whether it qualifies as a security or not.
Ripple and Garlinghouse have taken a strong stance over the years and remain steadfast regarding XRP’s non-security status. The CEO has now reiterated his view and made some comments that crypto enthusiasts and investors would love to hear.
Apart from saying that XRP and ETH are not securities, Garlinghouse noted that SEC Gary Gensler is an “unethical human being.” This is most likely because of his criticisms against the cryptocurrency industry, which many investors have deemed to be unjust.

Ethereum is now trading at $3138. Chart: TradingView
The Future Of Crypto Regulation
Garlinghouse’s comments have come at a critical time when regulators are closely monitoring cryptocurrencies. The crypto industry is yet to have a clear-cut regulatory mechanism and regulators around the world are working to make this a reality. 
Interestingly, XRP is now the only cryptocurrency with regulatory clarity in the US after a federal judge declared the sale of XRP to retail investors sale of non-securities. However, both parties are still in court regarding the sale of XRP to institutional investors. Most analysts think the case will eventually result in a settlement. 
At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.53. Its failure to break above $1 for the past two years has led some investors and crypto analysts to label it as being dead in terms of investment.

According to a Fox Business report, SEC Chair Gensler could be looking to class Ethereum as a security under the Howey Test. As the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum’s classification as a security could lead to a chain reaction of setbacks in its growth and other cryptocurrencies.
While Garlinghouse is critical of the SEC’s handling of crypto regulation, he is optimistic about regulations emerging outside the US, especially in the European Union.

Where to store your crypto: Wallets provide diverse options for holders

Being in control of your own assets — having total freedom of how and to whom they are sent — is a foundational tenant of cryptocurrencies. Today, over 10,000 cryptocurrencies exist on a multitude of blockchains. With the increased adoption and proliferation of digital assets, crypto users have more options than ever regarding how they store their assets.However, there are trade-offs to consider: Hot wallets, those connected to the internet, are convenient for making frequent transactions but are more susceptible to hacks. Conversely, cold wallets are far more secure but more suited to storing crypto than actively using it. Further consideration must be given to whether a wallet is custodial or noncustodial, meaning whether the user is in charge of their own private keys or whether a third party holds them. Custodial wallets may be easier to use, especially for newcomers to cryptocurrency, but they are more exposed to security breaches, censorship, fees and fraud.With all of these complicated choices, Cointelegraph looked at five different wallets to consider their strengths and weaknesses. MetaMaskMetaMask is a decentralized wallet that has been downloaded over 22 million times as of 2023. It is available as a browser extension and mobile application, which users can download for free.The wallet is noncustodial and supports Ether (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens by default, but it can also connect to BNB Chain, Polygon, Optimism and others, as well as decentralized finance (DeFi) and GameFi applications.MetaMask’s user interface is relatively straightforward. Users can send and receive crypto by copying a wallet address or using a QR code. They can also purchase ETH with fiat through the “Wire” and “CoinSwitch” options. Users can also import an existing wallet using a saved JSON file with a private key. Hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger can be connected to MetaMask, but this feature is available only on the browser version. However, MetaMask does not support popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Tronix (TRX) and XRP (XRP), which may be a disadvantage for some users.Security is also a concern, as MetaMask has long been a popular target for scammers. One well-known scam tactic redirects unwary users to fake websites that request access to their MetaMask wallets. Metamask wallet.

It was created with the support of crypto exchange Binance.The wallet boasts several safety features, including a PIN code, login password, fingerprint scan and even a built-in self-destruct mechanism. It also has an air-gapped sign-in mechanism that does not require users to connect to the internet or Bluetooth.The device has the same internal hardware security — the Secure Element chip — as Ledger hardware wallets, but it is somewhat cheaper at $49.99.The SafePal S1 allows users to store a potentially unlimited number of cryptocurrencies on 54 different blockchains. It also has its own utility token, SafePal Token (SFP), which is listed on Binance. The wallet has a lithium battery that charges in three hours and can last up to 20 days.SafePal S1 wallet.

Hackers made off with nearly $170,000 through the exploit. Developers fixed the problem once it was flagged, and the wallet reimbursed affected users.

When choosing a wallet, users must decide for which purposes they need it, whether that be to make transfers to other users, trade on cryptocurrency exchanges, or store savings. Desktop or mobile crypto wallets are more suitable for everyday use, payment and receiving transfers.

Nigeria could halt P2P crypto trading tomorrow


The Nigerian government is taking further steps to regulate the cryptocurrency sector, with the latest move focusing on managing peer-to-peer (P2P) trading within the country. 
Specifically, through the country’s Securities Exchange Commission, the government is reportedly considering suspending P2P trading after a scheduled meeting on May 6, local media outlet Punch reported on May 5. 
The move to regulate the $56.7 billion P2P market comes amid growing concerns about the potential use of cryptocurrencies to facilitate illicit activities and the possible devaluation of the local currency, the naira.


According to the publication, the suspension may be temporary, intended to allow the government to establish a comprehensive set of rules. Sources familiar with the matter indicated that authorities may engage with crypto sector players to develop the regulations.

“The newly appointed Director General of the Nigeria Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed an industry-wide meeting with the Nigeria blockchain community. The meeting will be facilitated by the Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee of Nigeria,” said the Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee of Nigeria (BICCoN).

Need for crypto rules clarity 
Interestingly, crypto stakeholders hope the meeting will clarify the sector’s rules. For instance, the President of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, Obinna Iwuno, noted that they hope to finally get clarity.

“There is a whole lot going on. It is not just clear the direction as we speak, but hopefully, on Monday, we will get to have a position,” Iwuno said. 

The Nigerian central bank had hinted at possible trade regulation following the institution’s decision to bar major fintech firms from onboarding new customers as part of an ongoing audit of their Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process.
Notably, at least three prominent fintech startups—Moniepoint, Paga, and Palmpay— opted to block accounts engaged in crypto transactions and report such activities to law enforcement authorities.
Role of crypto in Nigeria
Overall, this development could be a setback for cryptocurrency traders in Nigeria, estimated to number 33.4 million. Many rely on trading as a source of income in Africa’s most populous country.
It’s worth noting that many Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies partly as a hedge against the devaluation of the local currency, the naira. 
As reported by Finbold, the Nigerian naira has continued its downward trend against the United States dollar, reaching a new record low due to foreign currency shortages.

Is THIS threatening the Solana ecosystem? Yes, but here's why SOL is safe - AMBCrypto



Sui Network flipped Solana in terms of transaction activity.
DEX volumes on the network plummeted as the TVL continued to soar.

Activity on the Solana [SOL] has grown significantly over the past few months. However, recently, other competitors were seen to be going toe to toe with the network.
For instance, the SUI network recently outperformed Solana in terms of daily transactions.
This indicated that not only Solana was having a tough time attracting new users and creating engagement in its ecosystem, but the users were also moving to other networks and ecosystems.
Solana is not really in trouble
However, not all of these transactions are legitimate. In a recent tweet, Artemis clarified that a large number of transactions that were occurring on the SUI network were being caused by Spam Sui.
For context, the Sui network has a dApp called Spam Sui that offers a unique “Spam to Earn” concept. Unlike traditional crypto mining, you earn “SPAM” coins simply by sending transactions on the Sui network.
The more transactions you send, the more SPAM you receive.
With a staggering daily creation of one billion SPAM coins, the focus is on generating a high volume of transactions.
Source: X
So, it is hard to believe that the Sui network will be able to dethrone Solana anytime soon, despite the slowdown of activity on the latter’s network.
State of DeFi
Another factor that could impact the Solana ecosystem would be the state of its DeFi. Notably, the DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes on the Solana network had fallen significantly since March.
Poor DEX performances signal that users are opting for other networks for trading and swapping purposes.
Source: Artemis
Despite the plummeting DEX volumes, the TVL (Total Value Locked) on the Solana network had continued to grow, reaching $4 Billion at press time.

Realistic or not, here’s SOL’s market cap in ETH terms

This suggested that while Solana’s DEXes were not able to show positive performance, other sectors managed to pick up the slack and were able to generate value.
Source: Artemis
Coming to the state of the SOL token, it was observed to be moving mostly sideways. In the last 24 hours, the price of SOL had grown by 0.55% and was trading at $144.98 at the time of writing.

These Divisions Contributed Significantly to Tether’s Q1 2024 Profit of $4.52B


																Earlier this week, the largest stablecoin issuing company, Tether, revealed that it made more than $4.52 billion in net profit in the first quarter of 2024. With the firm having expanded its operations recently, a substantial portion of the profits came from its long-standing businesses and not the newly formed divisions.
Tether revealed in an attestation report that roughly $1 billion of the profit in Q1 2024 came from entities in charge of issuing stablecoins and managing related reserves.
Tether Made $4.52B in Profit Last Quarter
In mid-April, Tether announced that it was expanding its framework beyond stablecoins. The firm unveiled new divisions, including Tether Edu, Tether Power, and Tether Data, which would handle digital skills education, sustainable Bitcoin mining operations, and strategic investments in emerging technologies.
Tether Finance, which has been in existence, will continue spearheading the company’s stablecoin products and financial services. Tether revealed that the $1 billion this division made last quarter came from net operating profits derived mainly from its U.S. Treasury holdings. During the quarter, Tether increased its direct and indirect ownership of U.S. Treasuries via investments through money market funds and overnight reverse-repurchase agreements.
The remainder of Tether Q1 2024 profits came from mark-to-market gains in the company’s Bitcoin and Gold positions. Notably, the firm’s U.S. Treasury holdings are now in excess of $90 billion.




“With the first attestation of 2024, Tether has demonstrated its unwavering commitment to transparency, stability, liquidity, and responsible risk management. As shown in this latest report, Tether continues to shatter records with a new profit benchmark of $4.52 billion, reflecting the company’s sheer financial strength and stability,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said.
For the other divisions, encompassing renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and Bitcoin mining, Tether made strategic investments totaling $5 billion in Q1 2024.
Additional $12.5B USDT Issued
Interestingly, Tether unveiled its net equity for the first time. The company witnessed a significant spike from the $7.01 billion recorded by the end of Q4 2023 to $11.37 billion as of March 31.
Meanwhile, Tether claims its stablecoin offerings saw a $1 billion increase in excess reserves, bringing the total to approximately $6.3 billion. Tether-issued stablecoins are now backed by cash and cash equivalents at 90%. The company also issued an additional $12.5 billion USDT last quarter.

Here’s the Next Price Target for Bitcoin As BTC Repeats Previous Bull Market Pattern: Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is laying out his bull market price target for Bitcoin, saying BTC is beginning to mirror its previous cycle.
Pseudonymous analyst TechDev shares with his 448,000 followers on the social media platform X a chart that compares Bitcoin’s current market cycle to that of 2020-2021.










Using Elliott Wave theory, which traditionally suggests that an asset goes through bullish impulses in five main waves, TechDev speculates that BTC is going through a final bullish move that will take it near the six-figure range later this year.
“The impulsive structure of the last 1.5 years says $90,000-$100,000 is next. BTC”
Source: TechDev/X
Based on his chart, TechDev is also suggesting that Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) – a widely used momentum indicator – has cooled off, foreshadowing one more big upside move for BTC.
The analyst recently predicted that BTC will rally by over 120%, similar to what happened in late 2020 when Bitcoin surged from around $13,000 to over $29,000 in just two months.
“Bitcoin’s two-month candle is right on the candle body high, soon after max compression.
As RSI (relative strength index) is about to break 70.
These have been the conditions which led to the last three parabolic accelerations.
I suspect this next two-month candle will be as tall as Nov 2020.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $63,330.

Satoshi's Privacy Legacy Reverberates Through Dogecoin; What Happened

In response to a recent observation that raised privacy concerns, vocal Dogecoin community member Mishaboar has echoed the principles laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.As outlined in the original whitepaper released in 2008, Satoshi envisioned privacy, which ties into the idea of decentralization.While Bitcoin's blockchain is transparent, Satoshi acknowledged the need for privacy, suggesting that users could maintain anonymity by keeping their public keys secret.Satoshi wrote that the traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party.The reverse occurs in the Bitcoin network, where all transactions are publicly announced; however, Satoshi contends that privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else but there is no information linking the transaction to anyone.Satoshi proposes that, as an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.What happenedIn a recent tweet, Mishaboar, a Dogecoin community member, draws the community's attention to something apparent but often overlooked: self-custody equals privacy. He stated that most blockchains, including Bitcoin and Dogecoin, are entirely transparent, with a public ledger open to everybody, allowing anybody to see and track transactions. Mishaboar explained that in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi Nakamoto suggested ways to protect privacy, including avoiding the reuse of addresses. However, this requires wallet apps that are developed with this in mind.The vocal Dogecoin community member cited an instance: Privacy-oriented wallets discourage users from reusing addresses and incorporate easy-to-use coin control features. However, this does not appear to be the case, as many wallet apps still push users toward a single address use.

Manager to Establish $ 1.25 Billion Cryptocurrency Fund Talks About Crypto Sector: "There is a Future in These Two Areas" - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Franklin Bi, a general partner at Pantera Capital, the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US has significantly validated the cryptocurrency industry. The crypto venture capital firm is currently raising a new mega fund worth $1.25 billion.
While Bi declined to comment specifically on Pantera's new fund, he stated in an interview that the current climate is conducive for venture firms to raise new capital and position themselves to support new ventures.


Bi said the spot Bitcoin ETF approval “significantly validates” the crypto industry. “This approval showed people that regulations are still moving in a positive direction for digital assets,” Bi said. According to Bi, this confirmation reinforced the belief of many institutional investors that this is a long-term technology trend and a development cycle they need exposure to.

Within the crypto industry, Bi suggested that the gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors offer significant investment opportunities. He also noted the emergence of real-world asset tokenization as a continuation of DeFi, which brings traditional financial assets into the crypto space.





Bi added that blockchain technology is entering various global markets, including financial markets, supply chains and consumer applications. “I think it's a great time to really focus on those aspects of the industry and move forward in the long term, and that's what we're doing,” Bi concluded.

FLOKI: Is a bull rally on the way? Examining key indicators - AMBCrypto



FLOKI’s popularity was high as its social metrics soared.
The meme coin witnessed a slight price correction, but the trend might not last. 

Meme coins have created a lot of buzz of late, including Floki Inu [FLOKI], thanks to the surge in their popularity. 
At press time, the price of FLOKI broke above a bullish pattern, which might translate into a bull rally. 
FLOKI’s bullish move
AMBCrypto’s analysis of FLOKI’s daily chart revealed an interesting development. After peaking in mid-March, the meme coin’s price started to move inside a bullish flag pattern. 
It continued to consolidate inside the pattern for over a month and finally broke out on the 4th of May. A breakout above the bullish flag pattern suggested that FLOKI’s price might soon touch its March high again.
Source: TradingView
Things on the social front also looked optimistic for the meme coin. Per LunarCrush’s recent tweet, the meme coin’s social metrics were soaring, as over 48% of the market remained positive on FLOKI. 
Also, the meme coin’s official X (formerly Twitter) handle mentioned that FLOKI was trending on the social media site, reflecting its popularity. 
However, despite these optimistic signs, the meme coin’s price witnessed a correction. According to CoinMarketCap, the meme coin’s value plummeted by 1.5% in the last 24 hours. 
At press time, it was trading at $0.0001909. 
The bull trend might resume 
Investors should not be worried yet about the price drop, as a breakout above a bull flag pattern is often followed by a retest of the support level. Therefore, a slight price drop ahead of another bull rally is not rare.
AMBCrypto found that a possible reason for the recent price decline could be high liquidation. The meme coin’s liquidation increased sharply to the $0.0002 mark, after which its price dropped. 
Source: Hyblock Capital
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data suggested that the declining trend might not last. For instance, after an increase, FLOKI’s Funding Rate dropped. 
Generally, prices tend to move the other way around than the Funding Rate. Its MVRV ratio also remained pretty high, which can be inferred as a bullish signal.
 Nonetheless, its exchange inflow spiked, suggesting a rise in selling pressure. 
Source: Snatiment
To better understand whether the bull rally would resume, AMBCrypto then checked the meme coin’s daily chart.

Read Floki Inu’s [FLOKI] Price Prediction 2024-25  

As per our analysis, the meme coin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick and was headed further above the neutral mark. 
Its MACD also displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover. These metrics and indicators suggested that the chances of FLOKI’s price turning bullish again in the coming days were high.

Bitcoin soars 12,464% in a decade outshining Amazon, Google; What's next for BTC?


In the past decade, Bitcoin (BTC) has posted an extraordinary 12,464% increase in its price, outshining tech giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)
The analysis, published on X (formerly Twitter) on May 3 by WuBlockchain, examined Bitcoin’s performance alongside nine major technology stocks. This study highlighted its robust growth, further solidifying its reputation as a powerful  investment vehicle
The research revealed that  Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) led the pack with an even more impressive gain of 17,797%, dominating the tech sector with its cutting-edge GPUs and semiconductor products. However, Bitcoin’s rise to the second place, especially in such a volatile market, underscores its significant impact and potential within the financial ecosystem.



“The WuBlockchain team compiled the cumulative gains over the past 10 years of BTC and nine major tech stocks including Google, META, Apple, Netflix, and Amazon etc. BTC ranked second with an increase of 12,464%, while NVIDIA took the top spot with a surge of 17,797%”.-Wu Blockchain”

Other tech entities like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)  and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) also showed considerable gains, with increases of 3,335% and 1,200% respectively. These figures demonstrate the dynamic growth within the tech industry, yet Bitcoin’s performance remains a notable story of success and resilience.
Investment landscape transformation

Despite the inherent volatility and uncertainties associated with cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin’s impressive growth trajectory over the past decade showcases its resilience and potential as a viable investment avenue.
As investors continue to diversify their portfolios and seek avenues for potentially high returns, the findings of this analysis offer a valuable reference point, highlighting the noteworthy performance of both established tech stocks and emerging digital assets like Bitcoin.
With technological innovation driving the markets forward, the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets presents new opportunities for investors to explore and capitalize on in the years to come.
Market Cap reshuffle among the Magnificent Seven
Recently, Nvidia has demonstrated a positive trajectory by rising above its 50-day moving average, setting a target for a stable price base with a buy point of 974. Google has maintained its upward momentum following a positive earnings report, whereas Meta experienced a significant setback on April 24, falling below its 50-day moving average.
In contrast, Tesla(TSLA), has rebounded above this key technical level after reporting strong earnings, a recovery mirrored by Amazon which also rallied following impressive earnings.
These movements have led to notable shifts in the market capitalization rankings among the top tech companies, often dubbed the “Magnificent Seven.” Microsoft has overtaken Apple in terms of Nasdaq market cap share, now making up 9.5% of the index compared to Apple’s 8.6%. 
Nvidia, with a market cap share of 6.9%, has surpassed both Alphabet at 6.6% and Amazon at 6.2%. Meanwhile, Meta’s share has declined to 3.6%.
These market dynamics have also impacted the Composite Ratings of these firms. Apple’s rating has dropped to 53, despite a recent earnings boost. This reshuffling reflects the volatile yet dynamic nature of tech stock performance and market valuations.
The Road ahead for Bitcoin
Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $63,800 with daily corrections of almost 0.86%. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is down over 0.07%
Despite recent market downturns and a significant reduction in block mining rewards experts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.
Concerns about mining centralization and regulatory challenges persist, but the scarcity of Bitcoin, capped at 21 million tokens, is a critical factor that continues to drive its value. Looking ahead, industry insiders suggest that while the market may face short-term fluctuations, the long-term trajectory for Bitcoin looks promising.
As Bitcoin continues to compete with and even surpass major tech stocks, its role as a transformative asset in the investment landscape is becoming more pronounced.

Bitcoin Whale 'Mr. 100' Resumes Buying Amid Market Dip, Analysts Anticipate Price Consolidation and Potential Upswing



                    

The notable Bitcoin whale known as “Mr. 100” recently made a significant purchase of Bitcoin, marking his first buy since the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024. 



As the Bitcoin price briefly dipped to $56,000, Mr. 100 added over 4,100 BTC to his holdings, purchased around the $58,000 level. 




This acquisition, valued at approximately $242 million, was highlighted by the analysis of on-chain data from Bitinfocharts, brought to attention by user HODL15Capital.



This transaction comes after a hiatus since April 19, the day before the halving, during which the whale did not acquire any additional Bitcoin. 



The “Mr. 100” wallet, which began receiving regular BTC deposits following the November 2022 collapse of FTX, had been consistently accumulating at least 100 BTC daily since mid-February, excluding the period right after the halving.




Currently, “Mr. 100” holds over 65,155 BTC, making him the 12th-largest Bitcoin holder. The value of his wallet now exceeds $3.86 billion, with unrealized profits of $1.4 billion, a 33% increase from the average purchase price of $36,572 per BTC.



Amid this buying activity, market analysts have been debating the trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. 



Analyst Rekt Capital suggested in a May 2 video analysis that the current market conditions represented a prime buying opportunity, explaining, “Whenever we’d get close to a 20% downside, that was typically a fantastic buying opportunity before price reversals towards the upside. 



So if we’re deeper than 20%, it is an even better opportunity than we had this cycle, because the deeper we go the closer we get to a bottoming in Bitcoin’s price action.”




Other experts, like Jag Kooner from Bitfinex, predict a short-term consolidation in Bitcoin prices. 



Kooner anticipates a trading range with significant swings over the next couple of months, influenced by macroeconomic factors. 



He told Cointelegraph, “We could see a one-to-two-month consolidation in Bitcoin prices, trading in a range with swings of $10,000 on either side.

We expect the positive impact of the halving, which has brought about a reduction in Bitcoin supply, will be seen in later months. 



At this point, the economy is also expected to be performing better, having achieved a soft landing and avoiding a recession, providing further impetus to crypto assets.”



The $52,000 mark is seen as a crucial support-resistance level on Bitcoin’s weekly chart. A close above this threshold would likely indicate potential for further gains, according to crypto trader Marco Johanning.



Further context about the “Mr. 100” address was provided by Crystal Intelligence to Cointelegraph, identifying the address as associated with the Upbit exchange. 



The firm clarified, “We have found that the number and value of transactions associated with this wallet are indicative of a VASP-type service. 



‘Additionally, we can confirm with high accuracy that the incoming transactions originate from Upbit, and these have maintained a consistent value since the collapse of FTX.” 



This analysis was reinforced by the findings of Mai, an on-chain sleuth, who noted the operational similarities between Mr. 100’s transactions and Upbit’s typical activity with altcoins.

Warren Buffett compares AI to nukes after seeing deepfake doppelganger

Berkshire Hathaway co-founder Warren Buffett recently sounded off on artificial intelligence (AI) deepfakes and the perpetuation of scammers at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. Buffett, the ninth richest person in the world (as of April 2024), has seen his own net worth grow by some $16 billion through the first five months of 2024 alone. During the shareholders meeting held in Omaha, Nebraska he lauded the company’s growth and perseverance despite the November 2023 death of vice chairman Charlie Munger. However, the commentary quickly turned to AI as the meeting wore on. Speaking during a Q&A session, Buffett said “I don’t know anything about AI but that doesn’t mean I deny its existence or importance or anything of the sort." After this auspicious start, he compared the impact of AI technologies in illicit financial activities to the advent of the atomic bomb and the proliferation of nuclear weaponry. This, as the 93-year-old billionaire related it, stemmed from an experience he had wherein he was exposed to a deepfake doppelganger that looked, dressed, moved, and talked exactly like himself. Per a transcript of the meeting:“I mean, scamming has always been part of the American scene, but this would make me, if I was interested in investing in scamming, it’s going to be the growth industry of all time. And it’s enabled in a way. Obviously, AI has potential for good things too but I don’t know how you, based on the one I saw recently, I practically would send money to myself over and over in some crazy country."While this isn’t the first time that Buffett has decried what he sees as the scary potential of AI, it’s notable that Berkshire Hathaway’s largest investment holdings lie in the world’s second most valuable company, Apple. The Cupertino company’s number one spot was usurped by Microsoft who metaphorically strapped itself to a rocketship when it invested heavily in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. In the time since, it’s appeared as though Apple has been playing catch up. With a large portion of the company’s public-facing focus being placed on generative AI products.

Bitcoin Bull Michael Saylor Wants SEC To Corral Crypto Herd: ETH, ADA, SOL In The Crosshairs


								Michael Saylor, the tech entrepreneur who steered MicroStrategy into a Bitcoin behemoth, is back in the headlines. This time, he’s not championing the orange coin, but rather aiming his laser focus at its altcoin rivals.

At the recent Bitcoin For Corporations conference, Saylor unleashed a flurry of predictions, painting a picture of a future where the SEC cracks down on leading altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA).
Bitcoin’s Lone Wolf? Saylor Casts Doubt On Altcoin Legitimacy
Saylor’s stance on altcoins is about as subtle as a Bitcoin mining rig – there simply isn’t room for another top dog. He boldly claimed that the SEC will reject all applications for spot ETH ETFs, effectively throwing cold water on the hopes of investors eagerly awaiting such a product.


But it doesn’t stop there. Saylor predicts the SEC will reclassify these altcoins as securities, yanking them away from their current status as commodities under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This regulatory shift would significantly impact how these altcoins are traded and viewed by institutions.

“None of these tokens will ever be a part of a spot ETF, none of them will be embraced by Wall Street, and none of them will find favor with mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” declared Saylor.

His comments come at a crucial time, with the entire crypto market holding its breath as the SEC mulls over applications for Ethereum ETFs from investment giants like VanEck and Ark Invest. The deadlines for these decisions fall on May 23rd and 24th, respectively, making the next few weeks a potential turning point for the altcoin landscape.

SEC’s Past Hints At Saylor’s Prophetic Potential?
While Saylor’s predictions carry the weight of his industry expertise, it’s important to acknowledge his inherent bias as a Bitcoin maximalist. However, a look at the SEC’s recent history suggests there might be some truth to his warnings.

In 2023, the regulatory body came down hard on major crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. The former’s case concluded with a hefty fine and imprisonment for its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, while the legal battle with Coinbase continues to unfold. These actions by the SEC demonstrate a growing focus on regulating the crypto space, and Saylor’s predictions might be a glimpse into the future of altcoin oversight.
Brace For Impact Or Business As Usual?
Saylor’s pronouncements have sent ripples through the altcoin community. Some fear a domino effect, with the SEC’s potential crackdown on ETH impacting the entire altcoin market. Others remain cautiously optimistic, believing the SEC’s focus might be on unregistered securities masquerading as altcoins, not established players like ETH or ADA.
The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the validity of Saylor’s prophecies. If the SEC denies the applications for spot ETH ETFs and moves towards classifying leading altcoins as securities, it could significantly reshape the cryptocurrency landscape.
However, if the SEC takes a more measured approach, focusing on weeding out bad actors while allowing compliant altcoins to flourish, then Saylor’s pronouncements might fade into the background noise of the ever-evolving crypto world.

Uniswap CEO Condemns ‘Farming the Farmers’ Tactics in Token Launches - Coin Edition


							

Hayden Adams stressed the importance of treating tokens as more than mere points.
He condemned the “farming the farmers” practice, where projects artificially hype token distribution to boost numbers.
Adams’ commentary comes amid recent outrage over EigenLayer’s token distribution methods.




Hayden Adams, the founder of the Uniswap DEX platform, has outlined his perspective on ethical token distribution, offering eight key principles. Adams’ commentary comes amid recent community concerns over transparency in token distribution, particularly in light of issues raised with EigenLayer’s distribution methods, where industry pundits have labeled it a scam.









Adams began by highlighting the importance of treating tokens as more than mere points. Next, he condemned the practice of “farming the farmers,” where projects create hype around token distribution to boost user engagement artificially. He advised against making public speculations without concrete information and recommended withholding details until they could be fully disclosed.







Furthermore, the Uniswap founder expressed a distaste for “low float” tokens, which he considers manipulative. He argues that projects should enable genuine price discovery from day one by distributing tokens widely enough for decentralized exchanges to determine their actual value.



Fourthly, Adams criticized the tactic of exploiting unit bias through excessively high token supplies, labeling it as unethical. In parallel, he called for generosity in distribution. “Don’t be stingy,” the industry pundit said. Adams recommended that a significant portion of tokens be allocated to the community supporting the project.



Meanwhile, he took a firm stance against marketing token prices. He suggested that projects focusing on price hype are more interested in quick profits than creating lasting value. 



Besides, the Uniswap founder urged simplicity in the distribution process to avoid the complexities that have led to scams in the past.



His parting message is one of integrity: create an effective token distribution model that project leaders can be proud of and support wholeheartedly.

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) Rallies 225% in 5 Hours and Prepares for 3,000% Surge, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, has been attracting significant investment from early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.



Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) has surged around 225% in the first few hours since its launch,  delivering huge returns for early investors and attracting investment from early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, DOCPEPE still has plenty of potential to rise more, and it’s poised to rally another 3,000% in the coming 48 hours.



Furthermore, it has already been announced that the token will soon be listed on MEXC – as its first listing on a centralized exchange – and this will be another massively bullish event for its price.



Despite the rally so far, DOCPEPE still just has a market cap of around $34,000, meaning it has immense potential for more gains in the coming days and weeks.




Currently, Doctor Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DOCPEPE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for DOCPEPE by entering its contract address – 3n8HMVVfMF2uqdpts5TUETAHUrvD1AFg8V1XLahpeTT8 – in the receiving field.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

JPMorgan Chase Paying $448,000,000 Fine To US Regulators for Failing To Monitor Billions of Transactions on Bank's Global Trading Venues - The Daily Hodl


								JPMorgan Chase will pay a total of $448 billion to US regulators for failing to monitor potential market misconduct on billions of transactions in its global trading operation.
In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the banking giant says it has made a deal with an unnamed US regulator that will add an additional $100 billion in penalties to a $348 billion enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB).










In March, the two regulatory agencies accused JPMorgan of engaging in “unsafe or unsound” banking practices, saying that the lender’s corporate and investment bank division had significant gaps in its trade surveillance program. According to the OCC, the bank failed to properly monitor the actions of its traders and clients to detect potential market misconduct on billions of trading activities on at least 30 global trading venues.
Now, the banking giant says it’s paying an additional $100 million “after offsets for amounts paid to the OCC and FRB” to another US regulator to settle a separate enforcement action involving the same issue.
While JPMorgan does not name the third regulator involved, the firm says it “self-identified that certain trading and order data” at its Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) was not feeding into its trade surveillance platforms.
The firm says it’s now determined to continuously enhance the reliability of its trade infrastructure and maintain rigorous controls.
Data from the Violation Tracker, a comprehensive corporate misconduct database, shows that JPMorgan has paid nearly $40 billion since 2000 to resolve 277 enforcement actions and lawsuits involving toxic securities abuses, banking violations, investor protection violations and other offenses.
The New York-based bank made $49.6 billion in net income last year.

Six Coinbase customers claim the exchange is violating securities laws in new lawsuit

Six Coinbase customers filed a new class-action lawsuit against crypto exchange Coinbase Global, two subsidiaries — Coinbase, Inc. and Coinbase Asset Management, LLC. — and its CEO, Brian Armstrong, on May 5.The lawsuit alleges that the digital assets listed on Coinbase are securities. This includes Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Near Protocol (NEAR), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Uniswap (UNI), Tezos (XTZ), and Stellar (XLM). The plaintiffs argue that these tokens constitute ‘investment contracts,’ subject to state securities laws.Coinbase itself admits to being a “Securities Broker” in its user agreement, according to the lawsuit. Therefore, the defendants “knowingly, intentionally, and repeatedly violated state securities laws” and deceived its users, the lawsuit filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division alleges.The lawsuit further notes:“Its (Coinbase’s) entire business model has been built upon a lie and a dream: the lie is that “we do not sell securities,” and the dream is that, knowing it would eventually be caught in the lie, “it is better to ask for forgiveness than permission.”The lawsuit was filed by plaintiffs Gerardo Aceves, Thomas Fan, Edwin Martinez, Tiffany Smoot, Edouard Cordi and Brett Maggard from California and Florida. The plaintiffs are seeking full recission, meaning a cancellation of their purchase agreements, along with statutory damages under state law and injunctive relief.Coinbase has already been battling a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which alleges the exchange violated securities laws. Coinbase argues that secondary sale of crypto assets do not constitute securities. The exchange filed an interlocutory appeal after a judge allowed the SEC lawsuit to proceed.Late last month, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton filed an amicus brief in support of a motion for interlocutory appeal on behalf of 4,701 Coinbase customers. Deaton is currently running an election campaign against Senator Elizabeth Warren.Earlier this week, Coinbase reported a surge in its Q1 revenue, which surged past expectations to $1.64 billion. The exchange’s transaction revenue nearly tripled to $1.07 billion, with consumer transaction revenue alone soaring to $935 million, marking a doubling compared to the previous year.Mentioned in this article

The cryptocurrency community is abuzz with anticipation as fintech giant Ripple teases progress on its much-awaited stablecoin. This development marks a significant milestone for Ripple and the XRP Ledger ecosystem.At the recent XRP Las Vegas conference, Ripple CTO David Schwartz presented everything about XRP Ledger, including AMM, lending protocol, the future Ripple stablecoin, AI and crypto.The XRP community listened intently to the Ripple CTO's remarks, drawing a few deductions from his presentation at the conference.One of the takeaways that was shared by some XRP community members was that further details on Ripple's stablecoin will be disclosed in roughly a month during the XRPL Apex event in Amsterdam, which is slated for June 11-13. While Ripple is yet to disclose detailed information regarding its stablecoin project, the mere mention of development in this area has sparked interest among XRP holders and the wider cryptocurrency community.Another takeaway from the Ripple CTO's speech is that the Ripple stablecoin is ideal for institutions that cannot yet employ digital assets but want to use XRP Ledger. This was echoed by Vet, an XRPL dUNL validator, who highlighted the vast potential use cases of the latest XLS-68D Sponsor specification in this regard.The proposed stablecoin by Ripple is supposed to be 100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government treasuries and other cash equivalents.Ripple's stablecoin is expected to be a game changer for the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Ripple hopes to increase adoption and growth within the XRPL ecosystem by exploiting the platform's native features, which include a decentralized exchange and an automated market maker.The stablecoin will be a key entry point into new prospects for institutional and decentralized finance (DeFi) application cases across many ecosystems.

Employee at Billion-Dollar Bank Arrested, Accused of Stealing $44,000 From Account of Deceased Customer - The Daily Hodl


								An employee at a billion-dollar bank has reportedly been arrested and accused of stealing money from the account of a deceased customer.
Latia Wynn of Wilmington, Delaware, was arrested by police for allegedly withdrawing $44,000 from a deceased customer’s account at WSFS Bank, NBC affiliate Philadelphia10 reports.










When one of its customers passed away in a motor vehicle accident, their family reportedly began closing all of their accounts – but noticed a lot of money was missing.
After officers were dispatched to the family of the victim, investigators were led to Wynn, who was later identified as a suspect and is now charged with one felony count of identity theft, one felony count of wearing a disguise during the commission of a felony, and one felony count of theft of $1,500 or greater.
The 25 year-old has been formally charged and released on an $18,000 unsecured bail.
As of March 31, 2024, WSFS Financial Corporation had $20.6 billion in assets and $80.5 billion in assets under management and administration.
In a similar case, the US Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey recently said bank employee Jorge Nova has pleaded guilty to a count of wire fraud and faces a 30 year prison sentence for draining $105,000 from a deceased customer’s account.
Nova was working at an unnamed commercial bank in Nutley, New Jersey when he came across a deceased customer’s account that had continued to collect Social Security benefits by direct deposit.
The retiree, who was receiving $2,372 per month in benefits, passed away on August 29th, 2014 – but the Social Security Administration (SSA) was not notified of the person’s death.
Consequently, the beneficiary’s account continued to receive funds from the SSA for more than four years.

Bitcoin’s Downturn Impacts Hong Kong’s ETF Market Coin Edition


							

Hong Kong’s ETFs witnessed low trading volumes in the initial four trading days.
The Bitcoin ETFs marked $5.5 million in trading volume on Friday, much lower than the first day.
Bitcoin’s bearish track significantly impacts Hong Kong’s failure to attract investors to the ETF market.




Recent reports revealed that Hong Kong’s recently launched Bitcoin ETFs marked comparatively lower trading volumes in the first four days. Amidst declining Bitcoin price, the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds failed to attract investors and traders.









Reinforcing its vision of establishing a crypto hub, Hong Kong launched Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on April 30, following the Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) green light. In total, asset managers China Asset Management, Harvest Global, Bosera, and HashKey launched 6 Bitcoin and Ether ETFs.



In a previous interview, ChinaAMC executive Zhu Haokang posited that the initial listing scale of Hog Kong’s ETFs would exceed the initial day’s scale of US ETFs. He remained confident of the ETFs as he asserted, “The details will be revealed to everyone at 9:30 tomorrow morning.”



Contrary to Haokang’s words, on the initial day, the ETFs recorded a total trading volume of 87.58 million Hong Kong Dollars, equivalent to $12 million. The figure marked a severe low from the first-day trading volume of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, valued at $4.6 billion. However, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas asserted that considering the size of Hong Kong’s crypto market compared to that of the US, the volume doesn’t mark Hong Kong’s failure.



The trading volume declined substantially in the following days, with Bitcoin ETFs witnessing a $5.5 million trading volume on Friday. Reports state that the prevailing bear market and the falling BTC price, which lost nearly a tenth of its value in the past month, remain a significant barrier to the success of Hong Kong’s ETFs.



At present, Bitcoin is trading at $63,331, with a slight surge of 0.15% in the last day. The pioneer cryptocurrency even witnessed the $56k mark at the onset of May. Over the past week, Bitcoin has shown a decline of 0.96% and a dip of 5.33% over the past month.

Rated: Week's top 3 new cryptocurrencies with the largest trading volume


Amidst the crypto market’s recovery from the downturn in early May, there remains an influx of new projects.  Some of the projects are attracting investor interest in specific metrics as they move to take a share of the market. 
In this regard, Finbold has identified a selection of top new cryptocurrencies with substantial trading volume based on data retrieved from CoinMarketCap.

Friend.tech (FRIEND)
Friend.tech (FRIEND), the decentralized social network launched in August 2023, leads with a trading volume of $66.73 million. Despite this impressive figure, the platform initially faced significant setbacks as its native token experienced a drastic 98% drop in value at one point.


Upon its introduction to the market, the FRIEND token debuted at $169, attracting 18,000 holders. However, recent developments have raised concerns among investors participating in the airdrop.
Some users reported issues with app functionality and encountered difficulties in claiming their airdrop. Moreover, the distribution process was criticized for purportedly favoring leading creators over retail investors.
To address these challenges, a leaked smart contract revealed plans to launch non-transferable v2 tokens called POINTS. These tokens aim to stabilize the market price by imposing a 1.5% transfer fee.
Meanwhile, by press time, FRIEND was trading at $2.98, reflecting a 24-hour gain of 87%.

RSIC•GENESIS•RUNE (RSIC)
RSIC•GENESIS•RUNE (RSIC), built on the Runes protocol, represents the first pre-Rune airdrop for early Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals adopters. With a trading volume of $12.54 million, RSIC ranks second.
The platform provides individuals with an opportunity to engage with Bitcoin and contribute to a more decentralized future.
Notably, attention to the token can be attributed to a move by crypto exchange OKX, which announced the addition of RSIC on OKX Jumpstart, featuring a staking pool of 367.50 million tokens. In celebration of this addition, eligible users who stake BTC via OKX Jumpstart Mining can mine RSIC•GENESIS•RUNE as rewards.
By press time, RSIC was trading at $0.01461, with daily losses exceeding 1%.

Kamino Finance (KMNO)
Kamino Finance (KMNO), Solana’s (SOL) largest lending and liquidity protocol, emerged third with a trading volume of $10.66 million. Notably, the token, which debuted on April 30 and initially traded at $0.11, experienced heightened volatility, leading to a significant drop in value.
Despite facing initial challenges, Kamino Finance witnessed a significant 64% surge in price in just one day, attributed to a move by Bybit announcing a 3,750,000 KMNO Airdrop available in Bybit’s Kamino campaign.

It’s worth noting that Kamino Finance distinguishes itself by tokenizing users’ positions into LP tokens dubbed kTokens, which can be used as collateral in Kamino Lend. This feature adds composability to the protocol, enabling tokens to move between protocols via Kamino’s liquidity vaults.
At the moment, KMNO is trading at $0.077 with daily losses of almost 2%.

In essence, these highlighted cryptocurrencies will depend heavily on the overall trading activity within the crypto sector to maintain any market dominance. Importantly, investor interest is likely to be bolstered by the tokens’ ability to demonstrate robust fundamentals.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Says Layer-2 Solutions Will Drive Many Use Cases in Crypto Economy - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of US-based crypto exchange Coinbase is optimistic that layer-2 scaling solutions will transform the crypto economy.
Speaking at Coinbase’s first-quarter earnings call, Brian Armstrong says he sees layer-2 scaling solutions facilitating the explosion of crypto use cases with lower fees and faster transaction times.










“As a reminder, layer 2 solutions help blockchains scale, similar to when the Internet moved from dial-up to broadband. And we believe this scaling will drive many new use cases in the crypto economy.”
The CEO goes on to put the spotlight on Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 designed to onboard billions of users into web3.
“Base has helped dramatically reduce transaction fees and confirmation times, getting us closer to our goal of having the average crypto transaction take less than one second and cost less than $0.01 anywhere in the world.
Developer activity on Base increased eightfold in Q1. In the last 30 days, Base has processed over 2x as many transactions as the entire Ethereum network on layer 1. 
We’ve made Base faster and cheaper to use with fee reduction by about 80% through protocol upgrades, and our fees are now often below $0.01.”
As for Bitcoin (BTC), Armstrong says the spot market exchange-traded funds have helped re-energize the entire crypto market.
“I think the ETFs got a lot of attention. But what we’re seeing is that when there’s attention on crypto in general, I think it creates energy and interest across all kinds of products in the industry.”

This Week on Crypto Twitter: Ethereum, CZ, and Roger Ver in US Government Crosshairs - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for DecryptCrypto Twitter often delivers a heavy helping of the law, but the past seven days brought a double dose. On Monday, unredacted portions of a lawsuit filed by Ethereum software company Consensys against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that the regulator has secretly considered ETH to be a security for over a year. The bombshell news quickly sparked anger and indignation, given the fact that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly refused to comment publicly on his agency’s view of ETH in the intervening period. Even prominent American lawmakers waded into the debate. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, posted a stern statement on Twitter on Tuesday, accusing Gensler of having lied when he testified before Congress about ETH’s regulatory status without revealing the SEC’s internal, pre-existing determination on the subject. Shifting from the U.S. House to a federal courthouse, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao was sentenced to four months in U.S. federal prison that same day. Zhao pleaded guilty to money laundering violations last year. While it was certainly significant to see yet another founder of a major crypto exchange sent behind bars, the punishment was far less harsh than the three years prosecutors were hoping for. Indeed, the prevailing sentiment on Twitter following the sentencing hearing was fairly lighthearted, with many joking that Zhao had predicted his own sentencing given his famed use of the number “4” as a signal to dismiss cynical deployments of “fear, uncertainty, and doubt,” or FUD.Zhao himself took to Twitter shortly after the sentencing hearing to share his plans for life after prison and assert that he accepted the outcome of the trial, writing, “I will do my time.”If that wasn’t enough criminal crypto news for one day, only hours later the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it charged Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin investor known in some circles as “Bitcoin Jesus,” with evading nearly $50 million worth of taxes. Ver was arrested by authorities in Spain on Tuesday. Many on Twitter decried the arrest as an unjust anti-crypto provocation, given the fact that Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014. Others signaled their indifference to Ver’s plight, validating his status as a controversial personality in the crypto ecosystem.Some people found a way to reconcile both perspectives. Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin Ordinals Size Record Broken Again-How Much Bigger Can They Get? - Decrypt

Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes platform OrdinalsBot has created the largest Ordinals inscription to date, weighing in at a hefty 3.969 megabytes. Inscription number 70,614,708, the OrdinalsBot team announced Friday, contains a copy of “A Declaration of Independence in Cyberspace” by Logos Network.OrdinalsBot co-founder Brian Laughlan told Decrypt that the size of the inscription had less to do with the length of the document, and more to do with publishing the document as an image that would be large enough to read.“It's really interesting because the actual text content, if you build that out, would be like two kilobytes,” Laughlan said. “It’s tiny, but what they did was add an image and blew up the image to be that size—just to get that top spot and really make a statement.”It's not the first time in recent months that we've seen the Bitcoin Ordinals inscription size record broken, but the increases lately have been relatively minuscule—and there isn't much more room to grow, given the limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain. In this case, the new record inscription was a mere 0.001MB larger than the previous record-holder from March.The storage capacity on the Bitcoin blockchain was massively upgraded in 2017, Laughlan explained. The Segregated Witness (SegWit) update pushed past the prior 1 megabyte maximum size of a Bitcoin block to 4MB. Attempts to inscribe anything larger will fail.“Part of our job is making sure we don't do that,” Laughlan said. “What we'll do essentially is we'll craft [the Ordinal] locally, send it to our local Bitcoin nodes, and see if it all goes through—but we won't even look at it if it's over 4MB. There’s no point because we know its going to fail.”Following the launch of the Ordinals protocol in January 2023, OrdinalsBot came online as a way for Bitcoin enthusiasts to capitalize on the new craze with an easy-to-use interface. This March, the OrdinalsBot platform was used to inscribe music Ordinals for rapper French Montana, followed by another music NFT by Wu-Tang Klan’s Ghostface Killah in April.For large inscription projects like the Logos Network Declaration and the 3.968MB Runestone inscription from March, OrdinalsBot worked with Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital to add larger amounts of data to a single Bitcoin blockchain block. In this case, the total block came in at 3.99MB, nearly all of which was taken up by the Logos inscription.“Our engineers and the engineers at Marathon are some of the best Bitcoin developers in the world,” OrdinalsBot co-founder Toby Lewis said. “Watching them work, especially when it's going for the largest block, you feel like history has been made every time."“They're testing the parameters [and] fine-tuning stuff," Lewis added, "because they don't actually know what will work. But from testnet to production is a really exciting moment."Boasting over 200,000 users on its platform, OrdinalsBot claims it played a part in creating eight out of the top 10 largest files ever inscribed on Bitcoin, including the aforementioned Runestone, the Ordz Games inscription for the BitBoy One game console, and Inscribed Pepes.OrdinalsBot also provides backend support for Magic Eden’s inscription services. In April, OrdinalsBot launched the Trio Ordinals utility token using the BRC-20 Bitcoin token standard.Edited by Ryan Ozawa and Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Crypto's Resurgence: New Narratives, Same Risks, Says Molly White | Cryptoglobe


                                
As Molly White, a prominent blockchain and cryptocurrency critic, points out in her recent Bloomberg article, the crypto market has once again entered a period of speculative mania after more than a year of a deep crypto winter. Bitcoin prices have surged, venture capital firms are investing in cryptocurrency startups, and the infamous crypto bros are back, mocking skeptics with their “have fun staying poor” mantra. However, as White astutely observes, this resurgence comes with a veneer of normalcy and a reputational makeover that may not reflect the true nature of the industry.



According to White, the crypto market remains fraught with manipulation and scams despite the new spokespeople in suits focusing on regulatory compliance and the traditional financial institutions pitching cryptocurrencies as a way to diversify portfolios. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been seen as a watershed moment by crypto advocates, but as White points out, even SEC Chair Gary Gensler has reiterated that Bitcoin is primarily a speculative and volatile asset with ties to illicit activities.



White’s article alleges that there is still rampant market manipulation on crypto exchanges, with wash trading being a built-in feature and a relatively small number of large holders artificially propping up prices. Despite the industry’s push to present crypto as a legitimate new asset class, White argues that greater reforms and more stringent enforcement are necessary to protect investors.



One of the key points White makes is that crypto relies heavily on storytelling, as the underlying technology lacks practical applications for the average person’s daily life. The narratives surrounding crypto have shifted over the years, from Bitcoin being pitched as a stable alternative to traditional banking to the “web3” buzzword of the last crypto boom. Now, as White observes, the industry is latching onto the AI trend, with startups promising to use blockchains alongside AI models to address various issues despite blockchain systems’ inherent inefficiencies and limitations.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

White also calls attention to the concerning trend of AI pioneers like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also being involved in blockchain projects, such as the Worldcoin token, which has drawn the ire of data privacy agencies in multiple countries. The world of AI-blockchain hybrids, as White points out, remains light on products and heavy on speculation, much like the worst offenders of the web3 era.



As the specter of a new crypto mania looms, White argues that it is far past time to consider new solutions to the familiar downside. She says the industry’s scammers must no longer be allowed to exploit everyday people drawn in by promises of revolutionary technology. White acknowledges the concerns of some crypto skeptics who worry that regulation may leave loopholes for exploitation while legitimizing crypto, but she asserts that the past decade of regulators largely ignoring the industry has not worked.



White concludes by emphasizing the need for thoughtful, carefully crafted regulation to protect investors and limit the contagion any future crypto disasters can transmit to the rest of the financial world. She also calls upon industry leaders to hold one another accountable and support models of government regulation that require rigorous outside scrutiny.

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Rival Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) to Surge 7,000% Within 48 Hours



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Crypto Analyst Forecasts First Billion Users by 2025, Chart Reveals Path to Mainstream Adoption



                    

Cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo predicts that the cryptocurrency industry could hit its inaugural billion-user mark by the conclusion of 2025. 



Woo conveyed his insights in an April 29 X post, stating, “On track for 1 BILLION crypto users by the end of 2025. 




An extrapolation of many independent prior studies in this chart. Binance estimates that 65% of crypto users hold Bitcoin.”



The chart presented by Woo marks a significant advancement, offering a comprehensive model aimed at delineating existing crypto asset users and forecasting the initial billion adopters. 



Daniel Batten, an investor and author of the Bitcoin ESG Forecast, lauded the chart’s significance, remarking in an X reply to Woo, “Incredible chart. 




The first view we’ve had of when we’ll cross the 1B threshold, with a full backtrace.”



The criteria for defining crypto users in the chart are unique entities that have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and have previously engaged in blockchain transactions.



Attaining the milestone of the first billion crypto users has long been regarded as a pivotal moment for mainstream adoption.

Mainstream adopters have the potential to inject fresh capital into the ecosystem, a factor crucial for the appreciation of digital assets.



The trajectory towards 1 billion crypto users is underscored by substantial growth in ownership. 



According to a January 2024 report by Crypto.com, the number of cryptocurrency owners surged by 34% to 580 million in 2023. 



Bitcoin holders, constituting 51% of global crypto holders, swelled by 33%, from 222 million in January to 296 million by December 2023. 



The report attributes this growth primarily to developments surrounding Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Despite these strides, achieving the coveted billion-user mark by 2025 appears challenging, given the need for a 72% increase from the current 580 million users, based on 2023’s growth trajectory.



A joint 2022 report by Boston Consulting Group, Bitget, and Foresight Ventures forecasts reaching the billion-user milestone by 2030. 



Drawing parallels with the internet’s adoption curve, the report suggests that sustained crypto adoption could emulate a similar trajectory. 



Currently, crypto adoption remains relatively low, with ample room for expansion, as only 0.3% of individual wealth is invested in crypto compared to 25% in global equities, as estimated by BCG.

Shiba Inu Owners, Beware: Impersonators Are Targeting Your Pack!


								The booming Shiba Inu (SHIB) community faces a growing threat: imposters posing as prominent developers on social media platforms like Telegram. Shibarmy Scam Alerts, a watchful community group, recently exposed this deceptive tactic, urging investors to exercise caution in the face of these digital wolves in sheep’s clothing.

Shiba Inu Developers Targeted: Kusama And Dhairya In The Crosshairs
Shibarmy Scam Alerts identified fake Telegram accounts masquerading as Shytoshi Kusama and Kaal Dhairya, two leading figures within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The imposters meticulously crafted usernames that mimicked the real developers, with subtle alterations designed to bypass casual scrutiny. This highlights the sophistication of these scams, emphasizing the need for investors to be meticulous when verifying online identities.


Beyond Names: The Devious Depths Of Deception
The implications of these impersonations extend far beyond stolen usernames. Scammers leverage this facade to gain victims’ trust, potentially tricking them into surrendering sensitive information or even transferring their SHIB holdings. Shibarmy Scam Alerts warns that these bad actors may attempt to solicit private keys, seed phrases, or other crucial details that grant access to crypto wallets.
To combat this evolving threat, the Shiba Inu community is emphasizing the importance of information hygiene. Investors are urged to rely solely on verified sources for official updates and announcements. The Shiba Inu development team will never request personal information or wallet access through unsolicited channels.

Lessons From The Past: Shibarium Giveaway Scam A Stark Reminder
This recent incident isn’t the first time the Shiba Inu community has grappled with deception. In 2023, a fake Telegram account impersonating Kusama promoted a fabricated Shibarium giveaway following the network’s version 2.0 launch. This serves as a stark reminder of the lengths scammers will go to exploit community excitement and enthusiasm.

As the Shiba Inu phenomenon continues to attract new investors, the community recognizes the growing vulnerability to scams. Groups like Shibarmy Scam Alerts empower individuals to identify and report fraudulent activity. By fostering a culture of awareness and vigilance, the community can collectively safeguard the integrity of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.
Being Aware Of Red Flags
While Shibarmy Scam Alerts plays a crucial role, individual responsibility remains paramount. Investors are encouraged to educate themselves on red flags associated with crypto scams. This includes being wary of unrealistic promises, unsolicited investment advice, and pressure tactics. Additionally, leveraging two-factor authentication and strong passwords for online accounts adds another layer of security.

Bitcoin or Gold? We asked ChatGPT which asset is a better buy for summer 2024


As summer 2024 approaches, investors are closely evaluating which asset–Bitcoin (BTC) or gold holds more promise.
With their divergent roles in investment portfolios, Bitcoin as a growing digital asset and gold as a traditional safeguard against economic shifts, Finbold sought insights from ChatGPT, OpenAI‘s advanced AI model, to determine which might excel in the coming months.
Amid a landscape riddled with economic and geopolitical uncertainties, the debate between Bitcoin and gold becomes increasingly relevant. Each asset offers distinct advantages: Bitcoin presents high growth potential, while gold is viewed as a stable hedge against inflation and volatility.


While both assets have historically been compared, their paths in 2024 have significantly diverged. Gold has surged amid rising global concerns, demonstrating its strength as a dependable asset during turbulent times
Conversely, Bitcoin has experienced more volatility; notably, its price took a hit during the Israel-Iran conflict, overshadowing positive sentiments from recent cryptocurrency halvings.
Despite reaching record highs earlier in the year, Bitcoin’s value plummeted to around $57,000 by May, marking a critical support level. Meanwhile, gold closed April at an all-time high, reinforcing its status as a robust investment option.
This contrast underscores the divergent paths and potential of each asset as investors weigh their options for the summer of 2024.
ChatGPT’s analysis: Bitcoin vs. Gold investment prospects
According to ChatGPT, the decision largely depends on individual investment strategies and risk tolerance. For those seeking higher growth potential and are comfortable with volatility, Bitcoin might be the preferable option.

Conversely, for those seeking stability and lower risk, gold might be the preferred choice.

Including both assets in a diversified portfolio could also be a wise approach to balance potential risks and rewards.

As of 2024, the year-to-date performance for Bitcoin and gold presents a clear contrast in investment returns. Bitcoin has seen a significant rise, with a YTD increase of 52%, showcasing its volatile yet high-growth nature. The current price of Bitcoin stands at approximately $64,342. 
On the other hand, gold, known for its stability and role as a safe haven asset, has gained 11.5% YTD, with its current price at about $2,301 per ounce.
This performance highlights the divergent characteristics and investor appeal between the two assets: Bitcoin attracts those seeking rapid growth and high returns, albeit at higher risk, while gold appeals to investors looking for a more stable and secure investment amidst economic fluctuations.

Crypto Rich vs. Lottery Winners: Bloomberg Explains How Spending Habits Differ | Cryptoglobe


                                
The rise of cryptocurrencies has not only created a new asset class but has also given birth to a new generation of wealthy individuals. As reported by Bloomberg News, a group of researchers has delved into the fascinating world of crypto wealth and its impact on the US economy. Their findings shed light on how the so-called “crypto rich” are spending their newfound fortunes and the ripple effects this has on various sectors, particularly the housing market.



According to the Bloomberg article, the researchers found that crypto gains have led to a significant increase in household consumption. Over the past decade, this extra spending amounted to approximately $30 billion. Interestingly, for every dollar of unrealized crypto gains, households spent about nine cents. While this may seem like a small figure, it’s nearly double the marginal propensity to consume compared to stock market returns, as noted by Bloomberg.



However, the spending habits of crypto winners differ from those of lottery winners. The researchers discovered that household spending from crypto gains more closely resembles the patterns seen in traditional equity investments rather than the splurges associated with sudden windfalls like lottery winnings, as reported by Bloomberg.



One of the most intriguing findings from the research, as mentioned by Bloomberg, is the impact of crypto wealth on local housing markets. The researchers found that a significant portion of crypto gains were channeled into real estate, particularly in regions where cryptocurrencies are popular, such as parts of California, Nevada, and Utah.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

To quantify this effect, the researchers looked at the crypto boom of 2017, when Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed by nearly 1,400%. By comparing home prices in counties with high crypto wealth to those with less enthusiasm for digital assets, they discovered that home prices in crypto-wealthy counties grew 43 basis points faster. This translated to a median house price increase of about $2,000 over 12 months, as reported by Bloomberg.



Furthermore, the researchers analyzed the impact of crypto wealth on home prices over the decade leading up to 2023. Bloomberg reports that for every dollar gained in households’ crypto wealth, the median home price increased by 15 cents over the following three months.



The Bloomberg article also highlights an interesting trend observed by the researchers when analyzing investors who withdrew at least $5,000 from their crypto brokerages between 2018 and 2023. These individuals increased their total spending by around $5,754 in the year following a large withdrawal compared to the previous year.



Notably, while mortgage spending remained constant in the six months prior to large withdrawals, it rose significantly after the event. Bloomberg says that for every household that withdrew $5,000 from their crypto exchange account, one in 20 purchased a house for the first time.

9 Celebrity Endorsements That Are Pushing Crypto Mainstream


																Grammy award-winning rapper Eminem recently cut an ad for Crypto.com to advertise blockchain to NBA fans. Here are 10 other celebrity endorsements that prove cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating.
But real quick first— here’s “The Real Slim Shady” singer’s X post with the Crypto.com advertisement:


“From the beginning you couldn’t stop, breaking resistance with every swing and block. Your game plan never changed.”
Bloomberg called the collaboration between a major crypto exchange, the hip-hop superstar, and the NBA a “sign of a dramatic shift in the crypto industry’s marketing and advertising efforts.”
Celebrity crypto endorsements are appearing again in commercial advertising six months after a jury in New York delivered a guilty verdict in the fraud case against the founder of failed crypto exchange FTX.
Here are 10 other celebrity endorsements over the years that show just how far mainstream adoption has come for cryptocurrency since Bitcoin mined its first block on Jan 3, 2009:
1. Elon Musk – Notorious Doge Father
To the inveterate engineer and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, finance isn’t all that interesting. In May 2020, he told Joe Rogan that finance is just a matter of keeping track of money, but what we do with our resources to advance civilization is more interesting to him.
However, Musk recognizes the important innovations blockchain has produced in finance. In fact, he has been pumping Dogecoin since 2019, when he first posted on social media, “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.”
Styling himself the “Doge Father,” Musk has said regarding his vocal support for cryptocurrencies:
“I might pump, but I don’t dump.”
2. Lindsay Lohan – Dollar Inflation Hawk
In Feb. 2021, less than a year after Bitcoin’s third halving, “Parent Trap” and “Mean Girls” star Lindsay Lohan tweeted “Bitcoin To The Moon” with a rocket emoji.


Lohan’s endorsement was true to form. As early as 2011, Lindsay tweeted that she was concerned inflation is getting out of control.
“Have you guys seen food and gas prices lately? U.S. $ will soon be worthless if the Fed keeps printing money!” Lohan posted.
3. Maisie Williams – Arya Long Bitcoin?
In Nov. 2020, just six months after Bitcoin’s four-year supply cut, HBO “Game of Thrones” star Maisie Williams tweeted, “Should I go long on Bitcoin” in 2020?” with a poll.
Nearly a million Twitter users voted, and 53% said “No,” while 47% said “Yes.”


4. Snoop Dogg – Pumps Dogecoin
Around the time Lindsay Lohan shipped Bitcoin in Feb. 2021, RIAA gold and platinum selling hip hop artist Snoop Dogg pumped DOGE tokens on Twitter.
The “Gin and Juice” singer had his mind on his money when he posted a photoshop of one of his album covers depicting him as a Shiba Inu, with the caption: “Snoop Doge.”


The price of DOGE tokens surged to a new record high of $0.0844 following the tweet from Snoop Dogg and another by Elon Musk. KISS frontman Gene Simmons joined in with a tweet encouraging Dogecoin owners to “HODLE!”
5. Ashton Kutcher – Early Bitcoin Investor
“That 70’s Show” actress Mila Kunis repped Bitcoin on Stephen Colbert’s show in 2021. Kunis told Colbert that Kutcher, who played Steve Jobs in the indie biopic “Jobs,” got them investing in Bitcoin as early as 2013.
“He sat me down and was like, ‘Hey, babe, I got to explain this thing to you; tell me if I’m crazy.’ He’s like, ‘There’s this thing, it’s like mining for money. It’s called cryptocurrency. And there’s this company.’ This was eight-plus years ago— ‘It’s called Bitcoin,'” Kunis told Colbert.
“I was like, ‘Well, I think this is a horrible idea,’ she continued. “And he went, ‘Cool, we’re investing in it.’ So, he didn’t listen to me. I mean, this happens all the time.”
6. LeBron James – Cut an ad for Crypto.com in 2022
Los Angeles Lakers Power Forward LeBron James and the LeBron James Family Foundation signed a multi-year contract with Crypto.com in 2022. The all-time leading scorer in NBA history’s first advertisement for the Singapore-based crypto exchange featured James giving advice to his younger self.
In the ad, James from the Future said, “I can’t tell you everything, but if you want to make history, you’ve got to call your own shots.”
VIDEO
7. Mark Cuban – Endorsed Polygon and Injective
In January this year, ABC Network’s “Shark Tank” judge and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban highlighted Polygon (MATIC) and Injective (INJ) to his 8.8 million followers on X. He wrote, “I’ve invested in both (DYOR).”
Cuban’s answer to fans who asked him about crypto in the AMA-style interview on X reveals he’s bullish for Ethereum because Polygon is an Ethereum Layer-2 extending the base chain’s ecosystem, and Injective is an L1 crypto with an ERC20 bridge to Ethereum for multi-chain interoperability.
8. Kevin O’Leary – Once Crypto Skeptic, Now Bitcoin Bull
Canadian businessman Kevin O’Leary, one of the other judges on the hit ABC show about venture capitalism, was once a crypto skeptic who called Bitcoin “garbage” and a “useless currency.” Like the late Berkshire don Charlie Munger, O’Leary believed “there is nothing here except raw speculation.”
Today, he is not only a Bitcoin bull but also calls himself a Bitcoin “purist” who buys to hold “digital gold” for the long term.
O’Leary doesn’t even support Bitcoin ETFs because he thinks it’s better to custody your own on-chain BTC so you are the bearer of your private keys. Plus, he says it saves on paying those ETF issuers’ fees, so crypto investors can accumulate faster.
Although O’Leary did predict the Bitcoin ETFs in July 2022.
9. Joe Rogan – Hyperbitcoinization Theory
Comedian, UFC announcer, and podcast king Joe Rogan told OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in an episode of his show last October:
“The real fascinating crypto is Bitcoin. To me, that’s the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency. It’s limited in the amount that there can be [and] people mine it with their own [computer]. That to me is very fascinating. I love the fact that it’s been implemented.”
Rogan has also brought Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos onto his show for four separate episodes over the years to explain blockchain technology and the significance of cryptocurrency in the modern economy.

Hiring roundup: Former LA mayor joins Coinbase - Blockworks


Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, has been hired as a policy adviser for Coinbase.
Villaraigosa, who served as the mayor of LA between 2005 and 2013, will join the cryptocurrency exchange’s global advisory council.
Faryar Shirzad, the chief policy officer at Coinbase, wrote in a post on X that Villaraigosa will advise the leadership team at Coinbase to advance “economic freedom around the world.” 
“When 18% of America is underbanked, including 25% of Black & Hispanic households, it means the traditional financial system doesn’t work for everyone. It’s time to update the system,” Shirzad wrote.
According to the LA Times, Villaraigosa will not lobby on behalf of the global exchange but will only advise the company on developing a fair and robust regulatory framework so that it can provide services for US-based customers, noting that crypto participants “need regulatory protection.”
Paradigm special counsel leaves 
Rodrigo Seira, the special counsel of the crypto-focused venture capital firm Paradigm, has resigned and returned to Cooley LLP, a law firm where he previously worked.
Seira served at Paradigm for two and a half years and helped spearhead the company’s policy lab. He was also a founding member of blockchain and crypto-focused law firm DLX Law.
Former Citibank executive joins BitGo
Brett Reeves, a former Citibank executive who has been in the banking industry for over two decades, will join BitGo, a scalable wallet solution, to expand EMEA Sales.
Reeves most recently held the position of head of business development at Bequant, a digital asset prime broker. He previously held roles at Citibank, Nomura and Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore.

Real Estate Is the New Luxury for Bitcoin Millionaires


The narrative that early Bitcoin investors indulged in extravagant luxuries like Lamborghinis is shifting. 
Recent research suggests crypto millionaires are now channeling their newfound wealth into real estate investments, indicating a more mature spending pattern.
Bitcoin Millionaires Are Maturing
According to a study involving researchers from esteemed institutions like Brigham Young, Northwestern, and Imperial College London, the increase in crypto wealth has notably influenced the American real estate market. 
Their analysis, presented to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., used data from 60 million people over 13 years. It revealed that approximately nine cents fueled household spending for every dollar of unrealized crypto gains.
While social media often glorifies lavish spending on luxury cars and jewelry, the actual economic impact of crypto wealth has been more nuanced. The study highlights a propensity among crypto millionaires to invest in housing. This is paralleling traditional equity investments rather than fleeting lottery winnings. 

“Our estimates suggest that household spending out of crypto gains aligns more with the patterns from traditional equity investments,” noted Darren Aiello, assistant professor of finance at BYU.


Read more: Who Owns the Most Bitcoin in 2024?
This trend was particularly evident in 2017 when Bitcoin surged from about $950 to $14,000. Researchers found that home prices rose significantly faster in areas with high levels of crypto engagement than in less crypto-centric locations. Specifically, homes in these crypto-wealthy counties appreciated by an additional 43 basis points over 12 months.
Moreover, a separate analysis of crypto brokerage withdrawals showed that substantial sums withdrawn led to increased spending on housing shortly thereafter. 


“For every household that withdrew $5,000 from their crypto exchange account, one in 20 bought a house for the first time,” Jason Kotter, another finance professor at BYU, shared.

The shift towards real estate investment among Bitcoin millionaires reflects a strategic approach to wealth management. It diverges from the stereotypical image of frivolous spending.

This downward trend persisted, resulting in a price of around $0.53 by the week’s close. This decline equated to a loss of 12.10% of its value, positioning it as the third-largest loser, as per CoinMarketCap.

Binance Ban in Philippines Spurs Shift to Local Exchanges Amidst Higher Fees and Token Limitations



                    

Following Binance‘s expulsion from the Philippines, traders in the country now face increased trading fees and a reduced selection of crypto tokens, as indicated by a regional executive.



On December 14, 2023, the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated a three-month countdown to a Binance prohibition. 




Kelvin Lee of the SEC noted Binance’s failure to register in the Philippines and adhere to regulations.



The National Telecommunication Commission (NTC) instructed local internet service providers to block the exchange on March 25. 



Subsequently, on April 23, the SEC directed Apple and Google to remove the Binance app from their stores.




With the ban in full effect, Cointelegraph contacted local stakeholders to gauge the impact of the Binance ban on the Philippine crypto space.



Ethan Rose, CEO of Pouch, which facilitates Bitcoin payments in the Philippines, applauded the ban, citing former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s involvement in serious financial crimes.

Rose emphasized the ban’s protective nature for Filipino traders.




Rose highlighted a shift of business to local exchanges due to the ban, predicting a positive effect on the local economy and global investment funding for Philippine crypto businesses.



However, Rose acknowledged the trade-offs, foreseeing higher trading fees and fewer token options for Filipino traders.



Arlone Polo Abello, CEO of Global Miranda Miner Group, characterized the SEC action as not a significant crackdown but a reflection of the US SEC’s registration requirements for exchanges like Binance. 



Abello noted Binance’s lack of communication with Filipino traders, which was apparent in their focus group discussions.



Jay Ricky Villarante, CEO of Moneybees, emphasized the importance of regulatory compliance in the crypto industry. 



He viewed the ban as a step towards regulatory clarity in the Philippine crypto market, fostering confidence and responsible innovation.



In summary, while acknowledging both positive and negative implications, Villarante deemed the ban a significant development for crypto in the Philippines.

Subsidiary of Kraken Becoming Under-the-Radar Beneficiary of Multi-Billion ETF Boom: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A subsidiary of US-based crypto exchange Kraken is reportedly greatly benefiting from the success of the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) boom.
According to a new report by Bloomberg, CF Benchmarks – a London-based subsidiary of Kraken that provides reference data for about $24 billion in crypto ETFs – is emerging as an under-the-radar beneficiary to the launch of the BTC ETFs.










A benchmark is a standard used for comparative purposes when assessing the performance of assets or a portfolio.
According to Bloomberg, CF Benchmarks licenses its benchmarks to Bitcoin ETF issuers including BlackRock in exchange for fees that increase as an issuer’s assets under management rise.
Spot market BTC ETFs were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January and also debuted in Hong Kong within the last two weeks.
CF Benchmarks chief executive Sui Chung tells Bloomberg in an interview that he envisions BTC ETFs hitting Israel and South Korea after being approved by regulators in Hong Kong.
“South Korea is a market where ETFs have become the wrapper of choice for long-term savings. It is also a market where digital assets have gained a high degree of adoption.”
According to Bloomberg, CF Benchmarks expected $5 billion of assets from spot market BTC ETFs that utilize its indices but ended up with a figure four times larger than that.
Chung also tells Bloomberg he expects another $1 billion in assets to come under management for Hong Kong BTC ETFs by the end of the year.
Chung says that CF Benchmarks – which was acquired by Kraken in 2019 for a nine-figure sum – sees its revenue growing to the “mid-double digits” this year.
Bitcoin is trading for $63,433 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

Bitcoin Sender Struck With Staggering $100,254 Transaction Fee For A Single Transfer ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
An unidentified Bitcoin user has just shelled out a transaction fee of 1.5 Bitcoin (BTC), equivalent to $100,254, based on the current market price. The exorbitant fee was brought to light on Saturday by Whale Alert, a popular service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions. 







The fee is quite higher than the average transaction cost, resulting in wild speculation regarding the circumstances that might have led to such an expensive fee. This Bitcoin user paid this high fee to have their transaction included in an ordinary Bitcoin block.



Possible Reasons



Bitcoin transaction fees are dolled out to miners as part of their reward for verifying transactions and including them in new blocks added to Bitcoin’s blockchain. Normally, Bitcoin users can pay any amount they wish for transaction fees. If the transaction fee is too low, miners might not accept it, and if it’s outrageously high, miners are incentivized miners to process the transaction more quickly.



Average transaction fees are typically around $2 or $4 but rose to as high as $128 recently amid the quadrennial halving event and debut of Casey Rodarmor’s new Runes. This represented a record-level period in terms of fees, with a few costly, urgent transactions skewing the metric.



However, transaction fees have since stabilized, and the latest sky-high fee appears to be an individual error instead of a wider market impact. It could also be reasons known only to the sender or even related to money laundering.

&nbsp



Over its history, Bitcoin has witnessed several high-value transaction fees. For instance, in September 2023, a Bitcoin user paid 19 BTC (worth $510,000 at the time) for a BTC transfer.



Additionally, another BTC user paid over 4 BTC in January to have their transfer added to Bitcoin block 826,032. The transaction was, therefore, charged with an eye-watering 1,800,890 sat/vB fee.



Bitcoin was valued at $63,942 at press time, shedding a measly 0.3% over the last 24 hours.

Cardano founder proposes Bitcoin Cash integration in X poll

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently posted a “hypothetical poll” on the X social media platform asking the crypto community if they’d be interested in seeing a Cardano and Bitcoin Cash integration. The poll received more than 12,000 votes in its first 24 hours with a 66.3% early majority voting “yes” to the proposal. Source: @IOHK_Charles on X. “Would you like to see Bitcoin Cash become a Cardano Partnerchain upgraded with Useful Proof of Work Leios, NiPoPoWs, and Ergo tech, thus being the fastest and most useful proof of work chain ever built?”As mentioned above, Hoskinson labelled his poll as being hypothetical. However, as Elon Musk has shown since his purchase of the X platform, formerly Twitter, it’s possible to use the platform as a steering point for decision making. Ben Scherrey, founder and CTO of blockchain firm Biggest Lab, posted commentary in favor of the move, stating that he’d “always thought there was some natural synergy between the two chains given the shared UTXO model that allows for high scalability and decentralization.”While the community appears to support the idea of a Bitcoin Cash and Cardano integration, how such a partnership would form and function is a bit murky.On the technology side, Hoskinson used the term “partnerchain.” This seems to imply Bitcoin Cash would have to be bridged or cross-chained in some form in order to operate with the proposed upgrades. Assuming both development teams could come to an accord on the technical aspects of the partnership, there would still need to be a consensus among stakeholders and developers. Hoskinson’s discourse on social media comes as Cardano prepares for two “major upgrades” this year. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the company is preparing for the “Chang” hardfork slated for sometime in the second quarter of 2024 as well a new proof-of-stake model called “Ouroboros Leios.” The pending upgrades were lauded by Hoskinson in his response to an April 7 video posted by crypto influencer Ben “Bitboy” Armstrong. In the video, Armstrong referred to Cardano as “dead” Related: Crypto veterans call out DOJ for targeting Roger Ver a decade after he left US

Ripple CTO hints at progress in developing XRP Ledger stablecoin

Ripple has suggested substantial developments within its new stablecoin, billed to revolutionize the XRP Ledger environment. The information surfaced at the XRP Las Vegas conference where Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz revealed upcoming integrations, including the stablecoin, with the XRP Ledger.Ripple CTO provides insights at XRP Las VegasDuring the XRP Las Vegas conference, David Schwartz, who is the CTO of Ripple, provided a detailed review of the capabilities of the XRP Ledger including both the features it already has and the developments planned in the near future. The focus of his presentation was on the proposed automated market maker (AMM), a new lending protocol, and the combination of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Nonetheless, the biggest news for many of those present was the news on the work on a stablecoin developed by Ripple.Schwartz noted that more information related to the stablecoin would be revealed at the XRPL Apex event that will gather in Amsterdam from June 11 to 13. This news has increased the excitement among XRP holders and the market as well, emphasizing Ripple’s determination to develop its blockchain ecosystem.Ripple’s stablecoin effectSeen as an innovative addition to the XRP Ledger, the proposed Ripple stablecoin seeks to be backed by 100% U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government security, and other cash equivalents. This stablecoin is intended to help institutions that have not fully adopted digital assets to move easily into the realm of cryptocurrencies and take advantage of the decentralized nature of the XRP Ledger.The crucial part of XRP’s strategy is to leverage the ledger’s native decentralized exchange and upcoming automated market maker in order to drive wider adoption as well as support new institutional and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. In particular, Vet, a dUNL validator, highlighted the use cases the XLS-68D Sponsor specification allows, once again making it clear that the XRP Ledger is technically capable to support such advanced features.XRP’s stablecoin enhances XRP Ledger flexibilityThe stablecoin’s launch is in compliance with Ripple’s general strategy aimed at enhancing the usefulness and flexibility of the XRP Ledger. The provision of a stable and dependable digital currency option would see Ripple bring on board new institutional users and DeFi applications and in so doing, making the network more robust and attractive.This program is part of Ripple’s innovative initiative aimed at bringing cryptocurrency applications that push the limit of blockchain capabilities and practicality of cryptocurrency in real life. As the forthcoming XRL Apex conference in Amsterdam gains traction, not only the XRP users but also the potential investors watch Ripple’s actions, casting their eyes at the future prospects of the digital financial market that would be reshaped by this development.

Tron Founder’s Team Wallet Moves 120K EETH To Swell L2 Coin Edition


							

An address connected to Justin Sun has moved 120,000 EETH worth $376 million to Swell L2.



Reportedly, the transferred EETH accounts for 46.6% of the total deposits of Swell L2.



The same address, holding 48,374.301353998937694271 ETH, previously moved 120,000 ETH to EtherFi.




TRON Founder Justin Sun has recently created headlines in connection to a massive $300+ million worth of Ether (ETH). According to an X post by Colin Wu, a Chinese crypto journalist, an address related to Sun deposited 120,000 EETH, worth $376 million, into Swell L2.







EETH or ether.fi Staked ETH is the non-custodial liquid staking token for Ethereum. In other words, it is the ETH deposited into the liquid restaking protocol, EtherFi. As per Colin Wu, the address 0x7a9…3095, which is allegedly connected to Sun, transferred 120k EETH to Swell L2, a blockchain ecosystem.

However, a sharp fall of 30% in its trading volume over the last day, currently at $8,488,500,862, shows the varying trends in the market. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is traded at $63,461, with a slight surge of 0.57%.

Trump vs. Biden: Krugman Examines the "Are You Better Off" Debate | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent opinion piece for The New York Times, economist Paul Krugman revisits the question once posed by Ronald Reagan: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” 



Krugman is a renowned American economist, a Nobel Prize laureate, and a prominent public intellectual. He’s known for his expertise in international trade and economic theory, his work as a columnist for The New York Times, and his progressive economic views. Krugman has a strong academic background, having taught at prestigious institutions like MIT and Princeton. He won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his groundbreaking work on economic geography and trade patterns.pen_spark



Krugman uses the famous question to evaluate the current political discourse surrounding the potential return of Donald Trump, suggesting that an honest assessment would favor President Biden due to significant improvements since 2020.



Krugman says that four years ago, during Trump’s presidency, the U.S. grappled with the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, witnessing massive loss of lives daily, skyrocketing unemployment with over 20 million Americans out of work, and a surge in violent crime. Fast forward to today, Krugman notes, the U.S. has enjoyed the longest stretch of sub-4% unemployment rates since the 1960s and a reduction in violent crime rates that spiked under Trump.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Krugman argues against giving Trump a pass for the crises of 2020, which some attribute solely to the pandemic. He suggests that if Trump is excused due to these extraordinary circumstances, Biden should similarly be given leeway for challenges occurring during his administration that might be aftermaths of the same disruptions. He points specifically to the inflation surge of 2021-2022, which paralleled economic patterns in Europe, indicating broader, global causes likely related to the pandemic’s effects.



Addressing Trump’s touted economic wins, such as the brief period of sub-$2 per gallon gas prices, Krugman criticizes these claims as fleeting and linked to the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic, rather than successful economic policy. He emphasizes that, by most measures, Americans are economically better off now than before the pandemic began, with real per capita incomes and wages generally increasing more than inflation.



Despite these economic gains under Biden, Krugman observes a mismatch between public economic sentiment and actual personal financial conditions, a phenomenon he attributes to the psychological impacts of inflation, where visible price increases might overshadow real wage gains.



Krugman concludes by reflecting on the allure of “Trump-stalgia,” a nostalgic and perhaps glossed-over remembrance of Trump’s presidency, overlooking the significant hardships of 2020. He suggests that while Biden has successfully navigated the nation to a state of lower unemployment, reduced inflation, and decreased crime rates, many Americans remain unaware of these improvements, influenced by a selective memory of past challenges.

Ripple's Brad Garlinghouse Talks XRP Before Stablecoin Launch


Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse clarified the status of XRP and Ethereum in the eyes of regulatory bodies. 
Amidst Ripple’s intense legal encounters with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Garlinghouse’s comments carry significant weight, especially with Ripple nearing the launch of its stablecoin.
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse: XRP Is Not a Security, Stablecoin Coming
Garlinghouse, in a conversation with Michael Arrington of Arrington Capital, stated that neither XRP nor Ethereum are securities. This assertion is crucial as Ripple prepares to introduce a stablecoin, underscoring its stance in a complex regulatory environment.

“Anyone who thinks Ripple is not 100% behind XRP is just missing the point. They have lost the plot. We are totally committed and we will remain totally committed,” Garlinghouse said.

The ongoing debate regarding the classification of digital assets like XRP and Ethereum has seen various developments. Notably, a July 2023 court ruling partially relieved Ripple by declaring XRP not a security. Still, it pointed out that certain institutional sales of XRP were unregistered securities sales.

Meanwhile, Ethereum faces its challenges. Consensys recently sued the SEC, seeking a declaration to preempt any claims that Ethereum is an unregistered security.

As Ripple gears up for the next phase, the fintech giant is teasing advancements in its XRP Ledger ecosystem. At the same conference, Ripple CTO David Schwartz discussed the upcoming Ripple stablecoin alongside innovations in automated market makers (AMM) and lending protocols. 
The Ripple community is keenly awaiting further details, which are expected to be unveiled at the XRPL Apex event in Amsterdam.
The proposed Ripple stablecoin, backed by US dollar deposits and short-term US government treasuries, is tailored for institutions unable to utilize digital assets directly but eager to leverage the XRP Ledger. According to Vet, an XRPL dUNL validator, the stablecoin could revolutionize institutional and decentralized finance by utilizing the ledger’s decentralized exchange and automated market maker features.

Bitcoin Whales Gobble Over 47,000 BTC Worth $2,967,768,000 in Just 24 Hours Amid ‘New Era’: CryptoQuant CEO - The Daily Hodl


								The chief executive of blockchain intelligence platform CryptoQuant says that Bitcoin (BTC) whales have snapped up nearly $3 billion worth of the crypto king in just 24 hours.
CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju tells his 345,000 followers on the social media platform X that the deep-pocketed investors have gobbled up tens of thousands of BTC in just one day, signaling the approach of a new era.










“Bitcoin whales accumulated 47,000 BTC in the past 24 hours. We’re entering a new era.”
Source: Ki Young Ju/X
To get these results, Ju used CryptoQuant search filters to find whales of the top crypto asset by market cap that hold at least 100 BTC, had a transaction within a 24-hour time frame and do not qualify as a centralized exchange (CEX) or miner wallet.
Ju goes on to note that the recent spike of whale activity surrounding Bitcoin is not related to BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January.
Last month, Ju said that newer crypto whales – or investors that CryptoQuant defines as holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin with an average coin age of less than 155 days – have accumulated nearly twice as much BTC as their long-term holder counterparts.
Long-term holder whales hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin with an average coin age of 155 days or more
At the time, Ju said old BTC tokens were being transferred to new holders after Bitcoin’s average dormancy rate recently hit a 13-year peak.
Bitcoin is trading for $63,582 at time of writing, a 2.86% increase during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin’s Bullish Reversal: Is $83,500 in Sight Before July? - Coin Edition


							

Bitcoin has soared 14% since the crash to $56.6K, reclaiming the $64K channel.
An analyst said $67.5K re-entry sets the path to new ATH in the $83.5K level.
Where the re-entry fails, a retest of $60K is expected before the rally to $83.5K by July.




Over the last 48 hours, the crypto market has been in a significant recovery mode, with the premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), reclaiming the $64K threshold. This bullish market emerged less than a week after Bitcoin collapsed to $56,500.



With Bitcoin’s intraday high of $64,500 at press time, the premier asset has rebounded by over 14.15% since the May 1 crash. Expectedly, the alternative cryptocurrencies have leveraged Bitcoin’s rebound to regain lost territories.









However, given that the market’s recovery has been ongoing for at least two days, prominent market watchers are examining how long the recovery could last before another bearish turn.



Among those commenting on the subject is Matthew Hyland, a widely followed Bitcoin analyst. In a recent post on X, Hyland suggested two possible scenarios that could play out. 



Initially, the analyst argued that Bitcoin reclaiming $67,500 in this bullish run would set the path for a more aggressive rally that would drive the asset’s price to unexplored price territories. More specifically, he sees Bitcoin establishing a new all-time high shortly after regaining $67.5K.



Meanwhile, in a follow-up post, he highlighted other events that could surface if Bitcoin fails to re-enter the $67,500 range. He presented a chart that foreshadows Bitcoin’s trajectory.



The graph suggested the market could witness a brief retracement to the $60,500 price level. However, this development is anticipated to catapult Bitcoin’s value to $71,500. Meanwhile, another retest of the $67K range is expected following the surge to $71,500. 





In Hyland’s view, this retest would aggressively push Bitcoin toward the $83,500 range, a price level the premier asset has never seen. Interestingly, Hyland expects these projections to materialize before July.



Other prominent market observers have conveyed similar optimism that Bitcoin is headed for the $80K range after the crash to $56K. At press time, BTC trades at around $63,870.

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) Surges 225% in 5 Hours and Prepares for New 3,000% Rally, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, has been attracting significant investment from early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.



Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) has surged around 225% in the first few hours since its launch,  delivering huge returns for early investors and attracting investment from early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, DOCPEPE still has plenty of potential to rise more, and it’s poised to rally another 3,000% in the coming 48 hours.



Furthermore, it has already been announced that the token will soon be listed on MEXC – as its first listing on a centralized exchange – and this will be another massively bullish event for its price.



Despite the rally so far, DOCPEPE still just has a market cap of around $34,000, meaning it has immense potential for more gains in the coming days and weeks.




Currently, Doctor Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DOCPEPE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for DOCPEPE by entering its contract address – 3n8HMVVfMF2uqdpts5TUETAHUrvD1AFg8V1XLahpeTT8 – in the receiving field.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Crypto Analyst Foresees Altcoin Boom Amid Economic Downturn: 'Altcoin Bull Market Has Started' - Benzinga

In the wake of dismal U.S. economic data, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe forecasted a substantial rally in the altcoin markets.What Happened: On Friday, van de Poppe communicated his optimistic stance on cryptocurrencies to his followers on the social media platform X.This comes in the wake of the U.S. labor market falling short of estimates in April, with unemployment climbing to 3.9% and average hourly earnings growing less than anticipated. Van de Poppe believes that these economic indicators will compel the Federal Reserve to activate the money printers to bolster the job market, leading to a rally in risk-on assets.Also Read: Amid Dogecoin Crash, 374 Million DOGE Moved From Robinhood To Unknown Wallet"Terrible economic data -> DXY (US dollar index) down. Additionally, the case for QE (quantitative easing) and rate cuts will increase, and therefore risk-on assets rally," he said. The analyst also foresees a consolidation period for the altcoin market before it rallies to record new all-time highs.He predicted the total altcoin market capitalization to stabilize in the $880-$920 billion range before a run toward an all-time high.Van de Poppe also expects the resurgence of retail traders in the crypto markets once altcoins register significant gains."Retail isn’t even in the markets, while Bitcoin is around the all-time highs. When will they come back? It will probably be after this summer when altcoins start to lift off," he said.Why It Matters: The recent downturn in the altcoin market has been attributed to supply and demand dynamics and a loss of momentum, as reported by pseudonymous crypto strategist Pentoshi.The frequent launch of new altcoins diluted demand, necessitating around $200 million a day in new money inflows to maintain current prices.Furthermore, cryptocurrency strategist Altcoin Sherpa recently predicted a 267% surge in the value of Solana SOL/USD by the end of the year. He suggested that buying shares of Solana at current levels could yield substantial future gains. These forecasts align with van de Poppe's predictions, indicating a potential boom in the altcoin market.Now Read: Crypto Markets Tumble Following Iran's Drone Attack Against Israel, Investor Warns Of Continued SelloffThis content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock

Lido Finance Surpasses One Million Ethereum Validators, Cementing its DeFi Dominance



                    

Lido Finance, the premier decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol for liquid staking on Ethereum, has celebrated a significant milestone, reaching one million Ethereum validators. 



This achievement was announced through an April 29th post on X, underscoring Lido Finance’s position as a leader in the DeFi space.




Liquid staking protocols such as Lido Finance play a crucial role in democratizing staking for retail users with limited capital. 



Typically, individuals would require 32 Ether to operate their own validator nodes on Ethereum. 



However, Lido Finance offers an alternative avenue, making staking accessible to a broader audience.




According to data from Dune, Lido Finance commands a substantial portion, 28.5%, of staked Ether, with an additional 13.6% staked through the Coinbase exchange. 



Presently, over 27% of the entire Ether supply is engaged in staking activities.



The appeal of liquid staking protocols like Lido lies in the liquidity benefits they provide. 



Users who participate in staking through Lido receive Lido Staked ETH (stETH) in return, which can be utilized in various other DeFi protocols. 




This stands in contrast to traditional staking methods, where staked Ether remains locked and inaccessible for the duration of the staking period.

The rise of liquid staking is significantly contributing to the growth of DeFi. 



Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols has experienced a substantial surge, reaching $97 billion in the first quarter of 2024 from a low of $36 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. 



Current TVL stands at $92.32 billion, according to DefiLlama.



This growth, which saw a 65.6% increase quarter-on-quarter, can be primarily attributed to liquid staking protocols like Lido, as noted by on-chain intelligence provider Messari. 



The cumulative TVL amassed by liquid staking protocols exceeds $47.7 billion, with Lido alone accounting for over $29.9 billion.



Despite its success, concerns have been raised about Lido’s growing dominance within the ecosystem. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has previously expressed apprehensions regarding potential centralization risks associated with Lido. 



In a blog post dating back to September 2023, Buterin highlighted the need for vigilance against such risks, acknowledging the efforts made by protocols like Lido in implementing safeguards while cautioning that one layer of defense may not suffice.

Binance [BNB] might attempt to break out according to the 4-hour chart. But AMBCrypto’s analysis revealed that this effort could be in vain.
One of the reasons for this prediction is the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This indicator measures trend direction over some time.
At press time, BNB changed hands at $586. But the 20 EMA (blue) and 50 EMA (yellow) were at the same spot. The EMA positions indicated hesitation by bulls and bears to direct the price action.
Hence, BNB might trade within a tight range unless a crossover happens.
Golden cross gone: Death cross next?
If the 20 EMA crosses over the 50 EMA, the price might extend toward $593. But that seemed unlikely as the next target for BNB could be $561 where the last golden cross happened.
For those unfamiliar, the golden cross is the terminology used to describe a situation when the 20 EMA crosses above the 50 EMA. If the 50 EMA rises above it, then it is termed a dearth cross.
Source: TradingView
Apart from the indicator above, another one that suggested a decline was the Money Flow Index (MFI).
This indicator uses the price and volume data to show if a cryptocurrency is experiencing buying pressure or otherwise.
At press time, the MFI had decreased to 66.04, indicating that the BNB’s buying volume had subsided. Should the reading continue to decline, the bearish thesis might be validated.
However, this AMBCrypto analysis was not the only one sharing this view. A look at on-chain data revealed that a large part of the market expects the price of BNB to decrease.
Bears double-down on wager
This was evident from the Weighted Sentiment, which was negative at press time. This negative value shows that most comments about BNB on social platforms were bearish.
As long as this remains the same, it could be challenging for the price to jump. On the other hand, if remarks about BNB begin to get optimistic, the trend might change.
Furthermore, a look at the Funding Rate showed that it was on the extreme side of the negative area. The Funding Rate meant more traders leaned toward short positions.
Source: Santiment
If funding was positive, it would have implied that traders were bullish on the coin. In addition, funding also has an impact on the price. From the press time status, BNB’s price moved lower while funding was negative.

The reasonable inference here is that perp sellers are aggressive, and were getting rewards for their positions.
In a case like this, BNB might fade a bullish move, and a possible decline could be next unless spot buyers save the day.

Consensys Lawsuit Unveils SEC's Belief in Ether as Potential Security



                    

Consensys’ legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has brought to light significant revelations regarding the SEC’s position on Ether.



According to a report by Fox Business producer Eleanor Terret, the SEC and its chair, Gary Gensler, held the belief that Ether constituted a security, at least for a certain period. 




Terret, referencing court documents filed by Consensys on April 29, stated that the SEC and Gensler “appear to have believed for at least a year” that Ether was an “unregistered security trading out of compliance with current federal regulations.”



This disclosure follows Consensys’ submission of an unredacted complaint against the SEC to a Texas federal court on April 25, in response to a Wells notice from the SEC outlining its intent to sue Consensys for alleged violations of federal securities laws.



The newly revealed documents indicate that on March 28, 2023, Gurbir Grewal, the head of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, sanctioned a formal investigation into Ether’s classification as a security. 




Dubbed the “Ethereum 2.0” investigation, this initiative empowered enforcement personnel to scrutinize and subpoena individuals and entities engaged in the trading of the cryptocurrency.



Sources familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, disclosed that subpoena recipients were instructed to maintain strict confidentiality regarding the investigation if they sought additional information from the SEC.



The genesis of the “Ethereum 2.0” investigation stemmed from the SEC’s suspicion that potential unregistered offerings and sales of Ether had taken place since at least 2018.

Should the SEC under Gensler’s leadership deem Ether a security, it would contradict prior guidance provided by the SEC under former Chair Jay Clayton. 



In June 2018, Bill Hinman, then-Director of Corporation Finance, declared in a speech the SEC’s stance that Ether, along with Bitcoin, did not qualify as securities.



Further revelations from the filings indicate that the five-member commission authorized the Division of Enforcement’s “Ethereum 2.0” investigation on April 13, 2023, merely five days before Gensler faced questioning before the House Financial Services Committee, where he declined to clarify the SEC’s stance on Ether’s classification as a security.



This development coincides with recent assertions by applicants and entities involved in a potential Ether exchange-traded fund in the U.S., suggesting an anticipated delay by the SEC in reaching a decision regarding the approval of such a product in May.



ETF analyst Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg believes that Gensler’s ambiguous position on Ether could influence the decision-making process, given his previous reluctance to define Ether as a security.

                        The testing version of the ckETH minter on Internet Computer (ICP) mainnet has been upgraded, now featuring the Sepolia version of the USDC token.In a recent forum post, Christian Müller, Senior Software Engineer at DFINITY, revealed that users can obtain Sepolia ETH from various faucets available online and Sepolia USDC to engage with the Sepolia ETH and USDC tokens.Once acquired, users can deposit both Sepolia ETH and USDC to mint ckETH and ckUSDC, respectively. DFINITY Foundation is a not-for-profit organization developing technology for the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain.Internet Computer’ ckETH is Not Required to Deposit USDC
It’s important to note that while ckETH is not required to deposit USDC, it is necessary to withdraw ckUSDC and receive USDC back. Additionally, a portion of the ckSepoliaETH will be used by the minter canister to cover transfer transactions on the Sepolia testnet.The canister IDs of the ckSepoliaETH minter are also available for reference. Furthermore, the ckSepoliaETH minter offers a dashboard displaying conversions and corresponding Ethereum transactions for both ckETH and ckERC20 transactions. Developers interested in supporting conversions between ERC20 and the corresponding ck-twin token in their dapps are encouraged to start experimenting with ckUSDC.Müller emphasizes that the project is still in development, meaning users may encounter bugs and the canister’s state may reset upon upgrades. “It is expected that there are still bugs. Please help us make ckETH/ckUSDC rock solid by reporting those here,” he wrote. “In case the instructions don’t work for you, please report back, and we’ll be happy to help and improve the instructions.”It’s worth noting that, currently, there is no user-friendly front-end available, so users should be comfortable using dfx calls, especially for the final step.In June last year, the ICP launched an upgrade proposed by the community to expand support for all canister smart contracts, enabling users to hold and transfer ICP tokens.Meanwhile, DFINITY aims to directly integrate the Bitcoin (BTC) network with the Internet Computer, bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin through an application of Chain Key cryptography, they said.

New 'Brokewell' Smartphone Attack Drains Bank Accounts and Leaks Location, Posing 'Significant Threat to Banking Industry': Report - The Daily Hodl


								Security researchers are issuing an urgent alert about a new malware attack that’s targeting Android users’ bank accounts.
The malware, which has been nicknamed “Brokewell,” takes the form of a fake Google Chrome browser update webpage that mimics Google’s own messaging style, reports ThreatFabric.










When users are directed to the page, they see a message stating that Chrome needs to be updated.
If users fall for the fake ad, criminals gain full control of the device, allowing them to capture banking credentials as they’re entered on screen as well as record audio, collect information about the device, access call history and track geolocation data.
“The analysis of the samples revealed that Brokewell poses a significant threat to the banking industry, providing attackers with remote access to all assets available through mobile banking. The Trojan appears to be in active development, with new commands added almost daily.”
Source: ThreatFabric / Fake Ad Depicted on Right
ThreatFabric says its analysis shows the malicious application is a previously unknown malware family with a wide range of capabilities.
“Brokewell is equipped with “accessibility logging,” capturing every event happening on the device: touches, swipes, information displayed, text input, and applications opened. All actions are logged and sent to the command-and-control server, effectively stealing any confidential data displayed or entered on the compromised device…
Malware families like Brokewell pose a significant risk for customers of financial institutions, leading to successful fraud cases that are hard to detect without proper fraud detection measures. We believe that only a comprehensive, multi-layered fraud detection solution—based on a combination of indicators, including device, behavior, and identity risks for each customer—can effectively identify and prevent potential fraud from malware families like the newly discovered Brokewell.”
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has released a set of guidelines on how to avoid malware attacks.
Among other things, the agency recommends that people download well-known software directly from the source, avoid clicking potentially suspicious links, ignore pop ups, read browser security alerts and scan devices for malicious activity.

Oil King (OILKING) to Explode 8,300% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Oil King (OILKING) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Oil King (OILKING), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Oil King presents a similar opportunity.



Oil King has market cap below $25,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate massive returns in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,300% in the coming two days, and Oil King could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Oil King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Oil King on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Oil King by entering its contract address – H5LmDBec75DmGLwtALURVAtLuVDUX1GMh5CGQ8r5h5rU – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like OILKING.

Arbitrum leads Ethereum L2s in key areas: Will ARB's price follow? - AMBCrypto



Arbitrum outperformed all other Ethereum L2s in overall inflows.
Activity on the network grew, but TVL continued to decline.

Ever since Arbitrum [ARB] launched its token, it has taken over the L2 space, and how!
Over the last few months, the protocol has managed to retain its dominance in the Layer 2 sector despite new entrants.
Layer 2 networks see growth
According to Token Terminal’s data, Arbitrum has managed to see one of the highest amounts of inflows and has out-competed other Layer 2 solutions on the Ethereum [ETH] network.
Source: Token Terminal
Arbitrum was doing extremely well in terms of activity as well. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Artemis’ data revealed that the number of daily active addresses on the Arbitrum network had grown significantly.
In the past week, the number of active addresses grew from 250,000 to 400,000. The number of daily transactions grew as well, sitting at around 1.5 million at press time.
Source: Artemis
Some problems ahead
However, there were some problems being faced by Arbitrum on the DeFi front.
Notably, the DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes on Arbitrum had fallen from 2.2 billion to 500 million over the course of the last few days.
Coupled with that, the TVL (Total Value Locked) also took a hit. Since March, the TVL collected on Arbitrum fell from $3.30 billion to $2.65 billion.
The combination of these factors led to a loss of revenue for the network.
Source: Artemis
Another concern was the network development. AMBCrypto’s examination of Token Terminal’s data revealed that the number of code commits had declined.
Coupled with that, the number of core developers contributing to the network had also fallen. These factors could impede the overall growth of Arbitrum, going forward.
Source: Token Terminal
Even though these factors may momentarily impact Arbitrum’s growth, its rising activity proves that the protocol can improve in the future as users continue to stay interested in the network.
Moreover, the popularity of Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum, helps the popularity of Layer 1s, in this case, Ethereum.

Realistic or not, here’s ARB’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Layer 2 solutions help networks such as Ethereum scale, and make the network more accessible for users as well.
The growth of the Arbitrum protocol will invariably result in the rise in popularity of the Ethereum network as well.

Osmosis co-founder Sunny Aggarwal on costumes, Cosmos, and the ‘Bitcoin renaissance’

Even if you’re not an avid ‘Cosmonaut,’ you’re probably familiar with Sunny Aggarwal, the co-founder of Osmosis Labs. With an infectious smile and upbeat personality, Sunny’s name is surprisingly apt. He’s the type of person whose deep intellect, quick wit, and unbridled passion light up the spaces around him.We were scheduled to meet at Cosmos Dubai during Token2049 but life had other plans. The Cosmos side event wasn’t to be. Dubai was struck by the worst floods in 75 years, reducing the skyscraping desert metropolis to a lake and plunging entire neighborhoods underwater. “There’s always Cosmoverse in October,” Sunny smiles. “We can catch up in person then.”The rise and rise of OsmosisI was looking forward to seeing what outfit Sunny would wear; he has quite the collection, donning a spectrum of eye-popping costumes, from a 40lb suit of chainmail armor to a Byzantine General costume with a striking red-crested helmet. “Ah, I keep the cooler outfits for the bigger events like Cosmoverse or Osmocon,” he explains, “if I wore a new one for every event, my costume budget would get way too high,” he laughs. On the other side of the screen, from Sunny’s New York apartment, he looks decidedly more lowkey today.As the Cosmos ecosystem’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX), Osmosis announced surpassing $32 billion in all-time trading volume that day. I ask how it feels to mastermind the most popular project in Cosmos and to reach such an impressive milestone.“I think it said Osmosis DEX wanted to get to $40 billion, [in the tweet]” he replies, “but I’m waiting for $100 billion.”Sunny is unashamedly ambitious. Did he always know Osmosis would be such a success? He ponders:“The immediate traction it got when we launched was very surprising. Cosmos had a lot of high-value assets that weren’t listed on centralized exchanges, but we didn’t realize how big of a deal that would be.”Growth hacking and the bumps along the roadIt wasn’t all smooth sailing to get here. Sunny has been in the web3 industry since 2017. Like all battle-hardened OGs, he’s lived through his fair share of ups and downs — crypto crashes, bear markets, and all-out implosions like Terra (LUNA) and FTX. I ask the most stressful situation he’s experienced so far, and he pauses:“I think I would have to say the Osmosis launch week. It was my first time launching a project and a company and a blockchain at once. There are a lot of last-mile things you don’t think about.”Osmosis had publicly announced its launch date and, unlike the plethora of software projects that kick their launch dates down the road like the proverbial can, Sunny was adamant about not moving his. But as more and more last-mile items kept piling up, the launch date hung over the team’s head like a dark and brooding cloud.“Osmosis went from idea to launch very quickly,” he says. “We went from development to launch in only three or four months and we procrastinated on a lot of important stuff until the last two weeks.”Would he have done anything differently with the benefit of hindsight?“I would have planned things further in advance. When you launch a project, there’s more than just the code. There’s a lot of operational stuff to consider and it takes longer than you think… I would have done all that a lot earlier.”Osmosis launched with a team of six and, despite the scrappy start, now has 45 full-time employees:“I like the size we’re at now,” he says. “We’re small enough that you still know everyone and can do full team offsite, but we’re big enough to pursue multiple unique product lines in parallel.”How does he handle the stress of being at the forefront of an ever-evolving industry? By throwing himself out of planes. Sunny’s a fan of aviation and is learning how to fly a plane, and taking a skydiving course.“I find it’s best to put yourself in a position where you can’t touch your phone, like flying a plane, or scuba diving,” (or hurtling toward the earth at 120 miles an hour). “Crypto markets aren’t volatile enough, I have to add more adrenaline,” he laughs.Travel, idols, and a ‘liveness-favoring’ mindSpending so much time in the air, Sunny also likes to travel, and if there’s one place closest to his heart, it’s Switzerland. He’s always been fascinated with the mountainous Alpine country and its rich history, culture, politics, and economy.He even taught a class about Switzerland while studying at Berkeley. He wouldn’t want to live there, though, as it’s “just a little bit too boring.” Sunny prefers the frenetic pace of a city like New York or “being at the front seat of technological innovation” in San Francisco’s Silicon Valley. He also loves Berlin, where his co-founder lives, and has many friends. “It’s like a second home.”Beyond continually improving Osmosis, helping other Cosmos ecosystem projects, and racking up his pilot miles, Sunny’s a keen reader. One of his biggest idols is Peter Thiel, whose writing and “way of thinking” greatly influenced Sunny’s worldview. Beyond Thiel’s Zero to One, he recommends the book Swarmwise by Rick Falkvinge, the founder of the Pirate Party political movement in Europe. The book speaks of how Falkvinge started a political party and turned it into a decentralized force through a concept called “swarms.”He elaborates:“In consensus protocols, you have this concept of safety-favoring and liveness-favoring protocols. In safety-favoring, you can never fork, you come to consensus on everything and then you make progress. Liveness-favoring protocols are constantly forking but they’re making fast progress, you don’t have to get the approval of the entire group to make a move… In the early stages of an organization where you’re focusing on growth, you need that liveness favoring so you don’t get bogged down in bureaucracy.”A ‘Bitcoin maxi’ of a different ilkAs a self-declared “Bitcoin maxi,” Sunny does not doubt the original crypto being the best money for the world; but the glacial pace of development doesn’t gel with his need for constant innovation. That’s why he worked on Cosmos infrastructure in the first place, “building the appchain layer for Bitcoin.” What’s he most excited about right now?“Definitely the Bitcoin renaissance. Ordinals changed everything, there’s been a cultural shift with all the Bitcoin L2s happening. I’m confident that we’ll have a good soft fork in the next year or two.”Wouldn’t that be a detriment to the sound-money qualities and adoption of Bitcoin as an asset? “It’s the limitations of Bitcoin that have caused the need for so many other money-like assets, but now Bitcoin can scale to more people and do more functionalities, like bring in DeFi, privacy, social… there’s a lot of stuff we can do on top of Bitcoin now.”What would Sunny be doing if he didn’t spend his time disrupting traditional finance? “Hardware.” Before working in crypto, Sunny studied robotics at school, and he’d like to return to his roots someday.“There are different ideas I’ve had. I spent a lot of time thinking about smart guns, having firearms that are safer, with security systems, like fingerprint scanners so people can’t steal them.” He pauses, “I’m really interested in anything that has an important political impact. That’s why I got into crypto in the first place.”If you want to catch up with Sunny, follow his personal Twitter or Osmosis account, or hop on over to his website for ideas and inspiration. You can also explore the forefront of DeFi trying out the Osmosis DEX.Mentioned in this article

Bitcoin price shows strength: Analysts predict rally to $73,000

Bitcoin has shown strength, trading at .$63,667.93, and analysts say that it could reach $73,000 in the upcoming weeks. The crypto, which corrected sharply, has recovered well, prompting the bulls back in. Investors and traders anticipate more price reboundTechnical analysis indicators show Bitcoin trend as bullishTechnical analysis has a favorable point for Bitcoin, highlighting indicators like Bollinger bands indicating a bullish moment. The crypto’s fluctuating behavior on the 4-hour sheet, may mark a probable inclining movement. To grasp the significance of Bitcoin reaching above the $61,999 50-day EMA, it must be understood that it has historically been a sign of bullish market continuation and fluctuations.Source: coin market capThis pattern has been followed by a ‘three white soldiers’ candlestick pattern, which is extra strong evidence to back up the bullish attitude, which could, in turn, lead to further price increments. The traders use these signals to boost their confidence in making further profits by betting on the higher side of Bitcoin in a short period of time.Resistance and support levelsTrend reversals in the present market environment are difficult to predict, and the importance of resistance and support in determining price movements is becoming increasingly evident. Bitcoin is experiencing first-tier obstacles at $66,796 and $69,328. In case of a successful rise above these values, it can have an escalation below, which may cause it to develop. Apart from that, at $71,180, resistance lies before  Bitcoin’s all-time high again or not. Bitcoin will only manage that if it rises above $67,500, as per analysts.The level of resistance could be reached up to $61,735 in case of Bitcoin’s trend, providing support, to prevent sharp declines. The following lines of resistance are designated by $59,550 and $56,625 which are the levels to help the price to regain its grounds if the trend goes down.The market experts closely follow Bitcoin’s price rallies and might see $73,000 as a new high point if certain resistance levels are broken. The recovery of Bitcoin after a short correction pushed the market of crypto assets back but generated excitement among traders.As the majority of analysts claim that Bitcoin must gradually break the $67,500 mark once again, such a breakthrough may lead the way to result in more aggressive thrusts. The technical analysts advise that it would be risky not to climb higher than this level, which could lead to retesting of the support levels that have been taken.

Bitcoin Network Sets Record with Over 1.6 Million Transactions in a Day



                    

On April 23, the Bitcoin network achieved a new record with the highest number of confirmed daily transactions, just three days after entering a new halving cycle that started on April 20. 



This surge brought the total to over 1.6 million unique transactions processed between various senders and receivers.




Data comparisons from sources such as Blockchain.com and Glassnode have linked the spike in transactions to the launch of Bitcoin Runes. 



This new offering serves as an alternative to the existing Bitcoin Ordinals and the BRC-20 protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain, capturing a significant portion of the daily transaction volume. 



Notably, Runes accounted for 81.3% of all Bitcoin transactions on the day of the record.




Despite this initial dominance by Runes, Bitcoin (BTC) transactions regained their majority status over the network by April 29, with BTC transactions making up 77.8% of the total, while Runes transactions had decreased to 18.8%. 



The remainder of the transaction volume was made up of ordinals at 1.2% and BRC-20 transactions at 2.3%.



The influx of Bitcoin Runes transactions has proven beneficial for the mining sector. Major U.S. mining firms such as Stronghold Digital Mining and Marathon have reported positive impacts from the Runes transactions, both financially and functionally, as communicated to Cointelegraph.

Since the halving, Rune transactions have contributed over 1,200 BTC in transaction fees to miners.



Although the excitement surrounding Bitcoin Runes seems to be waning, Ignas, a pseudonymous decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher, sees continued potential in this market. 



In a post dated April 17 on platform X, Ignas commented, “Runestone, RSIC, and PUPS are already pumping, promising holders shiny new Rune token airdrops. 



And FOMO threads keep coming. But, like the NFT frenzy post-JPEG reveal, the market could soon cool off.”



Runes and BRC-20 tokens represent new fungible token standards designed to expand Bitcoin’s utility within the emerging sector of Bitcoin DeFi, or BTCFi. 



This initiative marks a significant shift towards integrating more complex financial functions directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, illustrating a growing trend of innovation within the cryptocurrency landscape.

Shiba Inu Price Forecast: Analysts Eye $0.00017 Amid Crypto Market Volatility



                    

Recent downward trends in the cryptocurrency market have exerted downward pressure on the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB). 



Nonetheless, several analysts remain optimistic about the token’s future trajectory, foreseeing it potentially reaching $0.00017 in the coming years.




Oscar Ramos, a well-known advocate for Shiba Inu, projects that the asset could hit $0.00017 by 2025, aligning with the anticipated culmination of the ongoing crypto bull cycle. 



This optimistic outlook implies a substantial 640% increase for investors who buy SHIB at its current price of $0.00002296.



On the other hand, platforms like Changelly and Telegaon adopt a more cautious stance, proposing a six-year timeframe for SHIB to attain this valuation, suggesting $0.000059994 as a potentially more realistic peak during the current bull market.




The possibility of SHIB reaching $0.0001 or beyond has been a frequent topic of discussion among analysts, citing its past performance as a basis for optimism. 



Analyst Eunice Wong suggests that a similar surge could propel SHIB to $0.000125.



Furthermore, SHIB’s expanding roster of partnerships adds to the positive sentiment surrounding its future prospects.

Collaborations such as the recent venture with CDSA to utilize Shibarium for combating piracy, alongside another undisclosed partnership hinted at by lead developer Shytoshi Kusama, contribute to the bullish outlook for the asset.



However, the prevailing bearish sentiment in the market has led to a decline in Shiba Inu’s price in recent months. 



According to data from CoinMarketCap, SHIB is presently trading at $0.00002466, marking a notable decrease from its peak in early March.



Analysts hold differing views on when SHIB might achieve the $0.00017 price target. 



While some anticipate it occurring within the current bull cycle, others believe it could take longer. 



Various factors, including market dynamics, successful partnerships, and the overall cryptocurrency market’s resilience, are anticipated to influence Shiba Inu’s trajectory moving forward.



As always, it’s imperative to acknowledge the high volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets. 



Conducting thorough research and understanding one’s risk tolerance are essential prerequisites before making any investment decisions.

PEPE's fork PORK faces bloodbath: Here's what's going on - AMBCrypto



Metrics revealed that selling pressure on PORK increased. 
Most indicators hinted at a further price drop. 

Pepe’s [PEPE] forked token, PepeFork [PORK], gained much traction in the crypto community as its social metrics soared. While PORK’s popularity rose, its price action moved the other way around. 
Therefore, AMBCrypto planned to check PEPE and PORK’s current states to see how they are faring against each other. 
PORK’s latest bloodbath 
LunarCrush’s latest tweet highlighted an interesting development related to PORK, as its social metrics soared. 
A possible reason behind this increase in popularity could be the meme coin’s weekly rally of over 12%. 
Thanks to the price uptick, sentiment around the meme coin remained bullish, as evident from its high Weighted Sentiment.
Source: Santiment
However, the bull trend didn’t last long, as the meme coin witnessed a major price correction. According to CoinMarketCap, the meme coin was down by more than 10% in the last 24 hours alone. 
At press time, it was trading at $0.0000002431 with a market capitalization of over $102 million. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that PORK’s MVRV ratio dropped on the 5th of May, hinting that fewer investors were in profit. 
As the meme coin’s price turned bearish, investors chose to sell. This was the case as the meme coin’s active deposits increased. 
Additionally, its Supply on Exchanges increased, while its Supply outside of Exchanges dropped on the 5th of May. This meant that selling pressure was high at press time.
Source: Santiment
PEPE is in a better position
PEPE, on the other hand, acted differently. According to CoinMarketCap, its price only dropped 1.5% in the last 24 hours. 
At press time, it was trading at $0.000008569 with a market cap of $3.6 billion. Market sentiment around PEPE remained bullish as its Weighted Sentiment graph was up. 
Unlike PORK, PEPE remained under high buying pressure. The meme coin’s Supply on Exchanges dropped, while its Supply outside of Exchanges increased over the last week. 
In fact, AMBCrypto reported earlier about the possibility of PEPE touching $0.00001 in the coming days.
Source: Santiment
What to expect from PORK
Since PORK was in a concerning state, AMBCrypto planned to check its daily chart to better understand whether it could change the bearish trend. 
We found that its Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a sharp downtick. 

Realistic or not, here’s PORK’s market cap in DOGE’s terms

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar declining trend. These suggested that the chances of a continued price decline were high.
Nonetheless, the MACD remained in buyers’ favor as it displayed a bullish advantage in the market.

Crypto Trader Says Three Altcoins Are His Golden Tickets, Flips Bullish on One Memecoin With ‘Monster’ Chart - The Daily Hodl


								An analyst who continues to build a following with timely crypto calls says he has his radar locked on three altcoins.
Pseudonymous trader The Crypto Dog tells his 776,300 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on an Ethereum (ETH) challenger and a pair of memecoins as the digital asset market bounces.










“Seems NEAR, WIF and PEPE are my golden tickets right now.”
On Near (NEAR), the crypto analyst says that he unloaded some of his Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum holdings to accumulate the ETH rival.
“You might have seen me try NEAR long last month. Didn’t work out with the whole market pullback, but kept my hunch it would outperform when we bottom.
I moved a chunk of spot ETH and BTC into NEAR earlier to ride into new yearly highs. Longed as well but closed too early.”
At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $6.84.
Looking at Pepe (PEPE),  the trader says the memecoin looks strong on the three-day chart.
“One hell of a chart.”
Source: The Crypto Dog/X
At time of writing, PEPE is worth $0.0000086, up over 6% in the last 24 hours.
As for Floki (FLOKI), the trader says the memecoin looks very bullish on the higher time frame.
“Maybe I should look at FLOKI too, that chart is a monster zoomed out.”
Source: The Crypto Dog/X
At time of writing, Floki is worth $0.00019, up over 9% in the past day.

Bitcoin reaches one billion transactions

The Bitcoin network has processed its one billionth transaction — marking a huge milestone moment for the network 15 years after its creation.Clark Moody’s Bitcoin dashboard shows that transaction 1,000,000,000 had been reached, which was mined into block 842,241 at 9:34 pm UTC on May 5, other data shows.Total number of transactions processed on the Bitcoin network. Source: Clark MoodyIt comes 15 years, four months and four days after Bitcoin (BTC) pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the network’s first block on Jan. 3, 2009.It means an average of 178,475 daily transactions have been made on Bitcoin in its 5,603 day existence.


However, the transaction count doesn't include those made on the Lightning Network, a Bitcoin layer 2 network primarily focused on micropayments.Data from the Bitcoin-only exchange River found the Lightning Network processed a lower-bound estimate of 6.6 million transactions alone in August, 2023 — which could suggest that hundreds of millions of transactions have been made on Lightning since it launched in January, 2018.Daily transactions on Bitcoin spiked around the network’s fourth halving event on April 20, including a record high 926,000 transactions processed on April 23.Much of this demand came from the launch of the Runes protocol — a new Bitcoin token standard — at block 840,000.That said, Bitcoin’s daily transaction count has since cooled off to 660,260 on May 4.Despite Bitcoin being the oldest cryptocurrency network, it isn’t the first of its kind to process one billion transactions.Bitcoin's biggest rival, Ethereum, has processed well over 2 billion transactions since it launched in July 2015, Etherscan data shows.Related: Impact of Bitcoin halving event on transaction confirmation timesBitcoin is currently priced at $63,750, up over 12% since it hit a two-month low of $56,800 on May 2, according to CoinGecko.However, it is still down 13,6% from its all-time high of $73,740 set on March 13.Bitcoin’s change in price over the last 12 months.

BTC-e Founder Admits $9B Money Laundering Conspiracy Charge - DailyCoin


        
The BTC-e case has finally concluded. 



Co-founder Alexander Vinnik has pleaded guilty.



The DOJ accused Vinnik of laundering billions. 
US regulators have been relentless in their crackdown on crypto, targeting anyone that even smells of money laundering, including notable figures such as Tornado Cash co-founders, Binance’s former CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Friend (SBF), and more. Now joining this infamous list is BTC-e founder Alexander Vinnik, who, after a grueling five-year legal battle, has finally pleaded guilty to laundering billions. BTC-e Founder’s AdmissionOn Friday, May 3, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed that BTC-e’s co-founder Alexander Vinnik admitted to his role in money laundering through the exchange from 2011 to 2017, marking the climax of a years-long case.During Vinnik’s leadership, the DOJ detailed that BTC-e processed over $9 billion in transactions and amassed over one million users worldwide, mostly based in the US. Shockingly, the regulator revealed that over $4 billion worth of Bitcoin was laundered through the exchange.
Authorities highlighted that the platform was utilized to launder funds acquired from various criminal enterprises, including computer hacking, ransomware attacks, and drug trafficking. The investigation uncovered BTC-e’s flagrant disregard for legal compliance, notably lacking registration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and AML or KYC protocols. With its lax compliance measures, BTC-e swiftly became a haven for bad actors seeking to evade regulatory scrutiny. The DOJ revealed Vinnik’s establishment of numerous shell companies and financial accounts worldwide, facilitating the illicit transfer of funds through the exchange and resulting in criminal losses exceeding $121 million.Following Vinnik’s admission, a federal court judge will now determine the co-founder’s sentence. Drawing parallels to the cases of Binance’s Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao and FTX’s SBF, Vinnik could face a sentence ranging from four months to 25 years.On the Flipside
Vinnik, a Russian citizen, previously attempted to broker a prisoner swap deal as part of negotiations between Russia and the United States. 



BTC-e was heavily implicated in the infamous Mt.Gox Hack.



In 2023, Alexey Bilyuchenko, an associate of Vinnik and former technology administrator of BTC-e, was fined and sentenced to three years and six months in prison for embezzling the exchange’s funds.
Why This MattersVinnik’s admission marks the end of a five-year legal saga, bringing closure to all those impacted by BTC-e. It also serves as a crucial juncture in cleansing the industry of bad actors and a stark example of the consequences for those who try to curb the law.Is BitFinex under threat?BitFinex Under Threat?

                        A top South Korean prosecution official says courts must deliver swifter justice to crypto offenders – with cases currently taking “too long” to process.The comments came from Lee Jeong-ryeol, the head of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office’s joint crypto investigation unit, in an interview with the newspaper Hanguk Kyungjae.The unit is the nation’s only investigative organization dedicated to crypto-related crimes.Swifter Justice Will Help Fight Crypto Crime – Prosecutor
Lee claimed that “regulation rollouts” and the “punishment” of crypto-related crimes “have been slow.” He said:“We must restore trust in the virtual assets market, which has turned into a lawless zone. To do this, we must speed up not only the pace of investigations, but also trials and sentencing.”Lee insisted that while crypto-related crimes present courts with novel aspects, at their core, they are essentially no different from conventional financial fraud.He said that neither investigative agencies nor courts “should find it difficult to deal with virtual asset crimes using new IT.”Lee justified this by stating that the “essence of stealing property through lies does not change – regardless of the technology involved.” He said:“An integrated response across the government is urgently needed. This kind of approach will help address the problem of fast-evolving financial and high-tech crimes.”The prosecutor added:“We will only be able to help victims recover their funds if investigations can be conducted rapidly.”The main entry to the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office.

These include a high-profile art-themed altcoin case involving police and prosecution corruption.Lee also noted that his unit has been dealing with cases such as “illegal over-the-counter (OTC) trade networks” worth “around $478 million.”The Financial Services Commission (FSC) building in Seoul, South Korea.

The unit has also investigated allegations surrounding Haru Invest and the crypto lending platform Delio, after the latter suspended withdrawals in October 2023.Lee also spoke about the challenging nature of his unit’s work, with investigators often entering terra incognita with their probes. He said:“The cases the joint unit investigates are mostly first-of-their-kind cases with no existing legal precedent.”Lee also commented on a recent wave of reports centering on alleged South Korean “scam coins,” saying:“Scam coins are no different from general scams. At their heart, their operators are out to make money by deceiving people.”Last month, police arrested a man for allegedly stealing almost $362,000 worth of cash in an armed robbery on an OTC crypto buyer.

Solana, AI, Memes: Daniel Yan’s Picks for May Outperformance


Amid the turbulence that rocked cryptocurrency markets in April, Daniel Yan, the Chief Investment Officer of Kryptanium Capital, has a clear vision for May’s trading strategies. 
He focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), Solana, and meme coins as potential leaders for a rebound.
AI, Solana, Memes to Lead May Catchup Trade
A blend of macroeconomic triggers and market dynamics marked April’s crypto crash. The US’s persistent inflation and hot labor market led to a significant selloff in US treasuries, impacting cryptocurrencies that are sensitive to such macroeconomic factors. Additionally, the behavior of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which, contrary to expectations, acted more as a trading instrument than a stable investment, contributed to April’s downturn.
Altcoins suffered acutely due to poor liquidity and heavy unlocking schedules, leading to a dramatic drop not seen since the tumultuous events of 2022. 


“The medium performer of the top 100 tokens on CoinMarketCap in April saw a decline of 33%, compared with a milder 15.5% dip for Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Yan explained.

However, after a series of positive macroeconomic updates, Yan sees a silver lining. The introduction of the US Treasury Department’s first bond buyback program since 2002 and a dovish statement from the Federal Open Market Committee have helped stabilize the crypto market. These factors contributed to Bitcoin’s over 10% rebound in just a few days.
Looking into May, Yan predicts it to be a “very macro month for crypto.” He expects market stability until the mid-month Consumer Price Index report, likely influencing market direction. Specifically, Yan is bullish on categories like Solana, AI-driven coins, and meme tokens. 

“Solana category, AI category and Memes category are my top picks for the catchup trade – they should outperform Bitcoin in May. In general, I don’t think the theses for a very bullish 2024 is challenged at all. However, the April crash is a great lesson to all market players,” Yan asserted.

Despite April’s challenges, Yan remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of cryptos, viewing the recent crash as a crucial lesson for market participants.

1.24 Trillion PEPE Meme Coins Bought By Crypto Whale


A remarkable transaction has shaken the cryptocurrency market as a crypto whale reportedly invested $10.4 million into meme coin PEPE. 
This substantial investment, unfolding amid a surge in market activity, has triggered intense discussion about the future of this meme-inspired digital asset.
Crypto Whale Buys 1.24 Trillion PEPE Tokens
Spot On Chain, a well-regarded crypto analytics platform, spotlighted the transaction. Details emerged about a multi-signature wallet known as 0x1a2e64b8a1977bf018850b377020bc33eaaac3c9, which facilitated the movement of an astonishing 915.85 billion PEPE tokens from Binance. 
This initial transaction was valued at approximately $7.75 million, calculated at a rate of $0.000008466 per token.

In a swift succession over the next 28 hours, the same wallet executed additional withdrawals. It amassed a total of 1.238 trillion PEPE tokens from the centralized exchange. This sequence of transactions cumulatively amounted to the eye-catching $10.4 million PEPE investment.

“Overall, the wallet has withdrawn 1.238 trillion PEPE via 2 transactions from Binance at $0.000008424 on average ($10.4 million) in the past 28 hours for the first PEPE trade. Previously, the whale had gained $146,000 (+14.2%) from one INJ trade but lost $118,000 (-8.01%) from one RNDR trade. The whale did not hold both tokens for long,” analysts at Spot On Chain said.

Currently, PEPE exhibits promising market trends. Despite a slight 1.2% dip in the last 24 hours, the meme coin has soared by 29.70% over the last month. With PEPE trading at $0.000008532, its position above the 50-day Simple Moving Average and a healthy Relative Strength Index of 62.78 indicate a stable market sentiment, reinforcing investor confidence.

The influx of significant capital into PEPE highlights an expanding interest in niche cryptocurrencies. Indeed, these tend to benefit from robust community support and a meme-based allure. PEPE’s unique frog-themed branding has endeared it to a broad audience, contributing to its growing traction in digital currency.
Although the motives of the whale remain undisclosed, market analysts suggest that the investor might be capitalizing on the rising potential of meme coins to diversify their investment portfolio and harness nascent market opportunities.
