Market Expert Who Predicted Bitcoin’s Rise above $69,000 Unveils New Target


																The Bitcoin rise above $69,000 before the fourth halving to reach a new all-time high of $73,000 in 2024 took many by surprise. However, crypto analyst BitQuant was not one of those people. In 2023, the analyst had correctly predicted that the BTC price would reach a new all-time high before the halving was completed. After the successful completion of his prediction, the crypto analyst has once again predicted where the Bitcoin price is headed, and how high it will go.
Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $95,000
BitQuant has unveiled his latest prediction for the Bitcoin price, and the target being displayed will please many who continue to be bullish. Amid the choppy headwinds that have dominated the market, the analyst believes that the Bitcoin price will surge and reach $95,000.

Interestingly, the analyst does not expect the campaign to $95,000 to be a long, drawn-out move. Rather, BitQuant explains that the Bitcoin price can complete this target in a single move. Such a move would mean a 50% increase in price from its current level of around $62,000 and will no doubt trigger a ripple effect that will be evident in the market.
The post read:

$95K will be achieved in just one move, and that is quite obvious. Will that move start today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow? I don’t think anyone knows. If you can’t relax now and wait for #Bitcoin to perform as expected, then it’s better to leave the market to avoid the torture. Because in the coming months, there will be a lot of pain for those with weak nerves.

BitQuant’s prediction was in response to another crypto analyst, Mikybull, who identified the formation of a ‘cup and handle’ pattern on the Bitcoin crash. The analyst believes that this formation will precede a massive breakout that will send it to a “cycle top.”

Is $250,000 Still In Play?
Back in 2023, when BitQuant made the initial prediction that Bitcoin would reach a new all-time high before the halving, he had set out a price target for the cryptocurrency. As the crypto analyst explained at the time, reaching a new all-time high before the halving, although it has never happened before, does not mean that it will peak by then.

Rather, the analyst expects the bull rally to continue well after the halving, which is when the price will peak. BitQuant’s target at the time was the price peaking at $250,000 at the top of the cycle. However, this target has not made an appearance in his analyses in recent times.
The most recent predictions circle around the $95,000 target and the analyst expects it to hit this price in May. In a prediction from April, BitQuant expects that the price will first go to $49,000, before recovering to $75,000, and then surge to $95,000.

In a startling development in Hong Kong's crypto sector, a scam involving "hell banknotes" has led to the arrest of three employees from a crypto exchange shop located in Tsim Sha Tsui.


								In a startling development in Hong Kong’s crypto sector, a scam involving “hell banknotes” has led to the arrest of three employees from a crypto exchange shop in Tsim Sha Tsui.
The suspects allegedly deceived a customer into transferring HK$1 million (approximately $127,500) worth of Tether (USDT) in exchange for counterfeit currency traditionally used in Chinese rituals. This incident marks a concerning trend in misusing digital currencies for fraudulent schemes.

Crypto Scam: The Arrest And Police Investigation
The scam was exposed when a 35-year-old man reported to the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) that he could not receive any real currency after attempting to convert his cryptocurrency at the shop.
He was shown stacks of what appeared to be cash but were actually ‘hell banknotes’—paper money intended as offerings to the deceased, not legal tender. The revelation of this deception prompted immediate police action.
The HKPF’s technology crime division moved quickly to detain the three men, aged 31 to 34, involved in the scam operation.
During the probe, police confiscated 3,000 hell banknotes, a safe, and a note-counting machine, indicating the deliberate nature of the scam. The suspects had convinced the victim to transfer his USDT to their wallet, only to provide worthless paper in return and then flee the scene.
Notably, this fraudulent act could lead to severe legal consequences for the perpetrators. Hong Kong law stipulates up to 14 years in prison for fraud. The suspects are also potentially liable for acquiring property by deception, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years.
Preventive Measures And Broader Implications
In response to this and similar incidents, the HKPF has issued an advisory urging the public to use only ‘licensed and authorized cryptocurrency exchanges.”
According to the report, they emphasized the importance of “inspecting banknotes” and being “vigilant about the authenticity” of currency received in transactions.
Furthermore, this incident is part of the region’s larger pattern of crypto-related scams. Last month, Hong Kong customs officials arrested three individuals linked to a HK$1.8 billion ($228 million) money-laundering operation using a crypto platform and bank accounts associated with shell companies.
These operations highlight criminals’ sophisticated methods to exploit the digital finance ecosystem.
Florence Yeung Yee-tak, commander of the Financial Investigation Division of the Customs Department, noted the difficulties in investigating these crimes due to cryptocurrencies’ inherent “anonymity” and the lack of “jurisdictional boundaries.”

According to Yeung Tak, the department relies heavily on intelligence, capital flow analysis, and comprehensive financial investigations to combat these kinds of illegal crypto activities.

What Does It Mean for Companies to Buy Billions of Dollars of Bitcoin Recently? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Matt Hougan, CIO of spot Bitcoin ETF issuer Bitwise, says the Bitcoin ETF allocations included in recent 13F filings are just the beginning. Institutional investors' recently disclosed Bitcoin allocations from first-quarter 13F filings were merely a “down payment,” according to the CIO.
Hougan explains that it takes most professional investors between six and twelve months to evaluate cryptocurrency investments. This process typically follows a pattern of due diligence, personal allocation, individual customer allocations and finally platform-wide allocation.


“About six months after the initial distribution, many firms begin to distribute across their entire client books, with allocations ranging from 1-5% of the portfolio,” Hougan wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
Highlighting the potential of Bitcoin ETFs, Bitwise CIO said, “The great promise of Bitcoin ETFs is that they can open the door for professional investors to purchase BTC en masse, significantly increasing the pool of capital invested in the asset.”





13F filings are quarterly reports filed with the SEC by institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in stock assets under management. These filings provide a snapshot of a manager's stock holdings at the end of each quarter.

Hougan highlighted several firms with significant Bitcoin ETF holdings. The firm Hightower Advisors, the second largest registered investment advisor, owns $68 million worth of spot bitcoin ETFs. Other notable firms include Cambridge Investment Research, Sequoia Financial Advisors, Integrated Advisors and Brown Advisory, with shares worth $40 million, $12 million, $11 million and $4 million, respectively.


A total of 563 professional investment firms reported holding $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin ETFs as of last Thursday. Hougan predicts we could see over 700 professional firms reporting total assets under management approaching $5 billion by the May 15 (today) filing deadline. The ownership scale for the new ETFs is “unorthodox,” according to Hougan.
While individual investors still dominate the ETF market, professional investors account for only 7-10% of ETFs' $50 billion in assets under management so far. However, Hougan argues that this rate will increase significantly given the adoption pattern by institutional investors.





For example, Hightower Advisors' current spot Bitcoin ETF holding amounts to just 0.05% of its assets, according to the CIO. If they follow the typical behavioral pattern Hougan outlines, a 1% allocation over time will equal $1.2 billion from a single firm.

Dogecoin Enthusiasts Switch to New VR ICO, Targeting 10x Returns / Source: Cryptonews
                        As Dogecoin (DOGE) attempts to push to the north of a key downtrend, its enthusiasts are switching their focus to an exciting new VR ICP called 5thScape (5SCAPE) as they target 10x returns.Dogecoin jumped over 7% on Wednesday to the uppers $0.15s amid a broad post-CPI crypto and traditional financial market rally.At current price levels around $0.157, Dogecoin is no course to close above a key downtrend from the April yearly.That could open the door to a move back above $0.20, assuming Dogecoin can break above $0.17 resistance.Dogecoin (DOGE) might be about to vault higher if it can break above these key resistance levels, but investors should check out this exciting new VR ICO nonetheless. Source: TradingViewWhile Dogecoin’s near-term price prospects are strong, enthusiasts might worry that its upside prospects are limited.Dogecoin’s market cap was last around $21.5 billion. Perhaps Dogecoin could post 2x or 3x gains from current levels.But many investors are looking for higher upside potential, such as for 10x growth.An often-overlooked investment strategy that frequently yields 10x growth is presale investing.Upcoming Web3 start-ups often raise funds via the sale of their native tokens at a discount.If investors can identify web3 start-ups that will go on to become market leaders, they can make big bucks.And one AR/VR web3 start-up conducting an ICO called 5thScape is looking very promising.Why New VR ICO 5thScape (5SCAPE) Could Be 2024’s Best Presale
5thScape is a first-of-its-kind crypto-infused VR/AR ecosystem that will be powered by the versatile 5SCAPE token.Huge demand for 5SCAPE in the project’s presale suggests investors are betting heavily that 5thScape will be a market leader.The new VR ICO has already raised close to a whopping $6 million.At the current price of $0.00327, investors are buying into this exciting project at a market cap of under $20 million.They will also be sat on paper gains of over 200% when the token launches at a planned $0.1.If 5thScape starts to gain traction as a market leader, it could easily become a $200+ million market cap coin.That could mean gains of over 10x for presale investors.$5SCAPE token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, BNB, or card.80% of the total 5.1 billion token supply is available for purchase in the presale.Buy 5SCAPE Here

Price analysis 5/15: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, TON, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, SHIB

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the Nasdaq Composite soared to a new lifetime high after the United States Consumer inflation report came in less than expected. That ignited a rally in Bitcoin (BTC), pushing the price above $66,000. The farther Bitcoin moves from $60,000, the less likely a breakdown is. However, that does not guarantee the start of a new uptrend. Galaxy Digital founder and CEO Mike Novogratz said during the firm’s first quarter earnings call that Bitcoin was likely to consolidate between $55,000 and $75,000 before moving higher at the end of the current quarter.The failure of the bears to sink Bitcoin below $60,000 seems to have attracted buyers. CoinShares’ “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly” report showed inflows of $130 million into digital asset investment products this past week, the first such occurrence in five weeks.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed investments in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds worth roughly $164 million. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a X post that more such investments by institutions could be expected as they “tend to move in herds.”Could Bitcoin and select altcoins overcome the near-term resistance and move higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin surged above the 20-day exponential moving average ($62,765) on May 15, indicating that the bulls have absorbed the supply.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf buyers maintain the momentum and propel the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($65,152), it will open the gates for a possible rally to the formidable resistance at $73,777. The bears may defend this level with all their might.If bears want to prevent the upside move, they will have to defend the 50-day SMA and tug the price to the $59,600 support. The bulls are likely to defend this level aggressively, because if the support cracks, the BTC/USDT pair may plunge to 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298.Ether price analysisEther’s (ETH) strong bounce off the $2,850 support on May 15 suggests that the bulls are fiercely defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf buyers shove the price above the 20-day EMA ($3,026), the ETH/USDT pair could rise to the resistance line of the descending channel. The bears are likely to mount a vigorous defense at the resistance line, but if the bulls prevail, the pair may start a rally to $3,400.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will signal that bears are selling on every minor rally. The pair could then retest the strong support at $2,850. A break below this support could start a downward move toward the support line of the descending channel.BNB price analysisBNB (BNB) fell below the moving averages on May 14 but rebounded sharply off the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern. This suggests aggressive buying at lower levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewBuyers will try to gain control by kicking the price above the resistance line of the triangle. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could surge to $634 and then to $692. The pattern target of the setup is $726.Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the triangle, it will suggest that bears have gained control in the near term. The pair could dive toward $495 and subsequently to the pattern target of $434.Solana price analysisSolana (SOL) broke above the 20-day EMA ($146) on May 15, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the price maintains above $145, the SOL/USDT pair could rally to $162. In a range, traders generally sell close to the resistance, and they are likely to do that again near $162. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will signal that the pair may remain range-bound for a while.A break above $162 or below $126 could start the next trending move. If the $162 level is taken out, the pair may climb to $205. On the other hand, a break below $126 could sink the pair to $100.XRP price analysisThe bulls tried to push XRP (XRP) above the 20-day EMA ($0.51) on May 14, but the bears held their ground.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bulls are again attempting to drive the price above the 20-day EMA on May 15. If they can pull it off, the XRP/USDT pair may rally to the overhead resistance at $0.57. This level could prove to be a difficult barrier to cross.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price to the critical support at $0.46. Buyers are expected to defend this level aggressively. A strong rebound off $0.46 will signal that the range-bound action may continue for some more time.Toncoin price analysisBuyers tried to push Toncoin (TON) above the $7.67 resistance on May 13, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels.TON/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewA minor advantage in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. This suggests that the bulls may take one more shot at the overhead resistance. If buyers propel and maintain the price above $7.67, it will signal the resumption of the uptrend. The TON/USDT pair could rally to $9.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down from the current level and plummets below the moving averages.Dogecoin price analysisThe bulls are trying to prevent Dogecoin (DOGE) from slipping below the neckline and completing a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA ($0.15) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a range-bound action in the near term. If the price rises above the 20-day EMA, the DOGE/USDT pair could reach the 50-day SMA ($0.17). This is an essentialt level for the bears to defend because a break above it could clear the path for a rally to $0.21.The bears will seize control if they sink and sustain the price below the neckline of the H&S pattern. That could start a drop to $0.08.Related: Why is Bitcoin price up today?Cardano price analysisThe failure of the bears to maintain Cardano (ADA) below the support line on May 15 attracted solid buying by the bulls.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that the bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and sustains below the support line, it will signal the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The ADA/USDT pair could descend to $0.35.Instead, if the price continues higher and jumps above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears are losing their grip. The pair may climb to the 50-day SMA ($0.51) and later to $0.57.Avalanche price analysisAvalanche (AVAX) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($35) for the past few days, but the bears have failed to pull the price to the support of the range at $29. This suggests that selling dries up at lower levels.AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bulls will try to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, it will suggest that the AVAX/USDT pair could remain range-bound between $40 and $29 for a few more days. A break above $40 could start a rally to $50.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the bears are trying to take charge. The pair may then slump to the strong support at $29. If this level breaks down, it will indicate the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The pair may then decline to the next support at $25.Shiba Inu price analysisThe bulls successfully guarded the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern in Shiba Inu (SHIB) on May 13.SHIB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe flattening 20-day EMA ($0.000023) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty, hence it is better to wait for the price to rise above or fall below the triangle before placing large bets.If the price breaks above the triangle, it will suggest that the corrective phase may be over. The SHIB/USDT pair could rise to $0.000030 and then to $0.000033. On the contrary, a break below the triangle could open the doors for a fall to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000017.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

El Salvador has launched tokenized investment offerings on the Liquid network, enabling individuals to invest in projects like a new hotel at El Salvador International Airport.
                        El Salvador took a decisive step into tokenization on Tuesday, unveiling national investment opportunities based on Bitcoin infrastructure.El Salvador Bitcoin: Investing in Development
The nation’s National Bitcoin Office launched its blockchain-based capital raise on the Liquid network.Liquid is a Bitcoin sidechain managed by Blockstream and a federation of 65 Bitcoin-centric companies globally. Utilizing BTC as its native asset, the blockchain facilitates faster, cheaper, and more private transactions than the main Bitcoin blockchain.Beyond BTC, Liquid allows for the issuance of tokens representing diverse assets, including stablecoins like Tether (USDT), meme coins, and real-world assets and securities.One of El Salvador’s token offerings involves investing in constructing the first hotel at El Salvador International Airport. The investment would yield 10% annually over a five-year term, requiring a minimum investment of $1000.“The infrastructure will include 80 rooms, five commercial spaces each measuring 99 square meters, a swimming pool, and various amenities such as restaurants, a gym, gardens, multipurpose rooms, among others,” the offering states on the Inverlag Hotels website.Tokenized Offerings on the Liquid Network
Investors would also secure free nights at the hotel they are helping build. Anyone who invests $1 million gets an all-year-round free stay throughout the bond’s five-year lifespan.“These opportunities are typically unavailable to the general public,” explained Roberto Laguardia, CEO of Inverlag, in an interview. “They are usually reserved for large-scale or institutional investors and private equity firms… However, with a minimum investment of $1000, individuals can access a 10% interest rate, paid bi-annually, over a five-year period.”The tokenized issuance was conducted by El Salvador Bitcoin startup DitoBanx, while the exchange platform used to issue the tokens is Bitfinex. Due to regulations, the investment is not available to U.S. investors.Advantages of Tokenized Investments
El Salvador is the first and only country in the world to treat El Salvador Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The state regularly invests in BTC and runs a Bitcoin mining operation powered by geothermal energy from the region’s local volcanoes.El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin extends beyond its legal tender status, as these new tokenized investment offerings demonstrate. The Bitcoin Office said this week that the nation has mined 474 BTC since 2021 and now holds 5,750 BTC ($378 million) in total.

KuCoin Latest To Pull Naira P2P in Nigerian War on Exchanges - DailyCoin


        

KuCoin has joined Binance and OKX to pull p2p support in Nigeria.



The KuCoin decision comes as authorities have embarked on a crypto exchange crackdown.



The country’s central bank has also moved to restrict crypto transactions.




“Which exchange is next?”



That’s the question Nigerian crypto market participants have been asking in recent weeks as the government has cast its eye on crypto p2p trading to catch the falling dagger, which is the country’s local currency. According to authorities, bad actors have thwarted monetary policy efforts to stabilize the naira by manipulating its value through alleged pump-and-dump schemes on these crypto p2p platforms.




This belief led to a crackdown on crypto exchanges, which forced Binance and OKX to withdraw support for the naira on their p2p platform. With the Nigerian SEC announcing plans to follow up the recent crackdown with an official crypto p2p ban, KuCoin has followed suit.



A “Temporary Pause?”



On Wednesday, May 15, many Nigerian KuCoin users were met with a shocking realization: they could no longer find the naira on the exchange’s p2p platform.



In an announcement on the same day, KuCoin confirmed it had pulled naira support on its p2p platform, describing the move as a “temporary pause” to ensure compliance.



Without going into details, the firm asserted that it was committed to resolving the situation quickly so it could resume naira p2p services.



A screengrab of KuCoin’s message to Nigerians



The KuCoin decision is the latest salvo in a sequence of events that have marked the rollback of progress made in December 2023, when the country’s central bank removed a two-year embargo on banks that prevented them from facilitating crypto transactions.



Walls Close in on Nigerian Crypto Traders



In the past two weeks, the country’s central bank has instructed financial institutions to freeze and report transactions involving cryptocurrencies.



At the same time, in the past three weeks, Nigeria’s anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, has obtained permission to freeze over 1,000 accounts belonging to crypto traders pending investigations that could lead to prosecutions for money laundering and terrorism financing.



On the Flipside 




In a recent blog post, Binance CEO Richard Teng asserted that efforts to seek practical guidance from the Nigerian SEC on licensing procedures in the past year had been met with no response.



Despite the ongoing crypto crackdown, the naira has depreciated in recent weeks, trading around 1,520 naira per dollar.




Why This Matters



KuCoin’s move to cease naira support on its p2p platform is the latest sign of escalation in Nigeria’s crypto crackdown. With the looming ban, crypto p2p transactions will likely move to encrypted messaging platforms where users will likely face greater risk of scams and exploitative rates.

The company noted that its strong revenue growth was driven by the commencement of its Bit Digital AI business, as well as by higher realized Bitcoin prices.The company reported quarterly earnings of 43 cents per share, which beat analyst estimates of 1 cent per share. Bitcoin mining revenue was up 166% on a year-over-year basis. Bit Digital’s AI business began generating revenue in January, and recognized $8.1 million of revenue during the quarter. The company said it mined 410.7 Bitcoin during the quarter, up 13% year-over-year.

Bitcoin rallies to $66,000 as inflation pressure eases - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to $66,400 on Wednesday after the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed signs of easing inflation pressures, according to data from CoinGecko.The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a decrease in the CPI to 3.4% year-over-year in April, down from 3.5% in March. Similarly, the core CPI, which omits food and energy prices, fell to 3.6% from the previous 3.8%. Both CPI figures matched market forecasts, with monthly increases of 0.3%.The reading provided some relief after earlier CPI reports suggested more persistent inflation, which dampened expectations for an early Federal Reserve interest rate cut.With inflation seemingly reversing course, investors are now pricing in a 75% probability of a rate cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.Bitcoin surged past $63,000 briefly after inflation data was released. The flagship crypto has extended its rally over the past hours. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $65,900, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko’s data.The overall crypto market cap also experienced growth, rising almost 6% to approximately $2.5 trillion. Major altcoins followed suit, with Ethereum (ETH) crossing the $3,000 threshold, up 4%, and Solana (SOL) breaking the $150 level with an 8% gain.Bitcoin may have hit the bottomBitcoin (BTC) may have exited the post-halving “danger zone” – the three-week period following the Bitcoin halving event, said technical analyst Rekt Capital in his recent post. He suggests that Bitcoin has transitioned to the accumulation phase.If historical patterns hold, the next bull market peak could occur between mid-September and mid-October 2025, he noted.“Currently, Bitcoin is accelerating in this cycle by approximately 200 days now,” the analyst stated. “So the longer Bitcoin consolidates after the Halving, the better it will be for resynchronising this current cycle with the traditional Halving cycle.”

Ethereum Layer-2 Network Blast Reveals Airdrop Details - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBlast, a rising Ethereum layer-2 scaling network from the founder of NFT marketplace Blur, has finally announced a launch date for its upcoming BLAST token airdrop: June 26. That’s later than expected.“We know this is past our initial estimate of May and we’re sorry for the delay,” the official network account wrote on Twitter. “The airdrop allocation will be increased to account for this.”According to Blast, the network will hold two more distributions of Blast Gold points before the token launch. Blast Gold works like airdrop points but for creators of decentralized apps (dapps) building on the network. Many dapps have then distributed their awarded gold to users—including Fantasy Top, the viral NFT game based around Crypto Twitter influencers.Half of the token airdrop will be allotted to developers through Blast Gold. The other half will be distributed to early users, including those who bridged funds to the network before the Blast mainnet went live at the end of February. Users had bridged over $2.3 billion worth of crypto in the hopes of earning points toward the upcoming airdrop.And there's a good reason they’re interested, beyond the typical crypto trader search for yield: Blast is aggressively built around user incentives, much like Blur before it, and that has worked out well for both Blur and its users. The NFT marketplace handed out some $818 million worth of tokens to traders in 2023, catapulting Blur above the competition and making it the second most valuable airdrop of last year.Blast has seen rising momentum around some of its early apps, games, and tokens, including the aforementioned Fantasy Top, which has dominated the Crypto Twitter conversation in recent weeks while driving an increase in NFT trading volume.

It’s time to overturn SAB 121 - Blockworks


Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission has made a name for itself with its hostility towards cryptocurrency. Time after time, over the last few years, his agency has repeatedly thrown up roadblocks to the common-sense regulation of digital assets and overstepped its regulatory authority.
One of the SEC’s most detrimental actions on digital assets came in the form of a seemingly innocuous memo known as Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (or SAB 121). SAB 121 is significant because it requires publicly traded banks to place digital assets on their balance sheet. This change contradicts a basic rule of bank custody: that bank custodial assets are always held off-balance sheet. 
As a result, banks are staying on the sidelines. These highly regulated institutions have successfully offered custodial services to the traditional financial system for decades. They are the experts in their field, and keeping them out of this market is making Americans less safe.
The recent approval of the bitcoin ETPs revealed a problem: The bitcoin within these ETPs is not held by banks, and most have the same custodian. 
If Chair Gensler wishes to protect retail investors, he should take this problem seriously. Whether you love crypto or hate crypto, digital assets are here to stay. We need to ensure American investors receive the same protections they would with any other asset class.
The content of the Bulletin is a problem, but the process is arguably even worse. First, Gensler’s SEC issued this bulletin without conferring with the banking regulators — an obvious misstep. Then, they attempted to circumvent the customary regulatory process by issuing a bulletin rather than a rule. Their process foul was so egregious that even the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office threw a flag on it, declaring that SAB 121 is effectively a rule for the purposes of the Congressional Review Act.
Last week, the US House of Representatives had the chance to change the course of federal policy and restore the role of Congress in the administrative rulemaking process. With the support of 207 Republicans and 21 Democrats, the House advanced our bipartisan resolution, H.J. Res. 109, which repeals SAB 121 under the CRA.
Now, the Senate is slated to take up H.J. Res. 109. We’re hopeful that this bipartisan, bicameral resolution will send a message — It’s time to adjust the SEC’s misguided approach to digital assets. 
We need a repeal of SAB 121 for the future of our digital economy, the safe custody of cryptocurrencies and the good of the American investor.

How High Can The XRP Price Go? Crypto Analyst Unveils 6-Month Prediction


																Crypto analysts continue to be super bullish on the future of the XRP price despite its poor performance in the past. However, while some analysts have predicted price targets that, to many, seem unrealistic, others have set more conservative targets. This is the case of crypto analyst Alan Santana, who just unveiled his 6-month prediction for the XRP price.
XRP Price Is Ready For A Bullish Wave
Alan Santana took to the TradingView website to share his latest analysis on the XRP price. This prediction is expected to play out over the next six months as the crypto market heads into what is expected to be an explosive bull rally.

	Related Reading



The crypto analyst believes that in this cycle, the altcoin may find its price moving well ahead of other altcoins. “it is likely to be one of the first to move… One of the first to move big!” the analyst said. Santana also gives reasons for this, one of them being that the waiting period between each bullish wave for the XRP price has elapsed.
His analysis showed that the altcoin has usually seen a 6-8-month gap between each bullish wave. However, it had been 308 days since it saw its last bullish wave, which is well over 10 months. This means that the altcoin is more than ready for another bullish wave. He also added, “The fact that XRPUSDT went through a correction and has been consolidating for this long is considered bullish.”

Furthermore, the altcoin has been on a bullish trend, recording higher lows. This is usually bullish for any asset as it suggests better support for the price as it moves upward. “Higher lows means that the bulls have the upper hand when it comes to the long-term trajectory of this chart,” Santana explained.
XRP Can Move 280% In 2024-2025
The crypto analyst expects a rather rapid bullish wave for the XRP price and stated that he expects this to happen sometime in 2024 and 2025. The main reason behind this is that the accumulation phase for the altcoin is finally coming to an end.
This is a sentiment that has also been shared by another crypto analyst known as U-Copy. According to the analyst, the XRP price had been in accumulation for the last seven years, but it has finally come to an end in 2024, and this end in the accumulation phase will lead to a rally.

	Related Reading



While U-Copy expects the altcoin to hit a new all-time high price as this accumulation phase comes to an end, which would be an at least 600% move from here, Santana has taken a more conservative stance. The analyst does expect the XRP price to break above $1, but puts the peak around $1.9 and $2. This would mean a 280-300% move from here.
“Once it starts going, it will go really strong and for a very long while… People will be wondering, ‘why didn’t I buy when prices were low?’,” the analyst concluded.

How Did This Crypto Investor Turn $3,000 To $46.3 Million With PEPE? | Bitcoinist.com


								Tales of crypto investors turning a few dollars into millions are not new, but one particular PEPE investor has taken this a step further. This crypto trader was able to turn a $3,000 investment into $46.3 million in the space of a year. Here’s how they did it.
$3,000 In PEPE Turns Into $46.3 Million
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the on-chain data tracking platform Lookonchain revealed exactly how this crypto trader turned the $3,000 investment into tens of millions of dollars. According to the tracker, the trader had bought $3,000 worth of PEPE tokens on April 15, 2023, which is when the coin launched. The trader received a total of 4.9 trillion tokens in return.

The same year, PEPE would go on a legendary rally, going from under a $1 million market cap to over $1 billion after securing listings from major crypto exchanges such as Binance. At this time, the investor’s stash had risen to more than $10 million. However, the crypto trader would continue to hold their stash and only sell a small portion of it.
Fast forward to May 2024 and the PEPE price has hit multiple new all-time highs. The latest happened this week when the meme coin’s price rose above $0.00001 to cross a $4.5 billion market cap. This move catapulted the trader’s holdings to over $40 million.
Following the price reaching a new all-time high, the crypto trader has begun to take some profit. As Lookonchain’s post shows, the investor recently sold 255 billion tokens for a total of $2.3 million. So far, the trader has sold around 1.4 trillion tokens, leaving them with a balance of 3.5 trillion tokens, which is currently worth a whopping $38.9 million.
In total, this investor has seen a 15,718x return or a 157,718% ROI. Their total realized and unrealized profit from this single trade now sits at $46.3 million at the time of writing.

Is This Crypto Investor An Insider?
Given the timing of the crypto investor’s buys into PEPE when it just launched, it has raised questions of whether this particular investor is an ‘insider’. In other words, some have wondered if this is one of the team members behind the meme coin.

However, others have focused on the sheer grit that it has taken the investor to hold their tokens to this point. One X (formerly Twitter) user points out the fact that the reason the investor was able to make such returns was the fact that they were able to hold, and did not sell early.


For now, the investor seems to be holding the majority of their coins to wait for better prices. Given that the bull market is expected to continue to unfold this year, it is possible that the PEPE price will continue to rally and reach new all-time highs, which would mean higher gains for this smart investor.

Bitcoin Price to Explode to $95,000 ‘In Just One Move,’ Says Top Analyst Who Predicted Recent All-Time High | Cryptoglobe


                                
A popular cryptocurrency trader known for accurately predicting Bitcoin’s recent rise to a new all-time high ahead of its halving event has recently  revealed he believes the price of BTC will surge to the $95,000 level “in just one move.”



The analyst, responding to another popular cryptocurrency trader on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), added that the timing of the move is uncertain, but noted that those who can’t “relax now and wait for Bitcoin to perform as expected” could be better of leaving the market “to avoid the torture.”



Per his words, in the coming months “there will be a lot of pain for those with weak nerves.”







These words came in response to trader Milkybulll Crypto, who shared a chart with their over 60,000 followers on the platform pointing to a cup and handle reversal pattern on Bitcoin’s weekly chart, before adding that the “breakout will be explosive and will send it to a cycle top.”



A cup and handle price pattern on an asset’s chart is a technical indicator where a cup is formed in the shape of the letter “u,” with the handle then coming with the price seeing a slight downward movement. The pattern was first defined by American technician William J. O’Neil, according to Investopedia, which notes the pattern is interpreted as a bullish signal.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The price prediction comes at a time in which another popular cryptocurrency analyst, Rekt Capital, said that the price of Bitcoin after the halving is officially out of the “danger zone,” and the cryptocurrency’s price celebrated with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.”



Rekt Capital noted that this month and the next may be “unremarkable for Bitcoin,” but added that we’re “running out of unremarkable months” before BTC enters the parabolic phase.



Notably institutional investors are slowly moving in, with the U.S. state of Wisconsin recently becoming the first government entity in the country to disclose an investment in the flagship cryptocurrency, having purchased 94,562 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), worth nearly $100 million, in the first quarter of the year.



The move sees the state of Wisconsin join several Wall Street giants, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, in revealing BTC exposure through investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to 13F filings.



JPMorgan revealed an investment of $731,246 in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC, while Wells Fargo disclosed $141,817 in GBTC holdings. BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon have also made similar disclosures.

                        Paul Ryan – the 54th speaker of the United States House of Representatives – has emerged as a major proponent of stablecoins, with a bright outlook on what regulation could bring to the industry.Paul Ryan Bullish On Stablecoins
In an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, Ryan highlighted stablecoins as a potential solution to the looming US sovereign debt crisis. Public data shows that the nation is currently $34.7 trillion in debt, and is making annual interest payments of over $1 trillion.“I think stablecoin legislation would be a step in the right direction,” he said. “That could be done this year, but I don’t see anything other than that on the horizon.”Stablecoins are crypto tokens that are pegged to relatively value-stable assets – mainly the U.S. dollar. Crypto traders often use them for trading, borrowing, and lending in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, while others use them to access the stability of the dollar in countries where dollars are otherwise unobtainable.Stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle mainly back their tokens with short-term US Treasury bills and other dollar equivalent instruments, while profiting on the interest they provide. As such, rising demand for stablecoins directly translates to demand for US government debt, which is imperative when the government needs lenders.At present, the stablecoin market is over $140 billion in size, but remains unregulated. According to Ryan, a bipartisan agreement on stablecoins making its way through the legislative process could help remedy that, currently being negotiated between Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters of the House Financial Services Committee.“I think there’s a reasonable chance they could get a deal on stablecoin legislation,” Ryan said. “That means you have a legal framework in which you can have stablecoins deployed… you’d go from a couple hundred billion dollars of stablecoins to maybe trillions.”Another Republican Supporting Crypto
The former speaker said that stablecoins adoption could integrate the dollar into the ongoing digitization of currencies, and entrench dollar adoption overall.“That’s one thing you can try and do on the margins to improve demand for bonds and improve dollar adoption,” he concluded.Ryan’s comments echo a common pro-crypto sentiment among Republicans, who have taken up the mantle of supporting the industry in place of their less-than-favorable Democrat counterparts.Former president Donald Trump, who once blasted Bitcoin as a scam, has recently flipped positions with a promise to keep crypto in America.

Pepe Whales Buy Up Nearly 1 Trillion PEPE As 100% Of Holders in Profit ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
PEPE has emerged as a standout performer in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, with its price surging over 100% in just a month.



Behind this meteoric rise lies a fascinating trend: whales, or large investors, have accumulated a staggering 720 billion Pepe tokens. This accumulation frenzy has coincided with a remarkable statistic—100% of Pepe holders are currently in profit.



Lookonchain, an on-chain platform, recently reported a whale purchasing 520 billion Pepe Coins on May 15. This purchase is seen as a speculative move, suggesting a potential upward trend in the price of PEPE. The whale subsequently withdrew PEPE tokens worth $5.28 million from the Binance cryptocurrency exchange.







Unlike typical traders, this whale is known for holding onto investments for extended periods rather than actively trading. The whale has acquired a total of 10 tokens but has never sold any. Despite the size of the investments, the whale has incurred a net loss of $6.1 million. Only 5 of the 10 tokens are profitable, resulting in a win rate of 50%, as per Lookonchain’s analysis.



Furthermore, a wallet address linked to BlockTower Capital acquired 202 billion tokens valued at $2.2 million through the crypto trading firm Cumberland. Simultaneously, BlockTower Capital’s primary hedge fund has suffered a security breach and partial loss due to fraudulent activities.

These large investors have amassed 720 billion Pepe Coin tokens, indicating a strong bullish sentiment toward the digital asset.



Pepe Profit-Taking and Price Correction



Investors showed significant interest in Pepe Coin, driving its price to a new peak. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that all PEPE traders are currently profitable, suggesting a potential sell-off by large holders.



Despite the positive sentiment and price rally, some whales have begun to book profits, leading to a slight correction in PEPE’s price. The token has fallen by 2.93% in the past 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.00001037. This profit-taking behavior is not unexpected, given the significant price increase in a short period.



The whale accumulation of Pepe tokens by whales has played a crucial role in driving the token’s price to new highs. With 100% of Pepe Coin holders currently in profit, the market sentiment remains overwhelmingly positive. However, profit-taking behavior among whales and selling pressure in the derivatives market could lead to short-term price fluctuations.

2 Years Ago Today: Terra (LUNA) Lost 99.999% of Its Value - A Reminder of Risks Associated with Altcoins ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Today is considered one of the darkest days in the history of the crypto assets market. Terra’s LUNA cryptocurrency started to collapse in the second week of May 2022, but by 15 May 2022, the coin had shed a whopping 99.999% of its value, going from $100 just a week prior to less than $0.002 by the end of the day.



Here is what happened in that eventful week:



Image Source: TradingView



The father of all dumps in the crypto market’s history left tens of thousands of investors holding bags of worthless LUNA tokens. Overall, investors are said to have lost more than $7 billion on this coin.



Why did LUNA Collapse?



LUNA’s value was set up in such a way that Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin US Terra (UST)’s fluctuations would be handled by LUNA’s liquidity. In hindsight, it was an absurd model that something as fluctuating as a cryptocurrency with no use case could make a stablecoin “stable”. UST, too, had nothing backing it.



Once UST lost 40% of its value, LUNA nosedived and has yet to recover from it. Some bear market traders were able to make some money from the wild fluctuations of LUNA (now LUNC), but that was it. There were reports of investors losing hundreds of thousands of dollars and their entire life savings on the digital token. It wasn’t a pleasant sight.

What Happened to Terra’s Founder?



Do Kwon, the Korean founder of the Terra project, fled and remained a fugitive for many months before he was finally caught in Montenegro’s international airport, and an extradition battle began. Both South Korea and the United States wanted him on their soil so he could answer for his financial crimes. Eventually, it was decided that he would be sent to the East Asian country, and he is facing a lengthy period behind bars.



Before he was arrested, Do Kwon attempted to conjure up a face-saving for the token project and launched another crypto to compensate the affected people. The resulting coin was also called LUNA, while the previous one was rechristened LUNC. But nothing saved the doomed coin, and both are pretty worthless now.



The Aftermath



The LUNA fiasco highlighted the fragility of the altcoin market. While Bitcoin has remained relatively stable most of the time, altcoins have been a mixed bag overall, with many coins failing. LUNA was overshadowed the same year by an even bigger fraud in the form of the FTX exchange scandal. Do Kwon and former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried remain public enemies no.1 and 2 in crypto circles.



The episode reminds investors to be careful when investing in risky endeavors like many altcoins.

5 Things to Know Ahead of the ‘Notcoin’ Token Launch - Decrypt

The Notcoin token is finally here—well, almost. After a couple of missed deadlines in April, the NOT token on The Open Network (TON) is set to launch in a matter of hours, with exchanges like Binance and OKX set to list the token on May 16.Tens of millions of players will also be able to claim their NOT allocations at the same time, which means Notcoin is poised to be not only one of the biggest gaming token launches of 2024, but possibly one of the biggest overall crypto drops in 2024.If you haven’t been following the latest updates, then there are a few key things that you need to know, whether you’re planning to claim your NOT tokens, purchase them, or perhaps try to earn some through staking campaigns. Here’s a quick, final primer before the Notcoin rollout.1) Staking campaignsWhile there was already a substantial player base, Notcoin also worked with notable crypto exchanges Binance and OKX to seed billions of NOT tokens to their respective customer bases, perhaps opening up a broader audience of NOT holders and traders.But that window is closing fast. Between the two campaigns, more than 4 billion NOT tokens were offered to users who staked other cryptocurrencies. And Binance users jumped hard at the opportunity, staking some $14 billion to grab a share of the rewards.As of this writing, there are only a couple of hours left to secure rewards via Binance, but several hours left to do so through OKX—so act fast if you still can.2) When listing?According to official Notcoin posts on Wednesday, the token will be listed on major exchanges at 12:00 UTC on Thursday—that’s 9am Eastern.Binance, OKX, Bybit, KuCoin, and Bitfinex are among those who have already announced plans to list the token right away. The total supply of NOT is just over 102.7 billion tokens, with about 80.2 billion offered to players via the airdrop claim.3) Claim your coinsIf you mined in-game coins between January and April 1, the end of the mining phase, then you can claim your on-chain NOT tokens. Some 35 million total players hopped into the Telegram-based clicker game, and NOT tokens are being awarded at a 1,000-to-1 conversation rate. So if you mined 100,000 in-game coins, you’ll have 100 NOT to claim.Notcoin opened up the in-game claim process to all players on Tuesday, beginning with the ability to either transfer the tokens to a centralized exchange account or stake them for future rewards and access—more on that in a moment. On Thursday, once the token has been listed, Notcoin will add the ability to withdraw any earned NOT to a self-custody wallet, as well.4) Should you stake?For some players, the NOT token launch might end their planned journey with Notcoin. Crypto traders “farm” airdrops all the time, and this one was simple and widely known. But Open Builders, the team behind Notcoin, aims to keep some of those millions of users onboard.When you go to claim your NOT tokens, Notcoin will ask whether you want to stake (or lock) your tokens within the game for a period of 30 days—which means you won’t be able to withdraw or sell them during that span.But in doing so, Notcoin says that you’ll be able to “Explore & earn extra rewards” and gain “Exclusive access” to staking pools based on your player level. Keeping your tokens locked up for a month is a risk, as with any crypto decision, but it’s one that could yield future benefits if you’re in no rush to cash out and move on.5) What’s next?Notcoin will bring back its coin-tapping game and launch a new kind of rewards model, but there are grander ambitions ahead, as Open Builders co-founder Sasha Plotvinov has shared with Decrypt’s GG.In the short term, Notcoin will bring back the familiar game with the added ability to earn real NOT tokens instead of more in-game coins. But with all the tokens minted and deployed, there will be a new model. Projects and companies will be able to buy NOT on the market and pay it into the game to fuel play-to-earn rewards, sharing tokens with players who engage with their content.Beyond that, Plotvinov shared that Notcoin aims to become the “Netflix of social, viral games,” serving as a platform for third-party developers to deploy their simple, addictive games that can potentially reach a sizable audience—with token rewards, of course.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Crypto enters the American Presidential Election cycle - Brave New Coin

For the first time, Bitcoin and crypto is set to take center stage in an American Presidential Election cycle. President Trump is positioning himself as the first major party nominee to actively court Bitcoin and crypto holders. 
For the first time, Bitcoin and crypto is set to take center stage in an American Presidential Election cycle. Donald Trump has reversed course on crypto and is now positioning himself as the first major party nominee to actively court Bitcoin and crypto holders.
Addressing crypto enthusiasts at Mar-a-Lago last week, Trump’s message was clear: support him or face the Biden administration’s stringent regulatory measures against the industry. “They are against it,” he declared during an event promoting his own non-fungible token (NFT).
This overt appeal to the crypto faithful marks a significant departure from Trump’s previous criticisms of Bitcoin during his first term, though it is not entirely unexpected. The GOP has increasingly embraced digital assets, contrasting with Democrats who remain divided on granting legitimacy to the industry, with Elizabeth Warren leading an anit-crypto army.
Trump’s direct endorsement signifies a pivotal moment for the American crypto industry, which has intensified lobbying efforts and invested millions to influence the upcoming 2024 elections.

Trump at Mar a Lago with Messari Crypto Advocate Ryan Selkis, via X
The issue has become a fresh line of attack for Trump against Biden. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, appointed by Biden, has pursued aggressive enforcement actions against crypto firms for alleged violations of federal securities laws. Trump criticized the administration’s stance, asserting, “The Democrats are very much against it.”
However, not all Democrats oppose crypto. Despite Biden’s veto threat, twenty-one Democrats joined Republicans in voting to overturn SEC crypto guidance. Yet, Trump’s embrace introduces a new partisan dynamic into the debate over crypto regulation, potentially complicating the industry’s bipartisan outreach efforts.
Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey is working with Donald Trump’s campaign to develop their Bitcoin and cryptocurrency policies. He wrote on X, “For the past month we have been working with the Trump campaign to develop their bitcoin and crypto policy agenda. We proposed a comprehensive executive order for President Trump to sign on day 1. I will be sharing those details soon. This week Trump took the first step, but there is much work to do. We intend to raise a $100m war chest for the campaign to ensure the next President of the United States is pro Bitcoin. If you can help, please reach out.”
Trump told the crowd that President Joe Biden “doesn’t even know” what crypto is. “If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you are in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump,” he added.
Trump’s campaign will accept donations in crypto, it’s expected that this will result in a sizable war chest.

U.S. Indicts Brothers for Attack on Ethereum Trading Bots | Cryptopolitan

Two brothers, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno, stand indicted by U.S. authorities for a calculated assault on Ethereum trading bots that shook the core of blockchain security.This sophisticated crime spree unfolded last year, prompting a rigorous investigation that culminated in the unveiling of charges by the Department of Justice on Wednesday.The brothers that laundered money through cryptoThe duo faces allegations of wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. Their operation reportedly compromised the Ethereum blockchain’s integrity, nabbing roughly $25 million in cryptocurrencies—all within a dizzying span of about 12 seconds.Their arrest earlier this week in Massachusetts and New York marks a significant breakthrough in the case.April 2023 saw the execution of their daring exploit. They targeted automated bots designed to capitalize on trading efficiencies—bots that attempt to anticipate and profit from pending transaction orders on the Ethereum network.These bots, driven by a concept known as Maximum Extractable Value (MEV), exploit the lag between transaction announcement and confirmation for profit.The brothers concocted a deceitful lure, initiating at least eight rigged transactions known to attract the bots into a trap, capitalizing on a now-fixed vulnerability in MEV-Boost software.Each trapped transaction coerced the bots into buying large volumes of hardly liquid cryptocurrencies using $25 million in various stablecoins.DOJ accuses them of deception and concealmentTo elude capture, Anton and James masked their identities using shell companies and anonymous cryptocurrency addresses.Post-attack, they meticulously moved the pilfered cryptocurrency through numerous transactions aimed at obscuring its origins and true ownership.Their preparatory work was extensive. They researched know-your-customer (KYC) standards and legal extradition intricacies, evidently planning their steps with meticulous precision. They also delved into potential charges they could face, arming themselves with knowledge to stay ahead of law enforcement.Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco remarked on the case, emphasizing the technological sophistication and unprecedented nature of the scheme—a plot hatched over months and executed in mere seconds.The indictment provides a detailed account of the Ethereum blockchain operation, explaining the role of validators—those who confirm and secure transactions—and the ‘mempool,’ where transactions wait before confirmation.The MEV-boost software in question facilitates the assembly of these transactions into blocks, allowing so-called ‘searchers’ to optimize trading strategies that could potentially undercut standard user profits.The mechanics of their exploitationsThe crux of the brothers’ strategy involved creating 16 Ethereum validators to pinpoint and exploit three specific traders’ bots.They sent out bait transactions to analyze the bots’ trading patterns. Subsequently, they drew these bots to a validator they controlled, which was about to validate a new block.Here, they executed the crux of their strategy: they preempted the bots, tampered with block transactions by swapping in fraudulent digital signatures, and swapped out genuine transactions for deceptive ones.The targeted bots ended up buying worthless cryptocurrencies at high volumes, thinking they were securing valuable assets.This left the victim traders with significant losses, as they were unable to sell the devalued cryptocurrencies, effectively stranding $25 million in more liquid assets like stablecoins, which the brothers then absconded with.Finally, the laundering of these ill-gotten gains was meticulously planned. The brothers converted the stolen cryptocurrencies into DAI and then into USDC, further masking their trail.Special Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation New York Field Office highlighted this operation as a novel form of blockchain manipulation, one that involved advanced knowledge of Ethereum’s inner workings and substantial technical expertise.

New Law in Oklahoma Establishes Legal Framework for Blockchain | Cryptopolitan

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt has recently put his signature on a groundbreaking bill that sets up a legal framework specifically for blockchain technology and digital assets.This decisive move aims to position Oklahoma as a hub for digital innovation, ensuring that the state remains at the forefront of technological advancement in the crypto industry.Oklahoma Introduces Legal Protections in CryptoThe newly signed law is a robust step towards integrating blockchain into everyday practices by eliminating restrictive measures on the usage of cryptoassets.Specifically, the law ensures that these assets, when used for legal transactions or held in self-custody, will not be burdened by any additional taxes or fees that aren’t imposed on traditional payment methods.This provision showcases Oklahoma’s commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment that respects the autonomy of digital transactions.Introduced by State Representative Brian Hill in January, this legislation also addresses the specifics of crypto mining. It allows residents to engage in mining operations within residential zones, provided they comply with local noise ordinances.On the other hand, businesses operating in industrial zones will not face any new noise restrictions aside from existing regulations. This balanced approach ensures that the growth of the crypto industry does not disrupt community standards.Oklahoma’s Classification of Blockchain is a WinUnder this new legal structure, blockchain is defined comprehensively. It is described as data shared across a network that creates a ledger of verified transactions.These transactions are maintained through cryptography, which secures the integrity of data exchanges and facilitates updates among network participants. This definition covers not only the technical aspects but also the operational dynamics of blockchain technology.The law further elaborates on several key terms in the blockchain and digital asset ecosystem:Digital Assets: This includes cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other digital-only assets that confer economic or proprietary rights.Digital Asset Mining: Defined as the process of using electricity to power computers or nodes that secure blockchain networks.Node: A computational device that maintains and updates a blockchain copy, ensuring the ledger’s accuracy and up-to-date status.Self-Hosted Wallets and Hardware Wallets: Tools that allow users to securely store and manage their digital assets independently of third-party services.Framework Supports Miners and Node OperatorsSections of the law detail the legalities surrounding digital asset mining and the operation of nodes. For instance, individuals engaged in home mining must adhere to local noise standards but will enjoy the freedom to mine without facing discriminatory regulatory practices.Similarly, crypto mining businesses are allowed to operate within industrially zoned areas without facing additional noise-related restrictions beyond what is already required for other industrial entities.Additionally, the law stipulates that operating a node or engaging in staking—committing digital assets to support a blockchain network—does not require a money transmitter license.This significant ruling opens up the field for more individuals and businesses to participate in blockchain operations without undergoing the cumbersome and often costly licensing processes typically associated with financial services.One of the most crucial aspects of the legislation is the protection it offers to crypto owners. The law explicitly states that neither the state nor local governments can impose taxes or charges on crypto transactions unless similar liabilities exist for transactions conducted with U.S. legal tender.Moreover, any attempts by local governments to rezone areas to disadvantage mining operations can be legally contested, providing a safeguard against discriminatory practices.

Bitcoin Self-Custody Enshrined As a Right In Oklahoma - Decrypt

Oklahoma has become the first U.S. state to pass a law protecting the right to self-custody Bitcoin.The new law says citizens cannot be prevented from holding and controlling digital assets using a hardware wallet. It also says that the state government cannot ban or restrict the use of crypto to purchase legal goods and services.The so-called ‘Bitcoin Rights’ bill—HB3594—was signed into law by Oklahoma’s Republican governor Kevin Stitt Monday, and the non-profit Satoshi Action Fund says more states will follow suit.“I think that at the end of the day, lawmakers across the country are very open to this type of policy,” the fund's CEO and co-founder Dennis Porter told Decrypt.The bill also mentions digital asset mining, allowing ordinary citizens to take part in the industry—within limits.“It shall be legal in the State of Oklahoma to participate in home digital asset mining as long as the person engaging in home digital asset mining complies with all local noise ordinances,” the law reads. Crypto mining involves minting new coins and keeping digital coin networks running. It is an energy-intensive industry that uses large amounts of hardware, space, and resources. Most Bitcoin mining operations today are industrial-scale operations that can generate a lot of noise.The Satoshi Action Fund created the template for the bill, which has been introduced in 15 other states. The Oklahoma Bitcoin Association helped educate lawmakers on the benefits of Bitcoin and played a major part in making Oklahoma the first state to pass the bill into law, Porter said.Crypto has become an increasingly hot political topic, and one evolving along partisan lines. At the national level, at least, Democrats typically focus on the potential threats of the technology, while Republicans oppose regulations that they say hamstring innovation in a globally competitive marketplace.Porter said similar laws are inevitably coming to other states—and that it isn’t a “left versus right” issue.“Elizabeth Warren is a major figure in the Biden administration,” he said, referring to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, an outspoken crypto critic. “It’s really like Elizabeth Warren and her banking henchmen friends that are influencing federal policy.”“As we see the technology growing in attention, and getting more and more scrutiny, we do see folks on the left taking a closer look and not just believing what the mainstream media tells them about this technology,” Porter added.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin Price Could go ‘Vertical’ when BTC Miner Revenue Recovers, Historical Data Shows | Cryptoglobe


                                
Popular cryptocurrency analyst PlanB, who is widely recognized in the crypto community, has suggested that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin could soon go “vertical,” based on historical data.



PlanB, known for his stock-to-flow (S2F) model for predicting Bitcoin’s price, recently shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) that historical data shows Bitcoin miner revenue takes between two and five months to recover after a halving, and that “after that bitcoin price goes vertical.”



PlanB’s analysis aligns with historical trends. Bitcoin miner revenue has demonstrably grown over time, with peaks often occurring in the months following a halving. This rise in revenue often coincides with a high relative strength index (RSI), an indicator of potential buying pressure.







The analyst has, as CryptoGlobe reported, predicted the price of Bitcoin would reach $500,000 this year based on key technical indicators and their past influence on the cryptocurrency price.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In a video at the time, he noted that Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI), a technical indicator meant to chart the current and historical strength or weakness of an asset‘s recent price changes, appears to be mirroring a historical pattern that in the past indicated major price surges.



PlanB elaborated on his interpretation of the data, stating that as we approach Bitcoin’s halving event, which will cut the supply of newly created tokens in half next year, its RSI is moving up. Per his words we “should be prepared for market volatility,” and a direct ascent is “unlikely.”



The analyst noted that if the pattern holds, he anticipates a bullish surge in 2024 with the RSI hovering around 90, while in 2025 and 2026 he sees the cryptocurrency endure a bearish trend.

OpenAI Loses Two More Leaders-What Does That Mean for AI Safety? - Decrypt

The same week OpenAI commanded global attention for releasing its latest AI model, prominent executives Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike announced that they were leaving the company. Coupled with the February departure of Andrej Karpathy, it appears the people most committed to safe, human-centered AI development have left the company.Has the top name in AI lost its brake pedal in the intense race to dominate the massively disruptive industry?The failed coupIt was early 2023 when Sutskever, co-founder and former chief scientist, was credited with being the mastermind behind a controversial move to oust CEO Sam Altman over alleged concerns that he was cavalier about AI safety protocols. His dramatic removal led to breathless headlines and widespread rumors, but Altman was restored to his post a week later.Sutskever soon issued an apology and resigned from OpenAI's board—and had not made any public statements or appearances since.Indeed, when OpenAI presented its much hyped product update on Monday, Sutskever was notably absent.Sutskever announced his official departure just two days later. His resignation statement was cordial, as was Altman’s public acknowledgement.“After almost a decade, I have made the decision to leave OpenAI,” Sutskever wrote. ”The company’s trajectory has been nothing short of miraculous, and I’m confident that OpenAI will build AGI that is both safe and beneficial under the leadership of (Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and Mira Murati).“It was an honor and a privilege to have worked together, and I will miss everyone dearly,” he continued, adding that he was moving on to focus on a personally meaningful project.“This is very sad to me; Ilya is easily one of the greatest minds of our generation, a guiding light of our field, and a dear friend,” Sam Altman said, “OpenAI would not be what it is without him.” He also replied to Sutskever’s announcement with a nice short messageShortly after, OpenAI announced that Jakub Panochi would be filling Sutskever’s position. Panochi previously served as Director of Research and had a more technical job, focusing mostly on scaling AI.But there may be something more to the changing of the guard. When Sutskever announced his resignation, he only followed a few Twitter accounts, including OpenAI and a dachshund meme account. Someone named Adam Sulik, a self-described “AI centrist,” replied to the announcement, suggesting Sutskever ignore any non-disclosure agreements he may still be subject and share insider information in the name of humanity.Sutskever followed Sulik after his comment... then unfollowed him a few hours later.As it turned out, Sutskever wasn't alone in heading for the exit. Just hours later, Jan Leike—who co-founded OpenAI's "superalignment" team with Sutskever to ensure ethical, long-term AI development—resigned with a frosty tweet simply stating, "I resigned."No pleasantries, no praise for OpenAI, and no reactions from OpenAI execs.Leike had worked at Google’s Deepmind before joining OpenAI. At the latter firm, the superalignment team focused on ensuring that cutting-edge systems in which AI’s are expected to meet or exceed human intelligence remain aligned with human values and intentions.Not much is known about this group of AI safety sentries, however. Besides the two leaders, OpenAI has not provided any additional information about the unit other than the fact that there are other “researchers and engineers from [its] previous alignment team, as well as researchers from other teams across the company.”Sulik also commented on Leike’s resignation, sharing his concern about the time of the events.“Seeing Jan leave right after Ilya doesn’t bode well for humanity’s safe path forward,“ he tweeted.OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.These departures come months after OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy left the company, saying in February that he wanted to pursue personal projects. Karpathy worked as research scientist at OpenAI and was involved in different projects from computer vision applications to AI assistants and key developments during the training of ChatGPT. He took a five-year break from the company between 2017 and 2022 to lead AI development at Tesla.With these three departures, OpenAI is left without some of the most important minds pursuing an ethical approach toward AGI.Decels out, new deals inThere are signs that the failed ouster of Altman removed resistance to more lucrative but ethically cloudy opportunities.Shortly after reinstating Altman, for example, OpenAI loosened restrictions on using its tech for potentially harmful applications like weapons development—guidelines that previously banned such activities outright.In addition to striking the deal with the Pentagon, OpenAI also opened a plugin store enabling anyone to design and share personalized AI assistants, effectively diluting direct oversight. Most recently, the company began “exploring” the creation of adult content.The diminishing strength of ethics advocates and guidelines extends beyond Open AI. Microsoft axed its entire ethics and society team in January, and Google sidelining its Responsible AI taskforce that same month. Meta, meanwhile, disbanding its ethical AI crew. All three tech giants are meanwhile in a mad dash to dominate the AI market.There’s clear reason for concern. AI products are already massively mainstream, a social phenomenon with billions of interactions per day. There appears to be growing potential for unaligned AI to adversely impact the development of future generations in business, political, community, and even family affairs.The rise of philosophical movements like "effective accelerationism"—which values rapid development over ethical worries—exacerbates these concerns.For now, the main remaining bastion of caution appears to be a mix of open source development, voluntary participation in AI safety coalitions—such as the Frontier Model Forum or MLCommons, —and outright regulation by the government, from the AI Act in the UK to the G7’s code of AI conduct.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Bitcoin Surges Past $64,000 as U.S. Core Inflation Hits Three-Year Low



                    

On May 15, Bitcoin soared past $64,000, coinciding with the announcement of lower-than-expected core inflation rates in the United States. 



This significant increase in Bitcoin’s value occurred after the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which reflected a positive outlook for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. 




As a result, Bitcoin reached a local high of $64,700, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.



The CPI report for April indicated a month-on-month increase of 0.3%, which was 0.1% below the anticipated figures. 



This data suggested a decrease in core inflation to its lowest point since 2021, hinting at potential cuts in interest rates. 




However, reactions to these statistics were mixed. 



The Kobeissi Letter expressed caution, noting that while CPI inflation had decreased for the first time in three months, the Producer Price Index (PPI) had risen for the third consecutive month. 



They highlighted that “The Fed will remain in wait and see mode,” acknowledging the complexities of the economic indicators.



Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell maintained a cautiously optimistic tone, despite mixed signals from recent economic reports. 




“I wouldn’t call it hot, I’d call it mixed,” Powell remarked about the PPI data in a statement reported by Reuters.



Despite the positive CPI data, market expectations for immediate rate cuts remained low. 



According to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, the likelihood of a rate cut in June was just 3.1%, with a slightly higher expectation of 28.3% for July.

The cryptocurrency market reacted swiftly to these economic developments. 



CoinGlass reported significant activity in Bitcoin exchanges, where prices surged, breaking past liquidity barriers and forming a new resistance level around $65,000. 



This dynamic shift indicated a strong buy-in from market participants.



Skew, a prominent trader, commented on the situation, emphasizing the need for continued buying pressure to maintain Bitcoin’s momentum. 



He suggested that for Bitcoin to lead the market confidently, it would need to surpass the $65,000 mark to restore market confidence.



In summary, Bitcoin’s price surge on May 15 was closely tied to the latest U.S. economic data, demonstrating the cryptocurrency’s sensitivity to global economic indicators and market sentiments. 



The mixed economic data has left the market in a state of cautious anticipation regarding future Federal Reserve actions.

Analyst Says Ethereum Rival Mirroring Memecoin That Just Printed New All-Time High, Updates Outlook on Altcoins - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto strategist thinks that an Ethereum (ETH) challenger is following in the footsteps of a red-hot memecoin that just hit a fresh record high.
Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 393,500 followers on the social media platform X that the market structure of layer-1 protocol Near (NEAR) looks similar to Pepe’s (PEPE), a memecoin that printed a new all-time high in the last 24 hours.










“Looks identical to PEPE and with my expectation of some relief across the board here I think dips are for buying, targeting the highs.
I’m long as of last night.” 
Source: Credible/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to be targeting $9 for NEAR with invalidation at $5.72. At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $7.03, suggesting an upside potential of nearly 30% if the altcoin hits Credible’s target.
But while Credible is bullish on NEAR, he says his sentiment does not extend to Pepe and large-cap altcoins. The analyst says that Pepe and major altcoins are inching toward a big corrective move as he believes market participants are rotating their capital to ride the next burst to the upside for Bitcoin (BTC).
“Pepe and major alts = in a ranging environment which I believe is a distribution top ultimately leading to breakdowns.
Bitcoin = in a ranging environment which I believe is a reaccumulation range ultimately leading to a breakout to $100,000.” 
At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $61,655.

Shiba Inu Big Buyers Return: What The 2,300% Spike In Whale Volume Means For Price | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) is again on top as crypto whales return to the meme coin’s ecosystem. On-chain data shows that these high-volume investors have been recently accumulating the meme coin, which could ultimately affect its price. 
Shiba Inu Sees Spike In Whale Transactions
Data from the on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock shows that Shiba Inu saw a 2,300% increase in its daily large transaction volume, amounting to $223 million. This category of transactions exceeds $100,000 and is usually made by traders called “whales.” This development presents a bullish signal for the meme coin, as whales are known to significantly impact a coin’s price discovery. 

Therefore, a surge in Shiba Inu’s price looks inevitable, as whale accumulation usually leads to an upward trend in the token’s price. Meanwhile, other metrics paint a bullish outlook for the meme coin. For instance, there has also been an increase in the daily active addresses and transactions, which suggests that crypto investors are actively trading the meme coin. 
Shiba Inu’s burn rate is also up in the past seven days with over 143 million SHIB tokens burned during that period. Shiba Inu’s fundamentals are also strong. The meme coin recently secured a listing on the cryptocurrency payment platform CoinGate. 
This listing is expected to expand Shiba Inu’s offerings. Users can use the meme coin to process some commercial transactions, including paying for Airbnb accommodations and purchasing from certain brands like Nike and Zalando. 
However, despite such a bullish outlook, the layer-2 network Shibarium is still lagging, which will undoubtedly be a cause for concern for the ecosystem. Data from the Shibariumscan shows that the network has continued to record daily transactions under 10,000. This is a far cry from when Shibarium recorded millions in daily transactions.
SHIB’s Next Move On The Charts
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently provided insights into Shiba Inu’s future trajectory. In an X (formerly Twitter) post, he mentioned that the meme coin could witness a “20% upswing to $0.00002954” if it breaks the upper boundary of this descending parallel channel at $0.00002444.

Crypto analyst DamiDefi also revealed in an X post that Shiba Inu had formed a falling wedge on the daily time frame. He claimed that if the meme coin breaks out from its current price level, Shiba Inu could experience a price pump of over 50%.

Shiba Inu could, however, be held back by Bitcoin’s tepid price action as data from IntoTheBlock shows that the meme coin still has a strong price correlation with the flagship crypto. Shiba Inu recorded a significant rally on May 13 and looked to be experiencing a bullish reversal, but that wasn’t the case as it faced a sharp correction, declining alongside Bitcoin. 
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00002404, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

GameStop Bull Roaring Kitty Keeps Sharing Movie Memes-What's He Telling Us? - Decrypt

Famed GameStop trader Roaring Kitty’s apparent return to Twitter has rocked the social media and financial landscape. But what on earth is he tweeting about?Rather than returning with his trademark GME YOLO updates or analysis of his darling stock GameStop, he started posting movie memes, with iconic scenes and inspiring monologues cut together and edited by the meme influencer. In turn, people have tried to decipher what he’s trying to say.Keith Gill, best known as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, was a key figure in the 2021 GameStop short squeeze. Prior to disappearing in 2021, his Twitter account would often post movie memes similar to what he posts today. But due to his three-year radio silence, the memes now hold more weight—and are driving massive trading action.So, here at Decrypt we’ve gathered the most notable movie mentions and attempted to bleed some meaning out of it."Fine, I'll do it myself"Movies: "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015) and "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" (2009)The memer started his movie posting spree with Thanos from “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” shown putting on the Infinity Gauntlet and saying, “Fine, I’ll do it myself.” This told the world that he was going to be hands-on with his return—just like the Marvel villain was with his goal of halving the population of the universe via the powerful Infinity Stones.It then cuts to a scene from “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” where the titular superhero is being experimented on by scientists. Wolverine grows his adamantium-laced claws and wakes up from the sedation he’s been put under—which appears to be Roaring Kitty basically saying “I’m back and ready to mess the game up.”However, looking deeper into the original scene, the superhero voluntarily went under sedation by the scientists. Does this mean that Twitter’s favorite GameStop influencer was asked to be silent by a group and he agreed? Or are we reading too deep into this comic book movie clip?"It's over"Movie/TV Show: "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986) and "Breaking Bad" S1E1 (2012)In his second movie tweet, the memer references both “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and “Breaking Bad”—both classics in their own right. It starts with Ferris saying, “You’re still here? It’s over,” and then Walter White responding, “We’re done when I say we’re done.”This is an obvious reference to the “It’s so over” meme that degens spout when their investment isn’t looking too great. Many believed that the GameStop saga was over with the disappearance of Roaring Kitty and GameStop failing with multiple attempts to capitalize on its 2021 fame. But Gill, represented as Walter White, is apparently saying that it’s not over until he says so.Change of directionMovies: "Furious 7" (2015) and "Drive" (2011)Beginning with the iconic scene from “Furious 7,” the “Fast and Furious” film released after Paul Walker’s death, Roaring Kitty is painting the picture that he planned to part ways with meme stock investing. That is, until the middle clip—which isn’t from a movie—shows a driver harshly handbrake-turning, just before a clip from “Drive” shows Ryan Gosling cruising through the streets, carefully watching who is following.This appears to suggest that Roaring Kitty considered leaving the scene forever, but had a sharp change of judgment. What sparked this change? Who knows. But now he’s back, patrolling the financial streets, and watching his back—like the getaway driver from the movie “Drive”—so he doesn’t get screwed like last time."Dog days are over"TV Show and Movie: "Sherlock" S2E1 (2012) and "Remember the Titans" (2000)This appears to be a warning to those investing in dog coins. A scene from BBC’s “Sherlock” series shows Irene Adler about to be executed when the famed detective saves her by telling her to run. This feels like Roaring Kitty is directly speaking to us.After a brief clip from “Remember the Titans” where the cast begins to sing “Ain't No Mountain High Enough” by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, it cuts to the music video for “Dog Days Are Over” by Florence & The Machine.A message to get out of the dog coins? Some speculated that this was a call to invest in cat coins instead, but maybe Gill’s not implying that much.Avengers initiativeMovies: "Iron Man" (2008) and "Avengers: Endgame" (2019)This one’s pretty straightforward: It’s a rallying call. He wants to unite the meme stock scene to take down Thanos, who he previously referred to as himself—but in this context we’ll assume that it’s the hedge funds the scene wanted to pummel the last time around."They found a loophole"Movie: "Old School" (2003)“They found a loophole,” the clip from buddy comedy “Old School” begins. “As stupid as they appear, they’re actually very good at paperwork.”This could be in reference to how many GameStop investors felt screwed over by the traditional finance world. A prime example of this is when Robinhood suspended GameStop trading, which some Reddit traders believed was only legal due to a loophole. As for the second half of the clip, which continues to showcase the frat bros dancing in unison? No clue. But it’s funny!Three years of nightsMovie: "The Batman" (2022)Roaring Kitty apparently paints a picture of what life has been like since he left. It’s been dark, he’s been a nocturnal animal. But now he’s returned, and he’s sending a message to the financial world: Be afraid. Also, maybe he’s Batman?"Requel"Movies: "Scream" (2022)Last year’s film adaptation “Dumb Money” covered the 2021 GameStop short squeeze with Paul Dano starring as Roaring Kitty himself. In this tweet, it appears that the real trader thinks the film itself was kinda dumb, too.He’s come back to release a “requel” of the 2021 short squeeze to make up for the film released last year. What has he noticed? Will the short squeeze be for GameStop?GameStooooooooooooooopMovie: "Braveheart" (1995)He finally said it. Up until this point, none of Roaring Kitty’s tweets had directly mentioned the meme stock that made him famous. Does this mean that everything he’s hinting at in these videos applies to GameStop? Or is it just a nod to his roots?It’s also very powerful to think that GameStop is synonymous with freedom. Power to secondhand video games… and the endless stacks of Funko Pop toys that seem to clog up most of the stores nowadays.Keeping it realTV Show: "Chappelle’s Show" S2E7 (2004)It appears that Roaring Kitty has been pissed off somehow. We’re not sure by who or how he was aggravated, but it seems like something that he’s been holding in for some time. He’s done playing Mr. Nice Guy and is reintroducing himself, no longer taking anyone’s crap.There are threads running through the tweets of Roaring Kitty. There are many rallying cries, including messages to his followers that there is a tough battle ahead, and that it’s time to fight in the financial markets.He hints at possible reasons why he’s been silent during these three years. Perhaps he just hasn't seen any financial opportunities arise; maybe he was silenced, or was just being polite. Whatever the case, he’s changed his mind and is putting pedal to the metal. It appears he’s seen something that will rival the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, something he’s calling a “requel.” It could be GameStop, non-dog meme coins, or maybe there’s something we’ve missed. We don’t know for sure, but until Roaring Kitty posts something more substantial than movie, TV, and music video mash-ups with rousing messages attached, we’ll keep analyzing them for clues.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

                        Two Russian teenagers have been arrested in a crackdown on a suspected crypto-powered “money laundering” ring, a police source claimed on May 14.Per the news agency URA, an unnamed “law enforcement agency” member in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug said the teenage brothers “attracted other teens” in the region to their scheme.Russian Teens Ran ‘Crypto Exchange’ with ‘Organized Crime Gang’
The source claimed that some of the teens’ parents sent a “statement” to law enforcement agencies in the region in April.The parents reportedly told police officers that “an organized crime group” had “involved their children” in what appears to be an illegal crypto exchange operation.Police appear to have been ignorant of the scheme before the tip-off, but launched a probe shortly after.The source claimed that the two brothers offered fellow teens “small financial benefits” for processing crypto-related transactions through their bank accounts.One of the teens transacted almost $22,000 worth of crypto exchange-related funds through their bank account in the space of two months, the source added.This helped the teen earn cash worth around $4,400, which he “hid under his pillow at home,” the source concluded.The Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug on a map of Russia.

USDC Issuer Circle Eyes Setting up Shop in US Ahead of IPO - DailyCoin


        

USDC issuer Circle is relocating from Ireland to the US. 



The company has not disclosed the reason behind its move.



All indications suggest that its potential IPO is a driving factor.




Circle, the issuer of the industry’s second-largest stablecoin, USDC, is planning to shift its legal base to the US from its current home of Ireland. The move will see the company depart from low corporate levies in favor of navigating more onerous taxes and a murky regulatory infrastructure, and here’s why. 



Circle Sets the Stage for an IPO



A company spokesperson confirmed to multiple publications that Circle’s parent company has initiated the necessary paperwork with the High Court of the Republic of Ireland to redomicile its firm, though the specific reason remains undisclosed.




Circle’s decision to relocate to the US could be influenced by its potential initial public offering (IPO), for which the company confidentially filed for its equity securities in January of this year. However, aside from the IPO, the move could appear less appealing due to the US’s complex regulatory landscape and high tax rates, contrasting Ireland’s lucrative corporate tax environment.



Earlier this year, Circle announced that it had submitted a draft registration statement S-1 form to the SEC as part of its efforts to go public. Details regarding share quantity and pricing are yet to be finalized, pending SEC review, and are subject to market and other conditions.



Circle’s decision to redomicile could indicate positive feedback on its IPO application from the SEC, suggesting progress in the company’s journey towards becoming a publicly traded entity and closing the gap on its main competitor. 



Circle to Break Out of Tether’s Shadow?



Circle has long operated in the shadow of its main rival, Tether, which boasts a market capitalization of over $111 billion, far surpassing the former’s $33 billion. 




While USDC has demonstrated exceptional performance over the past year, frequently flipping USDT in monthly transactions, an IPO could propel Circle much closer to Tether. If Circle successfully navigates the intricate process and stringent requirements of becoming a publicly traded company, it could gain favor among institutional investors and become ‘Wall Street’s stablecoin.’ 



This is particularly significant as Tether navigates turbulent waters, after regulators implicated the issuer in numerous money laundering and terror financing instances.



On The Flipside




In 2021, Circle tried to go public through a merger with Concord Acquisition Corp.; however, that arrangement didn’t see the light of day. 



Circle’s biggest competitor, Tether, is based in the British Virgin Islands.




Why This Matters



The United States may not seem the most appealing choice for major crypto companies seeking relocation, especially in light of the regulatory crackdown on the industry. Transitioning from a more crypto-friendly jurisdiction to the US might raise some eyebrows. However, this move holds significant importance for Circle and could position USDC in closer competition with Tether as the latter endeavors to restore its reputation.Franklin Templeton’s Jenny Johnson is astonished by blockchain technology:Franklin Templeton CEO Excited About Future with On-Chain ETFsAre Bitcoin Runes a flop?

Canada’s ‘Crypto King’ and Associate Arrested, Charged With Fraud in Alleged $30M Ponzi Scheme

Pleterski, who is also a small-time livestreamer, posted videos of his escapades – including numerous vacations to places like Los Angeles, London and Miami, driving rented Lamborghinis and McLarens, and detailing his expenditures. In one video, in which Pleterski filmed himself assembling a Lego model of the Titanic, he estimated that he’d spent $150,000 on Legos since 2021.

DOJ charges 2 people over $25 million ETH theft via MEV exploit

The DOJ arrested and charged two individuals on May 15 over an alleged $25 million MEV exploit that occurred on the Ethereum blockchain.The defendants — brothers Anton and James Pepaire-Bueno — face three charges of conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering, each with a potential 20-year sentence.Line of attackThe defendants’ plan involved several steps focused on Ethereum’s maximal extractable value (MEV) — particularly the MEV-Boost software many Ethereum validators use to optimize transactions as searchers seek profitable arbitration opportunities using MEV bots.First, the defendants allegedly established Ethereum validators and concealed their identities through various tactics. After establishing the network, the defendants supposedly created a series of “bait” or test transactions to study MEV bots’ trading activities.Then, after months of planning, the defendants lured victim traders into performing front-run trades, enticing the victims to purchase illiquid cryptocurrencies that were expected to gain value as a result of the transaction.Later, during transaction ordering, the defendants exploited a vulnerability to replace the lured transactions with tampered transactions, thereby blocking the victims’ final sale. The defendants kept the stablecoins and highly liquid cryptocurrencies that the victims originally spent, thereby finalizing the theft.The defendants then allegedly laundered the funds through various methods.Mixed responseThe case is notable as it concerns a new type of crypto crime.US Attorney of the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said the scheme “has never been charged before” and said it “exploit[ed] the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.”The case has attracted backlash from individuals who consider highly profitable uses of MEV bots, such as the trades that the defendants allegedly blocked, to be an issue in their own right.AllianceDAO Contributor and VoltCapital Venture Partner Mohamed Fouda said:“When an MEV bot uses $25 [million] of stablecoins to sandwich 8 different transactions of illiquid coins, that is a [completely] honest business. …If you bait this MEV bot, then that’s a crime.”Fouda also asserted that the case improperly portrays the duties of Ethereum relayers. He called it a “trap to pull every operator on Ethereum into a web of legal compliance requirements.”Ryan Sean Adams of Bankless likewise dismissed the distinction between transactions, rhetorically asking:“What’s legal MEV, and what’s illegal MEV that gets you 20 years in jail?”Other commentators opposed the alleged theft. Head of Commercial at Brainbot Loring Harkness said:“Stealing from thieves is still theft.”CEHV partner Adam Cochran called the case a “much more clear case of exploit” than widely reported.Metamask Lead Product Manager/Owner Taylor Monahan said:“Yes, if you steal and launder $25 million dollars you should expect to go to prison for a long time … “The DOJ has yet to prove its case in court.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

FTX repayments could create ‘bullish overhang’ for crypto markets - K33 Research

Slated cash repayments to FTX creditors could create a wave of bullish “buying pressure” in the crypto market, says K33 Research analysts.FTX is set to pay a minimum of $14.5 billion in cash to users who lost funds in the exchange’s bankruptcy. These payouts would likely create a “bullish overhang” for the market, K33 analysts Vetle Lunde and Anders Hesleth said in a May 14 report.“Not all creditor repayments are bearish,” said the analysts, contrasting FTX’s expected cash repayments with the planned crypto-based repayments from Mt. Gox and Gemini — the latter two combined “currently valued at $10.6 billion.” The buying pressure from cash recipients would neutralize the selling pressure from in-kind recipients, Lunde and Hesleth concluded.Not all creditor repayments are bearish. Source: K33 ResearchNoting that it would be “impossible” to determine the net buying or selling pressure from these repayments ahead of time, the analysts said the timing of the payments could form a key element in predicting their impact on the market. Related: Post-FTX crypto industry needs education before regulationGemini’s $1.7 billion in repayments is slated for early June, while Mt. Gox’s $8.9 billion is expected to be repaid by its October 2024 deadline. The analysts noted that there was still some uncertainty around the scheduled repayment date due to the court not yet approving the FTX repayment proposal, but said that most FTX creditors were expecting repayments to be issued later this year. “The different timing of these repayments represents yet another indication of a slow summer in the market and a solid end to the year.” On May 8, FTX said it could repay creditors as much as $16.3 billion with those holding claim amounts below $50,000 being eligible for up to 118% of the recovery — using the price of their crypto in November 2022. Some industry pundits expressed dissatisfaction with the proposal, saying that not all creditors would be receiving repayments equivalent to current market prices. “I understand why the bankruptcy process needs to work this way but let’s not pretend victims are getting their money back,” wrote BitGo CEO Mike Belshe in a May 8 post to X.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

NFT Recession: 95% of Assets Drop to Zero Market Value, Report - DailyCoin


        

The NFT market has hit a recession. 



A recent report reveals harrowing details about the NFT market’s decline since 2021.



Despite a significant slowdown in market growth, a glimmer of hope remains. 




In 2021, NFTs stormed into the crypto industry like a hurricane, transforming into a goldmine for almost everyone who touched it. Minting overnight millionaires with what many called ‘on-chain jpegs, ‘ the speculative frenzy led most to anticipate the asset class exploding much like memecoins today, resulting in its market swelling to billions– but not for long. 



After weathering a tumultuous two-year bear market and with the dust settled, a sobering realization emerges: people are losing interest in NFTs. 



NFT Markets Hits Recession. 



Today’s NFT market starkly contrasts with the feverish frenzy in 2021, as investors and traders now exit the once-booming ecosystem amidst declining sales and waning interest. In a report shared with DailyCoin, Invezz reveals that while the global market cap of NFTs has soared past $190 billion, the industry is traversing a harrowing path. 




After analyzing over 73,000 NFT collections with a combined trading volume of $17 billion, the report reveals a staggering reality: 95% of all NFT projects, totaling over 69,000 collections, held zero market value at press time. 



The decline can be attributed to the NFT market’s dwindling trading volume, which has plummeted 97% since its peak in 2021. Adding to the gloom, the once-thriving market, renowned for generating millions per sale through collections like CryptoPunk and Bored Ape Yacht Club, now struggles to generate even hundreds. 



According to the report, 53.6% of NFT sales were valued at less than $200, while 75% were worth less than $100. The daily number of sales also paints a similarly bleak picture, nosediving from an average of 87,000 in 2021 to around 2000 in 2024. 




Offering a sobering perspective, the market recorded only $11.6 million in sales in Q1 2024, a far cry from the industry’s erstwhile billion-dollar hauls per quarter in 2021. It’s evident that one of the crypto industry’s most lucrative and celebrated sectors now faces a pronounced recession; however, there remains a glimmer of hope for a potential comeback. 



There’s Hope For The NFT Market



The crypto market has been through the wringer, emerging from an enduring bear market worsened by international conflicts and contagion events like the FTX fiasco. Lingering scars from the past two years have yet to heal. 



While the industry has garnered significant favor and attention from institutions, leading to its historic run earlier this year, global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties continue to cast a shadow over investor confidence. 



Many find themselves on the edge of their seats, analyzing each candle, anxiously awaiting the official start of the bull market signaled by the US’ first rate cut in two years. 



While some investors have already plunged into memecoins, reaping astronomical gains amidst the frenzy, the NFT market lies dormant, poised for resurgence once market conditions stabilize.



NFTs are inherently speculative and entail considerable risk. Given the market’s tumultuous performance over the past two years, it’s not an appealing investment choice. However, the market could regain its lost valor once retail investors reenter the fray and reallocate funds from low-risk to high-risk assets. 



On the Flipside




Nascent, overhyped sectors like the NFT industry always face a sharp correction before they resurge. 



While US regulators intensify their campaign against the crypto industry, the NFT industry remains immune to ambiguity. Stakeholders argue that NFT-specific legislation could hinder its growth. 




Why This Matters



The NFT industry is one of the greatest subsectors of the crypto sphere. Its slow decline amidst waning interest and sales is concerning, especially for those who hold NFTs.

Solana’s Cypher Protocol Dev Confesses Stealing $300K


								The Solana-based Cypher Protocol is again in the negative spotlight after one of its core developers admitted to stealing and losing over $300,000 of users’ funds. Another of the project’s developers first unveiled the news and also alerted law enforcement.

Solana-Based Protocol Faces Inside Job
On Monday, Cobra, one of Cypher Protocol’s developers, revealed that a core contributor had stolen funds from the Cypher Redemption Package Contract. The developer, Hoak, had withdrawn funds from the contract for several months unnoticed.
The heist was only caught after a user in the project’s Discord pinged the team about having issues withdrawing funds. Per the post, Hoak claimed he would handle the issue. However, the user contacted the team after the developer’s deadline, stating that the issue persisted.
Consequently, the team investigated the issue and found that, in the last six months, Hoak had taken over $300,000 from the contract via 36 transactions.
During this time, the developer used the deployer wallet to withdraw assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Bonk (BONK), Orca (ORCA), Wrapped SOL (WSOL), Tether (USDT), USDC (USDC), among others.
Per the investigation, Hoak swapped the assets for Solana (SOL), USDT, and USDC before sending the funds to an intermediary wallet. The funds were sent to Binance from this wallet. The developer stole 2,498.8 USDT, 51,785.2 USDC, and 1,830.8 SOL, accounting for approximately $317,000.

Summary of the stolen assets. Source: Cobra
Cobra expressed his disbelief and sadness regarding the situation, stating that he didn’t think it was possible a core contributor, who stayed after last year’s exploit to rebuild the project, could “be the one who rugged funds from the redemption contract.”
As reported by Bitcoinist, the Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol was the victim of a security breach that took $1.03 million from the project. Despite the exploit being a major hit to the protocol, the team was able to freeze over half the stolen funds and offer a redemption plan.
The Redemption Package was based on the “socializing losses” mechanism, which consists of distributing the effects of an unfortunate event, like an exploit, across all users. Users would receive a portion of the remaining assets corresponding to their share or involvement in the protocol.
Developer Gambles Funds Away
On Tuesday, Hoak made a public statement admitting to the allegations against him and apologizing. In the statement, the developer claims to suffer from a crippling gambling addiction which has affected his professional life in several instances.
He explained that the untreated addiction drove him to steal the funds from the Redemption Package. However, he claims not to have run away with the Solana-based protocol funds but instead gambled them away, suggesting there’s little hope of retrieving the misappropriated assets.

He closed his statement by apologizing for his actions and stating, “Whatever comes next is in God’s hands.”
The community had mixed reactions to Hoak’s confession. Some members felt sympathetic towards the developer, as Ludomania is a serious matter that should be treated like any other addiction.
However, others felt that Hoak was “playing the victim” and using gambling as an excuse. Similarly, some considered that even if the reason was the one stated, users remained affected by his actions.
Problem gambling with cryptocurrencies is not a new issue in the community, as a user pointed out. A 2023 YouGov survey revealed that people in the UK “are experiencing harm from investing in cryptocurrencies and other high-risk trading products, experiencing similar difficulties that people report with gambling harms.”
It’s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are not related to or a cause of gambling addictions, but, as the UK’s Gambling Commission stated, “consumers who have a propensity to risk do perceive investing in these products as gambling.”

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin’s price surged by 7.50% to $66,350 amid the latest U.S. inflation data release. The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in April, down from 0.4% in March and February. This lower-than-expected increase suggests inflation is resuming its downward trend, bolstering financial market expectations for a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September.CPI Data and Its Economic Implications
The CPI data is significant as it indicates cooling inflation, which is a positive signal for the economy. The slower increase in consumer prices aligns with other data showing retail sales were flat in April, further suggesting a slowdown in domestic demand. This cooling demand is welcome news for Federal Reserve officials aiming to achieve a “soft landing” for the economy without triggering a recession.Key Inflation Drivers: Shelter and Gasoline CostsShelter costs, including rents, increased by 0.4% for the third consecutive month, and gasoline prices jumped by 2.8%. These two categories accounted for over 70% of the CPI increase. In contrast, food prices remained unchanged, with notable decreases in supermarket prices for items like eggs, which dropped by 7.3%.Year-over-year, the CPI increased by 3.4% in April, down slightly from 3.5% in March. This annual increase has slowed significantly from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Economists had forecast the CPI to rise by 0.4% on the month and 3.4% year-over-year, indicating that inflation is moderating.Dovish FOMC Stance Weakens DXY; Driving Bitcoin Price UpFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that although inflation is going down slowly, he expects it to continue moving downward towards the Fed’s 2% target. Financial markets now see a roughly 73% probability of a rate cut in September, up from 69% before the data release. Some economists even anticipate that the Fed may start lowering borrowing costs as early as July.The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate in the 5.25%–5.50% range since July, following a series of rate hikes totaling 525 basis points since March 2022. The expectation of a rate cut has positively impacted stock markets, with Wall Street trading higher, the dollar weakening against other currencies, and U.S. Treasury prices rising. This economic environment has fueled Bitcoin’s price rally as investors seek alternative assets amidst changing monetary policies.Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin is currently trading at $66,350, up 7.50%, according to a bullish Bitcoin price prediction. The 4-hour chart shows a strong bullish rally, with Bitcoin breaking out of a symmetrical triangle pattern around the $63,300 level.This breakout is confirmed by two significant bullish engulfing candles, indicating robust upward momentum.However, caution is warranted as recent candlestick formations, including Doji and spinning tops around the $66,200 level, suggest potential market indecision. These patterns, coupled with an overbought RSI of 78, could signal a forthcoming bearish correction.Bitcoin Price: Key Trading LevelsKey price levels to watch include the pivot point at $65,150, which serves as a crucial support level. Immediate resistance is found at $67,300, with further resistance at $68,545 and $70,000.On the downside, immediate support is at $63,300, followed by $61,560 and $60,185. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $62,565 also provides critical support, reinforcing the bullish trend.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewIf Bitcoin fails to sustain its upward trajectory, a pullback to the pivot point at $65,150 is likely, with further declines potentially reaching $63,300. The RSI being overbought suggests that a bearish correction may be imminent.Conclusion: The overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish above the $65,150 pivot point. However, a break below this level could trigger a sharp selling trend, targeting immediate support at $63,300.As Bitcoin experiences significant market movements, let’s dive into an exciting new opportunity in the crypto world.Sealana Presale

IOTA Launches New Testnet "IOTA 2.0" and Introduces PoS


Internet of Things blockchain ecosystem IOTA announced the launch of its “IOTA 2.0” testnet, which will improve the scalability and security of its ecosystem. 
IOTA’s new public testnet promises to be environmentally friendly by reducing its environmental impact and energy consumption. In doing so, it aims to attract companies focused on “green solutions.”
IOTA Launches New Testnet “IOTA 2.0”

IOTA announced that “IOTA 2” will enable the migration from Proof of Work (PoW) to a decentralized Proof of Stake (PoS), which will result in increased network scalability and efficiency.
The new testnet eliminated the central entity that previously managed consensus in the network and will now seek to combat the influence of “centralized figures” in the network. IOTA even promises to explore new concepts of efficiency and “genuine decentralization.”

“The new consensus mechanism is designed to improve the security of the network, making it more resistant to attacks and failures. This is crucial to gaining trust and expanding adoption in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and smart cities, where security is paramount,” IOTA said in a statement.

IOTA clarifies that its new restnet is a testbed for developers with no real-world value. It also clarifies that the 2.0 network could be subject to occasional reboots but with a “grace period.”
On social media, developers said the new IOTA testnet marks a milestone because it represents new opportunities for the decentralized finance ecosystem. Others said it has the potential to challenge Ethereum and achieve a market capitalization of $1 billion.

Some developers even commented that IOTA would come very close to solving the blockchain trilemma of scalability, decentralization, and security. Others predicted greater efficiency from the new testnet, as “you don’t do block after block after block.”

                        In a landmark case that has to be the first of its kind, two brothers, both graduates of the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), have been apprehended and charged with exploiting a vulnerability in the Ethereum blockchain. Their alleged actions resulted in a massive $25 million theft in 12 seconds. Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, face fraud and money laundering charges. A Well-Planned Exploit Of the Ethereum Blockchain By the Two BrothersFederal prosecutors in Manhattan filed the charges, describing the scheme as meticulously planned and executed with the precision of a high-stakes digital heist. “The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe,” said Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.The Peraire-Bueno brothers were arrested on Tuesday, with Anton being taken into custody in Boston and James in New York. They are expected to appear in federal court on Wednesday afternoon. The brothers’ lawyers have not yet commented on the charges.According to the US Justice Department, the brothers set up validators on the Ethereum network, which are intended to help order transactions and facilitate profitable trades through bots. However, they allegedly used their validators to deceive traders and secure access to pending transactions. This manipulation allowed them to alter the flow of electronic currency, effectively stealing the crypto. They then moved the stolen funds through complex transactions to obscure their origins.Over several months, the brothers meticulously planned their operation. They studied the trading patterns of Ethereum bots and established shell companies and identified cryptocurrency exchanges with lax ‘know your customer’ (KYC) procedures to launder their illicit gains. Their thoroughness even extended to researching extradition procedures, highlighting the depth of their preparation.Stolen Funds Going Up This Year
The heist is only the tip of the iceberg of ill-gotten crypto in recent years. United Nations sanctions monitors recently reported that North Korea laundered $147.5 million in stolen cryptocurrency through the Tornado Cash platform in March alone. A confidential document submitted to the U.N. Security Council sanctions committee revealed that North Korean suspects have been linked to 97 cyberattacks on crypto firms over the past seven years, amounting to approximately $3.6 billion. According to PeckShield, approximately $100 million of stolen cryptocurrency funds were successfully recovered in March, representing 52.8% of the total hacked amount. Despite initial losses of $187.29 million across over 30 hacking incidents, the Munchables incident was particularly notable. Following negotiations, the hacker returned the stolen funds, significantly contributing to the recovered amount. Meanwhile, a recent $71 million wallet impersonation scam resulted in an investor transferring 97% of their assets to a bait wallet address. The hacker swiftly converted the stolen Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) into approximately 23,000 ETH and began distributing the funds across multiple wallets after six days. In the first quarter of 2024, total losses from hacking and fraudulent activities reached approximately $336.3 million, down from $437.5 million in the same period in 2023. The quarter saw 46 hacking incidents and 15 cases of fraudulent activities. Ethereum was the most targeted blockchain, followed by the BNB Chain, with both networks accounting for 73% of the total losses. Major incidents included the $81.7 million exploit on Orbit Bridge and the $62 million Munchables hack, with a notable recovery of $73.9 million (22%) from seven exploits. Hacking incidents accounted for 95.6% of the losses, while scams and rug pulls comprised 4.4%.

FTX Customers Express Frustration Despite 118% Payouts In Bankruptcy Case-Here's Why | Bitcoinist.com


								Customers of the defunct FTX crypto exchange find themselves at the center of a complex bankruptcy case with potentially promising outcomes. 
While the process has been far from smooth, the recent surge in the crypto market has bolstered the value of FTX’s assets, resulting in the possibility of customers receiving payouts that exceed their initial investments. Still, there’s a catch for customers who have ignited discontent despite the exchange’s announcement of a full refund.
FTX Customers On The Brink Of Recovery
Following FTX’s downfall, affected customers, such as Arush Sehgal and Acaena Amoros Romero, saw their life savings vanish into the void. However, the subsequent rally in the crypto market, with FTX’s asset liquidation efforts and the discovery of scattered cash and crypto holdings, has transformed the bleak prospects into a potential success story. 
FTX’s newly appointed managers, led by Jonh Ray III, have found assets, including selling stakes in companies such as artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic, to make up for losses caused by the mismanagement of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund.

As previously reported, FTX expects to amass a substantial sum, potentially reaching $16.3 billion, after selling off assets. This exceeds the approximately $11 billion owed to customers and other private creditors, leaving most of them in line to receive 118% of their original FTX account value. 
However, government regulators are expected to receive only a fraction of their claims, while shareholders are likely to face complete wipeout, as is standard in bankruptcy proceedings.
The development has drawn attention as payouts surpass outcomes of other bankruptcies within the crypto space and beyond. Typically, creditors receive only a fraction of what they are owed, but FTX’s case is shaping to be an exception. The anticipated payouts, which constitute an unusually swift turnaround, are expected to commence later this year.
Frustrated Customers Rally Against Bankruptcy Plan
Yet, despite the positive outlook, some FTX customers remain dissatisfied with the proposed plan. According to Bloomberg, over 80 individuals have voiced their concerns in letters to the bankruptcy court, criticizing decisions made by FTX CEO John Ray, including the valuation of their accounts. 
Former creditor committee member Arush Sehgal has received support from approximately 1,500 individuals who share similar views, leading to the establishment of FTXvote—an initiative aimed at rallying opposition to the plan.
“A hundred cents on the dollar doesn’t mean much to me,” said Sehgal, a vocal critic of how restructuring advisors have handled the case. Sehgal and Romero say they stand to recoup about $1 million, a quarter of what their account would be worth. 

Nonetheless, the case’s ultimate resolution will depend on the upcoming vote by FTX account holders and US bankruptcy judge John Dorsey’s consideration of creditor comments.
Notwithstanding the discontent among certain customers, the bankruptcy process signifies a significant milestone in terms of the potential recovery for customers, even if not all expectations are met. 
Veno Bojanovsky, an affected customer, expressed skepticism about the outcome but chose to retain his claim rather than sell it off.

SEC custody rule made crypto regulation a ‘political football’ - Rep. Nickel

The United States securities regulator has turned crypto regulation into a “political football,” and its “open hostility” isn’t helping President Joe Biden, says Representative Wiley Nickel.In a May 15 letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, Nickel, a Democrat, claimed the regulator ran contrary to its mission to protect investors and breached its authority in trying to pass the controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, or SAB 121.SAB 121 is a proposed rule mandating that SEC-reporting entities custodying crypto must record those holdings as liabilities on their balance sheets.Nickel claims it would prevent American banks from being able to custody crypto exchange-traded products at scale — which creates a “concentration risk” by handing more control over to non-bank entities, The SEC’s “open hostility” toward the cryptocurrency industry “isn’t serving President Biden’s best interests,” he added.“The SEC is turning cryptocurrency regulation into a political football and forcing President Biden to choose sides on an issue that matters to many Americans,” the North Carolina Representative wrote.Source: Wiley NickelNickel wants Gensler to withdraw SAB 121 but he is confident the Senate in its May 16 vote on the matter will pass a resolution invalidating the SEC’s proposed rule.“I’m hopeful that this bipartisan, bicameral resolution will send a message: it’s time to adjust the SEC’s misguided approach to digital assets.”The House of Representatives voted to pass a bill overturning SAB 121 last week. The last stop for the bill before it could overturn the rule would be on Biden's desk — who has said he would veto the bill should it make it that far.Related: SEC’s Gary Gensler gets irked being asked about cryptoNickel is worried that SAB 121 could result in many U.S. investors seeking offshore custody solutions which could prove “riskier” in the long run.Many Republicans share his position, too, including U.S. Representative Tom Emmer, who said SAB 121 would make U.S. markets “less fair, less orderly and less efficient.”

                        Two South Korean police officers are standing trial over alleged bribery in an increasingly high-profile crypto fraud case.The newspaper Namdo Ilbo reported that on May 14, the Gwangju District Court’s Criminal Division began the trial of a 59-year-old superintendent police officer.The officer is named in reports as “A” for legal reasons. The court is also trying a 57-year-old police lieutenant (“B”) from the same station.
Crypto Fraud Case: South Korean Police Officers Implicated
The case centers around an alleged crypto fraudster surnamed Tak. The latter is accused of orchestrating an art-themed altcoin scam.Police think Tak duped several crypto-keen victims out of about $2.1 million worth of fiat and crypto.They have accused Tak of running a fake Ethereum (ETH) and NFT-related project.Officers think Tak convinced several citizens to invest in a bogus crypto-related company.When police and prosecution officials began investigating Tak, the latter hired a legal “broker” surnamed Seong (aged 62).Mobile police barriers on a South Korean street.Broker Paid Cash Bribes, Prosecutors Claim
Prosecutors told the court that Seong paid the superintendent over $7,300 in cash bribes “on two occasions” to promote B to a higher rank.The court heard that Seong met the superintendent police officer twice at restaurants on February 4 and 15.Both officers have been suspended from their posts for the duration of the trials.B first appeared in court on separate bribery charges, also related to the same case, in January this year.Seong appears to have created and fostered a network of contacts in the local police force, as well as the Gwangju and Mokpo prosecution services.The Mokpo Bridge in Mokpo, South Korea. (Source: Glabb [CC BY-SA 3.0])Tak has confessed to giving Seong money to bribe prosecution officials and police officers to help clear the name of the alleged crypto fraudster.But the plan appears to have unraveled fast. Last month, a Mokpo prosecutor was jailed for a year for accepting a bribe from Seong.The same court found the prosecution official guilty of taking money and favors in exchange for disclosing sensitive information about the case.
Crypto Fraud ‘Bribes’ Case: 18 More People Implicated
Seong has made a statement confessing to putting envelopes full of cash into both police officers’ “coat pockets” as these were hanging on pegs in the restaurant.A’s legal team disputed the allegations. It asked why Seong would make the promotion request in February, the month after the police force typically finalizes its list of promotion candidates.The legal team challenged the accuracy of the account during a witness cross-examination.The defense lawyers also asked Seong if he had explicitly asked the superintendent to promote his subordinate when handing over the alleged bribes.To this, Seong reportedly told the court that he “didn’t remember” much about the events of February 2022.He claimed that he was “in such a hurry” at the time that his recollections had become unclear.The court will reconvene on June 11. But more officers are set to face trial in the weeks and months ahead.The media outlet explained that the prosecution has indicted 18 people in connection with the case.This list “includes former and current prosecutors and police officials,” as well as “another broker,” Namdo Ilbo wrote.

Worldcoin’s Privacy Pivot: Iris Codes Deleted As Part Of Major Security Upgrade


								The Worldcoin Foundation has released a new open-source system to safeguard sensitive information more effectively.
This system, now accessible in a GitHub repository, allows any organization to adopt these advanced data protection measures.
The foundation highlighted that this initiative aims to establish a “new benchmark” in data security, particularly for biometric data.
The transition to this innovative system has led the Worldcoin Foundation to delete the iris codes previously collected during user registration.

Notably, participants in the Worldcoin project initially had their eyeballs scanned by specialized Orb devices to verify their identity and receive WLD tokens, the project’s cryptocurrency. This process was part of the foundation’s effort to create a unique digital identification for each user.
Secure Multi-Party Computation And User Privacy
The foundation’s new system is based on secure multi-party computation (SMPC), a subset of cryptography that enhances data protection by distributing a single secret across multiple parties.
This method increases the security of stored information by ensuring that the complete data set is never held in a single location, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches.
The Worldcoin Foundation, in collaboration with technologists from TACEO and Tools for Humanity, has developed a new implementation of SMPC that addresses previous limitations related to scale and cost.
This development is particularly pertinent as the requirement for individuals to provide biometric data to various organizations becomes more common. The Worldcoin Foundation stressed the growing need to protect users’ data securely against potential threats and misuse.
Meanwhile, prior to this development, Worldcoin was scrutinized by regulatory bodies across several nations, particularly due to concerns over its data collection practices.
For instance, Hong Kong’s Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data took investigative actions against the project earlier in the year, citing privacy concerns. This backdrop makes the foundation’s move to delete iris codes and enhance privacy measures even more noteworthy.
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has previously praised Worldcoin’s efforts to improve privacy. He lauded the project’s “data-minimal” approach and its ability to surpass traditional, centralized authentication solutions in safeguarding user privacy.
Looking Ahead: Worldcoin’s Strategic Expansion
Worldcoin is also preparing for the launch of World Chain, an open-source Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, set to debut in mid-2024. This platform aims to “revolutionize” human authentication by integrating with the Worldcoin protocol and providing a dedicated infrastructure to transition from existing networks.
The protocol has demonstrated significant adoption, with over 5 million people from 160 countries registered and 49 million transactions through verified wallets.
The upcoming World Chain seeks to enhance scalability, support a growing user base, and foster a stronger ecosystem for the project.
This effort includes addressing the challenges posed by automated transactions, which constitute approximately 80% of all blockchain activity and often lead to network congestion.
According to the report, the Worldcoin team is also trying to safely increase the L2 block gas limit, supported by research into performance scenarios to ensure a secure and inclusive ecosystem.

Bitcoin crosses $66K as traders eye 2 key indicators for $70K target

Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 7.54% in the past 24 hours and pushed past $65,000 amid positive United States inflation data with traders now keeping an eye on two key indicators for a potential rise to $70,000.Pseudonymous crypto trader Blockchain Mane told Cointelegraph they are closely observing the Gann Fans model — a key indicator which analyzes the geometric and cyclical movement of the crypto market — to see if Bitcoin can “remain bullish.”“Gann Fans are interesting, almost like a time and price momentum indicator,” they said, explaining it helps to better visualize the market cycles and price action.The Gann square consists of a 5x5 grid, column 1 is the start of the cycle. Source: Blockchain Mane“In terms of Gan timing, we are at a pivot in the market cycle, directly in the center of the current square. if we pivot to the upside, then we can see a markup phase until the end of May,” they explained.However, they warned, “if we lose this break then we will probably see the sideways, downtrend continuation until the end of May.”The pattern has stood out to the Blockchain Mane on the same day that core inflation fell to its lowest levels since 2021, at just 3.6% — potentially strengthening the case for interest rate cuts.Blockchain Mane is now looking for Bitcoin to flip its “previous resistance” price level of $63,000 to become its new support level, claiming this will be a “bullish indicator.”Bitcoin is currently trading at $66,085. Source: CoinMarketCapThey would rather see “sideway price action” here while more narratives build up, otherwise, they claim it may hinder the potential for altcoins to gain.“If BTC pumps here and gets rejected, Alts will probably get hammered as Bitcoin’s dominance continues to rise, Alts are becoming more and more glued to BTC price action.”Bitcoin’s dominance — the ratio of Bitcoin’s market cap compared to the total market cap of all other cryptocurrencies — has risen 2.23% to 55.99% over the past seven days, according to TradingView data.Related: Bitcoin selling pressure to ease? M2 money supply flips positiveMeanwhile, the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern — a bullish indicator signaling the downtrend is easing and buyers are gaining market dominance — is one of the indicators showing that Bitcoin is due “for a bounce,” pseudonymous crypto trader Milkybull Crypto told his X followers on May 15.Source: Milkybull CryptoThe inverse head-and-shoulders pattern forms as a reversal setup and includes an “inverted” head and shoulders, with the left and right shoulders upside down below the neckline. If the pattern continues, Bitcoin’s price could reach its next key price level of $70,000 before potentially breaking its current all-time high price of $74,580, according to Milkybull Crypto.This represents an approximate 12% jump from its current price of $66,085, according to CoinMarketCap data.Magazine: UK cannabis millionaire’s legal ‘deals on wheels’ via cryptoThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Bitcoin ETF 13F filings 'just a down payment' on BTC: Exec - AMBCrypto



So far, professional investment firms own about $3 billion of BTC ETFs.
Bitwise exec term $3B as a ‘down payment’ as allocation will increase in 6 months. 

Despite the discouraging market choppiness, Bitcoin’s [BTC] future seems bright and full of unimaginable potential. 
According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, flows to BTC ETFs could surge as large firms increase their allocation in the next six months. 
Hougan maintained an uber-bullish stance on BTC’s future after many confirmed professional firms held BTC ETFs after recent 13F filings. 
“I find the 13F filings for Bitcoin ETFs extraordinarily bullish for the long-term future of Bitcoin.” 
It has been challenging to know the buyers or sellers of spot BTC ETFs that debuted in January. However, the 13F filings have solved the problem. 
The 13F filings, filed every quarter, are one of the SEC’s requirements for investors holding more than $100 million in AUM (assets under management) to report their holdings publicly. 
For instance, the Boston-based Bracebridge Capital reportedly bought $262 million of Fidelity’s BTC ETF (ARKB) based on the filings. 
Why the 13F filings are a bullish case for Bitcoin
Since their January debut, the spot BTC ETFs have seen $11.8 billion in cumulative net flow and over $50 billion in net assets, per SoSo Value data. 
Based on recent 13F filings as of last Thursday, professional investment firms owned $3.5 billion of spot BTC ETFs, per Bitwise exec. 
Part of Bitwise CIO statement on the filing read, 
“All told, 563 professional investment firms reported owning $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin ETFs as of last Thursday. By the time the May 15 filing deadline arrives, I suspect we may end up with 700+ professional firms and total AUM approaching $5 billion.” 
Bloomberg ETF analyst called the above huge number of BTC large-scale investors ‘bonkers.’
“What is also notable IMO is the sheer number of holders that each has so far.. $IBIT is up to 250. That’s bonkers for the first quarter on mkt.”
According to Huogan, the large-scale professional investment firms holding BTC ETFs were comparable to none, except the gold ETFs in late 2004. 
However, retail investors owned more BTC ETFs than large-scale firms. Hougan noted that the investment firms owned about $3-$5 billion of BTC ETFs, about 7-10% of the ETF’s  $50 billion in total assets. 
But Hougan argued that professional investors could soon eclipse retail investors. Hougan noted that professional investors are testing out things before exposing their clients. 
According to the Bitwise exec, the next step will involve professional investors allocating for a ‘few clients’ before going to a platform-wide allocation ranging from ‘1-5% of the portfolio’ in the next six months. 
It meant the amount declared in the 13F filings could increase in the next six months, making the current declarations a ‘down payment.’
‘This tells me that the allocations we see in recent 13F filings are just a down payment.’
If Hougan’s outline comes true for professional investment firms, we could see an increase in flows from large firms in the second half of 2024. This could potentially bolster BTC prices over the same period.

Vanguard’s new boss says Bitcoin ETF not on the table: Report

The new chief executive of United States investment giant Vanguard has said he won’t reverse the company’s decision to not launch a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund.Vanguard’s new CEO, Salim Ramji — the former head of BlackRock’s global ETF business — told Barron’s in an interview published May 15 that Vanguard stands for consistency and crypto-related investment products do not align with its “investment philosophy.” “I think it’s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer,” said Ramji. “I have heard [chief investment officer] Greg Davis’ explanation and I think it is entirely consistent with Vanguard’s investment philosophy. It is a logical and consistent point of view.”Ramji oversaw the launch of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF in January, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has amassed $18 billion in assets under management.He has openly expressed his interest in crypto and his move to Vanguard had industry watchers speculating on what changes he would make at the firm.Salim Ramji. Source: VanguardAlongside BlackRock’s ETF launch, its rivals including Fidelity and nine other investment managers also launched spot Bitcoin funds which have together seen over $12 billion in net inflows.Vanguard, with its $8.6 trillion in AUM, opted for a different approach and didn’t launch a Bitcoin ETF — viewing crypto as a speculative investment and an immature asset class.Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a May 15 X post he doesn’t believe Ramji would usher in a Vanguard spot Bitcoin ETF.Seyffart said, however, that Ramji might reverse the firm’s position to not allow its clients to buy other spot Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform.Vanguard’s outgoing CEO, Tim Buckley, said in March that he didn’t believe a Bitcoin ETF belongs in a long-term portfolio of someone saving for their retirement as it’s a speculative asset.His comments followed pressure from customers after the launch of the Bitcoin ETFs from rival firms.Related: JPMorgan reports holding shares of several spot Bitcoin ETFsIn January, a number of Vanguard clients threatened to close their accounts over the firm blocking access to spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Ethereum Price Recovery Trails Behind Bitcoin's Surge in Crypto Rebound


																Ethereum price recovered above the $2,920 resistance. ETH is trailing Bitcoin and might struggle to continue higher above the $3,050 resistance.

Ethereum started a recovery wave and even climbed above $3,000.
The price is trading above $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).
The pair could now struggle to clear the $3,040 and $3,050 resistance levels.

Ethereum Price Recovers Nearly 5%
Ethereum price remained stable above the $2,860 support zone and started a fresh increase. ETH gained nearly 5% but less than Bitcoin. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.
The bulls pumped the price above the $2,950 and $3,000 levels. A new weekly high was formed at $3,039 and the price is now consolidating gains. It tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $2,860 swing low to the $3,039 high.

Are Dips Supported In ETH?
If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,050 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,000 level. The first major support is near the $2,950 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $2,860 swing low to the $3,039 high.
The next support is near the $2,930 level. A clear move below the $2,930 support might push the price toward $2,900. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,860 level in the near term.

Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL) to Skyrocket 13,000% as BitMart Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because DOGESOL has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on BitMart.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Baby Doge on Sol can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Baby Doge on Sol could become the next viral memecoin.



Baby Doge on Sol launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Baby Doge on Sol on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the BitMart listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Baby Doge on Sol by entering its contract address – G5GEMyeea1HqS2KnpazPiMuTy3sqS1UdQegsbNLGpF7U – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGESOL.

Toncoin beats Bitcoin with stunning 160% gain, but there's a catch - AMBCrypto



TON has gained over 160% more than BTC so far.
TON has also seen more activity in some on-chain metrics.

Toncoin [TON] has emerged as the only Layer 1 Network capable of competing effectively with Bitcoin [BTC] since the beginning of the year. 
TON has outpaced BTC by over 160% and boasts a higher number of active addresses. 
Despite these achievements, traders appear to lack confidence in TON, as sentiment surrounding the coin has turned negative.
Toncoin gains more than 100% over Bitcoin
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Bitcoin and Toncoin’s price trends revealed that Toncoin had outpaced BTC in terms of gains. 
TON, starting the year at around $2.3, has experienced substantial uptrends in recent months, reaching approximately $6.8 at the time of writing. 
Utilizing the price range tool, it was evident that TON had surged by over 200% from the year’s beginning to press time. 
Source: TradingView
Conversely, BTC began the year at approximately $44,220 and had risen to around $62,400. This represented a growth of about 42% during the same period.
 Comparing the charts, Toncoin exhibited nearly 160% more growth than BTC.
Source: TradingView
Furthermore, analysis of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated that BTC was below the neutral line at the time of assessment, suggesting a bear trend. 
In contrast, Toncoin’s RSI was above 60, signaling a strong bull trend.
Toncoin sees more active addresses than Bitcoin
Analysis of Toncoin’s active addresses over the last 30 days has revealed a surge in activity, surpassing that of Bitcoin. 
From March onwards, Toncoin’s active addresses began to climb steadily, peaking in May and maintaining this heightened level. 
Starting from around 1,000 active addresses in March, Toncoin has now surpassed 10,000 active addresses, with over 10,800 recorded at the time of writing.
Source: Santiment
In contrast, Bitcoin’s active addresses metric, while having higher overall numbers, has been on a declining trend.
 On the 15th of April, Bitcoin recorded nearly 16 million active addresses, but this number had decreased to around 12.6 million by press time. 
This comparison highlighted that although Bitcoin has a larger number of active addresses overall, Toncoin was experiencing more activity and growth in relative terms.
Bitcoin edges Toncoin in sentiment
AMBCrypto’s look at Bitcoin’s Funding Rate on Coinglass indicated a positive sentiment at press time. 
Despite a slight decline, it remained around 0.0018%, suggesting that buyers continued to dominate the trend.

Conversely, Toncoin’s Funding Rate revealed a negative sentiment. At the time of writing, the Funding Rate was around -0.047%, indicating a prevalence of sellers in the market. 
These metrics reflected a scenario where more participants were betting on an increase in Bitcoin’s price. At the same time, Toncoin had a higher number of traders taking short positions.

Bitcoin Selling On Coinbase Fizzles: Short-Term Jump Soon?


								Data shows that Bitcoin selling pressure on the crypto exchange Coinbase is decreasing, which could be conducive to a short-term bounce.
Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Is Approaching Neutral Mark Again
As analyst Maartunn explained in a post on X, the Coinbase Premium Gap has risen since plunging into negative territory yesterday. The “Coinbase Premium Gap” here refers to a metric that tracks the difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).
When the value of this indicator is positive, it means the cryptocurrency price listed on Coinbase is greater than on Binance right now. Such a trend implies the buying pressure is higher (or the selling pressure is lower) on the former than on the latter.

On the other hand, a negative value would suggest that the selling pressure on Coinbase may be higher than on Binance, as the asset is trading for a lower value on the exchange.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past few weeks:

As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has been negative for the past few days, suggesting Coinbase users have been selling more heavily than Binance ones.
Coinbase is popularly known to be the preferred platform for US-based institutional investors, while Binance hosts global traffic. As such, the premium’s value can tell us about the behavior of American whales.
The recent negative values of the indicator would naturally imply that these large entities have been participating in some selling. From the chart, it’s visible that these investors also showed similar behavior earlier.
When the selling finally dropped off, and the Coinbase Premium Gap flipped, the cryptocurrency’s price rebounded in the short term. Over the past day, the indicator has shown a similar trend, as its value has now approached the neutral mark.
This may imply that the institutional traders could be done with their selling for now. “This could potentially create some short-term upside opportunity,” notes the analyst.

In some other news, the Bitcoin Open Interest, a measure of the total amount of derivatives-related positions currently open for the asset, has seen an alarming spike during the last few hours, as Maartunn has pointed out in another X post.

Generally, an increase in open interest can lead to higher volatility in Bitcoin prices. This 9% rise has come so suddenly, so a violent liquidation event may be coming for the cryptocurrency.

XRP Price Shows Signs of Recovery Within Range: Can it Spark a Rally?


																XRP price is attempting a fresh increase above the $0.5050 resistance. The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.520 resistance.

XRP is eyeing a steady move above the $0.520 level.
The price is now trading above $0.5120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There was a break above a short-term declining channel with resistance at $0.5025 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could start another increase if there is a close above the $0.520 resistance.

XRP Price Eyes Breakout
Yesterday, we saw how XRP price started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price was able to settle above the $0.4950 and $0.50 resistance levels.
There was a break above a short-term declining channel with resistance at $0.5025 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even cleared the $0.5150 resistance level and settled above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
It traded as high as $0.5195 and is currently consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4980 swing low to the $0.5195 high. The price is also trading above $0.5120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

Immediate resistance is near the $0.5185 level. The first key resistance is near $0.5200. A close above the $0.5200 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5220. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.5220 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.5350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.550 resistance.
Another Decline?
If XRP fails to clear the $0.520 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5145 level. The next major support is at $0.5120.
If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5120 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could even drop below the $0.5050 support zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4980 swing low to the $0.5195 high.
Technical Indicators
Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.
Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

Ripple and Evmos to Build XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain


Ripple announced its collaboration with Cosmos’ Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based protocol, Evmos, to build an XRP Ledger EVM sidechain. In this partnership, they will also collaborate with crypto software company Peersyst.
The XRP Ledger (XRPL) sidechain will be built on the evmOS solution, with which they will seek to prioritize native Web3 enterprise applications and their compatibility with EVM.
Ripple and Evmos to Build XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain

evmOS is a modular, production-ready solution that supports EVM and web3 enterprises. It is built with Cosmos SDK, allowing projects to customize their logic and go beyond standard smart contract platforms.
The sidechain will give Web3 companies access to over 60 Cosmos SDK, Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), CometBFT consensus engine strings, and the DApp Store. Building the sidechain also involved interconnecting the user community, DApps, and a network of more than 90 connected chains.
Read more: How To Buy XRP and Everything You Need To Know
XRPL will be connected to the blockchain through IBC. In addition, XRP users can access DApps such as Orbinal Apes, Forge, Osmosis, and Stride, among others.
Now, the XRPL community will have a “passport” to all the chains, while users can browse any application seamlessly. It is important to note that XRPL has a relatively large user base, which is evident from its native token’s, XRP, market capitalization of $27 billion. 

“Bringing the XRPL EVM sidechain to the interchain with evmOS represents a significant milestone in expanding the XRPL ecosystem. By leveraging evmOS technology we can offer developers unparailleled flavibility and customization options, enabling them to build innovative cross-chain applications that tap into the vast potential of the XRPL and the broader interchain ecosystem,” Jasmine Cooper, Head of DeFi Product at Ripple, explained.

Additionally, Evmos pledges $5 million in grant funding to the XRPL blockchain. To this end, it called on developers “who are aligned with Evmos’ values” to join the ecosystem.


“Thanks to Evmos, the XRP Army joins the open, scalable, and interconnected economy of the future: the interchain. Learn more about Ripple x Evmos and how evmOS leverages Interchain Stack components to unlock a modular-interchain EVM solution,” the Cosmos team commented.

Following the announcement, the price of XRP rose by more than 2 percent, from $0.49 to $0.52. At the time of writing, XRP is now trading at $0.51. Similarly, the Cosmos’s native token, ATOM, increased from $8 to $8.41.

Following JPMorgan & Wells Fargo, $12 Billion Boston Hedge Fund Bets Big on Bitcoin with Spot ETF Investment | Cryptoglobe


                                
Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund managing roughly $12 billion in assets, has revealed a significant investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) totaling $363 million across three funds.



According to a recent analysis from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, Bracebridge Capital has added exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin via the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC).







Notably, Bracebridge is known for managing endowment funds for prestigious institutions like Yale and Princeton Universities. The move highlights growing institutional interest in Bitcoin after the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, with major financial institutions investing in these.



The disclosure comes amid several others, with the U.S. state of Wisconsin recently becoming the first local government entity to reveal an investment in Bitcoin after purchasing 94,562 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), worth nearly $100 million, in the first quarter of the year.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The move sees the state of Wisconsin join several Wall Street giants, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, in revealing BTC exposure through investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to 13F filings.



JPMorgan revealed an investment of $731,246 in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC, while Wells Fargo disclosed $141,817 in GBTC holdings. BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon have also made similar disclosures.



BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin in the first quarter of the year as well by purchasing shares of IBIT.

This Is How Many New Tokens and Meme Coins Have Emerged on Ethereum and Solana Since Apr 1


																Since the beginning of April, more than a million new tokens have been created, with over 370,000 appearing on Ethereum, owing to activity on Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, Base.
Solana leads with the creation of over 640,000 new tokens, primarily meme coins.
Base Sees Increased User Activity
According to the data shared by Coinbase director Conor Grogan, 372,642 new tokens have been launched on the Ethereum network alone since April 1, with 88% of them on Coinbase’s Layer 2 blockchain, Base.
This surge in activity on the Layer 2 network is driven by users flocking to the low-cost platform to create new meme coins. Interestingly, the number of tokens created on Ethereum in this short period is double the total number launched between 2015 and 2023.
Base experienced a revival in user activity this quarter. This is evident in Franklin Templeton’s recent report which highlighted that the blockchain has gained substantial traction from SocialFi applications like Friend.Tech. It found that several leading crypto-based social applications are being built on the Layer 2 network.




In fact, Base processes around 46% of all SocialFi transactions, making this sector vital for the network’s adoption and growth, according to the asset manager’s statistics.
Data from L2BEAT further revealed that Base is currently positioned as the third largest Ethereum Layer 2 network boasting $5.48 billion in total value locked (TVL).
New users on Base have been consistently increasing since the beginning of the year but gained notable traction after March. Dune Analytics’ data indicated that the daily user count on the network increased from 4.6 million in March to 8.9 million in May, reflecting a 92.86% increase in just two months.
Solana’s Meme Coin Explosion
Meme coins made up the majority of the 643,227 new tokens created on Solana during the same period. Some of them that have posted massive gains are dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), and Slerf (SLERF), among others.
Besides spot Bitcoin ETF hype, meme coin mania has played a crucial role in the current market cycle. Many industry players have touted this cycle as “bizarre” as a result. However, most of these tokens have since collapsed or become worthless, with meme coin scams rife not just on Solana but also on Base.
Meanwhile, CryptoQuant co-founder Ki Young Ju recently warned against the meme coin hype, asserting that these assets often overshadow the efforts of dedicated teams working on legitimate products that could propel industry progress.

Blockchain ID project Humanity Protocol hits unicorn status with $30M raise

Decentralized identity solution Humanity Protocol is officially a unicorn after a recent $30 million raise lifted its valuation to $1 billion. The $30 million Seed Round was led by Kingsway Capital, with participation from Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com, Hashed, Shima Capital and 20 other investors, Humanity Protocol wrote in a May 15 Medium post.wHumanity Protocol plans to use the funds to expand its product development unit as the firm prepares for its public testnet launch in the second half of 2024. The project scans user’s palms and claims to secure their digital identities on a blockchain by integrating zero-knowledge technology and “proof-of-humanity” — a consensus mechanism used to confirm the user is human and not an AI bot.Source: Humanity ProtocolHumanity Protocol hopes its palm scanning will be viewed as a less invasive alternative to its iris scanning rival Worldcoin by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.Despite its controversial approach, which has seen Worldcoin banned in multiple countries over privacy concerns, it has already amassed 10 million users.Humanity Protocol’s waitlist, meanwhile, has seen over half a million people sign up since it emerged from stealth one month ago.Related: How a decentralized AI movement is shaping a fairer futureTerence Kwok launched the Humanity Protocol through the Human Institute in February 2023.Kwok is receiving assistance from Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu and Polygon Labs, which helped Humanity Protocol build a testnet in February this year.As powerful as decentralized ID solution can be, Siu says it is crucial to ensure they’re not “too invasive, complicated, or cumbersome,” particularly when users sign up in the onboarding process.Competition in the blockchain-based identity market continues to ramp up amid a surge in data breaches in an increasingly AI-driven world. IT Governance data shows 8.2 billion documents were breached from 2,814 incidents reported in 2023. Kwok’s firm claims user information will be stored in a “decentralized manner” which won’t be owned by anyone but the user.

Q1 Bitcoin ETF holders: 1500 institutes reported, Millennium leads with nearly $2 billion in holdings - Crypto Briefing




Yesterday marked the deadline for investment firms managing over $100 million in Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares to disclose their holdings, and the data shows that these newly launched ETF products are attracting significant interest from institutional players.According to combined data from Fintel, over 1500 investment firms disclosed total ownership of around $10.6 billion in these ETFs. Of the ten spot Bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) are the top choices for professional investors.Hedge fund giant Millennium Management leads the pack with $1.97 billion worth of Bitcoin ETF shares, according to a recent 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The fund’s investment portfolio includes $844 million shares in iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), over $800 million in the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), about $202 million in Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), and close to $45 million each in ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust (BITB).However, the filing reveals that these holdings only account for 3% of Millennium’s $64 billion assets under management.Other top Bitcoin ETF holders in Q1 following Millennium were Susquehanna International Group ($1.1 billion), Bracebridge Capital ($404 million), Boothbay Fund Management ($303 million), and Morgan Stanley ($251 million).Breaking Records for New ETFsAccording to Bitwise’s CIO Matt Hougan, the investment trend in Bitcoin ETFs is gaining momentum. The current level of institutional ownership is unprecedented for a new ETF. Traditionally, most ETFs see minimal participation from large investors in their initial months.For instance, the gold ETF launch in late 2004 was considered wildly successful, amassing over $1 billion in its first five days. However, even at its first 13F filing, only 95 professional firms held positions in the gold ETF. By comparison, Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a historic surge in terms of the sheer number of institutional investors involved.While professional investors currently hold an estimated 20% of the total Bitcoin ETF assets, retail investors still dominate the landscape. However, Hougan noted that these early institutional allocations could be just the tip of the iceberg as institutional engagement deepens.“…the allocations we see in recent 13F filings are just a down payment. Hightower Advisors may have $68 million allocated to bitcoin ETFs today, for instance, which is great, but it’s just 0.05% of their assets. If they follow the pattern outlined above, that allocation will build over time. And to put it in context, a 1% allocation of their portfolio to bitcoin would equate to $1.2 billion—all from a single firm,” Hougan stated.“Multiply that by the growing number of professional investors participating in the space, and you can begin to see what’s behind my enthusiasm,” he added.

Tether Scandal: Chinese Authorities Uncover Alleged $2B USDT Money Laundering Operation | Bitcoinist.com


								Chinese law enforcement agencies have announced a breakthrough in their fight against illegal financial activities. They have dismantled a large underground banking gang allegedly involved in facilitating illegal transactions using Tether’s USDT stablecoin. 
The operation spans multiple provinces and is believed to have enabled over $2 billion worth of illicit USDT transactions. 
193 Suspects Arrested In Tether-Linked Banking Scandal
According to local media reports, the Chengdu Municipal Public Security Bureau uncovered a significant underground banking case involving a staggering 13.8 billion yuan ($1.9 billion). 
The operation was spread across 26 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. 193 suspects have been arrested nationwide, with public security agencies in each jurisdiction filing 58 cases. Authorities have also frozen 149 million yuan in funds associated with the operation.

The investigation was initiated in November 2022 when the Longquanyi District Branch identified suspicious fund settlements through underground banks, indicating potential engagement in illegal foreign exchange activities. 
The Chengdu Municipal Public Security Bureau reportedly formed a task force of various departments, including economic investigation, cyber security, legal affairs, and technical investigation. 
On June 1, 2023, the task force coordinated arrest operations in Shanghai, Changsha, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Fuzhou, Jinhua, and other locations under the command of the Ministry of Public Security and the Public Security Department. 
As a result, 25 criminal suspects, including Lin, Weng, and Chen, were apprehended, and significant evidence, such as bank cards and payment instruments, was seized.
$1.9 Billion Illegal Scheme Unveiled
The investigation revealed that the criminal gang, led by Lin, Weng, Chen, and others, primarily operated within the import and export business sector. Authorities further claim that they allegedly exploited USDT as a medium to provide illegal services to customers seeking to transfer funds abroad. 
Their activities primarily involved illegal foreign exchange, payment, and settlement businesses, which reportedly facilitated the smuggling of drugs and cosmetics, overseas asset purchases, and fraudulent tax refund schemes. 
According to the report, Tether’s use of stablecoin allegedly allowed it to evade national foreign exchange supervision, posing “substantial risks” to foreign exchange security and financial management.
By reportedly utilizing USDT and collaborating with other companies for fund settlements, the gang engaged in various criminal activities, including financial fraud, job-related crimes, drug management obstruction, smuggling of prohibited goods, credit card fraud, and export tax refund fraud.
Crack Down On Criminal Operations
Tether has swiftly cracked down on criminal operations utilizing its digital currency in response to allegations of its involvement in illicit activities. Paolo Ardoino, the firm’s CEO, has consistently emphasized the company’s commitment to combating illicit activity and has called Tether “the dumbest choice for doing illicit activity.” 

Recently, Tether also took a decisive step to combat illicit activity by freezing approximately $5.2 million USDT. The action was taken in response to crypto tracking and compliance platform MistTrack findings. 
The platform identified 12 Ethereum addresses associated with phishing operations, which threatened users and the integrity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 
Tether has also implemented new security measures aimed at preventing illicit financial activities. In collaboration with Chainalysis, a crypto tracking and compliance platform, the stablecoin issuer has developed a tool specifically designed to monitor secondary markets. This enables Tether to detect and address any suspicious or unauthorized transactions promptly.

Examining how Bitcoin ETFs drove Galaxy Digital's 40% hike - AMBCrypto



Galaxy Digital’s net income jumped 40%, with the same attributed to spot Bitcoin ETFs’ impact
Galaxy Trading also saw a hike in revenue and volumes

Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. has emerged as a significant player in the financial realm after seeing a surge in net income by 40% to $422 million. Interestingly, analysts are attributing this growth to the impact of spot Bitcoin [BTC] Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). 
In fact, the upward trajectory coincided with a notable resurgence in net inflows observed in spot Bitcoin ETFs on 14 May, following four consecutive weeks of outflows. According to reports, there were total inflows of $116.8 million last week, indicating renewed interest among investors.
Good day for Bitcoin 
These inflows might have had an impact on the price action of Bitcoin too. After flashing all reds over the past week, Bitcoin, at press time, was recovering on the charts following a 6% hike in 24 hours. 
The same was confirmed by the Relative Strength Index climbing close to the 50-level on the charts.
Providing further insights into Galaxy Digital’s Q1 results, analyst Joseph Vafi noted, 
“Spot bitcoin ETF approvals have been a major catalyst for the increase in counterparty engagement as some of the more traditional asset managers and hedge funds are entering/reentering the space.” 
According to the firm’s first-quarter report, 
“Trading reported counterparty trading revenue of $66 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by increased revenue from derivatives and favorable asset price movements.” 
Galaxy Digital’s Q1 report 
The report further claimed that counterparty trading volumes appreciated by 78%, compared to the prior quarter. This, while the average loan book size expanded to $664 million. 
This underlines the increasing importance of platforms like Galaxy Trading in facilitating digital asset exchange and investment. 
Additionally, Galaxy posted a record Bitcoin mining revenue of $31.5 million, a 69% hike from the previous quarter.
Source: Alyssa Choo/X
Here, it’s worth noting that the company mined 373 bitcoins at an average cost of less than $19,500 per Bitcoin, highlighting its efficiency in its mining processes.
Remarking on the same, Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, said, 
“Our first-quarter results underscore the strength and resilience of our business model.” 
In conclusion, while optimism prevails, market uncertainties remain unpredictable. However, the launch of the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, along with two new XTrackers Exchange Traded Commodities in partnership with DWS Group, paints a promising path forward for the firm.

Bitcoin ETF Flows Surge to Two-Week High as BTC Soared Beyond $66,000


																Inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States soared to $303 million on May 15 amid a big jump in BTC prices.
It is the highest inflow since May 3 as institutional inventors pivoted back to bullish in the wake of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on May 15 which met expectations.
Fidelity led the pack with its FBTC fund seeing $131 million in inflows for the day, its highest inflow since March 26. Bitwise’s BITB fund also had a solid day with an inflow of $86 million, a figure not beaten since March 4.
BlackRock’s IBIT fund saw its third consecutive trading day of zero flows, but experts have previously explained that this is perfectly normal for a fund of this nature.
Spot ETFs Surge
Even Grayscale’s GBTC saw an inflow with $27 million returning to its flagship BTC fund following four months of outflows.


Additionally, the latest US Security and Exchange Commission filings show that one of the world’s largest hedge funds, Millennium Management, holds a whopping $2 billion spot Bitcoin ETF portfolio.
This was commented on by prominent ETF analysts, with James Seyffart quipping, “It’s only retail traders buying the Bitcoin ETFs.”
The portfolio is comprised of $844.2 million in BlackRock’s IBIT, $806.7 million in Fidelity’s FBTC, $202 million in Grayscale’s GBTC, $45.0 million in Ark’s ARKB, and $44.7 million in Bitwise’s BITB.
Millennium is now the largest holder of IBIT and FBTC. The hedge fund led by billionaire Izzy Englander has more than $64 billion in assets under management.


May 15 was the deadline for institutional investment firms to file their quarterly 13F report with the SEC for their positions held as of the end of Q1.
Another major hedge fund, Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital, disclosed a stake of nearly $12 million in IBIT, and Apollo Management Holdings disclosed a stake of $53 million in ARK 21Shares’ ARKB.
BTC Tapped $66,000
The big ETF inflow day came amid big gains for bitcoin’s price. The asset has surged 7% over the past 24 hours, tapping $66,567 during early trading in Asia on Thursday morning.
BTC was changing hands for $65,900 at the time of writing, following a gain of 15% over the past fortnight, bringing it to just 10% from its all-time high.
Crypto markets reacted to the April CPI data in the US, which came in lower than expected at 0.3%.
The report is a key indicator of inflationary trends, and it has increased the likelihood of the Federal Reserve reducing rates and injecting more liquidity into markets, which is good news for high-risk assets such as crypto.

Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) Will Explode 17,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 17,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DIAPAWS will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Diamond Paws.



Currently, Diamond Paws can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DIAPAWS on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Diamond Paws by entering its contract address – HCEn3J1sKqMqPxrQDE33rGhJvyXh4r3YgyzD2wiAm3ga – in the receiving field.




DIAPAWS currently has a market cap of just under $16,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Futures Exchange Giant CME Plans To Kick Off Bitcoin Trading


According to a Thursday report by the Financial Times, Chicago-based futures exchange CME Group is on track to launch Bitcoin spot trading due to growing demand.  It is unclear when spot Bitcoin trading will become available on the exchange since the plan is yet to be finalized. It is worth noting that CME Group has long been a major player in the crypto market. It initially launched Bitcoin futures in December 2017, a move that coincided with the peak of the bull run. In May 2021, it also launched micro Bitcoin futures, responding to demand for futures contracts of smaller size. According to data provided by CoinGlass, CME is currently in the lead when it comes to Bitcoin futures open interest with $9 billion. It is ahead of such major crypto native players as Binance, OKX, and BitMEX. In early 2020, CME also launched Bitcoin options on its futures contracts. CME comes in second place in terms of options value, significantly lagging behind Deribit. The growing demand for spot trading comes after the launch of several spot ETFs earlier this year. According to the most recent data, spot Bitcoin ETFs managed to attract $303 million worth of inflows on Wednesday.

Millennium Discloses $2 Billion Bitcoin ETF Holdings for Q1 2024


Millennium Management, a global investment firm with over $60 billion in assets, has disclosed its significant Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings for the first quarter of 2024.
According to a recent 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Millennium holds approximately $1.9 billion in various US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Institutional Bitcoin ETF Investments Surge

The firm’s largest holdings include BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). In addition, Millennium holds smaller stakes in the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Specifically, the filing details Millennium’s investments as $844.2 million in IBIT, $806.7 million in FBTC, $202 million in GBTC, $45 million in ARKB, and $44.7 million in BITB.

Other prominent asset managers are also increasing their Bitcoin ETF holdings. Pine Ridge reported $205 million in IBIT, FBTC, and BITB. Meanwhile, Schonfeld Strategic Advisors disclosed $248 million in IBIT and $231.8 million in FBTC, totaling $479 million.
Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, highlighted the significant trend of institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs. According to Hougan, approximately 563 professional investment firms reported owning $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs last Thursday. By the filing deadline, he anticipates that the market may see over 700 professional firms and total assets under management (AUM) approaching $5 billion.

“This is absolutely massive. For any financial advisor, family office, or institution wondering if they were the only one considering Bitcoin exposure, the answer is clear: You are not alone,” Hougan affirmed.

Hougan compared the interest in Bitcoin ETFs to that of gold ETFs launched in 2004, which were considered highly successful. Gold ETFs attracted over $1 billion in their first five days, with just 95 professional firms invested at the initial 13F filing.


“From a breadth of ownership perspective, the Bitcoin ETFs are a historic success,” he said.

Although most Bitcoin ETF investments are currently from retail investors, Hougan noted a potential for a growing trend among institutions. For instance, Hightower Advisors has $68 million allocated to Bitcoin ETFs, just 0.05% of their assets. Hougan predicts that such allocations will increase over time, potentially reaching significant proportions within institutional portfolios.

“Multiply that by the growing number of professional investors participating in the space, and you can begin to see what’s behind my enthusiasm,” he explained.

Indeed, substantial investments by institutions like Millennium Management underscore the growing integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream financial portfolios. This increased institutional backing signals long-term confidence in digital assets’ potential, potentially paving the way for broader crypto adoption.

Shiba Inu Faces Market Shift: Whale Transactions Decline as Subtle Bullish Signals Emerge



                    

Recent data reveals a 15% decrease in significant transactions involving Shiba Inu, a development that could considerably impact the cryptocurrency’s market dynamics. 



This decline is typically indicative of diminished activity by whales, the large-scale investors whose substantial trades can significantly influence market directions. 




Such a trend might suggest waning confidence among these investors or a pivot towards smaller, more discreet transactions.



In spite of this downturn in large transactions, there are faint signs of bullish sentiment. 



A marginal increase of 0.32% in the creation of new addresses on the SHIB network hints at a growing interest or the arrival of new participants in the market. 




This is generally viewed as a positive indicator, although the minimal rise indicates a lack of strong new momentum. 



Moreover, there’s a slight 0.04% uptick in the concentration of SHIB holdings among top addresses, suggesting that some major holders may be quietly increasing their stakes, or that a smaller number of addresses are accumulating more SHIB.

Currently, SHIB is experiencing a consolidation within a tightening price range, suggesting a potential spike in volatility soon. 




The decline in transactions by major investors could lessen the impact of significant sell-offs or purchases, possibly leading to a temporary stabilization of prices. 



Nevertheless, the ongoing consolidation phase points to a likely breakout, the direction of which will probably be influenced by broader market trends rather than SHIB-specific factors.



The landscape of Shiba Inu’s market is undergoing a complex transformation, highlighted by the reduction in large transactions coupled with modest bullish indicators. 



While the decrease in significant transactions might reflect a lack of confidence among larger investors, the incremental growth in new addresses and the slight increase in holdings by top addresses indicate a burgeoning interest. 



As SHIB navigates through a narrowing price range, an impending volatility spike seems imminent. 



The future trajectory of Shiba Inu will largely hinge on overall market movements, making it a cryptocurrency worth monitoring.

The hedge fund diversified its holdings of spot Bitcoin ETF products across ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC).BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund was Millenium’s largest allocation, with over $844 million invested.

Additionally, the majority — roughly 60% — of new spot Bitcoin ETF buyers were comprised of investment advisory firms while around 25% were hedge funds, Blachunas shared.Source: Eric BalchunasThe recent spate of compulsory 13F filings has shed light on who is buying spot Bitcoin ETFs, something Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan says has made him increasingly “bullish on Bitcoin’s future.”Related: Vanguard’s new boss says Bitcoin ETF not on the table: ReportIn a May 13 memo to investors, Hougan wrote that the quarterly 13F filings have shared important details behind who is actually buying these funds, adding that the outsized scale of institutional interest in these products was a good sign for Bitcoin moving forward.“The big news is: a lot of professional investors own Bitcoin ETFs,” wrote Hougan, drawing special attention to the presence of firms such as Hightower Advisors, Bracebridge Capital, and Cambridge Investment Research as holders of the Bitcoin products. “By the time the May 15 filing deadline arrives, I suspect we may end up with 700+ professional firms and a total AUM approaching $5 billion,” added Hougan. On May 14, The State of Wisconsin disclosed that it held a total investment amount of $164 million across two funds offered by Grayscale and BlackRock.

Coinbase Eyes Australian Pension Market With Bitcoin Service Tailored For Self-Managed Funds - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

In a strategic move to tap into the burgeoning Australian pension market, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN is developing a service tailored to the self-managed pensions sector in Australia.What Happened: Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., is focusing on the self-managed pensions sector in Australia, a market that constitutes about a quarter of the country’s $2.5 trillion pension system. The sector currently has approximately A$1 billion ($664 million) invested in cryptocurrencies, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.John O'Loghlen, Coinbase’s Managing Director for Asia-Pacific, revealed that the exchange is tailoring a service to cater to these clients, who often make a single allocation and leave it untouched. This move comes as Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD price has surged by around 45% this year following the launch of ETFs."Self-managed super funds might just make a single allocation and set it and forget it," said O'Loghlen. "We are working on an offering to service those clients really well on a one-off basis — to have them trade with us and stay with us."See Also: Pepe Pumps 8% And Millionaire Trader Thinks Will Become ‘So Nutty Soon’ That His $1M Investment Will Outperform All OthersO'Loghlen, a former employee of Ant Group and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., believes that the recent ETF launches in the U.S. have boosted the crypto market, leading to an all-time high for Bitcoin in March. He predicts that Australia will introduce more crypto ETFs by the end of 2024.Why It Matters: The move by Coinbase to target the Australian pension sector comes at a time when institutional investors are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies as a viable investment option. Earlier in March, the world’s largest pension fund, the Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan, expressed interest in diversifying its portfolio with Bitcoin.Australia’s cryptocurrency market has been experiencing significant developments. The Australian Securities Exchange is reportedly set to approve the country’s first spot-Bitcoin ETF before the end of 2024. This move is expected to further fuel the growth of the cryptocurrency market in Australia.Despite the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, there are still concerns about the risks associated with the sector. Financial advisers, such as Michael Houlihan, have cautioned against allocating a significant portion of a portfolio to high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. "You wouldn't want a significant part of a portfolio in something that's such high risk," he said.Read Next: Why This Crypto Market Is ‘A Bear Trap’ And Which Coins This Trader Is BackingImage Via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh BagalkoteThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

CME Group to Venture into Bitcoin Trading | Coinspeaker



CME Group aims to tap into the growing interest in Bitcoin among major players in the financial sector to establish a regulated marketplace that offers users direct exposure to the kingcoin.

CME Group, a prominent global futures trading company headquartered in the United States, is gearing up to enter the world of cryptocurrency by introducing a dedicated trading platform for Bitcoin (BTC) spot traders.
According to a Financial Times report citing three people familiar with the matter, the company has held a series of meetings with potential customers who would like to purchase the leading crypto asset on a regulated marketplace.




Although the plan is still in the works, its potential implications signify a noteworthy milestone in the widespread acceptance of digital assets in the US, particularly following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country.
CME Group Target’s Financial Giants
The SEC’s approval of new investment products in January 2024 has opened up new opportunities for established financial institutions to venture into innovative areas within the crypto economy.
Since then, several financial institutions from around the world have already entered the crypto scene, with CME Group being the latest to join the trend with the planned launch of a Bitcoin trading marketplace. The company’s target market includes Wall Street money managers and other corporate investors currently engaging with the emerging economy.
CME Group aims to tap into the growing interest in Bitcoin among major players in the financial sector to establish a regulated marketplace that offers users direct exposure to the kingcoin.
The company already operates a successful futures market for Bitcoin. However, the planned introduction of another marketplace for spot traders allows investors to execute basic trades more efficiently, taking advantage of price differences between the two types of contracts.
The US-based group recently surpassed Binance as the world’s largest Bitcoin futures market, with about 26,000 open positions valued at around $8.5 billion on its Chicago market.
Bitcoin’s Journey from All-Time High to Recovery
Meanwhile, the planned launch of a Bitcoin trading platform by CME Group comes at a time when the crypto market is reeling from the aftereffects of the Bitcoin halving, which took place in April 2024.
The leading crypto asset in the industry is down from its all-time high of over $73,000 in March this year, after recovering from its two-year lows since the 2022 market winter, which saw billions of dollars wiped out from the industry.
The month of April has been a rollercoaster ride for investors in the crypto market as Bitcoin slipped below $57,000 for the first time after reaching its new all-time high in March. This downward trajectory continued into May.
During this volatile period, many investors faced significant losses. On April 19, about $300 million was liquidated from both short and long positions. On May 13, approximately $130 million was wiped out within 24 hours, with Bitcoin and Ethereum bearing the brunt of the impact.
However, as of the time of writing, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have slightly recovered from their previous lows of $60,000 and $2,900, respectively. According to CoinMarketCap data, the two crypto assets are currently trading around $65,958 and $3,016, respectively.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Predictions, and More: Recap May 16


																TL;DR

Bitcoin’s price surged from $61,500 to over $66,500, possibly driven by the release of US CPI data.
Shiba Inu saw a 9% price increase, with analysts predicting further gains of up to 50% based on technical patterns.
PEPE achieved a new all-time high on May 15, becoming the third-largest meme coin by market cap, with all holders realizing paper profits at one point.


BTC Resurgence
After trading sideways in the past several days, the price of the primary cryptocurrency has once again headed north on May 15. It soared from $61,500 to over $66,500 in a matter of hours, currently standing at approximately $66,000 (per CoinGecko’s data).
BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko
The uptick occurred shortly after the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. It showed that the inflation rate in the world’s largest economy clocked in at 3.4%, meeting previous expectations.
The Federal Reserve’s goal is to decrease the annual inflation to 2%. As such, it implemented multiple measures in the past few years, including rate hikes. America’s central bank hinted at a pivot sometime this year which is seen by many industry participants as a bullish factor for Bitcoin and the entire industry.
After all, lowering interest rates makes money borrowing easier, possibly sparking more interest in riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies.




SHIB Forecasts
The popular meme coin has also experienced a substantial uptick, with its price soaring by 9% on a 24-hour scale. 
Several analysts, such as the X users Ali Martinez and Dami-Defi, believe SHIB is yet to witness a bull run. The former envisioned a 20% surge should it break “the upper boundary of this descending parallel channel at $0.00002444.”
Dami-Defi was even more bullish, predicting a 50% increase based on “a falling wedge pattern on the 1D time frame.” They also suggested that the entire meme coin sector will continue to flourish in the following months.
PEPE’s Success
The frog-themed meme coin has outperformed many of the leading cryptocurrencies in the last few days, registering a double-digit price spike. As CryptoPotato reported, it hit a new all-time high on May 15, whereas its market capitalization neared a whopping $5 billion.
PEPE’s price slightly retraced in the past several hours, but it remains the third-biggest asset in the meme coin cohort. The forth-largest – dogwifhat (WIF) – trails behind with a market cap of approximately $3 billion.
Somewhat expectedly, PEPE’s latest revival has benefited investors. According to IntoTheBlock, 100% of the coin’s holders stood at paper profits on May 14.

Chinese police bust $1.9B USDT underground banking racket

Chinese police have unearthed a $1.9 billion underground banking racket involving popular stablecoin Tether (USDT).The underground banking operations operated in the Chinese city of Chengdu and used the USDT stablecoin to exchange foreign currencies. The city police issued a media report highlighting the details of the underground operations and said they had arrested 193 suspects across 26 provinces. The Police report noted that the underground USDT banking operations began in January 2021 and were primarily used to smuggle medicine, cosmetics, and investment assets overseas.The authorities destroyed two underground operations in Fujian and Hunan, and the police also froze 149 million yuan worth $20 million linked to the USDT banking operations.Despite a comprehensive prohibition on crypto-related activities in China, Chinese traders persist in circumventing the national ban and utilizing crypto assets in alternative ways. A report published by Kyros Ventures indicates that Chinese traders are among the largest stablecoin holders worldwide. The report indicates that 33.3% of Chinese investors hold a large number of stablecoins, ranking them second only to Vietnam’s 58.6%, indicating a higher level of risk appetite.Source: Kyros VenturesThe Chinese government has banned the use of cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency exchanges, along with Bitcoin mining operations. However, the local population has found ways to evade such a ban over the years. Related: China’s most valuable company pivoting to AI as gaming profits falterAt the time of the Bitcoin mining ban, China was the largest contributor to the Bitcoin (BTC) network hash rate, which dropped to nearly zero right after the ban. However, within a year, Chinese mining hash rate contribution rose to second place, indicating that individuals continue to defy the ban.Similarly, after the country banned the use of centralized exchanges, Chinese traders turned to decentralized protocols to carry out trade. In the wake of the ban, there was a significant spike in the use of DeFi-based protocols by Chinese traders, while some defied the ban using virtual private networks (VPNs).Magazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in

                        Coinbase exchange is having big plans in developing services that targets Australia’s $600 billion self-managed pension sector, Bloomberg reported.The largest US crypto exchange is reportedly developing a tailored service to tap the unfilled demand over crypto products, Coinbase’s Asia-Pacific Managing Director John O’Loghlen, confirmed.“Self-managed super funds might just make a single allocation and set it and forget it. We are working on an offering to service those clients really well on a one-off basis — to have them trade with us and stay with us.”According to latest Australian Taxation Office data, self-managed pension portfolios form a quarter of Australia’s $2.5 trillion pension system. These encompass AU$1 billion ($664 million), designated to crypto assets, which is down from a 2021 peak of AU$1.5 billion.The fall could be attributed to some institutional money managers in Australia who refrain from the crypto sector, given its past scandals and high volatility. However, recent changes such as talks to launch a crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Australia, and Bitcoin price increase have significantly increased the cryptos held within these self-managed retirement fund.Aussie’s DIY Pension Sector Lost Millions in Crypto Bets
Besides, Michael Houlihan, head of a private wealth management firm, publicly warned investors to avoid large stake in risky assets.“You wouldn’t want a significant part of a portfolio in something that’s such high risk,” he noted. Investors interested in cryptos are typically in their 40s with low account balances, Houlihan added.This is true in previous cases, for instance, in 2023, thousands of Australians who used do-it-yourself (DIY) pension funds to bet on cryptocurrencies, faced hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.Such risky bets jeopardised their savings in a scheme originally set up to ensure adequate retirement income. Per a Reuters’ analysis last year, these bets fall outside the remit of prudential regulator that oversees professionally managed funds.Elsewhere in the world, freewheeling DIY pension sector comes with some regulation. In the UK, self-managed pension funds cannot directly invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

600 Billion Dollar Move from Bitcoin Exchange Coinbase! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the USA, is planning to expand to Australia.
At this point, Coinbase plans to provide services targeting Australia's $600 billion retirement industry.


Speaking to Bloomberg, Coinbase Asia-Pacific General Manager John O'Loghlen stated that the $600 billion pension sector's demand for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is rapidly increasing.
Stating that, as Coinbase, they are not indifferent to this increasing demand, O'Loghlen said that the service is under development.





Referring to the latest data from the Australian Taxation Office, O'Loghlen said that self-managed superannuation funds in Australia have increasingly held cryptocurrencies since March 2019, and that according to the latest data, funds have invested approximately 1 billion Australian dollars (664 million US dollars) in crypto. He said that he invested in USD.

“At Coinbase, we are working on an offering that will provide a really good one-time service to our customers, allowing them to trade with us and stay with us.
“With our new work, self-managed super funds can make a single allocation, set it and then forget about it.”

Boosting AI: Senators propose $32B investment plan for US tech growth

A bipartisan group of four senators led by United States Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence (AI) and establish safeguards around it.The roadmap is another effort by the U.S. government to regulate and promote AI development. It comes six days after legislators in the U.S. unveiled a bipartisan bill to aid President Joe Biden’s administration in imposing export controls on top AI models created in the country. After months of meetings with industry experts and AI critics, the bipartisan working group identified the importance of AI investments to keep the U.S. competitive with its rivals abroad and improve Americans’ quality of life — supporting technology that could help cure some cancers or chronic illnesses.While the roadmap doesn’t constitute a concrete bill or policy proposal, it provides a glimpse into the scope and magnitude of what lawmakers and relevant parties envision for future AI legislation, setting the stage for more comprehensive and detailed policies to come.The senators’ proposal also calls for enforcing “existing laws for AI,” including addressing any gaps or unintended harmful bias, prioritizing the development of standards for testing to understand potential AI harms, and developing use case-specific requirements for AI transparency and explainability.The group also recommended new requirements for transparency as AI products are rolled out and that studies be conducted into the potential impact of AI on jobs and the U.S. workforce.Related: OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist departs AI firmThe AI Working Group is not pioneering the effort to regulate the rapid progress of generative AI (genAI) and general AI development and adoption. In February, the National Institute of Standards and Technology formed the AI Safety Institute Consortium, which brought together over 200 organizations to establish safety guidelines for AI systems.According to experts, the U.S. is lagging behind several other countries, including the European Union, which has taken a significant lead in regulating AI. In March, the EU established a comprehensive new law governing AI across its 27 member states, putting pressure on the U.S. to catch up.The law created safeguards for general-purpose AI, limited law enforcement’s use of biometric identification systems, banned online social scoring and AI manipulation or exploiting user vulnerabilities, and gave consumers the right to launch complaints and get “meaningful explanations” from AI providers.

Bitcoin Self-Custody and Home Mining Made Legal Rights in Oklahoma After Passage Of Landmark Bill - Benzinga

In a landmark development, Oklahoma became the first state in the U.S. to declare self-custody of Bitcoin BTC/USD and other cryptocurrencies a fundamental right.What Happened: The bill proposed by Rep. Brian Hill (R) was signed into law by Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt (R), paving the way for greater autonomy for citizens regarding their cryptocurrency usage.The bill mandated a legal right to use digital assets for purchasing goods and services, self-custody of digital assets using a self-hosted wallet or a hardware wallet, and even mining digital assets from home. The bill also stipulated that no additional taxes would be levied on digital asset payments, treating them the same as traditional forms of payment. The bill would be effective from Nov.1 this year.Why It Matters: The new legislation comes at a time when the country is becoming increasingly polarized over cryptocurrencies and their increased oversight.Last week, the House voted in favor of a resolution against the SEC's controversial directive that restricted credible financial institutions from holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. President Joe Biden had threatened to veto the legislation if it reached him. On the other hand, former President Donald Trump has stepped up his pro-crypto stance in the election campaigns, promising to make the atmosphere more conducive so as to stop cryptocurrency companies from moving out of the country. He even said, "If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump."Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $65,837.53, rising 6.41% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Photo Courtesy: Shutterstock.comRead Next: Robinhood Launches Its First Crypto Staking Offering For Solana But Feature Limited To Europe

Swiss leaders plan to enforce global crypto reporting framework

The highest authority in Switzerland issued a public consultation for its plans to adopt global standards for crypto tax reporting to “ensure equal treatment” as traditional assets.The Federal Council — a group of seven members that collectively head the Swiss government — intends to implement the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) to improve tax transparency. On May 15, the Federal Council launched a consultation paper to gauge public sentiment around joining the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), a cooperation between international tax administrations to fight tax evasion. Switzerland’s extension into the AEOI is currently slated for Jan. 1, 2026.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established AEOI and other initiatives for the Group of 20 (G20) nations, which were later extended to include other nations.Switzerland previously adopted the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS) in 2014, but it left out CARF, which regulates the handling of crypto assets and their providers. Planning to change that reality, the Federal Council said:“Implementation of the CARF will expand Switzerland’s progressive crypto market regulation and help to maintain the credibility and reputation of the Swiss financial center.”However, the CARF implementation will require parliamentary approval and cannot be based solely on the responses to the consultation paper.By 2027, nearly 50 countries are expected to fully adopt the CARF regulations to mutually help fight money laundering.The Swiss federal authority intends to “close gaps in the tax transparency mechanism and ensure equal treatment with respect to traditional assets and financial institutions.”The consultation will run for over three months and end on Sept. 6.Related: G20 moves forward with international crypto frameworkIn April 2024, Canada’s annual budget suggested that the country will implement the CARF for taxation by 2026 as well.The CARF would impose new reporting requirements on crypto asset service providers, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto-asset brokers and dealers and crypto-asset automated teller machine operators. When the regulation sets in, Canadian individuals and businesses will be required to report transactions between crypto assets and fiat and crypto assets for other crypto assets to the Canada Revenue Agency.Magazine: UK cannabis millionaire’s legal ‘deals on wheels’ via crypto

Bitcoin Rally in Coming Months ‘Will Be One for the Record Books,’ Says On-Chain Analyst Willy Woo - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								On-chain analyst Willy Woo is expressing bullish sentiment about Bitcoin (BTC) for the upcoming months.
Woo tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that he expects Bitcoin to break out before October this year.










According to Woo the ensuing Bitcoin rally in 2025 will be “one for the record books”. The on-chain analyst says that the rally will be driven by an increase in global liquidity, which typically favors risk assets.
“Global liquidity forming a bullish ascending triangle.”
Source: Willy Woo/X
An ascending triangle typically forms when an area of horizontal resistance is continually tested while higher lows are consecutively being formed. A bullish ascending triangle is confirmed when a breakout above the horizontal resistance occurs.
In response to a post by the pseudonymous quant analyst PlanB that the price of Bitcoin appreciates drastically between two to five months following the halving, Woo says that the four-year event triggers a reorganization among BTC miners leaving only the fittest to survive. The fourth Bitcoin halving took place on April 19th.
“Inefficient miners get culled at the halving.
They dump their BTC before dying. 
Only the strong ones survive.
They operate on fatter margins so don’t need to sell.
Miner sell pressure gone.
Takes two to five months for the new supply/demand to reflect in price.”
According to PlanB,
“Historically, Bitcoin miner revenue recovers two to five months after a halving, and after that Bitcoin price goes vertical.”

Bitcoin is trading at $62,373 at time of writing, about 15% below the all-time high reached in March.

El Salvador Mines $29 Million in Bitcoin Using Volcanic Energy Amid Global Scrutiny and Environmental Debate



                    

Since 2021, El Salvador has successfully mined 474 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $29 million, using the renewable geothermal energy harnessed from its Tecapa volcano. 



The mining operation involves 300 processors and draws 1.5 megawatts from the 102 MW generated by a state-owned plant, as reported by Reuters.




El Salvador has taken significant strides in the cryptocurrency realm, especially in integrating renewable energy for Bitcoin (BTC) mining—a sector often criticized for its substantial energy consumption and reliance on fossil fuels. 



This initiative places El Salvador at the forefront of sustainable BTC mining practices.



In a historic move in 2021, El Salvador became the first country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, on par with the U.S. dollar. 




This decision was part of a broader strategy that included the development of a geothermal plant specifically for mining BTC. 



Presently, El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserves amount to about 5,750 BTC, worth around $354 million.



However, the adoption of Bitcoin has not been without controversy. 



Since its decision, El Salvador has faced intense criticism from global entities like the World Bank, mainly due to concerns about the implications of embracing a digital currency.




The skepticism intensified during the cryptocurrency bear market from 2022 to 2023, putting additional pressure on President Nayib Bukele’s pro-Bitcoin policies. 



Despite this, Bukele reaffirmed his commitment to the cryptocurrency by promising the daily purchase of one BTC, a move that seemed to garner domestic approval as evidenced by his decisive victory in the 2024 presidential election.



The debate over Bitcoin’s environmental toll is ongoing within the broader crypto industry.

Advocacy groups like the Ripple-backed Greenpeace have been pushing for Bitcoin to transition from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) framework. 



This environmental concern led to legislative action, such as New York becoming the first U.S. state to enact a two-year moratorium on PoW mining, signed into law by Governor Kathy Hochul on November 22, 2023.



Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, briefly considered Bitcoin as a payment method for Tesla vehicles after purchasing $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. 



However, Musk rescinded this decision, citing environmental concerns associated with Bitcoin mining. 



He stated that he would reconsider only if the mining process became predominantly renewable, noting that recent reports indicate over 60% of BTC mining now utilizes green energy. 



Despite these developments, Musk has not confirmed the reintroduction of Bitcoin payments. Meanwhile, Tesla is currently dealing with a lawsuit alleging violations of the Clean Air Act at its Fremont factory.

Millennium Leads Wall Street Charge into Bitcoin ETFs


							

Industry giant Millennium Management LLC holds nearly $2 billion across various spot Bitcoin ETFs launched earlier this year.



Bitwise CIO, Matt Hougan, predicts the investor base for these ETFs could reach 700, a significant increase compared to typical launches.



Hougan described the level of institutional interest as “unprecedented,” highlighting the growing acceptance of Bitcoin within traditional financial markets.




A surge of hedge funds and asset managers, including industry giant Millennium Management LLC, have poured in significant capital into the spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approved in the United States earlier this year. The move underscores growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency, a once-niche asset class.











According to regulatory filings analyzed by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, New York-based Millennium Management disclosed holdings of nearly $2 billion across various Bitcoin ETFs as of March 31. These investments spanned:



BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust



The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust



Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund



Bitwise Bitcoin ETF



ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF



Boston-based Bracebridge Capital, which manages investments for prestigious institutions like Yale and Princeton Universities, also entered the fray. They revealed ownership of $262 million in shares of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and $81 million in the BlackRock product.



Even the Wisconsin Investment Board, overseeing assets for the state’s retirement system, joined the wave. They purchased over $99 million in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and hold more than $63 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.









Balchunas’ analysis of 13F filings for the first quarter suggests a staggering number of investors – over 500 – have flocked to the spot BTC ETFs. This represents more than 200 times the average number of investors for a newly launched exchange-traded fund. Notably, 60% of these holders are investment advisors, while hedge funds comprise 25%.



In a client memo posted on Bitwise’s platform, Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan predicted the investor base could swell to 700, with total Assets Under Management (AUM) reaching $5 billion. Hougan described this level of investment as “unprecedented.”

Bitcoin ETF Deadline Ends With A Bang: Institutions Buy Big


								The curtain fell on the first-quarter 13F filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, and the reports revealed a seismic shift in institutional investment patterns toward spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with Millennium Management emerging as a frontrunner in this new asset class.
Millennium Becomes The King Of Bitcoin ETFs
Millennium Management, helmed by billionaire Izzy Englander and overseeing assets worth over $64 billion, reported an unprecedented $2 billion investment distributed among several Bitcoin ETFs. This mammoth investment has not only positioned Millennium at the zenith of Bitcoin ETF ownership but also signals a broader acceptance and validation within traditional investment frameworks.
The detailed disclosure showed Millennium’s investments spread across five major funds: $844,181,820 in BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) which represents 20,859,447 shares, $806,640,303 in Fidelity’s Wise Origin BTC Fund (FBTC) encompassing 12,997,749 shares, $202,029,915 in Grayscale’s BTC Trust (GBTC) holding 3,198,194 shares, $45,001,320 in ARK’s BTC ETF (ARKB) for 634,000 shares, and $44,737,805 in Bitwise’s BTC ETF (BITB) with 1,155,717 shares.

Renowned crypto analyst MacroScope remarked via X, “Major filing after the market closed today. Next to Wisconsin’s yesterday, certainly one of the most important BTC disclosures to date and it will get huge attention from asset managers.” On Tuesday, the State of Wisconsin disclosed a $161 million allocation in BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC.
According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this level of diversified investment across all Bitcoin ETFs is unprecedented. But “Millennium is king of the Bitcoin ETF holders with about $2 billion across four ETFs, out of over 500 holders. This is approximately 200 times the average for new ETFs,” Balchunas explained.
He further noted the majority of these investments came from investment advisors (60%) and a significant portion from hedge funds (25%). Balchunas also highlighted the rapid accumulation of liquidity and a diverse institutional footprint in IBIT, which is atypical for a newly launched ETF.


“You normally don’t see such a diverse range of holder types until years after an ETF’s launch,” he added, indicating the robust market confidence in Bitcoin’s potential as an investment asset.

The sector’s growth was further underscored by additional disclosures from other major financial entities. Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital disclosed an investment of nearly $12 million in BlackRock’s IBIT as of the end of the quarter, while Apollo Management Holdings reported a $53.2 million stake in ARK/21’s ARKB.
The wave of investment did not end with hedge funds and asset managers. Other notable entities such as Aristeia Capital and Hudson Bay Capital also revealed significant stakes in Bitcoin ETFs, contributing to the combined assets under management of all 10 available spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now stand at cumulative inflows of $12.1 billion.
As the deadline closed, the filings painted a picture of a rapidly maturing market where Bitcoin is no longer seen as just an alternative or speculative asset but as a viable part of diversified investment portfolios, attracting interest across the spectrum of financial institutions.
At press time, BTC traded at $65,771.

Worldcoin Foundation unveils new SMPC system, deletes old iris codes | Cryptopolitan

Just recently, the Worldcoin foundation, alongside TACEO, applied new secure multi-party computation (SMPC) for Machine Learning to Iris codes. The latest developments allow Worldcoin to establish an individual’s uniqueness. The foundation unveiled a new open-source system that reportedly handles biometric information more safely and securely.Considering the sensitivity around biometric data and personal data in general, Worldcoin has been compelled to continue building new technologies that align with stringent data protection measures.The new open-source software is currently available in the Github repository for interested developers to use and improve.The foundation, together with TACEO, aims to establish a new standard for data security, necessitating the development of this new technology.As a result, the Foundation successfully deleted iris codes previously collected while retaining the ability to establish uniqueness among individuals.Worldcoin Foundation applies SMPCThe SMPC stands for Secure Multi-Party Computation. The protocol itself is accessible on the GitHub repository. The Foundation decided to apply SMPC concurrently with Worldcoin’s existing Iris codes to ascertain their reliability.Also Read: Worldcoin Aims For Tech Partnerships Despite Regulatory StrugglesThe change to the new SMPC system requires 1152 cores and 3.6TB memory, and it uses 5 Gbps bandwidth across all parties. Despite the bump in system requirements, the new technology realizes faster implementation times, achieving up to 10,000X more.Why SMPC?Earlier attempts to use the SMPC technology have proven significantly challenging, considering the highly intensive computations required.The heavy system requirements have stifled its use, especially in biometric template protection. An excerpt from an International Red Cross research paper on SMPC reads“While SMC-Janus [an SMPC solution] offers the strongest data protection, its cost makes it unsuitable for large aid distribution projects.”Also Read: WORLDCOIN PRICE PREDICTION 2024 – 2033: HOW HIGH WILL WLD GO?The Foundation has reportedly considered several solutions available for biometric template protection. Nearly all of them fell short of the requirements, leaving only two options on the table. The homomorphic encryption also known and HE and SMPC.Both have been reported to provide sufficient privacy, security, and accuracy; however, according to the Foundation, SMPC offers a slightly better technology for uniqueness verification.The adjustments administered by the foundation also improve the overall performance of the SMPC, enhancing its performance to exceptional levels.  Cryptopolitan reporting by Collins J.

Andrew Tate plans a huge investment in Bitcoin

Andrew Tate, former kickboxer and American entrepreneur, known online as “Top G”, has announced his intention to convert over 100 million dollars into Bitcoin (BTC), completely abandoning fiat currency. 
This announcement coincides with a period of significant growth for Bitcoin, which has seen a 7% increase in the last 24 hours, surpassing the resistance level of $66,000.

Criticism of the Traditional Banking System
In a series of posts on social media “X”, previously known as Twitter, Tate expressed his disillusionment towards the traditional banking system, stating:

Bitcoin on the rise
The recent increase in Bitcoin price has caught the attention of industry experts.
The co-founders of the on-chain analysis company – Glassnode have observed and stated that this breakout was long awaited. According to them, recent data on inflation in the United States, lower than expected, and weaker retail sales could lead the Federal Reserve to a more “dovish” monetary policy. 
These factors have helped strengthen confidence in the cryptocurrency market. 
The co-founders of Glassnode also predict that Bitcoin could reach $66,000, then $69,000, and finally reach $84,000.
Bitcoin and the Legal Challenges for Andrew Tate
Actually for Tate this is a really critical private moment, in fact the former kickboxer seems to be involved in serious legal proceedings in Romania.
The charges are very serious: human trafficking and rape. 
The authorities, in this regard, have already seized various assets of Tate, including about 21 Bitcoins worth $560,000, along with luxury cars and real estate worth millions of dollars.
Despite his legal controversies, Tate still continues to have a sort of influence in the world of cryptocurrencies, remaining known especially for his provocative opinions and lavish lifestyle.

Wisconsin State BTC Investment Could Cause Chain Reaction From Other States


																In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) reported investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Grayscale.
According to SWIBs Form 13F for Q1 2024, the $156 billion pension fund purchased $64 million worth of Grayscale’s GBTC, and $99.2 million worth of BlackRock’s IBIT, with a total Bitcoin investment of just over $163 million.
The filing suggested that the crypto investment could be used for the Wisconsin Retirement System.
Other States to Follow?
On May 15, macroeconomics analyst “Macro Scope” suggested that other states would start to follow suit now that BTC investments can be easily accessed through regulatory-approved spot ETFs.
“Every state is doing this math right now. And the disclosure yesterday by Wisconsin will now become part of those conversations.”






The comments come in response to member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Keith Ammon, extolling the virtues of Bitcoin investments earlier this week.
On May 13, Ammon asked, “Should the State of New Hampshire investigate allocating a small percentage of its reserves into a Bitcoin ETF?”
He added that hindsight was a great thing, but had the State of New Hampshire put just 5% of its 2016 “rainy day fund” into Bitcoin and held it, “that amount of BTC today would be worth nearly half a billion dollars, a 10,000% ROI.”
Ammon, who commented on dollar devaluation on May 16, continued to say that New Hampshire has outstanding liabilities to the state pension system of $1.25 billion, asking how they could climb out of that hole.
“The answer may be staring us in the face, and it’s worthy of further investigation.”


Big Banks, Funds Buying BTC
In a separate post to X, Macro Scope said that Wisconsin’s disclosure was getting highlighted in industry publications before adding, “This will be widely discussed in the public and private investment sectors in coming weeks and months.”
On May 15, crypto industry observer “Marty Party” commented:
“Don’t underestimate this State of Wisconsin Investment Board buying Bitcoin ETFs. This will start a chain reaction,”
The Wisconsin SEC filing followed similar filings from major banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, disclosing around $760,000 and  $143,000 invested respectively in spot Bitcoin ETFs.
On May 15, one of the world’s largest hedge funds, Millennium Management, revealed a whopping $2 billion in holdings in spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Unknown Trader Nets $46 Million from Pepe Memecoin Amidst Resurgent GameStop Hype



                    

In a remarkable financial feat, an anonymous trader garnered over $46 million in profits from trading the Pepe memecoin, achieving a staggering 15,718 times return on their initial $3,000 investment. 



This individual initially purchased 4.9 trillion PEPE tokens on April 15, and by May 15, the value of these tokens had surged to more than $56 million. 




The trader has already cashed out 1.41 trillion PEPE for $7.4 million and still holds 3.5 trillion PEPE, currently valued at $38.9 million.



Pepe memecoin, with a market capitalization of $4.5 billion, is now the third largest behind giants like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, reflecting a 40% increase in value over just the past week. 



The resurgence in memecoins like Pepe is partly due to the same cultural disillusionment that propelled punk rock to prominence after initial skepticism. 




Hao Yang, head of financial products at Bybit exchange, compared the phenomenon to punk rock, telling Cointelegraph, 



“The success of memecoins can be seen, like punk rock, as a symptom of disillusioned young investors who have seen the opportunities afforded to their parents disappear.” 



Yang further critiqued the broader financial system, noting, “By printing tokens out of thin air and pumping them to billion-dollar valuations, these creators are showing the absurdity of our current fiat system.”



The recent spike in Pepe’s price appears linked to the renewed excitement around GameStop’s stock, which surged following Keith Gill’s return to social media after nearly three years. 




Gill’s comeback coincided with Pepe reaching new all-time highs and GameStop stock experiencing a dramatic 111% increase within 24 hours, surpassing Bitcoin’s annual returns.

Xiaohan Zhu, CEO of Meter, believes the GameStop saga played a crucial role in Pepe’s recent momentum. Zhu explained to Cointelegraph, 



“The GME saga may be one of the factors contributing to PEPE’s momentum.”



While it’s challenging to predict a broad memecoin rally, some speculate that the profits from the GameStop event might flow into other cryptocurrencies, similar to the 2021 bull market. 



However, not all memecoins will likely benefit from this trend, but Pepe, with its deep cultural resonance, seems well-positioned for further gains. 



Aleksandra Artamonovskaja, head of art at TriliTech, Tezos, emphasized Pepe’s unique cultural position, telling Cointelegraph, 



“Beyond being the most recognized meme on the internet, Pepe is a culture of its own and symbol against the establishment, symbol of freedom and hope – a relatable narrative of the GME saga.”

Crypto Markets Add $150B Daily as Bitcoin (BTC) Skyrocketed to 3-Week High (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price actions were quite underwhelming for days but the substantial ETF flows as well as the positive US CPI numbers resulted in massive gains that propelled the cryptocurrency to a 3-week peak of over $66,000.
The landscape with the altcoins is quite similar, with most turning green on a daily scale. ETH is above $3,000, while SOL and NEAR have soared by double digits.
Bitcoin Skyrockets Above $66K
The primary digital asset slumped hard last Friday to just over $61,000 after failing to overcome the $64,000 level. It used the relatively quiet weekend to regain some traction and remained around $61,000.
The bulls initiated a notable price surge on Monday that drove bitcoin to just over $63,000. Although it failed to conquer that line at first, it went on the offensive once again yesterday after the US CPI numbers for April came out.
The fact that they met the expectations of 3.4% resulted in a jump toward $64,000. The positive inflows in spot BTC ETFs in the States started another rally that pushed the cryptocurrency to a 3-week high of around $66,500.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Despite losing some ground since then, bitcoin still trades above $66,000 now. Its market cap has soared past $1.3 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is close to 52%.

SOL, NEAR on a Roll
As it typically happens when BTC heads in one direction, so do most altcoins. Ethereum has reclaimed the $3,000 level after a 3.6% increase in the past day. Binance Coin is above $580 after gaining 3%. Similar increases are evident from XRP and DOGE.
Shiba Inu, Avalanche, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Cardano have surged by somewhere between 6-8%. However, the most impressive gains come from Solana and NEAR Protocol’s native token.
SOL is up by 13% and stands well above $160, while NEAR has skyrocketed by 17% and trades north of $8.1.
TON and PEPE are the only larger-cap alts with notable price declines on a daily scale now.
The total crypto market cap has added roughly $150 billion since yesterday’s low and is now above $2.5 trillion.

Wall Street's Crypto Gateway: CME Considers Bitcoin Spot Trading


							

CME mulls Bitcoin spot trading to meet Wall Street’s crypto demand.



Easier access to “basis trading” is a potential benefit.



CME’s Bitcoin expansion could fuel regulated crypto market growth




The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a leading global derivatives marketplace, is exploring the possibility of launching Bitcoin spot trading. This move comes amid growing demand from Wall Street money managers seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market through a regulated environment.



While a final decision has not been made, CME has reportedly held discussions with traders who expressed interest in a regulated platform for Bitcoin spot trading. Sources familiar with the discussions suggest that the new product, if approved, would provide Wall Street with a more direct route to participate in the cryptocurrency market.



CME already offers Bitcoin futures trading, but investors are eyeing the potential benefits of spot trading. If implemented,  investors would gain easier access to “basis trading,” a common strategy employed by both professional Bitcoin traders and the U.S. Treasury market. Notably, CME dominates the Treasury basis trading space.









CME has demonstrably profited from the recent surge in institutional interest in Bitcoin. The platform surpassed Binance to become the world’s largest Bitcoin futures market, currently holding approximately 26,000 open positions valued at roughly $8.5 billion.



However, some skepticism surrounds the potential approval of the proposal and CME’s future in the Bitcoin spot trading arena. A cryptocurrency trader expressed concerns about CME’s ability to capture a significant market share if its Bitcoin trading operates across two separate platforms: CME in Chicago and EBS in Switzerland. The trader questioned, “I struggle to see how they would get all the efficiencies available to them.”

Popular Memecoin Has Made an Update to Its Blockchain Network! Price is on the Rise! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Shiba Inu (SHIB) enthusiasts are on the rise today as ShibaSwap, the decentralized exchange (DEX) associated with the SHIB cryptocurrency, announced that it has expanded to the Shibarium blockchain, an Ethereum layer 2 solution developed by the SHIB token team.
SHIB Becomes More Scarce as Shibarium Blockchain Expands
The developers behind this move emphasized that increased use of the Shibarium blockchain for transactions will result in a faster burn rate for the SHIB token, ultimately reducing its circulating supply.


As a result of this announcement, the SHIB price has increased by 8.8% over the last 24 hours, aligning with a broader market rally.
With ShibaSwap, launched on Shibarium, users create new liquidity pools (LPs), allowing investors to swap tokens on the network and receive a share of transaction fees by providing liquidity.






According to the latest data, ShibaSwap has over $25 million in tokens locked as of today, with a total transaction volume of $1.7 million in the last 24 hours.
“The more transactions occur on the Shibarium blockchain, the more base gas fees the protocol will burn, which will affect the overall burn rate of SHIB,” said the developers, underlining the importance of increased activity on the blockchain.


Burning, a term that refers to the permanent removal of tokens from the circulating supply by sending them to an uncontrolled address, plays a crucial role in regulating token scarcity and therefore affecting market dynamics.
At the time of writing this article, SHIB token was traded at $0.0000256.

'You Are Still Early:' Bitcoin's Global Adoption Rate Hits 4.7%, Echoes Internet's Early Growth Phase, Says Analyst - Benzinga

The world's largest digital asset Bitcoin BTC/USD has the same number of users as the Internet had in early 1999, reflecting the cryptocurrency's immense scope for future growth.What Happened: Bitcoin's world adoption hit 4.7%, according to popular cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo, reminiscent of the Internet's growth curve in January 1999. The trajectory prompted Woo to say, "You are still early… and that’s backed by the best data available," referring to the present holders of the cryptocurrency.Bitcoin's user base was around 430 million as of this writing. The analyst last month, extrapolating multiple independent studies, had predicted that Bitcoin's total user base would swell to 500 million by October, and nearly a billion by the end of 2025.  Why It Matters: Bitcoin's fast pursuit of the Internet adoption curve raised optimism among proponents that the digital currency would eventually mimic the parabolic rise of the World Wide Web.The Internet frenzy took off at the turn of the millennium, ushering in an astronomical jump in the number of users. As of April 2024, there were 5.44 billion internet users worldwide, constituting 67% of the global population, according to Statista. The better part of the story is that Bitcoin was expanding faster than the Internet, as popular Bitcoin expert Vivek recently claimed. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $65,837.53, rising 6.41% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The King Crypto was up 57% year-to-date, and nearly 150% since the same time last year.Read Next: Bitcoin Self-Custody and Home Mining Made Legal Rights in Oklahoma After Passage Of Landmark BillMohamed Hassan from Pixabay

Andrew Tate to dump fiat and buy $100M worth of Bitcoin


Not long after he touted Bitcoin (BTC) as the only acceptable monetary and investment choice, social media personality and former professional kickboxer Andrew Tate announced he would completely abandon fiat money and purchase more than $100 million worth of the maiden cryptocurrency.
Specifically, Tate voiced his disillusionment with traditional banks, their financial practices, and what he perceives as fraudulent schemes, announcing his intention to transition entirely from fiat currency to Bitcoin and plans to invest over $100 million into BTC, as shared in his X post on May 15.

As the popular influencer further explained, he hasn’t done this yet because he actually had “more crypto than fiat” in his possession, but added that “I think I’ll just leave fiat completely,” which he earlier referred to as a “fiat ponzi scam cash that you self enslave to earn.”


Andrew Tate Twitter lessons
Indeed, many know Tate as a big fan of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, having declared in late April the end of the United States dollar, along with real estate and many other investments, which the government might take away from their holders, leaving Bitcoin as the only option.
On top of that, he had indicated plans to buy $10 million worth of Bitcoin, adding up to the ‘Top G’s’ estimated net wealth in the range between $4 million and $12 million, most of which comes from the cars that he owns together with his brother Tristan Tate, as Finbold reported on April 3.
Additionally, the former kickboxer has claimed to have earned around $85 million from “Defi land” during the previous bull run, as well as stated that he purchased his first Bitcoin in 2018 and has been buying some “every single week without fail” ever since (which means even when he was in jail in Romania).
Meanwhile, the price of the largest asset in the crypto market at press time stood at $66,179, marking a recovery in the amount of 6.43% in the last 24 hours, adding up to the weekly advance of 8.27% and accumulating a 4% increase on its monthly chart, as per data on May 16.

                        Former President Donald Trump has been dubbed “America’s first crypto president” ever since his first year in office in 2017, according to Chris Giancarlo, a former CFTC regulator. This designation came about when his administration approved the introduction of Bitcoin futures contracts, he said.Giancarlo, speaking at a Washington DC crypto policy event on Wednesday, highlighted Trump’s supposedly long-standing reputation in the crypto industry, FFox Business reported. The ex-official’s comments come after Trump last week pledged to end cryptocurrency hostility if re-elected.“In addition to announcing he’s now ‘good with it’ — crypto, that is — Trump may justifiably claim to be ‘America’s first crypto president,’” Giancarlo said. “That is because of the launch of regulation Bitcoin futures in the first year of the Trump presidency.”“The enduring success of that regulated futures marketplace has helped ensure that the world’s first digital commodity — Bitcoin — is priced in US dollars,” he added.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched its Bitcoin futures trading in 2017, joining CBOE among the first exchanges to offer this new financial instrument.Crypto’s Political Trajectory in US Elections
Trump’s time as the 45th US president commenced with his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017, and concluded on Jan. 20, 2021. According to Giancarlo, cryptocurrency was not a politicized issue in 2017. At the time, he along with fellow CFTC commissioners were “unified in support of regulatory innovation.”But now, seven years down the line, crypto is on the brink of becoming a political focal point for the first time in a presidential election.Donald Trump’s Changing Views on Crypto
Before becoming a crypto advocate, Trump voiced strong criticism in July 2019. He labeled them “not money” and slammed their volatility and lack of inherent value. Additionally, he raised concerns about their potential use in criminal activities such as drug trafficking.Some in the industry worry about Biden’s stance on crypto, while others hope for favorable legislation under his administration. Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, criticized Biden for hindering the crypto industry, citing regulatory uncertainties. On the contrary, Kyle Bligen from the Chamber of Progress sees potential for positive crypto laws if Biden is re-elected.Under Biden, the SEC and the CFTC have fought over crypto industry jurisdiction. Congress struggles with bipartisan legislation to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, courts grapple with whether digital assets should be commodities or securities.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Creator Breaks Silence on Ethereum ETF


In a recent social media discussion, Dogecoin co-author Billy Markus gave his opinion on the upcoming SEC decision regarding Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds. Responding to a skeptical post about the fate of ETH ETFs, Markus expressed an equally pessimistic stance, implying that the current "compromised" state of the regulator holds little good for potential approval. This statement from Markus comes amid heightened expectations surrounding Ethereum's legal position as part of the SEC's ETF discussions. Financial lawyer Scott Johnsson recently opined that Ethereum's legal classification will figure prominently in the upcoming ETF decisions. He noted the regulator's reluctance to approve commodity trust shares for Ethereum, citing concerns about its securities-like nature, something Bitcoin ETFs have not faced.Current situation for Ethereum ETFsThe imminent decision dates for VanEck and ARK Invest's applications for Ethereum ETFs, set for May 23 and May 24, respectively, which is already a week away, has intensified speculation in the crypto industry. Despite expectations of a rejection due to Ethereum's alleged regulatory failure, the exact basis for the SEC's potential rejection remains unclear.Markus's remarks add to the skepticism surrounding the prospects of Ethereum ETFs, reflecting the broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency community regarding regulatory obstacles.There are still unanswered questions about the extent to which regulatory barriers will prevent the mass adoption of Ethereum and altcoins, and whether there will be alternative investment opportunities. There are also ongoing debates about the effectiveness and fairness of the regulatory framework, with supporters arguing for clearer guidelines and opponents criticizing excessive regulatory overreach.

ShibaSwap, the decentralized exchange (DEX) aligned with the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has rolled out a major upgrade — moving to the Shibarium blockchain. According to a recent press release, the move will offer a “variety of new decentralized exchange and decentralized app (DApp) utilities” for users. The press release detailed new features including a new dashboard, improved user experience, discovery charts “for new and trending tokens,” and the onboarding process of news tokens on the DEX. Source: Shytoshi KusamaShiba Inu (SHIB) lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama commented on the upgrade, stating:The new ShibaSwap empowers DEFI innovators looking for the next hit on Shibarium to find, swap, and interact with community tokens in an entirely new way! It is the redesigned beating heart of a freshly forked Shibarium, where community tokens can flourish. We invite the community to try our new swap and invite current Shibarium tokens to port over to our swap with ease. Finally, rest assured, this new UX is still an early ShibaSwap version, with more updates in the pipeline for the product.The upgrade will utilize "part of the transaction fees portion" to improve the value of liquidity pools (LPs) in swap transactions. This will result in increased LP token value for users and benefiting the yield farmer community, according to the press release.Relate: Over 1 million new crypto tokens have been launched since AprilFellow pseudonymous SHIB developer and contributor Kaal posted on X explaining that the upgrade rollout will be “focused on discovery” and that more regular “updates and upgrades” should be expected. Source: KaalAccording to the press release, this upgrade is focused on minimizing gas fees and fast transactions. Shibarium also supports the other growing segments of the Shiba Inu Ecosystem, including the $SHIB and $LEASH tokens, SHEboshis DN-404 tokens, SHIB The Metaverse, the ShibaSwap DEX, and the Shiba Eternity game.The layer 2 (L2) Shibarium mainnet went live in August 2023 — featuring the creation of 21 million wallets, and was trialed by millions of users. The debut introduced a new consensus mechanism dubbed proof-of-participation (PoP) that works by selecting validators based upon their holdings of the associated cryptocurrency. At the time of writing SHIB price was $0.0002548 — up almost 7% in the last 24 hours and holds the 11th largest market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.

                        Crypto custody firm Bakkt expects a significant increase in the involvement of institutional investors in the cryptocurrency trading market.The driving force behind this mainstream adoption, according to Bakkt, is the recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The firm made the prediction on Wednesday when announcing its latest quarterly results, according to a report from PYMNTS.Bakkt Sees Surge in Crypto Trading Volume
In the first quarter ending on March 31, Bakkt witnessed a remarkable 324% surge in crypto trading volume compared to the previous quarter, primarily fueled by robust client trading activity.The positive trend indicates a growing demand environment, with increased industry activity, higher coin prices, and overall elevated retail trading volume, as stated by Andy Main, President and CEO of Bakkt, during the company’s quarterly earnings call.The existing crypto trading market was primarily tailored for retail investors, utilizing a central limit order book trading structure.However, institutional investors seeking to offer Bitcoin ETFs have found that this structure fails to meet their large-scale requirements.Recognizing this need, Bakkt plans to seize the opportunity by developing BakktX, an electronic communication network (ECN) designed as a purpose-built crypto trading venue for institutions.BakktX aims to provide high performance, low latency, and cost-effective solutions.BakktX to Facilitate Real-Time Execution
The proposed BakktX trading venue will facilitate real-time execution of trades, leveraging Bakkt’s extensive network of liquidity relationships.It will also feature a low fee structure, incentivizing trading volumes and catering to the demands of institutional investors.The company believes that this enhancement in trading technology will strengthen existing relationships and attract new clients who prioritize top-tier infrastructure providers.In addition to the launch of BakktX, the company plans to expand its product offerings and solutions while focusing on broadening its client network, deepening existing relationships, and continuously improving its cost structure throughout 2024.To streamline operations and drive profitability, Bakkt recently implemented a restructuring initiative, reducing its headcount by 20%.This strategic move is expected to result in $7 million in cash savings for 2024 and $13 million in annualized cash savings.The decisions made by Bakkt reflect its determination to navigate the challenging landscape and reallocate resources to growth areas.By capitalizing on the increasing interest of institutional investors and delivering a purpose-built trading platform, Bakkt aims to solidify its position as a key player in the evolving crypto trading market.As reported, trading volume on major cryptocurrency exchanges has experienced a significant decline in April, coinciding with Bitcoin’s retreat from its all-time high.Additionally, derivatives trading volume saw its first decrease in seven months, falling by 26.1% to $4.57 trillion.The decline came as major CEXs like Binance experienced a large surge in trading volumes between October 2023 and March 2024.

Hedera (HBAR) New Account Creation Booms, Token Gets Boosted | Cryptopolitan

Hedera (HBAR) is rising after a spike in new account creation. The overall market recovery lifted HBAR, but the asset also reflects the organic growth of the Hedera project. The Hedera network is growing its transaction count and active addresses. The growth is long term and mostly driven by DeFi. However, in the short term, Hedera users also noted a sudden spike in new address generation.  Active wallets on the Hedera network grew mainly because of DeFi projects, and there was also some growth from NFT owners in the past two quarters. Hedera’s new address creation is a somewhat involved process, where enterprises can create up to 100 wallets in a batch using BitGo. Hedera Expands with DeFi AdditionsIn the past few months, alternative platforms, and blockchains benefitted the most from the return of DeFi. Hedera hosts several decentralized markets and lending protocols, including those that expanded to multiple chains, such as Pangolin DEX. Hedera still has limited value locked to DeFi, but growth happened just about six months ago. Decentralized trading and liquidity mining are among the factors that put the project in the spotlight, unlike its long-term goals and ambitions for global influence in payment systems and finance. Recently, Hedera announced a partnership with like-minded projects that plan to disrupt finance. Hedera will work with Algorand, Ripple, XRPL Labs, Constellation, and Casper to create the Decentralized Recovery Alliance (DeRec).Hedera Aims to Grow Real-world ApplicationsHedera undeniably benefitted from the return of DeFi and the 2024 bull market. However, the project has long-term goals and tries to aggressively grow its use cases. One tool for applying Hedera technology is a new Beta program for app developers. Recently, Hedera approved a new batch of projects, including Vayana Official, Inveniam, and FreshSupply. The selected projects will boost the adoption of blockchain-based finance. All projects work on the intersection of traditional payments and tokenization. Hedera’s other development direction is the Internet of Things (IoT). In the crypto space, IoT projects have been considered mostly vaporware. Hedera has the technology to carry a high load of microtransactions and is designed similarly to IOTA and other graph-based networks. Hedera also mentioned the Neuron World Beta program, where developers can create and try out sensors for everyday objects. Neuron World is an open-source project, seeking teams to apply physical IoT infrastructure. With this new source of data and micro-transactions, Hedera has a claim on DePIN status, as well as real-world microtransactions. The Hedera network now has 32 known nodes, which stake 22B HBAR tokens during predetermined periods. The network distributes worldwide, but many of the nodes, including the node run by BitGo and Chainlink, have their base in the USA. Is HBAR Heading for a Longer Price Rally?Hedera has always attempted to boost its community and remain highly visible. The growth of DeFi on the network helped HBAR move up from its bear market lows. HBAR traded at $0.11, bouncing from lows of $0.09, but still far from the monthly peak at $0.17. HBAR is relatively volatile and may touch the lower monthly range again, but traders are expecting the next breakout. HBAR is still under its 200-day moving average, but traders suggest the token may have reached its low point in the short term. HBAR trades on low volumes of just under $100M per day, but activity has expanded to $3.5B daily during active trading. The expectations are that Hedera will line up among blue-chip projects during this market cycle. HBAR is already more visible in the top 30 coins and tokens and may break out higher up the charts. HBAR also showed signs of accumulation in the past weeks, and is considered a token with a significant upside, to potentially achieve 10X growth in the event of a new altcoin bull rally.Cryptopolitan reporting by Hristina Vasileva

XRP Investors Beware: SEC Appeal Threatens Post-Court Victory


							

XRP’s gains trail behind broader market rally amidst looming Ripple lawsuit.



Court to determine penalty for Ripple’s alleged violation as SEC seeks fines.



Potential SEC appeal could restrict XRP sales to institutions.




The XRP market is currently experiencing a holding pattern, balancing recent gains with the looming uncertainty of the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple. While XRP managed a 3.63% gain on Wednesday, May 15th, it lagged behind the broader crypto market’s impressive 6.38% surge, which was driven by positive US economic data.



The lack of updates on Ripple’s Motion to Seal case documents was not unexpected, but the real tension lies0 in what comes next. The court will soon deliberate on the penalty for Ripple’s alleged securities violation and decide on a potential sales ban on XRP. This ban, coupled with the hefty $2 billion penalty the SEC, has the investors on edge. 







SourceL TradingView



Technically, XRP’s price action indicates it is currently stagnant. Key technical indicators suggest range-bound trading, with a potential breakout or breakdown dependent on upcoming events.



However, the most significant factor influencing XRP’s future remains the SEC lawsuit. Upcoming U.S. economic data and Federal Open Market Committee announcements will also play a crucial role. Investors are keenly awaiting any developments in the Ripple case, particularly regarding the court’s ruling and the potential SEC appeal.









Popular crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto, known for his XRP insights, recently shared a forecast regarding XRP’s “Super Guppy Cycle Top” expected in September 2024. EGRAG’s analysis compares the current cycle to past patterns, offering projections and potential insights into XRP’s trajectory over the coming months. The Super Guppy indicator is a group of Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) that signal changes in price action.

The past day has seen $82 billion worth of BTC change hands, according to Coinglass.Bitcoin has been helped along by signs that inflation in the U.S. has started to wane. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released new data showing that consumer prices had fallen for the first time in six months. That's good news for risk-on investors who trade cryptocurrency and stocks. The Consumer Price Index is one of the key metrics that the Federal Reserve tracks when deciding when (or whether) to lower federal interest rates in the states.

NFT Market Crashes: 95% Of Assets Become Worthless


								The once-feverish NFT marketplace, where digital art and collectibles commanded millions, now resembles a deserted online bazaar. A new report paints a stark picture – a 97% plunge in trading volume since 2021 and a staggering 95% of NFT projects holding zero market value.
This dramatic decline begs the question: is the NFT market headed for extinction, or is this just a temporary hiccup?

From Jpeg Millionaires To Tumbleweed Sales
Just two years ago, NFTs were the new gold rush. Beeple’s $69 million digital collage sale became a cultural phenomenon, and stories of overnight millionaires from “on-chain jpegs” fueled a speculative frenzy. However, that frenzy seems to have fizzled out.
Today, the average NFT sale struggles to break the $200 mark, a far cry from the seven-figure sums of yesteryear. Daily sales have nosedived from a bustling 87,000 in 2021 to a mere 2,000 in 2024.

Crypto Winter And Beyond: A Cocktail Of Challenges
The blame for this downturn falls on several factors. The broader crypto market slump, often referred to as the “crypto winter,” has undoubtedly played a role. Economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions haven’t helped either, dampening investor confidence.
However, the NFT market’s woes may run deeper. Critics point to a saturation of low-quality projects and a lack of utility for many NFTs beyond bragging rights. The multi-million dollar sales of 2021 might have been outliers, fueled by hype rather than genuine value.

A Glimmer Of Hope? Retail Investors Hold The Key
Despite the bleak landscape, the report suggests a potential comeback. The authors point to historical trends in the crypto market, where periods of decline have often been followed by resurgence.
A return of retail investors, those willing to take on higher risk for potentially high rewards, could breathe new life into the market. This hinges on a recovery in the broader market and a renewed sense of optimism among investors.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Regulation: A Looming Cloud
The future of NFTs isn’t without its hurdles. Regulatory scrutiny from the US government casts a long shadow. While some argue that clear regulations could bring stability and legitimacy to the market, others fear it could stifle innovation. Finding the right balance between protecting investors and fostering growth will be crucial for the NFT market’s future.

The Verdict: A Time Of Reckoning
We can view the current status of the NFT market as a reckoning era. The gaudy dreams of 2021 have made way for a more grounded reality. It will be interesting to watch if NFTs develop into a strong asset class with practical applications or if they become just another digital memory.

Shiba Inu Soars: ShibaSwap Launch on Shibarium Boosts EcosystemWriter: Anisha Pandey


							

Shiba Inu ecosystem expands with ShibaSwap launch on Shibarium, its Layer-2 solution



Shiba Inu token poised for potential growth



Shibarium emerges as a DeFi contender




Shiba Inu (SHIB) enthusiasts are celebrating the launch of ShibaSwap on Shibarium, the project’s much-anticipated Layer-2 scaling solution. This marks a significant milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, unlocking new functionalities and potentially boosting the value of the SHIB token.







ShibaSwap’s migration to Shibarium news signifies a major step forward for Shiba Inu. It expands the project’s reach beyond the Ethereum network, establishing Shibarium as a key player in the DeFi landscape. Notably, ShibaSwap becomes the first major decentralized application (dApp) built on Shibarium, serving as a flagship platform to demonstrate the network’s capabilities.



Through ShibaSwap, users gain access to a wider range of features. This includes creating liquidity pools (LPs) directly on Shibarium, enabling seamless token swaps between the Layer-2 network and Ethereum. Additionally, users can stake their SHIB tokens on ShibaSwap, providing crucial support for the overall Shiba Inu ecosystem.



The integration of ShibaSwap with Shibarium is expected to fuel a rise in network transactions. This, in turn, could accelerate the rate of SHIB token burning. According to data from Shibburn, the burn rate for SHIB skyrocketed by 306% within a 24-hour period ending at 11:57 p.m. ET on Wednesday.









SHIB, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, is poised to benefit considerably from this development. Increased staking opportunities with associated rewards are expected to drive demand for SHIB, potentially creating a positive feedback loop that fuels token burning and potentially increases its value.Data from CoinMarketCap indicates a near 10% surge in SHIB’s price, currently sitting at $0.00002518 with a corresponding 24.85% increase in trading volume. The market capitalization of the meme coin now stands at $14.84 billion.

Binance develops ‘antidote’ to address poisoning scams after $68M exploit

Binance’s security experts developed an “antidote” against the growing instances of address poisoning scams, that trick investors into willingly sending funds to a fraudulent address.The security team of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange developed an algorithm that detected millions of poisoned crypto addresses, according to a report shared with Cointelegraph:“We have developed a unique method of identifying poisoned addresses, which helps us to alert users before they send money to criminals and was instrumental in identifying and flagging more than 13.4 million spoofed addresses on BNB Smart Chain and 1.68 million on Ethereum.”Address poisoning, or address spoofing, is a deception trick where scammers send a small amount of digital assets to a wallet that closely resembles the potential victim’s address, to make it part of the wallet’s transaction history — hoping that the victim will accidentally copy and send funds to their address.Binance’s algorithm detects spoofed addresses by first identifying suspicious transfers, such as those with near zero value or unknown tokens, pairing them with potential victim addresses, and timestamping malicious transactions to find the potential point of poisoning.The spoofed addresses are registered in the database of Web3 security firm HashDit, Binance’s security partner, which will help protect the wider crypto industry from poisoning scams, according to Binance’s report.“Many cryptocurrency service providers use HashDit’s API to boost their defenses against a variety of scams. One of them, for example, is Trust Wallet, which uses the database of poisoned addresses to alert users when they are about to transfer funds to a spoofed recipient.”The algorithm will also help flag spoofed addresses on HashDit’s user-facing products, web browser extensions, and MetaMask Snaps.Related: Post-FTX crypto industry needs education before regulation — Former Biden adviserAddress poisoning is a growing concern following $68 million scamThe necessity for a preventive algorithm became apparent two weeks ago, after an unknown trader lost $68 million to an address-poisoning scam. They accidentally sent $68 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) in a single transaction to a spoofed address on May 3.In a fortunate but mysterious turn of events, the thief returned the $68 million on May 13, after numerous on-chain investigators started shedding light on his potential Hong Kong-based IP addresses. This suggests that the scammer wasn’t a white hat hacker, but a thief that became scared of the public attention following the scam.Address poisoning scams may seem easily avoidable, but most traders only verify the first and last digits of the wallet’s 42 alphanumeric characters, as most protocols only display the first and last digits.Making matters more difficult, scammers rely on vanity address generators to customize their addresses to seem less random or more similar to a given address, according to Binance.“An authentic Ethereum address like 0x19x30f…62657 could be spoofed using a similar-looking 0x19x30t…72657, which can be totally different in the middle while maintaining the first and last few characters.”VIDEOScammers, WATCH OUT!

Market expert sets Bitcoin price for August 2024


Bitcoin (BTC) is once again flirting with the possibility of reclaiming a new record after successfully breaching the $65,000 resistance mark.
As the maiden cryptocurrency seemingly benefits from the euphoria around the latest United States inflation data, technical indicators suggest that a new record high for Bitcoin is on the horizon.
Particularly, in a TradingView post on May 16, crypto trading expert TradingShot suggested that Bitcoin might be in line to clinch the $150,000 target by August 2024. 


The analyst pointed out that Bitcoin has shown signs of resurgence, buoyed by a recent 25% correction which the expert deemed as normal within bull cycles. 
TradingShot also observed that Bitcoin had closed above the one-day moving average 50 (MA50) after two consecutive rejections, indicating that Bitcoin’s upward trajectory seems promising.

The trading expert also reviewed Bitcoin’s long-term chart, particularly the one-week timeframe, where the crypto appears to be at a cyclical stage. Historically, during similar cycles, Bitcoin has embarked on its most aggressive rallies. 
Technical levels to watch out for 
Therefore, TradingShot stated that Bitcoin’s recent bounce on the exponential moving average (EMA) ribbon, coupled with its recovery of the mayer multiple SD1, indicates positive momentum.  
Drawing from these indicators, the analysts suggested that Bitcoin’s next target could be $150,000 by August. 

“As you can see, BTC rebounded on the EMA Ribbon, after making a new All Time High (ATH) while also recovering the Mayer Multiple SD1 from above. When those parameters got met in the past, Bitcoin always touched at least the MMB SD2 from above. Based on that, the next Target on this run is $150,000,” the expert said. 

Bitcoin’s breakout inevitable 
On the other hand, another crypto expert, Michaël van de Poppe, suggested in a May 16 post on X (formerly Twitter) that an upwards trajectory for Bitcoin was inevitable based on its recent recovery.
He noted that Bitcoin’s steady rise would instill renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency markets. As Bitcoin continues its ascent, Poppe suggested that attention is shifting to altcoins, which are expected to benefit significantly from this positive market sentiment.

It’s worth noting that renewed interest in BTC comes after the latest inflation figures were released. According to the data, the core inflation rate fell to 3.8% year-on-year, its lowest level in three years.
These figures have ignited speculation that the Federal Reserve might finally enact an interest rate cut, with some market participants projecting that the cut might come as early as July.
In the meantime, the flagship digital asset continues to be buoyed by several bullish elements likely to sustain its momentum. For instance, CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, is reportedly planning to unveil Bitcoin trading to capitalize on the growing interest in the asset by Wall Street.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin price today is trading at $66,270 with daily gains of almost 6%. On the weekly timeframe, BTC is up 8%.

Having breached the $65,000 resistance, Bitcoin is well-positioned to reach the $70,000 mark en route to a new all-time high. This trajectory will be aided if the historical post-halving rally kicks in.

Swiss Federal Council seeks public input on global crypto tax standards

The Swiss Federal Council has recently urged a public consultation to bring into effect international reporting conduct for crypto tax and ensure equal treatment of crypto assets, which is generally at par with traditional financial assets. The Federal Council’s proposal implies the introduction of a Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) to ensure tax transparency in Switzerland.Swiss Federal Council pushes for crypto tax rulesThe Federal Government Council, or the Swiss government, which has 7 members, released a consultation paper on May 15 to discover the private will that Switzerland can actively take part in the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). AEOI is adopted by member countries as a measure of collaboration among tax administrations to curb tax evasion. Instead of Switzerland’s entry into AEOI planned for January, 1st, 2026 is the country’s extension up to the date. This step is subsequent to the fact that Switzerland accessed the OECD’s standard CRS(Common Reporting Standard) in 2014, which excluded CARF at the initial stage.The introduction of CARF will enhance Swiss comprehensive crypto sympathetic market regulation and contribute to maintaining country’s financial establishment dignity. Nevertheless, the Parliament will have to be involved, and the CARF adoption must include more than just the answers to the suggested criteria in the consultation paper. This development is just one of the many different things Switzerland is doing in order to improve tax transparency and make sure all the financial assets are treated in the same fairway.CARF guidelines to shape Swiss regulationThe OECD launched the AEOI and other initiatives, which were later completed for the G20 countries, who now joined other countries in it. In 2027, 49 countries are estimated to have fully implemented the CARF rules to put a pre-emptive measure in place for fraud and increase fiscal transparency. The fact that this collaboration requires the use of the same reporting standards for crypto assets and the traditional types of financial assets is proof that there is a need for standardization.The Swiss federal authority tries to level financial institutions and overcome the transparency gaps related to both traditional assets and financial professionals. This consultation period extends till September 6 and aims to get the opinions of all the major stakeholders, including the financial institutions, the crypto asset service platforms, and everybody else. The result of this conversation will be a guideline for the crypto asset regulation in Switzerland as well as its adherence to international standards.Canada and Switzerland to adopt CARFThe introduction of CARF will introduce new reporting requirements that will be obligatory to the service providers of crypto assets. Those service providers will be for example crypto-exchange platforms, brokerage firms or automated teller machine operators. Due to the necessity of reporting the activity on crypto assets along with fiat currency, they will account for any transactions between different cryptos. In turn, these increased level of reporting aims to introduce transparency to the sector and to steer tax evasion and money laundering away.In April 2024, the budget for the Canadian Year asking the country to create CarF for taxing by 2026. This goes onto show that the increased adoption of this reporting framework is actually a footprint in the pathway to standardisation of reporting for crypto assets among the nations. Countries like Canada and Switzerland are aiming for the implementation of CARF, thus, bringing about a globalized platform of deployment regulatory issue comparisons and a more transparent cryptocurrency asset regulation.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin rebounded strongly, surpassing $65,930 and reaching a peak of $66,591 on Thursday. Softer-than-anticipated U.S. inflation data fueled this rally by increasing the likelihood of interest rate cuts and boosting investor confidence across the crypto market.As Bitcoin climbed, it catalyzed gains across other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Ripple, pushing the global cryptocurrency market cap to $2.39 trillion, a 24-hour surge of more than 5%.Adding to the positive market dynamics, Millennium Management, a prominent hedge fund, has significantly invested in Bitcoin ETFs, holding nearly $2 billion in assets, underscoring strong institutional support for Bitcoin.Millennium Management Leads in Bitcoin ETF Investments with Nearly $2 Billion Holdings
Millennium Management, an international hedge fund, has made a substantial investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs, holding nearly $2 billion as of the first quarter of 2024. According to their latest 13F filing with the SEC, Millennium’s investment spread across five prominent ETFs totaled approximately $1.94 billion by March 31.These investments were diversified among several key products, including the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, iShares Bitcoin Trust, and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF.
Largest Holdings: BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund, with over $844 million, and Fidelity’s fund, closely following at just over $806 million.
Market Impact: Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas highlighted Millennium as having 200 times the exposure of typical new ETF investors.
The significant engagement of professional investors like Millennium suggests a robust institutional interest in Bitcoin, reinforcing a positive outlook for its future. Matt Hougan of Bitwise has expressed optimism, noting that the scale of professional investment might lead to a combined AUM nearing $5 billion. This trend underscores the growing acceptance of Bitcoin among seasoned investors, enhancing its profile in the investment community.BTC Rises Above $66,000 Amid Expectations of Potential Rate Cuts on Softer US Inflation Data
Bitcoin surged above $66,000 yesterday, achieving its highest single-day gain in nearly two months. The most recent US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which showed a slower inflation rate of 0.3% month-over-month for April, below the anticipated 0.4%, was the driving force behind this significant uptrend. This unexpected slowdown heightened investor expectations for potential rate cuts. Meanwhile, Retail Sales for the same period remained stagnant, further underscoring economic softness and bolstering the case for monetary easing.
Core PPI rose by 0.5% month-over-month, surpassing expectations.
Softer CPI and stalled retail sales have increased optimism for potential rate cuts.
This amalgam of economic indicators has sparked a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, as softer inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy sooner.Bitcoin ETFs See Record Inflows, Driving BTC Price Surge to $66,000
On May 15, Bitcoin ETFs in the United States experienced a significant boost in inflows, totaling $303 million, the largest since early March. This influx was led by Fidelity’s FBTC fund, which attracted $131 million, and Bitwise’s BITB fund, receiving $86 million. Notably, Millennium Management is the largest institutional holder in this space with an investment totaling $2 billion across various Bitcoin ETFs.
Top Fund Inflows: Fidelity’s FBTC ($131 million) and Bitwise’s BITB ($86 million).
Key Driver: Bitcoin’s 7% price increase to $66,000, spurred by US inflation data suggesting potential rate cuts.
This remarkable inflow into Bitcoin ETFs, combined with favorable economic indicators, has significantly bolstered Bitcoin’s market value, pushing its price to $66,000. This trend underscores the growing investor confidence in cryptocurrencies as a viable investment amid shifting economic conditions.
Bitcoin Price Prediction

With a bearish Bitcoin price prediction, BTC is experiencing a slight downturn, trading at $65,930, marking a 0.44% decrease. The cryptocurrency is hovering just below its pivotal point of $66,260, a critical juncture that could determine the next directional move. 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is elevated at 74, indicating that BTC is possibly overbought, which might precede a pullback if bullish momentum does not sustain.
Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: Tradingview
Immediate support and resistance levels are crucial to watch. The first significant resistance lies at $67,820, with subsequent barriers at $69,084 and $70,643. A push above these levels could signal a strong bullish continuation. Conversely, support levels are set at $64,732, followed by $63,438 and $61,438. A breach below these could confirm a bearish trend, especially if the price falls beneath the pivot point.
The 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $62,687, further supporting the idea that the mid-term trend has been bullish, but caution is warranted given the current RSI levels.
Current Trend: Cautiously bearish unless BTC decisively clears the $66,260 pivot point.

Deere & Co. Q2 Earnings Top Forecasts, But Shares Dip on Lowered Outlook - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Deere & Co. (NYSE: DE), a leading agricultural equipment manufacturer, reported strong second-quarter earnings on Thursday, May 16, 2024. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) and revenue surpassed analyst expectations. However, it lowered its full-year net income forecast due to declining crop prices and reduced demand for its products.



Deere & Co. Tops EPS and Revenue Forecasts in Q1, Lowers 2024 Outlook



Deere & Co. reported Q2 EPS of $8.53, beating the analyst estimate of $7.87 by $0.66. The company’s revenue for the quarter reached $15.24 billion, exceeding the consensus estimate of $13.3 billion. Despite the strong quarterly performance, Deere revised its full-year net income forecast downward to approximately $7.0 billion, from the previous forecast of $7.5 to $7.75 billion.



The company attributed the revised outlook to declining crop prices and reduced demand for tractors and combine harvesters. The U.S. Department of Agriculture projected a 25.5% decline in net farm income to $116.1 billion for the year, driven by a drop in corn and soybean prices to over three-year lows. Higher interest rates have also pressured farmers, leading to increased inventories of agricultural equipment and forcing Deere and other manufacturers to cut production. As a result, Deere expects sales of large agricultural equipment to decline between 20% and 25% this year, an adjustment from the earlier expectation of a roughly 20% fall.





Deere & Co. Shares Drop on Lowered 2024 Outlook



Deere & Co. closed at $414.02 on May 15, 2024, reflecting a slight increase of 0.30%. However, in pre-market trading today, the stock was down 6.50%, trading at $387.10 at the time of writing.The 52-week range for Deere’s stock was $321.85 to $446.76, and the company’s market cap stood at $115.25 billion as of the latest close.



The company’s trailing P/E ratio is 12.07, with a forward P/E ratio of 15.53. Key profitability metrics include a profit margin of 16.39%, return on assets (ROA) of 9.90%, and return on equity (ROE) of 45.61%. Deere’s total revenue (ttm) was $60.76 billion, with net income attributable to common shareholders at $9.96 billion, and diluted EPS (ttm) at $34.32.



Deere’s total cash (mrq) was $3.83 billion, and the company’s total debt/equity ratio was 289.24%. Analyst price targets for Deere’s stock range from a low of $365.00 to a high of $495.00.

FTX Bankruptcy Update: Major Claim Transferred to Single Creditor, Simplifying Case but Risking Smaller Parties



                    

In the latest twist in the FTX bankruptcy saga, a significant claim previously held against FTX EU—renamed from K-DNA Financial Services—has been assigned to a single creditor, named FTXcreditor, according to court documents from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware dated May 15. 



This move forms part of the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings involving FTX and could potentially streamline the process, albeit introducing new risks for smaller creditors involved.




The transfer adheres to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, specifically Rule 3001(e)(2). 



This rule pertains to the transfer of claims, and in this context, the documents state: “Seller hereby waives any notice or hearing requirements imposed by Rule 3001 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, and stipulates that an order may be entered recognizing this Evidence of Transfer of Claim as an unconditional assignment and Buyer as the valid owner of the claim.” 



This statement underscores the legal basis for the transfer and the elimination of typical procedural requirements to expedite the process.




This strategic consolidation aims to reduce the administrative burden of managing multiple claims by channeling them through a single creditor. 



While this could speed up the resolution of the case, it also poses significant concerns for smaller creditors.

With all claims funneled through one entity, there is a risk that these smaller parties may be marginalized, potentially receiving lesser or less favorable settlements compared to larger creditors.




The identity of the transferring party remains undisclosed, adding a layer of opacity to the proceedings. 



The official statement regarding this anonymity notes, “To protect the identity of the Transferor, Transferee has not disclosed the Transferor’s name or address, and has not attached the signed Evidence of Transfer to this Notice of Transfer of Claim.” 



This lack of transparency could lead to speculation and concerns about the fairness and integrity of the bankruptcy process, especially in terms of potential for manipulation.



The backdrop to these developments is the dramatic downfall of FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 after a sudden financial collapse. 



The fallout continues to affect numerous creditors and has prompted tighter regulatory scrutiny over the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, aiming to enhance investor protection.



Adding to the ongoing drama, FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried recently reiterated his innocence following a 25-year prison sentence. 



In a May 9 interview, he shared insights into his prison life, focusing on his basic diet and mentioning that rice had become “one of the currencies of the realm inside,” illustrating the stark change in his circumstances.

Shiba Inu: ShibaSwap Debuts On Shibarium, Features Revealed


								ShibaSwap, the native decentralized exchange (DEX) of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has officially launched on Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 scaling solution. This strategic move was announced via X, signifying a major step forward in leveraging the scalability and cost-efficiency of Shibarium while maintaining the security features of the Ethereum blockchain.
The SHIB army received this news with the following statement from the Shiba Inu team via X: “ShibArmy the wait is finally over — ShibaSwap is coming home to Shibarium! ShibaSwap is more than just an exchange; it’s where our community’s spirit meets innovation, where your community tokens not only exist but thrive.”
Shiba Inu’s DeFi Ecosystem Makes A Giant Leap Forward
The integration of ShibaSwap onto Shibarium is not just a mere transition; it is a transformative shift that establishes ShibaSwap as a multi-chain DEX now operating on both Ethereum and Shibarium, according to the latest issue of SHIB Magazine. This dual-chain approach optimizes user benefits by combining the robust security of Ethereum with the enhanced scalability and reduced transaction costs offered by Shibarium.

A central feature of this integration is the enhanced ability for users to directly influence the exchange’s ecosystem by creating new liquidity pools for their preferred tokens. This move significantly enhances the decentralized nature of the platform, allowing for greater community participation and influence in shaping the ecosystem’s growth.
“Adding liquidity to ShibaSwap’s pools empowers you to participate in decentralized trading while earning fees with ease. While setting up a liquidity pool on Ethereum can cost around $100 or more, doing so on Shibarium typically costs less than $1, making it an attractive option for users seeking to participate in DeFi without breaking the bank,” the SHIB team explained.
In addition to technical upgrades, ShibaSwap has introduced substantial improvements to its user interface and overall user experience. The redesigned dashboard and simplified user interface are aimed at enhancing the trading and yield farming experience for all users, regardless of their level of expertise in the DeFi space. This redesign makes navigation and operation within ShibaSwap more intuitive, facilitating smoother interactions with the platform’s various features.

The platform now includes advanced features such as trend analysis charts, which allow users to spot trending tokens by volume and trading activities. The newly integrated analytics display provides users with real-time data on ShibaSwap’s total value locked (TVL) and trading volume, enhancing their ability to make informed trading decisions.
The increased transaction volume on Shibarium not only promises more fees for liquidity providers and stakers but also supports a higher burn rate of the SHIB token through the burning of base gas fees. This dynamic serves a dual purpose: rewarding users for their participation and investment in the ecosystem and simultaneously reducing the overall supply of SHIB, potentially increasing its scarcity and value.
Commenting on the future of ShibSwap in the SHIB Magazine, the dev team revealed that the DEX “is poised for even greater advancements with the upcoming V2 and V3 releases,” which will introduce a range of new features designed to further enhance user experience. These include extended user interfaces, more concentrated liquidity management tools, and customizable price ranges.
All enhancements aim to improve rewards for liquidity providers, enhance portfolio management, and optimize overall liquidity performance.
At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002550.

Fraud and Money Laundering: Canadian Crypto King and Associate Charged


							

Aiden Pleterski and aide Colin Murphy charged with money laundering



The charges followed a joint investigation by Canada’s DRPS and OSC.



OSC advises the public to scrutinize individuals offering investment advice




Canadian authorities have charged Aiden Pleterski, a self-proclaimed “Crypto King” residing in Whitby, Ontario, and his associate, Colin Murphy of Oshawa, Ontario, with fraud and money laundering offenses. The charges stem from a joint investigation – Project Swan – conducted by the Durham Regional Police Service (DRPS) and the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC).



Pleterski faces the most serious allegations, including violating a court order (pursuant to subsection 517(1) of the Criminal Code) issued on May 14, 2024. He is also charged with one count of fraud exceeding $5,000 (Section 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code) and one count of laundering proceeds of crime (Section 462.31(1)(a) of the Criminal Code). Pleterski remains in custody pending a bail hearing.









Murphy, the second suspect, is charged with a single count of fraud exceeding $5,000. Unlike Pleterski, he was released after signing an undertaking, a legal promise to appear in court.  The OSC issued a public advisory urging investors solicited by the suspects to contact the commission. The regulator expressed gratitude to those who have already provided information to aid the ongoing investigation.The OSC’s Enforcement Branch and the DRPS Financial Crimes Unit led the investigation, with assistance from the Toronto Police Service, York Regional Police, and FINTRAC. Both the OSC and DRPS emphasized investor protection. They advise the public to exercise caution when approached with investment opportunities or financial advice. The authorities recommend using the  “Check Before You Invest” and “Registered crypto asset trading platforms” pages of their websites to verify the registration status of investment vendors.

South Korean Crypto Market Soars to $32.4B as Bitcoin Recovers to $66,000 | Coinspeaker



In addition to the increased daily trading activities in South Korea, local crypto exchanges also experienced growth in user base well ahead of the global crypto surge that pushed prices to unprecedented levels in early 2024.

The South Korean crypto market has experienced significant growth over the past year, reaching a new  height of  $32.4 billion. The surge was driven by increased interest in the digital asset industry, particularly Bitcoin (BTC), which reached $73,000 in March following a two-year rebound.
Despite the crypto asset dipping below $57,000 in April and now climbing back to $66,000, it did not deter investors from engaging with the emerging economy.




South Korean Crypto Market Hits New Milestone
According to reports citing an annual survey detailing the state of the virtual asset market during the latter half of 2023, the market capitalization of South Korean virtual assets sector surged by an astonishing 43.6 trillion won ($32.4 billion).
However, this figure was only generated from licenced exchanges in the country such as Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax. In the last six months of 2023 alone, these companies recorded a 53% increase in market capitalization equivalent to $11.2 billion, compared to the first half of the year.
The survey findings was released on May 16 by the South Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU), a division of the Financial Services Commission. The data were collected from 22 local exchanges and 7 wallet and custodial service providers in the country.
The study found that between July and December last year, the country’s crypto sector gained massive traction from traders looking to explore the market. The surveyed exchanges saw increased in trading volumes, daily activities and other areas of their business operations.
“Trading volume, market capitalization, operating income of exchanges, deposits in Korean won all increased compared to the first half due to the rise in crypto prices and recovery of investor sentiment. The number of crypto trading users rebounded from the first half of 2023,” said KoFIU.
Daily Trading Volume
The daily trading volume of domestic virtual assets during the latter part of 2023 reached 3.6 trillion won ( $2.6 billion). The figure represents a 24% surge compared to the first half.
In the KRW market, the average daily trading volume saw a 24% increase to $2.6 billion. Despite this increase, the coin market experienced a decline of 44% to $30,000.
The coin market refers to crypto-to-crypto transactions where traders exchange their digital asset holdings for other types of cryptocurrencies without involving national currencies like dollars or Korean won.
Individual Investors Lead Surge in Registered Users
In addition to the increased daily trading activities in South Korea, local crypto exchanges also experienced growth in user base well ahead of the global crypto surge that pushed prices to unprecedented levels in early 2024. According to the survey, active users of registered exchanges in the country soared by 390,000 to reach 6.45 million by the close of 2023.
This surge in users, accounting for over 10% of the nation’s total population, was predominantly driven by individual investors trading Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (Ether), and other altcoins.
This group of investors made up 99% of the total number of active registered users, with nearly 60% of them falling within the age range of 30s and 40s.

Why Is the Crypto Market Up Today?


The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) shot up above $2.3 trillion as the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading came in cooler than expectations. The headline CPI April came in at 3.4% year on year against the expectations of 3.6% from March’s 3.8%.
Along with this Bitcoin price too surged and so did the altcoins with Fantom leading the pack with a 24% rise.
In the news today:-

Ripple joins hands with Cosmos’ Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based protocol Evmos to build an XRP Ledger sidechain. This chain will be designed to be EVM-compatible.
IOTA launched its “Testnet 2.0” which will enable the migration of the chain from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). The aim is to improve the scalability and efficiency of the network.


TOTAL Breaks Out
The total market cap broke out of the symmetrical triangle it was in for the past month on the back of softening inflation. This brought the total value of all crypto assets to $2.32 trillion, adding nearly $140 billion in the span of a single day.
If the support at $2.3 is secured, the crypto market cap could continue rising gradually.

However, losing the same support could result in a fall back towards $2.25 trillion or lower.

Bitcoin Price Breaches $65,000
Bitcoin’s price too rallied along with the rest of the altcoins as the biggest crypto asset in the world crossed the $65,000 mark. BTC can be seen trading at $65,800 at the time of writing, after closing above $66,000 yesterday.
The flag pattern suggests a 45% uptick is on the cards but the practical outlook would be a breach of $68,500 in the coming days.

On the other hand, this rise might also trigger corrections at the hands of investors should they move to book profits.

Fantom Surprises the Market
Among all the top altcoins, Fantom’s price rise placed it at the top of the best-performing asset list. The altcoin increased by more than 24% to breach the $8 barrier at the moment. FTM has entered the resistance box between $0.80 and $0.88.
This range has been tested as support and resistance, making it a crucial area to breach above. Flipping it into support could trigger a major rally for the cryptocurrency.

However, the altcoin has failed a breach in the past. If the same occurs this time as well, Fantom’s price could drop back down to $7. Further drawdown will bring it to $6.3 support floor.

First Bitcoin Statement from Vanguard's New CEO! - Bitcoin Sistemi

US-based investment company Vanguard, which has a negative perspective on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, recently introduced its new CEO.
Vanguard, which manages $7.2 trillion in assets, has named Salim Ramji, the former head of BlackRock's global ETF division, as its new CEO.


It was wondered whether there would be a change in Vanguard's decision regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs regarding the transfer of Salim Ramji, an important name in the launch of BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, to Vanguard.
Unlike global giants such as BlackRock, Vanguard's new CEO Salim Ramji, who has a negative attitude towards cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, gave his first interview and announced that the BTC ETF decision will not be reversed.





Speaking to Barron's, Ramji said that Vanguard has not changed its mind about Bitcoin and that the company will not reverse its decision not to launch spot Bitcoin.
In his statement, Ramji stated that his new company, Vanguard, represents consistency and that crypto-related investment products do not align with the “company's investment philosophy.”



“I think it's important for companies to be consistent in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer.
I heard the statement from the company's CIO, Greg Davis, and I think it is entirely consistent with Vanguard's investment philosophy. “It's a logical and consistent point of view.”

Vanguard views Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a speculative and immature asset class.

Crypto casinos can onboard millions of users into Web3 - MyPrize CEO

Over the long course of human history, one activity that has followed humanity practically everywhere is gambling. The earliest evidence of human gambling dates back to the Paleolithic era, and it has been present in every major civilization and society since then.As technology has evolved, so have the ways people gamble. While major gambling hubs such as Las Vegas and Macau still dominate with brick-and-mortar casinos and entertainment, online casinos have exploded in recent years — and many of these websites use cryptocurrency to power their platforms. The largest, Stake, reportedly generated a whopping $2.6 billion in gross revenue in 2022 alone.On episode 14 of The Agenda podcast, hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond spoke with Zach Bruch, founder and CEO of MyPrize — a crypto casino that recently emerged from stealth and is now open for early access — to better understand how crypto casinos work, where they fit into the broader crypto ecosystem, and how they might be silently onboarding millions of people into Web3.Crypto and gambling: a match made in heaven?Bruch argued that the biggest use case for crypto in 2024 is still speculation, and this is playing out via the memecoin craze, which The Agenda recently discussed in depth in episode 34 with Andreas Brekken of SideShift.ai. According to Bruch, memecoins are so popular “because people love to speculate. People are having fun with their friends. They’re participating as a group. They’re rallying around something, and they’re speculating together.”“Gambling has been around since the very first day of human life. People love taking risk. Crypto is the epitome of that.” Bruch sees crypto casinos as fun places where people can come together as friends to engage in risk-taking and speculative behavior in a fun environment where — at least for MyPrize — the minimum bets can be as low as $0.01.But operating an online crypto casino is not without its challenges. For one, it must comply with the regulatory requirements of each country it operates in, which is why many online casinos — MyPrize included — have separate websites with different functionalities for United States-based customers.The security concerns also differ, as crypto casinos have to make sure their code and smart contracts are bulletproof. In September 2023, Stake was hacked for a reported $41 million. According to Bruch, operating a crypto casino is more akin to operating a crypto exchange: “You’re building user accounts. You’re thinking about AML, KYC, fraud, chargeback risk, asset security, all those different types of things. And all of that comes into play for an online casino as well, right?”Gambling as a path toward mass adoptionBruch told The Agenda that online casinos offer significant on-ramps into the crypto ecosystem. “Most people don’t even recognize this, but some of the largest applications for crypto today are on-ramping into the casino space,” he said, offering the opportunity to then funnel these customers into the broader crypto ecosystem. Bruch said that this is made easier because gambling already has a long history of having a great product-market fit.“You have all these traditional folks that aren’t actually active members of the crypto ecosystem or the crypto ecosystem that we know it, but are active gamers and gamblers in online casinos, and they are buying crypto to go play in these sites.”This is the long-term vision of MyPrize: users will on-ramp into crypto through the casino and then remain in Web3. “We’re starting by creating a killer application that will onboard millions of users, and then we’ll funnel those millions of users into a much broader decentralized ecosystem,” Bruch said.To hear more from Bruch’s conversation with The Agenda — including the future of “GambleFi,” whether there will be casinos in the metaverse and more — listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Arbitrum Reaches All-Time High for Newly Created Addresses | Cryptopolitan

Arbitrum (ARB) addresses reached an all-time high in May after new users flowed into the platform to make use of its DeFi and NFT offers. The peak activity news also helped ARB recover faster during the latest rally. The Arbitrum network is now ranked among top Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum, and offers faster and clearer smart contracts for messages and activities between L1 and L2 addresses. The address peak in Arbitrum was also sudden, with unique active wallets now close to 900,000. The generation of new wallets started the growth trend in March, and went vertical in the past two weeks. One of the reasons for the growth of Arbitrum is the direct targeting of developers. New teams have started using Arbitrum as a basis for their decentralized apps. Source: NansenThe other reason for the growth of Aave is the optimization of gas fees, which have fallen since the end of March, while transaction counts expanded. Arbitrum already carries some leading multi-chain apps, including Uniswap, Sushi Swap, OKX DEX, Trader Joe, and Aave. Web3 gaming is also experiencing an active period, this time choosing Arbitrum’s tech for new competitive experiences. The Arbitrum DAO is currently voting to add more projects as Orbit Chains, with opportunities to connect to other L1 or L2 networks.Arbitrum Introduces Orbit Chains for Easier Infrastructure CreationArbitrum aims to grow more sustainably by drawing on crypto startups. One of the main tools are the Orbit Chains, which offers a fast creation of new layers. New projects can now spend a minimal time to build the desired features, setting up their mainnets without delay. In a market where new tokens arrive every minute, projects choose Arbitrum for the immediate creation of new features. Orbit Chains allow Arbitrum to become a hub for projects, making it similar to other platforms. Offering easier chain creation and connectivity was the main point behind Polkadot, Cosmos, and even Avalanche with its subnet creation. DeFi Grows with ARB Connections to Other ChainsArbitrum also offers a cross-chain bridge, which is highly liquid and has a daily turnover above $5M even on a slow day. The Arbitrum bridge is widely used for wrapped Ethereum and various stablecoins. The bridge is part of the DeFi ecosystem, where Arbitrum has grown its locked value to $2.76M. The performance of DeFi on Arbitrum is an exception, as its biggest growth phase happened in late 2023. Unlike other networks, Arbitrum did not peak in 2021-2022, and instead is waiting for more sustainable growth. Arbitrum recently started hosting liquid restaking, a tool to tap the value of locked ETH tokens. The Renzo multi-chain project increased its holdings on Arbitrum by 25% in a month, locking in more than $324M in notional value.Bitcoin DeFi Starts to Spread to ArbitrumArbitrum’s growth may also be tied to attempts to use Bitcoin and tap its value in new decentralized tools. Wrapped BTC coins are not new and have been used as collateral in various projects. But now, platforms are competing again to integrate Bitcoin into decentralized finance. Projects on Arbitrum create gamified solutions for Bitcoin DeFi, combined with NFT collections. There is still no clear-cut way to bring BTC products on Arbitrum, as most of the offers will come from independent builders. ARB Token Recovers Close to $1Despite the growth of use cases, the ARB token is near its lower trading range at $0.99. The asset peaked above $2.20 in early 2024, and has returned to its baseline price. ARB is now in a period of re-accumulation, though some traders expect a new downturn to the $0.80 range. However, during a period of increasing usage, ARB sets the expectations for a new rally. The token has traded for over a year, and has positioned itself successfully among leading L2 solutions. Cryptopolitan reporting by Hristina Vasileva

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Tops $66K as Interest-Rate Cuts Loom

Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) plans to offer spot bitcoin trading in response to demand from clients, according to the Financial Times. Already the top bitcoin futures exchange, CME is aiming to take on the likes of Binance and Coinbase, who dominate the spot market. “Crypto exchanges might lose some business with the potential debut of a bitcoin spot market on the CME, a global derivatives giant, as the present bull run is particularly driven by institutions, who prefer to trade on regulated avenues," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said. The spot trading business could be run through the EBC currency trading venue in Switzerland, the report added.

Shiba Inu Team Member Declares Altcoin Season A Time For Shibarium To Shine | Bitcoinist.com


								As the cryptocurrency industry moves toward a thriving altcoin Season, popular Shiba Inu team member and marketing lead Lucie has proclaimed the season is the perfect time to showcase the potential of Shibarium, the project’s layer 2 blockchain solution, to the larger cryptocurrency community. In this statement, Lucie positions Shibarium as a major participant in the altcoin boom by highlighting its distinct benefits and technological advancements.
Altcoin Season: A Golden Opportunity For Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Capabilities
On Wednesday, Shiba Inu marketing head Lucie shared her insights on the much-anticipated altcoin season and its impact on the project’s ecosystem. According to Lucie, Altcoin season is a thrilling time when altcoins frequently perform better than Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency asset, which presents a fantastic opportunity for Shibarium and the ShibArmy.
The post read:
Altcoin season is an exciting period when alternative crypto often outperforms Bitcoin. For Shibarium and the ShibArmy, it is a fantastic opportunity.
During altcoin season, Lucie pointed out that funds tend to move from Bitcoin to altcoins such as SHIB, SHEB, BONE, LEASH, and other Shibarium tokens. This shift in investment will potentially trigger the value of these altcoins considerably. Thus Shibarium may become more widely used and benefit the ecology, due to its distinct qualities.

Another aspect highlighted by Lucie to be triggered by the altcoin season is Shiba Inu’s community power. In the course of the period, the fervor of the ShibArmy may fuel more visibility and appeal of Shibarium tokens.
The altcoin season will also cause an increase in trading volume and liquidity, according to the marketing head. “Higher trading volume means more liquidity, making it easier to trade Shibarium tokens,” she stated.
Lastly, Lucie advocates the growth of the layer 2 solution during the altcoin season, as the excitement may encourage Shibarium’s growth and innovation, which would benefit the entire crypto community.
As a result, the Shiba Inu team member believes that making money during the altcoin season is not all to consider but also an opportunity to establish Shibarium‘s reputation in the cryptocurrency space and highlight its potential.
How To Determine Altcoin Season
Lucie has also identified several factors to observe in order to determine when an altcoin season begins. The first aspect to watch out for is the investors’ interest in Bitcoin and the optimism around its price when the bull cycle starts.

When Bitcoin appreciates, it attracts all of the attention and capital for a period. After experiencing significant increases, investors sell some Bitcoin to lock in profits, thereby looking for the next big investment, turning their attention towards altcoins, triggering an altcoin season.
With more investors shifting their investments towards the altcoin market, prices will increase significantly, surpassing Bitcoin’s performance in the period. “So, a bull run starts with Bitcoin, then money flows into altcoins, creating altcoin season where altcoins surge in value,” she added.

How Humanity Protocol CEO drove his previous firm to insolvency


The CEO of Humanity Protocol, a reported $1 billion ‘Worldcoin rival’ that’s raised $30 million, almost bankrupted his $1.5 billion smartphone firm, burning through $170 million in investor funds.
Terence Kwok founded Hong Kong-based Tink Labs in 2012. The Unicorn company raised millions in funding to provide hotels with smartphones for guests to use during their stay. 
His goal was to give guests an alternative to roaming charges, improve their hotel experience, and sell gathered data on customer preferences.
However, the Financial Times (FT) reports that his firm began to operate at a loss of £9.06 million in 2017. This was reportedly due to multiple factors, including his policy of aggressive expansion, roaming charges becoming cheaper and more accessible, and hotels not wanting to pay for the phones he had given out.
Terence Kwok’s Tink Labs liquidated 
According to a former employee, Tink Labs investor SoftBank forced it to abruptly stop a major project over concerns the firm was “funnelling money from the joint venture in Japan to stay afloat in other regions.”
Kwok reportedly struggled to pay employees and contractors and eventually ordered mass layoffs before closing Tink Labs on August 1. Laid-off employees reportedly “smeared cake all over the walls and floor,” as they left the firm’s Oxford offices. 
Tink Labs’ European arm began winding up in January 2020 before undergoing insolvency proceedings. The former head of various Tink Labs human resource operations told FT, “I never thought it would last but I didn’t think it would close so quickly.” She also told the FT that Kwok only cared about “making money.”
Terence Kwok CEO of human palm ID crypto firm
Last year, Kwok launched Humanity Protocol, a blockchain-based identity firm that relies on scanning the palms of people’s hands as a means of identification.
The firm reportedly raised $30 million in funding from Kingsway Capital, Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com, and Shima Capital, and has already reached Unicorn status. 

Kwok told Bloomberg that Humanity Protocol will use its own crypto token to pay for verification fees. The funding round reportedly ensures investors’ future tokens through a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT). 
A test network will reportedly be launched in the second quarter and an infrared camera is being worked on that will allow your phone to scan your veins as an extra layer of security. He claims to have a waitlist of 500,000 people for the project.

Coindesk dubbed Humanity Protocol a ‘Worldcoin rival.’ Indeed, it’s similar to Worldcoin’s ‘proof of personhood’ system. Kwok calls his concept ‘Proof of Humanity,’ and told Bloomberg that unlike Worldcoin or Face ID, “It’s not your face and it’s also not your eyeballs. It’s much less dystopian.”

The pseudonymous leader of the Shiba Inu developer team has addressed the SHIB community with a celebratory tweet about the upcoming launch of the upgraded ShibaSwap decentralized exchange on the layer-2 solution Shibarium.The top developer of SHIB, Kaal Dhairya, also tweeted about that, going into detail about the new iteration of the ShibaSwap DEX.Shytoshi Kusama makes celebratory announcementIn a tweet published on May 15, the mysterious SHIB lead, Kusama, tagged a post by the official SHIB account on X and wrote that he is proud of the improvements and innovations made by the team of developers, and Kaal Dhairya in particular.Specifically, Kusama meant the bringing of the ShibaSwap version to the Shibarium blockchain. The SHIB leader also added some intrigue for the community, as he stated that “so much more in store as we march forward.”Kaal Dhairya quoted Shytoshi Kusama’s tweet as he also added a comment to the announcement. The top SHIB developer specified that the new version of ShibaSwap’s main focus will be on the discovery of new meme coins – “so all the creative geniuses meme away,” he said encouragingly.Dhairya also promised that the SHIB team will continue to push out updates and upgrades regularly going forward, since SHIB, Shibarium and everything about them is “not a race, it’s a marathon.” Now, the ShibaSwap DEX will be operating on both the Ethereum and Shibarium blockchains, with a firm bridge between them to allow moving assets from one to the other and back, thus expanding opportunities for the SHIB army and adding adoption and utility to Shibarium tokens.Shiba Inu price skyrockets on newsFueled by the news of ShibaSwap launching on Shibarium, the price of the native SHIB meme coin has soared. Over the past 24 hours, Shiba Inu has printed a massive 12% increase, soaring from $0.00002293 to the $0.00002577 level.A tiny pullback followed that astounding increase as SHIB stepped back by a marginal 2%.As the price soared overnight, an anonymous meme coin holder transferred a jaw-dropping amount of three trillion Shiba Inu from an unregistered wallet to the popular trading platform Robinhood in the last 24 hours. This amount of Shiba Inu is evaluated at more than $74 million in fiat.

                        Launched in January 2023, the Ordinals Protocol opened the Bitcoin ecosystem up to the craziness of NFTs, enabling users to inscribe data – images, art, videos, and more – to individual Bitcoin denominations known as satoshis.The idea of bringing NFTs to the Bitcoin network might have seemed frivolous to some.Others, though, recognized the significance and heralded Ordinals as a shot in the arm for the Proof-of-Work blockchain.Strong as it was, the digital gold narrative would now be supported by another compelling use-case as bitcoin became more than a deflationary digital currency: now it could double as a non-fungible piece of digital art or a piece of music.Ordinals: From Inscriptions to Infinity
The arrival of Ordinals effectively enabled the minting of NFTs directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain for the first time. The idea is credited to ex-Bitcoin Core contributor and Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor.Ordinals represents a system wherein serial numbers are assigned to satoshis, giving each a unique identifier which can be tracked across transactions and enabling users to attach supplementary data to them (inscriptions).Mere months after the arrival of Ordinals, an anonymous developer pioneered BRC-20, a token standard that extended Bitcoin functionality by supporting the minting and transfer of fungible tokens via a protocol.The experimental standard – which utilizes Ordinal inscriptions to embed token data directly on the blockchain – has been a revelation: less than a year after the launch of Ordinals, moonshot BRC-20 meme coin ORDI surpassed $1 billion in market cap.As for Ordinals, around 66.5 million inscriptions have been made on satoshis according to Dune Analytics.Given there are 100 million satoshis per bitcoin, we have some way to go before inscriptions equate to a whole coin. The dollar amount generated by Ordinals fees, meanwhile, exceeds $417 million.In less than 18 months since Ordinals officially launched, there have been many meaningful milestones, from the debut of the first Ordinals Collection (Bitcoin Shrooms) to the arrival of the first-ever inscription service (OrdinalsBot) and the aforementioned success of ORDI.Among the biggest milestones was the opening of a Bitcoin NFT marketplace on Magic Eden, which set the scene for frantic trading of Bitcoin-based BRC-20 NFTs, akin to the Ethereum NFT boom of 2021.How Do Bitcoin Ordinals Compare to Ethereum NFTs?
So, how do the bitcoin-based NFTs conceived compare to the more long-established equivalents on Ethereum?The major difference worth noting is that Ethereum NFTs are created using smart contracts based on standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155.This actually means that NFT data can be stored on different layers of the Ethereum blockchain or even on the InterPlanetary File System, with NFTs benefitting from greater functionality. By contrast, bitcoin NFTs are recorded directly on the eponymous blockchain.Another point of divergence relates to transaction fees. Because Ordinals are stored on-chain, transaction fees are higher. Ethereum NFTs, by contrast, can be stored off-chain and thus benefit from lower fees.Because NFT royalties work via smart contracts, and Bitcoin is not a smart contract network, Ordinals do not entitle creators to royalty revenue on re-sales of their work.That said, there are initiatives which seek to bring smart contract capability to Bitcoin, covenants being one example.Although maligned by some for bringing DeFi degeneracy to Bitcoin (not to mention driving up network fees), Ordinals and BRC-20 have been praised by the likes of Vitalik Buterin, who hailed the “organic return of builder culture” to the PoW network last summer.It is a culture that has collided with Ethereum’s in the form of the BRC-721 token standard which enables the bridging of ERC-721 NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin.Interestingly, Ordinals can be leveraged for purposes beyond inscribing a message onto a satoshi: a recent initiative by major BTC hodler MicroStrategy sees the protocol utilized to enable the creation of trustless, tamper-proof decentralized identifiers (DIDs).There is an argument to be made that Ordinals has learned lessons from the previous NFT boom and, since inscriptions cannot be modified post-creation and bitcoin NFTs are inherently scarcer, they are better at preserving their value. Time will tell.The Blooming of Bitcoin Layer-2sThe success of Ordinals is inextricably linked with the rise of Bitcoin Layer-2s, secondary protocols built on top of Bitcoin and intended to address the network’s scalability challenges while enhancing its utility.In a sense, this evolution of the Bitcoin network is following a similar trend to Ethereum, which spawned its own multitude of Layer-2s during the last major DeFi boom.One such Layer-2 is Merlin Chain, which leverages ZK-Rollup technology to compress transaction data and therefore enable faster and cheaper transactions.Other distinguishing features of the L2 include its decentralized oracle network, on-chain BTC fraud-proof modules, and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.Despite only launching earlier this year, Merlin has become by far the biggest Bitcoin sidechain, its $1 billion + TVL vastly exceeding that of Rootstock, Stacks and other Bitcoin L2s.The team behind Merlin Chain previously developed BRC-420, a standard that transforms Ordinals inscriptions into assets that can interact with each other – known as recursive inscriptions.Notably, BRC-420 introduces a royalty standard, entitling developers to revenues from usage of their creations, with the team committed to unleashing the potential of Bitcoin’s native assets, protocols like Ordinals, and attendant products.With the market cap of Bitcoin L2 solutions now exceeding $4.3 billion less than 18 months after the launch of Ordinals, Casey Rodarmor has a lot to be proud of.Not that the developer has rested on his laurels: in April he launched Runes, a protocol for fungible tokens that leverages Bitcoin.

Youthful Demography Fuels South Korea's Crypto Boom


							

Retail investors drive South Korea’s rise in global crypto market



A young demography reshaping South Korea’s crypto landscape



Upcoming regulations signal proactive approach to crypto oversight




In a recent Bloomberg Crypto report, South Korean retail investors are credited with fueling the surge in local digital asset exchanges, predating the global crypto boom that pushed prices to record highs earlier in 2024. 



The Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KOFIU) revealed a significant uptick in crypto participation, with active users on registered exchanges surging by 390,000 to 6.45 million by year-end 2023.







This surge in activity is particularly noteworthy, representing over 10% of the country’s total population, according to reports. The majority of these investors, categorized as “individual” investors, fall within the 30-40 age range, comprising nearly 60%.



Daily average crypto trading volume in South Korea also witnessed a substantial increase of 24%, reaching 3.6 trillion won ($2.6 billion) during the same period. This trading activity surge paralleled a remarkable 53% increase in the total value of crypto held by registered exchanges, reaching 43.6 trillion won.



These figures underscore South Korea’s growing importance in the global crypto landscape. The South Korean Won (KRW) emerged as the most-used currency for crypto trading in the first quarter of 2024, surpassing even the US dollar. Upbit, the biggest exchange in the country, is often in the top five global trading exchanges.









KOFIU attributed the surge in various metrics, including trading volume, market capitalization, exchange operating income, and Korean won deposits, to the rise in crypto prices and a rebound in investor sentiment.



Despite the recent collapse of TerraUSD, a stablecoin developed by South Korean native Do Kwon, the country’s crypto enthusiasm remains resilient. This resilience is further evidenced by a major political party’s campaign pledge to grant Koreans access to US Bitcoin ETFs during the recent parliamentary election.



Looking ahead, South Korea is poised to implement the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in July, introducing stricter regulations for exchanges and harsher penalties for wrongdoing in the sector.

Ethereum Flashing Bearish Signal, According to Crypto Analyst Benjamin Cowen - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Widely followed cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that the price of Ethereum (ETH) could depreciate drastically.
Cowen tells his 801,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum has fallen below the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB), an indicator consisting of a 20-week simple moving average and a 20-week exponential moving average used to determine whether the price of an asset is in bullish or bearish territory.










“The last time that Ethereum fell below its Bull Market Support Band was actually about 30 weeks ago. Or the last time it was below its 20-week simple moving average was about 30 weeks ago. So it’s been quite a while and now we have closed below it once again.”
According to Cowen, the price of Ethereum fell drastically during two previous times that closely resemble the current moment when the second-largest crypto asset closed below the BMSB.
“In both cases, after it fell below the Bull Mark Support Band, Ethereum/US dollar then fell about another 50%…
…50% from here [around $2,970] puts ETH all the way back down at around $1,400.”
Ethereum is trading at $2,902 at time of writing.
The widely followed analyst says that he foresees the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair bottoming out over the coming weeks though the Ethereum/US dollar (ETH/USD) pair could take longer to form a bottom.

ETP: 21Shares analyzes the impact of the Pectra update on Ethereum

Recently 21Shares, a leading company in the issuance of ETPs linked to crypto, analyzed the impact of the technical improvements that will be made by the upcoming Pectra update to the Ethereum blockchain, scheduled for Q4 2024/Q1 2025.
On paper, Pectra should bring greater efficiency to the capital locked in staking and greater flexibility in terms of transaction management.
In particular, the EIP-7702, recently proposed by Vitalik Buterin, if included in Pectra (replacing EIP 3074) could provide new smart contract functionalities to users’ EOA wallets adding very interesting features.Let’s see what it’s all about.

21Shares: the largest ETP manager studies the improvements that will be made to the Ethereum blockchain thanks to Pectra
According to Adrian Fritz, Head of Research at the largest crypto ETP issuer 21Shares, the impact of the upcoming Pectra update on the Ethereum blockchain could be crucial for the future cryptographic ecosystem.
Pectra, arrives after the recent implementation of Dencun, and will be a combination of the two upgrades Electra and Prague, respectively aimed at changing the consensus level and the execution level of the network.
According to the schedule set by the Ethereum Foundation and its team of developers, the update and the next hard fork of the network will arrive between the end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025.
The Nethermind client has already revealed to the public that the implementation on the testnet was successful and now the next appointment is with pectra-devnet-0.

Pectra represents a response to the evolution of the environment surrounding the Ethereum blockchain, with numerous improvements that will be made thanks to the 6 EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) that will be included within it:
EIP-6110: Provide validator deposits on the chain
EIP-7002: execution-level activatable outputs
EIP-7549: Moving the committee index outside the attestation
EIP-2537: precompilation for operations on the BLS12-381 curve
EIP-3074: AUTH and AUTHCALL opcodes
EIP-7251: Increase MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE
As the famous ETP issuer 21Shares analyzes, the Pectra update as a whole will help strengthen network stability and enhance user experience.
In particular, one of the main focuses of the update is aimed at increasing the stake quota to participate in consensus from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, avoiding the fragmentation of capital by large validators who currently have to use a multitude of different wallets to manage the stake on the Beacon chain.
It is worth mentioning the EIP 3074, which aims to bring significant improvements to the management of resources in a wallet, including smart contract functionalities to EOA accounts.
Simplifying, we can summarize the effects in the introduction of the so-called “sponsored transactions” that will allow the use of the Ethereum network even in the absence of ETH to pay the gas.
The same EIP also wants to introduce the possibility of performing multiple actions in a single transaction and at the same time adding a social recovery solution for all inactive wallets after one year.

21Shares reminds us that Pectra will also solve the problem of so-called “empty accounts“, that is, those users with assets or funds invested equal to zero, by excluding them from the network.
This is how you should free up network space, which will lead to a general lightening of the system and, consequently, to a simpler and faster processing of transactions.
Vitalik’s EIP-7702 could replace EIP-3047: debates among Ethereum community experts begin
Until a few days ago it was clear that EIP-3047 would be included in the Pectra hard fork, now it is no longer so obvious after Vitalik Buterin proposed the new EIP-7702 which could replace the first one by addressing some critical issues.
As stated by the ETP crypto issuer 21Shares, this proposal, similar to EIP 3047, aims to transform users’ EOA portfolios into more sophisticated accounts, but with a more streamlined modus operandi.

While the EIP-3074 proposed by developers Ayush Bherwani and 0xDanki aims to implement the ability for EOA wallets to authorize smart contracts and perform transactions on their behalf, Vitalik’s EIP 7702 allows the same wallets to temporarily become accounts authorized to sign smart contracts during a transaction, reverting back afterwards.
This is a subtle difference but with very visible effects because in the first approach it is necessary to introduce new operating codes (auth and authcall) in addition to the implementation of invoker contracts that would complicate the work of the Ethereum network.
Vitalik’s EIP-7702 compared to the first one turns out to be more flexible (although technically more complex to implement) but at the same time guarantees full compatibility with account abstraction and with the ERC-4337 standard.
It is worth noting how EIP-3047 entails risks associated with the authorization of smart contracts, adding the possibility of emptying a complete address with a single signature (as it happens on Solana), while currently “n” signatures are required, where “n” is the number of assets owned by an EOA.
At the moment this EIP, as described in the previous paragraph, has already been included in Pectra’s implementation program, but after Vitalik’s intervention it may be replaced.
The debates of the community and industry experts continue unabated to understand which will be the best solution to adopt.

According to Adrian Fritz’s comment, 21Shares is in favor of Vitalik’s proposal as it expands the functionalities and potential of cryptographic wallets, while maintaining the security component intact. Here are his words:
“At 21Shares, we look favorably upon EIP 7702, which also reflects our thesis that cryptocurrencies will never be able to onboard millions more people without providing them with an intuitive interface that resembles the user-friendly experience they are familiar with on Web2 applications.”
The wish for Ethereum blockchain is that these improvement proposals will be successfully implemented following the established timeline and that they can bring improvements on the same level as what was done with Dencun, which significantly reduced the cost of fees on the network’s layer-2.

ShibaSwap Moves to Shibarium: Lower Fees, Faster Transactions, and Enhanced Utility | Cryptoglobe


                                
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a decentralized cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator or group of creators known as Ryoshi. It is an Ethereum-based altcoin that features the Shiba Inu dog breed as its mascot. SHIB is often labeled as a “meme coin” or parody cryptocurrency, akin to Dogecoin, which it aims to rival or even surpass as a “Dogecoin killer.”



The Shiba Inu ecosystem is built around the concept of being a community-driven project, with its principles detailed in a “woof paper.” This project began from the ground up, without any pre-existing community or team, emphasizing the power of collective decentralization to create something unique and impactful. The ecosystem comprises tokens such as $SHIB, $LEASH, and $BONE, along with native SHIBOSHIs and SHEboshi NFTs.



ShibaSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that serves as the cornerstone of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It enables users to trade, farm, and stake SHIB and other tokens within the ecosystem, such as BONE and LEASH. ShibaSwap operates on the Ethereum network and uses its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, providing a platform for secure and efficient transactions.



In January 2023, Shibarium was introduced as a layer-two blockchain designed to run on top of the Ethereum network. Shibarium aims to alleviate congestion, introduce staking capabilities, lower gas fees, and offer a framework for decentralized applications (DApps) and Web3 expansion within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It went live in August 2023.



On 16 May 2024, the Shiba Inu ecosystem announced a significant update to its decentralized finance (DeFi) offerings. The decentralized exchange (DEX) ShibaSwap has now been ported to the Shibarium blockchain. This move marks a crucial upgrade, allowing ShibaSwap to operate on both the Ethereum and Shibarium networks. This dual functionality aims to empower creators, foster connections, and drive innovation within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The transition to Shibarium introduces a variety of new utilities for ShibaSwap, enhancing its capabilities as a DEX and decentralized application (DApp) platform. Key improvements include a new and enhanced dashboard, streamlined user processes for adding and withdrawing liquidity, staking, and trend analysis. Additionally, the platform now features discovery charts for new and trending tokens, helping traders navigate market volatility. The onboarding process for new tokens onto ShibaSwap has also been simplified.



The Shiba Inu community is encouraged to utilize ShibaSwap on the Shibarium blockchain. A portion of transaction fees will be used to enhance the value of the liquidity provider (LP) tokens used in swap transactions. This increase in LP token value is expected to benefit yield farmers within the community.



Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, commented on the update, stating that the new ShibaSwap offers a transformative experience for DeFi innovators on Shibarium. The redesigned platform aims to support community tokens and invites current Shibarium tokens to port over easily. Kusama emphasized that this is an early version of ShibaSwap, with more updates planned for the future.



Shibarium is designed to facilitate high-speed transactions with minimal gas fees, transforming the user experience in the blockchain space. Built on a community-first and environmentally friendly consensus mechanism, Shibarium enables the development of cost-effective protocols. This expansion enriches the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which includes the $SHIB and $LEASH tokens, SHEboshis DN-404 tokens, SHIB The Metaverse, the ShibaSwap DEX, and the Shiba Eternity game.

Bitcoin price: Here’s why QCP Capital expects BTC run to $74k - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Bitcoin surges past $66k after US CPI data triggers buyside pressure
Here’s why QCP Capital analysts say BTC could run to $74k

Bitcoin price surged past the $66,000 mark on Thursday to hit highs last seen in April amid a fresh dose of bullish sentiment.
BTC price reached $66,699 on US-based crypto exchange Coinbase, extending gains seen when markets soared on softer-than-expected US inflation data released on Wednesday.
Bitcoin price outlook: QCP Capital says bulls can reclaim the ATH
According to analysts at QCP Capital, the bullish momentum currently surrounding Bitcoin could see prices run to highs of $74,000.
The market reaction to the US Consumer Prices Index (CPI) data release, as well as the broader traction for spot Bitcoin ETFs, are potential catalysts.
“US CPI numbers triggered a break out of the range across risk assets. BTC has since traded back above 66k. ⁠We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of 74k. The desk saw sizable buyers of 100-120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot,” the Singapore-based platform said in a note on Thursday.
The analysts also pointed to the increased institutional demand for the flagship cryptocurrency. The last few days have seen large asset managers file their 13Fs, disclosing huge positions in spot Bitcoin ETFs.
For instance, Susquehanna, Morgan Stanley and the State of Wisconsin Investment Board have disclosed huge holdings of BTC ETFs. Asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld have invested roughly 3% and 2% of their assets under management (AUM) respectively into spot Bitcoin ETFs.
“The stars seem to be aligning on this breakout with significant sovereign and institutional adoption, abating inflation and upcoming US elections. Is this the resumption of the bull market?” the QCP traders pondered.
At the time of writing, the benchmark cryptocurrency was up more than 5% in 24 hours, with trading volume at over $37.8 billion and showcasing a 24-hour increase of 93%.
BTC price reached its all-time high of $73,737 on March 14.

Cryptocurrency Bill is Being Submitted to Parliament! Here is the Time! - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to NTV's news, the bill on the definition of cryptocurrencies will be presented to the Turkish Grand National Assembly today.
In the news, it was stated that AK Party Group Chairman Abdullah Güler will announce the details regarding the “Proposal Law on Amendments to the Capital Markets Law” at the press conference he will hold in the Turkish Grand National Assembly at 15.30 today.


The news also stated that the proposal will define crypto assets for the first time and transactions will be legally regulated.

In his previous statements, Minister of Treasury and Finance Mehmet Şimşek said that the legal definition of cryptocurrency assets will be made for the first time in the said bill.





The enactment of this proposal is of particular importance for Turkey to be removed from the FATF gray list.
FATF, which determines the compliance of world economies in the fight against financial crimes, included Turkey on the so-called gray list in 2021 because it fell behind in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. While Türkiye is found to be compatible with 39 of 40 standards, it aims to eliminate the last deficiency in this field with its crypto regulation.


Minister Şimşek said in a statement: “Fighting against financial crimes is among our main priorities. According to the report shared by FATF, our country is in compliance with 39 of 40 FATF standards. Within the scope of technical compliance, the only issue that continues to be prepared is the work on cryptocurrencies. Our necessary work on this issue has reached the final stage.” “As such, Turkey has become one of the most successful countries in technical harmonization. We are determined to continue our work in this context by increasing the efficiency we will provide in practice. We are making efforts to remove our country from the gray list.” said.

Bitcoin Nears All-Time High on Renewed Institutional Demand


							

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows surge to 2-week high of $303 million.



Bitcoin price jumps 7% to $66,567, near all-time high.



Hedge funds join the rally, with Millennium holding $2 billion in Bitcoin ETFs.




Bitcoin prices rallied into bullish territory fueled by a surge in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and a 7% price increase over the past day. This positive movement comes on the heels of key US inflation data meeting expectations, easing investor concerns.







On May 15th, spot Bitcoin ETF inflows in the US skyrocketed to a two-week high of $303 million. This significant inflow reflects renewed institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency, mirroring the positive sentiment in the market.



Fidelity’s FBTC fund led the charge, attracting a record-breaking $131 million on the day, its highest since March 26th. Bitwise’s BITB fund wasn’t far behind, experiencing a solid day with an inflow of $86 million, its highest since early March. Even Grayscale’s GBTC, which had seen outflows for the past four months, witnessed a reversal with a $27 million inflow.



This renewed institutional interest extends beyond traditional investment firms. Regulatory filings revealed that hedge fund giant Millennium Management holds a staggering $2 billion Bitcoin ETF portfolio. Millennium Management is now the largest holder of specific Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. Other notable hedge funds like Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital and Apollo Management Holdings also disclosed holdings in Bitcoin ETFs, further solidifying the institutional appetite for the digital asset.









The surge in ETF inflows coincided with a significant jump in Bitcoin’s price. On May 15th, Bitcoin surged 7%, reaching a high of $66,567 during early Asian trading. This brings Bitcoin within 10% of its all-time high, a milestone last achieved in December 2021.



The positive market sentiment can be partly attributed to the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on May 15th. The data met expectations, easing concerns about inflation, a key factor influencing Federal Reserve’ decisions on interest rates. Lower interest rates tend to be positive for riskier assets like Bitcoin, as they increase investor appetite for higher-yielding alternatives.

                        Roaring Kitty is back, igniting excitement across the meme coin markets. Wall Street Pepe was leading the pack but in a dramatic collapse, the price has now crashed.This article will provide an analysis of WSP’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more compelling investment opportunity at this time.Wall Street Pepe’s dramatic rise has been fuelled by the spill-over from Roaring Kitty’s return, and has been egged on by a community sharing ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ inspired Pepe memes.WSP Price Analysis: As Wall Street Pepe Falls in Spectacular Rug-Pull – Is This The New Norm for GME Linked Tokens?
As price action slams down into true capitulation, Wall Street Pepe is currently trading at a market price of $0.0001315 (representing a 24-hour change of -98.85%).This comes after WSP price shocked retail markets Yesterday, mounting an incredible +14,400% rally to hit an all-time high at $0.01875.However, despite efforts by holders to consolidate these major gains above higher support at $0.01255, all was too good to be true – with a major dump engulfing the chart around 21:45PM UTC.In classic rug-pull form, as the dust settles, WSP price has been left in the dirt following a -98.5% bleed-out.Now, with a market cap of just $13,000 – it seems likely that WSP is finished, and set to join the ranks of countless GME-linked meme coins that have pumped and dumped since the return of Roaring Kitty.But WSP is not a unique instance; traders across the market have suffered the scourge of naughty blockchain developers deploying quickfire scams on DEX markets.From GME to KITTY to GameStop token; all have rugged – this is normal and to be expected with too good to be true meme coins.However, it doesn’t have to be that way, some meme coin projects have committed development teams on a mission to create lasting projects with strong staying power (think Dogcoins like DOGE or SHIB).Discover DOGEVERSE: Could Presales Offer Better Meme Coin Play?
While SOL presents a market-leading opportunity, the most significant gains are often found in presale investments, which allow investors to get in early and potentially secure the majority of a project’s growth.Just imagine investing in WSP before it hit the market and skyrocketed 14,000%.VIDEOOne such opportunity in the SOL ecosystem is the DOGEVERSE presale – which has unlocked viral success over the last month to hit $15M raised in the ongoing presale.Aiming to be the first multi-chain incarnation of DOGE, DOGEVERSE is positioned to grow rapidly as market participants race to grab a piece of the pie.DOGEVERSE is still raising funds at the presale stage and will start preparing for exchange listings very soon.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

Gnosis opens public registration for Genome naming service - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Gnosis, a blockchain infrastructure project advocating for radical inclusivity, has announced the launch of Genome, a digital ID service native to the Gnosis Chain.Developed in collaboration with Web3 domain and identity platform SpaceID and Web3 messaging protocol dm3, Genome allows users to translate their lengthy, technical wallet addresses into human-readable names, making it easier to send and receive transactions and interact within the Gnosis ecosystem.Genome automatically grants users ownership of both .GNO and .gnosis.eth names, providing a seamless, interoperable user journey within Gnosis across EVM-compatible blockchains.The service synchronizes across Gnosis dApps, communities, and social networks, giving users a single identity and login that they can use across various services. Genome is also fully interoperable with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), enabling users to claim ownership of two domain names simultaneously.“From payments to gaming to SocialFi, if Web3 is going to fulfill its promises, we need to accelerate interoperable on-chain communication and identification tools,” shares Friederike Ernst, co-founder of Gnosis.Genome is integrated with various applications on Gnosis Chain, such as Gnosis Pay and Circles, as well as other blockchain utilities like Blockscout and NiftyFair. The integration ensures that users are able to maintain a consistent identity across multiple platforms, enhancing interoperability.According to Ralph Xu, a Business Development Specialist at Gnosis, the main differentiator between Genome .gno domains and other products is the custom ENS resolver developed by the DM3 Protocol team.The resolver pairs the .gno domain on Gnosis Chain with a corresponding subdomain on Ethereum, allowing one to be the extension of the other on a different chain. This is made possible through CCIP L2 (cross-chain interoperability) and off-chain resolution, which points to an off-chain server and then to the smart contracts on Gnosis Chain, relaying the information back to Ethereum.The launch of Genome aligns with Gnosis’ vision of inclusivity through accessible, open infrastructure. The project has opened registration for a .gno or .gnosis.eth username to the public.

We asked ChatGPT-4o what will be SHIB price at the end of 2024; Here’s what it said


At one point in 2024, meme coins were the apex cryptocurrencies, accounting for nearly all of the top 10 performers in the crypto market. The period saw multiple older coins hit new all-time highs (ATH) or, at least, reach very close to their old peaks.
Newer meme coins were also running exceptionally high and generating new overnight rags-to-riches stories, though there were also some mishaps and old-fashioned scams.
Though the situation has calmed somewhat in May, meme coins remain popular and relatively strong and few are as interesting as one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies out there –  Shiba Inu (SHIB).

With this context in mind and inspired by the new update, Finbold decided to consult the most advanced version of OpenAI’s flagship artificial intelligence (AI) platform – ChatGPT-4o – on how SHIB might fare through the rest of 2024.
ChatGPT sets SHIB price for end of 2024
Upon analyzing Shiba Inu’s recent performance and its current circumstances, ChatGPT developed a speculative scenario – largely hinging on factors generally considered positive for any cryptocurrency – to provide a price target for SHIB at the end of 2024.
According to the AI, should SHIB find new use cases and benefit from technological developments – possibly on the broader Ethereum (ETH) blockchain – it might, as long as the crypto market sentiment remains stable and the regulatory environment does not turn worse – reach around $0.000035 by the end of 2024.

ChatGPT offers a bullish scenario for SHIB
ChatGPT also conceded that the factors it outlined in its baseline scenario could have a significantly larger impact – particularly if the crypto community turns highly active on social media such as X, thus helping promote Shiba Inu.
Under such circumstances, the AI believes SHIB could hit $0.000080 before 2024 is over.

Given Shiba Inu’s continued commitment to further development – most recently exemplified by the arrival of ShibaSwap to Shibarium – an innovation-driven rally, such as the one partially outlined by ChatGPT, remains both possible and plausible for the meme coin.

ChatGPT outlines a bearish SHIB scenario
The large language model (LLM), however, also warned that cryptocurrencies, and meme coins in particular, remain vulnerable to a string of dangers. 
ChatGPT’s most advanced model singled out general volatility, increased regulatory pressure, technological setbacks, and a broader economic downturn – such as a recession – as areas of particular concern.
The AI concluded that should a combination of such factors converge, Shiba Inu might face a significant drop in price, potentially falling as low as $0.000010 by late December.

A possible example of a weakening of confidence in Shiba Inu is that an unknown ‘whale’ recently transferred approximately 3 trillion SHIB worth nearly $75 million to the Robinhood (HOOD) exchange. 
Such a transfer might indicate a loss of confidence in the meme coin’s upcoming performance and a desire to sell while the prices are still relatively high.
ChatGPT assesses possible extreme outcomes
Finally, ChatGPT was asked if it sees any extreme scenarios in either direction as plausible given the recent developments in the crypto industry and market. 
Though the AI considered both a bullish direction – which would hinge on much the same factors as its other bullish scenarios, though, again, with each having an increased impact – that would see SHIB hit $0.000150 by the end of the year, it assessed that its extremely bearish scenario is more likely.

ChatGPT’s extremely bearish scenario – which would see Shiba Inu drop to just $0.000001 – would hinge on a similar string of calamities as its more general pessimistic scenario, though the AI proved more specific on the potential technical issues naming them explicitly as security problems.
What is next for SHIB?
While ChatGPT’s forecasts are focused on the long-term and offer a glimpse at possible outcomes of trading through the entire 2024 for SHIB, analysts and experts are, in mid-May, proving generally optimistic about the meme coin.
In mid-May, Ali Martinez shared their analysis of Shiba Inu on X, indicating that it could – should it break above the descending parallel channel at $0.00002444 – soon rally to $0.00002954.

Around the same time, another crypto expert, Nebraskangooner, assessed that SHIB’s recent performance indicates a high likelihood of an imminent bullish breakout.

Details of AK Party's Bitcoin and Crypto Asset Bill Have Been Revealed! - Bitcoin Sistemi

An important stage has been reached in cryptocurrency studies in Turkey and AK Party Group Chairman Abdullah Güler announced the details of the “Proposal on Amendments to the Capital Markets Law” at the press conference he held in the Turkish Grand National Assembly.
Güler stated that the announced draft law first includes the definition of concepts such as wallet, crypto asset service provider and platform in the crypto asset ecosystem.
“The bill consists of 19 articles.
Cryptocurrency exchanges will start providing services by obtaining a license from the CMB. The aim here is to ensure that investors can make transactions safely under the supervision of the CMB.
Crypto asset service providers are obliged to ensure the security of their information systems. In this sense, TÜBİTAK's determining criteria regarding technological infrastructure will be included in the law.
The sale and distribution of crypto assets will be determined by the CMB. A preliminary report will be received from TÜBİTAK for crypto asset issuance.
Contractual provisions that limit or eliminate the liability of crypto asset service providers to their customers will be deemed invalid. Control mechanisms will be established to examine investors' complaints and objections. Measures are envisaged against market-distorting transactions.
The procedures and principles regarding crypto investment consultancy will also be regulated by the CMB.
Customer assets cannot be seized due to the debts of cryptocurrency exchanges.
CMB will monitor exchanges operating without permission.
Providing crypto asset services without permission will be considered a crime under the Turkish Penal Code and the penalty will be imprisonment from 3 to 5 years.
There will be a transition period for institutions currently operating. Those operating will apply to the board within 1 month or take a decision on liquidation within 3 months.
The activities of crypto asset providers operating abroad are also terminated with the transition period.
“It is essential that customers keep their crypto assets in their own wallets, and any damages and losses they may incur due to not keeping them in their own wallets will belong to the customers.”

Ankara Deputy Ömer İleri said that the draft law is not a bill that completely regulates blockchain technology and crypto assets, but rather aims to regulate cryptocurrency asset providers in Turkey, and that the regulation provides a legal basis for crypto assets.

                        Leading trading firm QCP Capital has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s price momentum, forecasting a potential return to the highs of $74,000.Bitcoin To Go Back to $74k High
In a recent note, the firm said it has observed substantial buyers acquiring 100,000 to 120,000 BTC Calls for December 2024, indicating confidence in the upward movement of the cryptocurrency.“US CPI numbers triggered a break out of the range across risk assets. BTC has since traded back above 66k,” the firm wrote.The surge in spot prices has coincided with increased institutional demand, with prominent asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld allocating approximately 3% and 2% of their assets under management (AUM) into BTC spot ETFs.QCP Capital highlights several factors aligning favorably for Bitcoin’s breakout, including growing sovereign and institutional adoption, easing inflation concerns, and the upcoming US elections.These factors, combined with the recent price movement, have prompted speculation about the resumption of the bull market.QCP Capital Offers Two Trade Ideas
In light of this optimistic outlook, QCP Capital offers two trade ideas for investors seeking to capitalize on a potential bullish trend.The first is the June Seagull strategy, which involves selling a 60,000 Put option while simultaneously buying a 70,000 Call option with an 88,000 knock-out level.This trade can be executed at zero cost, and if the BTC spot price approaches 88,000 at expiry, it could yield a maximum payout of $18,000 per BTC, equivalent to a 249% annualized return.The second trade idea presented by QCP Capital is the August Seagull strategy, which entails selling a 58,000 Put option and buying a 70,000 Call option with a 100,000 knock-out level.Similar to the June Seagull, this trade can also be executed at zero cost. If the BTC spot price reaches just under 100,000 at expiry, investors could enjoy a maximum payout of $30,000 per BTC, representing a potential annualized return of 176%.Galaxy Digital Founder Expects Bitcoin to Trade in Narrow Range
Despite the bullish view from QCP, Michael Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital Holdings, a prominent digital-asset financial services firm, expects Bitcoin to remain in a relatively narrow trading range in the current quarter.As reported, he expects Bitcoin to remain within the range of approximately $55,000 to $75,000 until specific market events or circumstances push the prices higher.Novogratz mentioned the tailwinds experienced in the fourth quarter of the previous year and the first quarter of this year.“I think that is probably where we are certainly for this quarter, maybe next quarter until either A, the Fed starts cutting rates because the economy finally slows or B, we get through the election and I think the election will bring clarity one way or the other to the crypto regulatory landscape.”On the other hand, technical analyst Rekt Capital believes that Bitcoin has emerged from the post-halving “danger zone” and entered an accumulation phase, as indicated by weakening selling pressure.“The Post-Halving Bitcoin “Danger Zone” (purple) is officially over,” the popular crypto trader wrote in a recent post on X.

KuCoin Latest To Exit Nigeria's Crypto P2P Market Amid Regulatory Scrutiny


								Nigeria’s naira continues its downward spiral despite a tightening noose around cryptocurrency trading. The government, blaming digital assets for the currency’s woes, has launched a multi-pronged attack on the digital asset, forcing major exchanges to retreat and pushing traders towards riskier avenues.

Central Bank Points Finger At Crypto
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has cast cryptocurrency  as the villain in the naira’s depreciation drama. Officials allege rampant manipulation of the currency’s value through pump-and-dump schemes on peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms. This, they claim, undermines their efforts to stabilize the naira through monetary policy.
Exchanges Feeling The Heat
The finger-pointing has had a chilling effect on digital currency businesses. Fearing regulatory retribution or an outright ban, major exchanges like Binance, OKX, and most recently, KuCoin, have all suspended naira support on their P2P platforms.
KuCoin, in a Wednesday announcement, downplayed the move as a “temporary pause” to ensure compliance with local regulations. However, the lack of a clear timeline for resumption leaves Nigerian bitcoin traders in limbo.
Looming P2P Ban Pushes Traders Into The Shadows
The situation is likely to worsen as the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans a full-blown ban on crypto P2P trading. This move, if enacted, will effectively push crypto transactions into the shadows of encrypted messaging apps.
Experts warn that this shift will expose traders to a Wild West environment rife with scams, exploitative rates, and a complete lack of consumer protection.
Bitcoin is currently trading at $66.163. Chart: TradingView
Central Bank Freezes Transactions, EFCC Targets Traders
The CBN is not stopping at regulating exchanges. In the past two weeks, they have instructed financial institutions to freeze and report all cryptocurrency transactions. This move effectively cuts off any legal avenues for Nigerians to buy or sell crypto using their naira.
Adding fuel to the fire, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nigeria’s anti-graft agency, has frozen over 1,000 crypto trader accounts in the past three weeks. These accounts are reportedly under investigation for money laundering and terrorism financing, allegations that many find dubious given the transparency inherent in blockchain technology.

Crackdown’s Effectiveness Questioned
Despite the aggressive measures, the naira continues its downward trajectory. Currently, it trades at a dismal 1,520 naira to the US dollar. This suggests that the crypto crackdown might be a misguided attempt to address a complex economic issue with a technological scapegoat.
Lack Of Clarity Frustrates Businesses
The Nigerian government’s approach has also been criticized for its lack of transparency. Binance CEO, Richard Teng, shared his frustrations in a recent blog post, highlighting their year-long efforts to obtain licensing information from the Nigerian SEC, all in vain.
This lack of clear regulatory framework makes it impossible for legitimate crypto businesses to operate, further pushing the industry underground.

Arbitrum-based L3 ApeChain integrates Supra's real-time oracle data and randomness protocols - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Supra, a prominent provider of oracle data feeds and verifiable randomness, has become the first oracle price feeds and verifiable randomness provider for ApeChain, a new Layer 3 solution on Arbitrum, according to a press release published today.As part of this collaboration, Supra’s Distributed Oracle Agreement (DORA) will provide real-time data for DeFi, GameFi, and other decentralized applications (dApps) built on ApeChain. Additionally, Supra’s dVRF offers a decentralized and verifiable randomness solution, ensuring the integrity of outcomes in blockchain games and other scenarios requiring transparency, the team noted.Designed for secure and reliable data delivery to blockchains, DORA offers over 475 active price feeds with strong security guarantees.Its security features, including resistance to Byzantine corruption and node collusion, provide high-quality price feeds with robust security guarantees. Supra also accommodates various dApp requirements through its support for both push and pull data models.Another highlight is the Supra Moonshot Consensus protocol. According to the team, during advanced global testing, the protocol achieved a throughput of 530K transactions per second with 500-millisecond optimistic finality and approximately 1.5–2 seconds full block finality.Supra’s data feeds also offer archival, authenticity, and aggregation features, ensuring secure data storage, accurate data verification, and reliable information streams.In addition to DORA, Supra’s dVRF protocol addresses the need for unpredictable outcomes in dApps by providing decentralized randomness that is both trustless and verifiable.This is especially beneficial for Web3 game developers who require integrity and unpredictability in random outcomes for scenarios such as prize draws and competition matchups. Supra’s on-chain verifiable randomness generator allows for the creation of random outcomes that can be easily verified, fostering trust within the community.The integration with Supra’s dVRF and oracle data feeds is expected to allow ApeChain to build richer gaming experiences with reliable data and provably fair mechanics. Focusing on GameFi and metaverse applications, ApeChain aims to be the foundation for ApeCoin and upcoming Ape-related games and protocols.Apart from that, through the partnership, Supra and ApeChain expect to drive mass adoption of GameFi by delivering more reliable data and fostering trust with guaranteed, verifiably fair outcomes.Hervé Larren, ApeCoin DAO Special Council and co-author of ApeChain, expressed enthusiasm for the partnership. He stated:“Supra is pioneering solutions with integrations across all major ecosystems and will now empower ApeChain through Bridges, Oracles, Automation, and Randomizers. The ApeCoin DAO eagerly anticipates the innovative creations that builders will craft, leveraging Supra’s best-in-class stack for games, DeFi, and beyond!”

Dogecoin's roadmap to $0.3 - Here are the price targets for DOGE - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin’s price surged by more than 7% in the last 24 hours 
DOGE’s metrics and market indicators all leaned bullish too

Dogecoin [DOGE] investors are now having a good time after the memecoin registered a comfortable rally on the charts. Its latest price uptick pushed the world’s largest memecoin to a critical level, one that could result in a further price uptrend in the coming days. 
Dogecoin bulls are pushing hard
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that DOGE’s price appreciated by more than 5% in the last seven days. The better news was that in the last 24 hours alone, the memecoin’s value increased by over 7%. At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.1562 with a market capitalization of over $22.5 billion. 
World of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting a bullish falling wedge pattern on the memecoin’s daily chart. Thanks to the latest price uptick, Dogecoin seemed to be about to break above that pattern, which could propel further growth. As per the tweet, a breakout might as well result in DOGE touching $0.3 in the coming weeks. 
AMBCrypto then analyzed Santiment’s data to find whether metrics supported the possibility of a successful breakout. As per our analysis, DOGE’s MVRV ratio improved. Market sentiment around the memecoin also turned positive. This was the case as its weighted sentiment hiked, meaning that bullish sentiments reigned supreme in the Dogecoin market.
On top of that, DOGE’s open interest also hiked along with its price. An uptick in this metric usually suggests that the prevailing price trend is likely to continue further.

Dogecoin’s upcoming targets 
We then analyzed Dogecoin’s daily chart to see whether market indicators seemed bullish for the coin. The technical indicator MACD displayed a clear bullish crossover. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was resting above the neutral mark of 50. At press time, it had a value of 52.7. 
Another bullish indicator was the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), as it registered an uptick. 
All these indicators suggested that the chances of DOGE breaking out of the bull pattern were high, which might as well allow it to reach $0.3.

Read Dogecoin’s [DOGE] Price Prediction 2024-2025

If the bull rally continues, then DOGE’s price should first hit $0.16, as liquidations increased near that range last time when DOGE touched it. It will be important for DOGE to first go above that level, as high liquidations often result in price corrections. 
Going further north, DOGE might get into the range of $0.166–$0.17. A successful breakout above the same could clear the memecoin’s path towards $0.3.

                        MetalCore, a free-to-play massive multiplayer online (MMO) combat game led by former developers from Activision, Disney, Lucasfilm, and Midway, has announced a partnership with the universal gaming ecosystem Portal.Studio369, the game development company behind the blockchain-powered PvP shooter, said that Portal is a cross-chain gaming access point that enables users “to consolidate all of their Web3 games, digital assets, and user accounts into a single, easily accessible location.”MetalCore and Portal Focus on Eliminating Onboarding Barriers
The Web3 game industry is gaining popularity. However, Studio369 argues, the blockchain onboarding experience still has two major pain points: it’s complex and fragmented across competing ecosystems.These issues represent “a bottleneck to broader growth.”This is what MetalCore and Portal aim to eliminate.Creating a consolidated ecosystem will break down onboarding barriers, opening doors to millions of new users.“By integrating into a unified ecosystem, gamers will access a powerful interface, removing the complexities of navigating blockchain bridges and liquidity pools,” the press release said.Furthermore, the partnership is a step in MetalCore’s overall mission to build a player-driven, interconnected ecosystem of gaming token utility.Per the team, this ecosystem involves sustainable, interoperable economies and tokens integrated into the core gameplay loop.Therefore, it’s the players themselves who shape the game’s outcome. Their choices also affect the narrative and economy.“Portal is connecting the Web3 gaming ecosystem in a way never attempted before,” remarked Studio369 CEO Matt Candler. “This space is going to need AAA titles to support growth, but also the means to connect players and assets. We believe we’re at the cutting edge of building such an ecosystem.”Nearly $19 Million Raised
Studio369 is a team of Unreal Engine experts focused on PC and console platforms, the announcement noted.Its members previously worked on massive titles such as Fortnite, The Walking Dead, Star Trek, Gears of War 3, MechWarrior 2, Nether, and Outpost Zero.They have decades of extensive development and publishing experience.In March this year, Studio369 successfully raised $5 million for MetalCore, from Delphi Digital, BITKRAFT Ventures, Sanctor Capital, Spartan Group, King River Digital Assets, and Arrington Capital, among others.Per Crunchbase, the team has raised a total of $18.7 million in three rounds.Following the March raise, Studio369 said it would put the newly raised funds toward continued development and upcoming features, including “a never-seen-before dynamic mission system that leverages AI to generate unique assignments, objectives, and tasks.”Also, thanks to the integration in the Immutable zkEVM ecosystem, developers have been enabled to deploy custom smart contracts and offer users a gas-free service.Winner of Global Blockchain Show’s Best Blockchain Game of the Year and GAM3 2022 Award for Best Shooter Game, MetalCore possesses an innovative ‘scanning’ system that lets players obtain blueprints from fallen enemies, craft new weapons and vehicles, and convert them to Web3 assets for trading, the team noted.Meanwhile, Portal offers a suite of services for users to engage with Web3 titles. It includes a wallet, companion app, multi-chain functionality, a launchpad, and a native token.Speaking of the PORTAL token, it debuted this year at a $2.37 billion valuation.The platform, whose advisory board includes Jamie King, co-founder of Rockstar Games, also recently partnered with Pixelmon.Justin Taylor, a member of the Portal team, commented on the partnership with MetalCore.

After a concerning five-day streak of declines, which coincided with the formation of a technical pattern known as the "death cross," Cardano's ADA has made a noteworthy rebound.ADA recovered from a low of $0.426 on May 15; the gains continued until press time, with ADA rising 5.38% in the last 24 hours to $0.455.  This upward movement comes as a welcome relief for ADA holders, who have been patiently waiting for signs of a bullish reversal. Over the past weekend, Cardano's ADA's 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) crossed bearishly, resulting in a death cross formation.Given the bearish outlook suggested by the death cross, ADA's recent rebound is noteworthy. Several factors may have contributed to Cardano's positive price performance post-death cross. ADA/USD Daily Chart, Courtesy: TradingViewOne significant aspect is the overall market recovery, where a slight improvement in the broader economic outlook has led to increased investor confidence across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies.Also, the anticipation of upcoming protocol upgrades likely played a role in bolstering investor sentiment. However, it remains yet to be seen if ADA's current rebound is a dead cat bounce or something that might metamorphose into a sustained rally for the cryptocurrency. In this regard, a break above the daily moving averages may be the first indication of strength.Cardano awaits major upgradesOuroboros is the consensus protocol that powers the Cardano blockchain. Given Cardano's ongoing development and increasing use, Ouroboros has moved forward with its planned upgrade path.Ouroboros's evolution will continue with Ouroboros Genesis, which is scheduled for release in the third quarter of 2024. Ouroboros Genesis is a set of improvements to the already robust Ouroboros protocol that include countermeasures to safeguard network nodes when they are new or return after an absence.The first Genesis-capable implementation is expected for deployment in Q3, 2024. At this point, the most significant unknown is the level of optimization required to compensate for the increased peer count required to prevent eclipses.

                        The Pepe price has fallen by 7% in the past 24 hours, with its drop to $0.00001036 coming as the cryptocurrency market as a whole gains by 5% today.PEPE is clearly correcting after a strong couple of days, with the meme token still up by 30% in a week and by 100% in a month, not to mention by 500% in a year.That it is still largely in the green indicates how today’s loss mostly relates to traders taking some profits after a rip-roaring start to the week, which followed from the return of meme-stock trader ‘Roaring Kitty’ to X.And with PEPE remaining one of the most popular vehicles for whales, it’s likely to rebound soon enough.Pepe Price Prediction as PEPE Drops 7% Suddenly – What’s Going On?
PEPE’s chart shows that it has run out of a little steam relative to the previous few days, with its indicators signalling a loss of momentum.Its relative strength index (purple) has declined from 85 on Monday to just under 50 today, and while it has shown tiny signs of improvement it may still struggle in the near term.Source: TradingViewLikewise, PEPE’s 30-day average (orange) is now declining again after spending several days shooting well above the 200-day (blue), which is again a sign that recent buyers have begun taking profits.What’s interesting, however, is that the coin’s trading volume remains elevated, at around $1.6 billion today.This contrasts favorably with the levels (e.g. sub-$500 million) seen only a few days ago, indicating that interest remains in PEPE and that it could rebound soon enough.Indeed, some whales are still accumulating PEPE even now, suggesting a belief that the meme token will return to growth pretty soon.This certainly remains a possibility, given that meme coins – and particularly PEPE – have been hot ever since meme-stock investor Keith Gill (AKA Roaring Kitty) returned to posting on X for the first time in roughly three years.However, it should be noted that GameStop – the stock Gill was instrumental in pumping in 2021 – declined by nearly 20% on close yesterday.This suggests that the bullishness his return instigated may already be ebbing away.Nonetheless, PEPE remains a favorite among whales, so it’s likely to return to winning ways in the next few weeks, if not days.It could see sustained gains later in the year, particularly if the Fed comes through with rate cuts and boosts the wider market.As such, the Pepe price could hit $0.0000120 in a couple of weeks and $0.000020 by Q4 2024.New Meme Tokens Could Outperform Older Coins
Traders may be worried that PEPE could correct for a while longer yet, so they could potentially turn to newer meme tokens to make bigger gains in the near term.Now would be a good time to make such a move, since there are various meme tokens holding their presales at the moment, with many on course to rally big once they list.A prime candidate for a big opening is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme token that has raised just over $1.2 million in its increasingly popular sale.The reason why investors are turning to SEAL is that it’s aiming to become the latest in a long line of SOL-based meme tokens to outperform the market this year.It has adopted a bumbling, Americanized seal as its meme, and so far, it has been successful in drawing in supporters and growing its community.Also bullish is the fact that an Ethereum version of its token will now be available, making it a multi-chain cryptocurrency and thereby giving it wider application.Investors interested in joining its sale can do so at the official Sealana website, where they can purchase the token by sending SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.It’s available at a rate 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which converts to $0.023 per token.VIDEOThis is a rock-bottom price, and one which SEAL should leave behind very quickly once it lists on exchanges in the next few weeks.Buy SEAL Today

Ethereum (ETH) Breaks $3,000: Are We Saved?

Ethereum has secured a breakthrough above $3,000, but the current state of things suggests that the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market might still face some troubles. The price has started an immediate reversal, and Ether could face additional selling pressure if it falls below $3,000 again.Currently, Ethereum is trading around $3,005, with resistance levels at $3,200 and $3,400. If ETH can break through these levels, it could signal a stronger bullish trend than now. However, if Ethereum falls below $3,000, the support levels to watch are $2,900 and $2,800. A drop below these levels could indicate an aggravation of the bearish trend.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewRecent price action shows that Ethereum is struggling to maintain its upward momentum. The 50-day EMA around $3,067 and the 200-day EMA near $2,800 are critical levels to monitor. Breaking through the 50 EMA would be a positive sign, while falling below the 200 EMA could trigger more selling pressure.On-chain data provides additional insights. The number of active addresses on the Ethereum network has been fluctuating, indicating varying levels of user activity. Currently, the number of active addresses is around 450,000, down from recent highs. Transactions on the network have also shown some variability, with daily transactions hovering around one million.The net ETH emission after EIP-1559 has been slightly negative, suggesting that more ETH is being burned than minted. For now, the situation has changed as activity on the L1 of Ethereum dropped substantially. Ethereum's recent breakthrough above $3,000 is a promising development, but the asset is still facing some issues. Key levels to watch are $3,200 and $3,400 on the upside, and $2,900 and $2,800 on the downside.

GameStop Party Ends, Will Meme Coins Follow Suit? | Coinspeaker



The frenzy surrounding Gamestop and AMC has extended into the realm of crypto, meaning that the recent correction in GameStop shares could trigger corrections across multiple meme coins as well. 

After creating a massive frenzy earlier this week, the share price of GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) has come under severe selling pressure. On Wednesday, May 15, GameStop stock price tanked 18.87% dropping under $40 by the end of the day.
In pre-market trading on Thursday, GameStop shares are experiencing a significant decline, amplifying losses incurred from Wednesday’s downturn. Currently, the GME stock price is down by an additional 16% with its price dropping to $32.20 in the pre-market trading.




The recent market movement contrasts with the substantial $9.6 billion increase in market value witnessed on Monday and Tuesday. This surge followed activity on an X account linked to Keith Gill, a figure instrumental in drawing attention to GameStop in 2021, posting for the first time in nearly three years.
The rally in GameStop and AMC also triggered a massive surge across the entire cryptocurrency meme coin sector. As per data provided by on-chain data provider Santiment, notable assets such as $PEPE (+100%), $PONKE (+96%), $MAGA (+80%), $TURBO (+78%), etc. have experienced substantial gains. Just over the last week, the trading volume across the meme coin sector has shot up by a staggering 136%.
However, as the GameStop party ends, investors playing in the meme coin sector should be careful from taking up new bets at this point.
Will Meme Coin Party End Along with GameStop?
The frenzy surrounding Gamestop and AMC has extended into the realm of crypto, largely driven by their speculative appeal. Currently, these two companies dominate discussions on cryptocurrency platforms, emerging as the most trending topics within the community.
Thus, the pullback in meme coins is very much likely following the pullback in GameStop. The Solana-based GameStop ($GME) meme coin which rallied over 4,400% this week, has also tanked by 46% in the last 24 hours. with its price slipping under $0.01. While there have been talks about the GameStop ($GME) meme coin price reaching $1, it looks to be a distant dream as of now.


PEPE Coin, which touched its all-time high earlier this week, is currently down by 6% and trading at $0.00001041. On the PEPE 3-day chart, the TD Sequential indicates two sell signals: an assertive 13 and a green nine candle. Furthermore, there’s a noticeable bearish divergence between the price movement and the RSI.

Tornado Cash Developer Appeals Dutch Judge's Jail Verdict



After several back and forths, the Dutch Judge finally ruled this week that the Tornado Cash developer be sentenced to 64 months in prison, equivalent to five years and four months.

Alexey Pertsev, the core developer behind sanctioned cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash, was found guilty a few days ago for his involvement in money laundering. However, he did not agree with the verdict and decided to file an appeal with the Court of Appeals s-Hertogenbosch.
The court has yet to give a verdict on his appeal. Notably, it might take a couple of months before Pertsev’s first hearing will happen if an appeal is finally granted.




Alexey Pertsev Implicated in Tornado Cash’s Money Laundering Case
The Tornado Cash developer’s case has been in court for almost two years. Its struggle started when the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanctioned the crypto mixer for helping to launder about $7 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. OFAC suspects that the notorious North Korean hacking group Lazarus is one of Tornado Cash’s core clients.
Precisely, Pertsev was accused of failing to take sufficient measures to prevent criminals from using Tornado Cash for money laundering. At first, Pertsev was put behind bars for a few months to allow investigations to take its course.
Later, the court denied him bail and ruled that he should remain in jail until his hearing that took place earlier in April 2023. Judges ruled that Pertsev possesses a high risk of fleeing or interfering with the investigations if freed on bail. In response, Pertsev pled not guilty to the charges levied against him. He stated that Tornado Cash is an open-source code available to anyone with the internet.
Pertsev’s lawyer Keith Cheng was vocal with his argument.
“We had the opportunity to explain the basis for Tornado Cash and why it is not money laundering. It is our opinion that the lack of knowledge is what’s keeping him here. Of course, I’m disappointed that Pertsev won’t be released on bail. He will fight until the end to show the importance of decentralized options, software, and open-source code,” Cheng said.
Tornado Cash Developer Bags 64 Months in Jail
After several back and forths, the Dutch Judge finally ruled this week that the Tornado Cash developer be sentenced to 64 months in prison, equivalent to five years and four months. His lawyers were given approximately two weeks to contest the verdict and plead for a reduced sentence.
Just two days after the jail sentence was pronounced, he lodged the Appeals filing. It is worth noting that Pertsev has the opportunity to request that he await the appeal at home although he was escorted directly to jail on Tuesday after the verdict was given.
The decision of the Dutch Judge sets a precedent for the broad crypto industry, particularly for developers that are associated with platforms like Tornado Cash. Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, co-founders of Tornado Cash, are also facing similar allegations in the country as Pertsev. The Prosecutors argued that they aid criminals in laundering stolen funds and violating sanctions.

Subsquid secures $17.5M in a funding round and teams up with Google ahead of token launch


Subsquid, a leading Web3 data access layer, has secured $17.5 million in funding and forged a partnership with Google ahead of its highly anticipated token launch, as per the information shared with Finbold on May 16.
The financial boost will support the development of Subsquid’s innovative data indexing technology, which aims to revolutionize blockchain data accessibility.
Subsquid’s integration with Google BigQuery
A major highlight of this development is Subsquid’s integration with Google BigQuery. 


By incorporating its software development kit with Google’s powerful data analytics platform, Subsquid offers developers new capabilities to analyze blockchain data. 
This marks a significant step forward, providing enterprises and big data analysts with a robust and reliable blockchain data source.
Following the success of Subsquid’s testnet
The partnership follows the successful deployment of Subsquid’s testnet, which saw participation from over 70,000 users and the deployment of more than 20,000 indexers. 
The platform has already secured key integrations with notable players like Berachain, Neon EVM, CORE, and Starknet, further solidifying its position in the industry.
In a record-breaking sale, Subsquid raised $6.3 million in just 19 minutes on CoinList, making it the fastest sale in the history of the platform. 
The swift and substantial community backing of course contributed to the overall $17.5 million funding, attracting thousands of new token holders. 
SQD token to list on major exchanges on May 17
Subsquid announced that its native token, SQD, would be listed on multiple tier-one cryptocurrency exchanges on May 17, 2024. 
The SQD token will be available for trading on Gate.io, Bybit, KuCoin, CoinList, and MEXC Global, with markets opening at 8:00 UTC and an initial launch price set at $0.094.
The introduction of SQD is expected to enhance liquidity and accessibility for the Subsquid token, as SQD is integral to the Subsquid ecosystem, aligning incentives among infrastructure providers and rewarding node operators who offer computational and storage resources. 
Additionally, the token facilitates node curation and protocol governance.
Marcel Fohrmann, Co-Founder of Subsquid, expressed enthusiasm about the listings: 

“We’re excited to see our token go live on various trading venues. We’ve been working on getting Subsquid to market and onboard hundreds of worker nodes. With Subsquid Network even petabytes of on-chain data can be accessed and queried in a trustless and permissionless way, gradually replacing RPC nodes for data reads. We believe that this is another step towards powerful, fully decentralized web3 dapps and analytics.”

The listing of SQD on these prominent exchanges aligns with Subsquid’s objective of decentralizing its network and expanding its user base within the Web3 community. 
Industry support for Subsquid
Prominent investors such as Blockchange, Hypersphere, Zee Prime, DFG, and Lattice played a pivotal role in these recent funding rounds.
Jack Platts, Co-Founder of Hypersphere remarked:

“Helping to build networks is one of our primary purposes at Hypersphere. By investing in Subsquid, we are ensuring that network and protocol developers always have access to the data they need to build. Subsquid reduces data costs for at scale deployment for many of the most popular blockchains and developer communities in the industry,”

With the token launch getting nearer, Subsquid co-founder Dmitry Zhelezov emphasized the broader implications of the funding:

“With our token launch just around the corner, this is just the beginning of the next generation of the open internet: Permissionless data access for anyone building in the Web3 space. By eliminating vendor-lock and serving data in a P2P manner, Subsquid is a game-changer, and a fundamental improvement over the status quo of centralized solutions that have full control over the data.” 

As Subsquid prepares for its token launch, the company’s advancements and strategic partnerships underscore its commitment to transforming blockchain technology and data usage.

Animoca Brands leads $7M funding round for Param Labs

Gaming infrastructure developer Param Labs raised $7 million worth of funds in a “significantly oversubscribed” investment round.The modular gaming ecosystem’s $7 million round was led by crypto venture capital (VC) firm Animoca Brands, with participation from investment firms including Delphi Ventures, Cypher Capital, P2 Ventures (formerly Polygon Ventures), Mechanism Capital, Merit Circle, TRGC Capital, Double Peak Group, MH Ventures.The funding will be used to address one of the most pressing shortcomings of Web3 gaming — the lack of underlying infrastructure. Modular gaming ecosystems like Param will be crucial for laying the groundwork for the next generation of Web3 games, according to Anthony Anderson the CEO of Param Labs and Kiraverse.Anderson told Cointelegraph:“Unlike most Web3 studios that focus on developing single game titles, modular ecosystems offer a variety of products and components. This allows developers to build their own games from these modules and provides essential tools for other developers to utilize and integrate into their projects.”The funding round precedes significant growth for the Param Gaming Platform, which recently surpassed 300,000 daily active users (DAUs). The protocol’s X page has also surpassed the 2.5 million follower mark before the investment round.Animoca Labs co-founder Yat Siu and Face Clan founder Banks also made strategic investments in the protocol. According to Yat Siu, Param Labs could help materialize the vision of a truly open metaverse. Siu wrote:“We're excited to partner with Param Labs to advance digital property rights in gaming, bringing us a step closer to realizing the vision of the truly open metaverse. This collaboration aligns with our shared vision to redefine the gaming landscape, ensuring that gamers are the true owners of their digital assets.”Related: Binance develops ‘antidote’ to address poisoning scams after $68M exploitWeb3 gaming needs infrastructure for mainstream adoption The lack of Web3 gaming infrastructure makes blockchain integrations difficult for developers, which is among the biggest challenges for mainstream adoption, according to Anderson:“Focusing on infrastructure is crucial as it not only addresses the challenges in the games we’re developing but also has the potential to be applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of other experiences. This will significantly contribute to the adoption of blockchain gaming.”The lack of blockchain gaming infrastructure became even more apparent this week, after Wanderers game founder Nick Greenawalt shared a game preview, ironically dubbing it “the future of gaming,” in a May 15 X post.The video shows gameplay pausing every few seconds as a MetaMask wallet prompt pops up to record every single shot on-chain. While the video was perceived as a satirical post, not a true preview, it illustrates the need for seamless gaming infrastructure.Source: Nick GreenawaltTo achieve true mainstream adoption, Web3 games need to organically incorporate crypto assets and Web3 technology, without any disturbing friction points, according to Param Labs’ Anderson:“Gamers should be able to interact with on-chain assets without even realizing it, while still benefiting from features like trading assets with friends and monetizing their in-game time.”Related: Crypto trader turns $3K into $46M in one month as PEPE price soars

El Salvador’s Bitcoin Reserves Grow As BTC Price Surges - Here’s How Much The Country Holds | Bitcoinist.com


								Central American country, El Salvador has realized significant profits from its extensive Bitcoin reserve. The country which previously accepted Bitcoin as a legal tender has now made hundreds of millions of dollars in gains as Bitcoin surged past $66,000 recently. 
El Salvador Bitcoin Profits Soar
El Salvador’s audacious Bitcoin bet continues to pay off as the country’s profits have risen significantly following the cryptocurrency’s surge to $66,000 on May 16, 2024. Over the past three, the country has aggressively accumulated a staggering amount of BTC.

Against all criticism and discouragement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021. Since then, the country has continually increased its Bitcoin reserves, acquiring the cryptocurrency by any means either through direct purchase or mining. 
According to El Salvador’s Bitcoin office, the country holds about 5,751 BTC valued at approximately $379 million using the current price of Bitcoin. Since 2021, the Central American country has mined a total of 474 Bitcoin worth about $29 million, embracing green energy by utilizing its volcanic geothermal energy to facilitate mining activities.
In March, when Bitcoin’s price had reached a new all-time high above $73,000, the Central American country had yielded significant profits, experiencing a slight drop when Bitcoin’s price gave up gains to trade below the $60,000 price mark. Now, with Bitcoin surging once more, the country’s profits are increasing steadily. 
El Salvador President Nayi Bukele, a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, has championed the cryptocurrency as a means to promote economic growth and improve financial inclusion in the country. President Bukele disclosed earlier on February 2, 2024, that the country does not plan to sell its Bitcoin assets. Instead, it aims to continuously incorporate more into its digital asset reserve. 
Bitcoin Surges Above $65,000
Bitcoin rose above $66,000 this week, marking the first time since April 24, 2024. The pioneer cryptocurrency has recorded a 6.74% increase over the past 24 hours and is presently trading at $65,993. 
Following the Bitcoin halving event on April 20, the cryptocurrency experienced a massive downturn, giving back the majority of its gains made from its rally in March. At the time, Bitcoin’s skyrocketing value was driven by the soaring demand of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. 

According to crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, the crypto market is still very early, highlighting that Bitcoin was just 25 days post Bitcoin halving and suggesting that the cryptocurrency could surge even higher once bearish sentiment diminishes.
Presently, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has experienced a significant upward momentum, highlighting the growing interest from investors and crypto traders in the industry. The cryptocurrency’s 24-hour trading volume of approximately $42.3 billion has risen by more than 70.27%. Additionally, its overall market capitalization has jumped by more than $1.3 trillion, marking a daily increase of 6.56%.

Why Did The Bitcoin Price Rise Above $66,000 Today?


																Bitcoin recently rose above $66,000 for the first time since April. This recent price rally from the flagship crypto is believed to be due to several factors, including the recently released inflation data. 
Inflation Data Comes In Lower Than Expectations
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data was announced on May 15 and came in lower than expected. The CPI rose by 0.3% in April, against forecasts of 0.4%. The CPI data was also lower than those recorded in March and February, when inflation rose by 0.4%.

	Related Reading



Therefore, the latest inflation data suggests that inflation in the US might be slowing down. This development has provided some relief for investors, as the Fed is likely to maintain a dovish stance and consider rate cuts as inflation looks to decline. Lower interest rates mean investors will be more confident investing in risk assets like Bitcoin. 
Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s rally is recent reports showing that some notable institutions are heavily invested in the flagship crypto. Bitcoinist reported that the State of Wisconsin has invested almost $99 million in BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF. Hedge Fund Millenium Management is also reported to hold $1.94 billion across five different Spot Bitcoin ETF products. 
This presents a bullish outlook for Bitcoin as it suggests that institutional investors are interested in the crypto token for the long term. Meanwhile, from a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin also looked primed for this rally, with crypto analyst Rekt Capital revealing that the flagship crypto was out of the post-halving “Danger Zone.”   
Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also noted that Bitcoin was displaying a cup and reversal pattern on the weekly chart and added that the “breakout will be explosive and will send it to a cycle top.” 
What Next For Bitcoin?
In a Telegram update, crypto trading firm QCP Capital stated that they expect this bullish momentum to take Bitcoin’s price to the previous highs of $74,000. They highlighted activity in the derivatives market and growing institutional demand as factors that could contribute to Bitcoin’s rise to this price level.  
They also raised the possibility of this being the resumption of the bull market, stating that “the stars seem to be aligning on this breakout with significant sovereign and institutional adoption, abating inflation and upcoming US elections.” The trading firm added, “If this is indeed the start of the bull trend again, then this move could take us past all-time highs.”

Rekt Capital suggested that this might be the beginning of an upward trend for the flagship crypto as he revealed that the daily downtrend for Bitcoin is over. In another X post, the crypto analyst also noted that the Bitcoin bull market is not yet over.

Here's Why Polkadot's (DOT) Price May Rally to $20-$25 Soon (Analysts)


																TL;DR

Polkadot’s price briefly surpassed $7, with its market cap nearing $10 billion, suggesting that the market might have been revived.
DOT could see a rally to $20-$25 or $9-$13 if it overcomes key resistance levels and benefits from recent protocol developments, analysts asserted.


Where Is DOT Headed?
Polkadot’s native cryptocurrency is not among the top-performing cryptocurrencies during the most recent market revival but is situated well in the green. Its price briefly surpassed the $7 mark, whereas its market capitalization neared the $10 billion milestone.

One person who believes the asset is poised for future gains from now on is the X user Michael van de Poppe. He claimed that DOT has already “bottomed,” especially since the introduction of the JAM whitepaper in April.
Recall that the team behind Polkadot released the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) Gray Paper nearly a month ago. The upgrade combines elements of Polkadot and Ethereum and “provides a global singleton permissionless object environment.”
Another analyst envisioning a bright future for DOT is Block Diversity. They suggested that the token’s valuation could surge to $9, $11, and eventually $13 once it clears the major resistance level of $6.90. DOT’s price has hovered around that line for the past several hours, which has become a major roadblock on its upward trajectory.




Additional DOT Forecasts
Other crypto enthusiasts touching upon the asset as of late include FLASH and Crypto Thanos. The former described DOT’s previous price retreat as “a textbook correction” that will eventually be replaced by a resurgence towards the $20 mark. “$5 level during summer hole bleedout could be attractive,” they added.
Crypto Thanos argued a few days ago that the token’s descending parallel channel was about to break out. DOT’s price has already overcome that level in the last 12 hours or so by climbing above $6.8, so it would be interesting to follow whether their analysis will play out.

SEBI Explores Regulatory Framework for Cryptocurrency

		Since 2018, India has maintained a conservative stance towards the cryptocurrency market. However, a recent statement reported by Reuters suggests that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is hinting at a potential change. 				In a recent statement, SEBI mentioned that it could explore regulatory options for cryptocurrencies, indicating a willingness to engage with this evolving market. This development could pave the way for a more conducive environment for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors in India.				What’s the News? 				India's markets regulator has proposed that oversight of cryptocurrency trading be distributed among various authorities, according to Reuters. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) made this recommendation to a government panel responsible for shaping finance ministry policy, as per documents cited by Reuters. The panel aims to submit its report by June.				SEBI's stance contrasts with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which reportedly supports a ban on stablecoins. The RBI has consistently expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies pose a threat to policy sovereignty.				SEBI suggested that it could monitor cryptocurrencies resembling securities and initial coin offerings (ICOs). It could also issue licenses for equity market-related products. If this happens then it would be similar to the US SEC where it regulates the tokens that are in the nature of crypto exchanges.				It also recommended that RBI could regulate assets backed by fiat currencies like stablecoins. Additionally, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) could supervise insurance and pension-related virtual assets, in coordination with the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).				The resolution of investor grievances in cryptocurrencies is proposed to fall under India's Consumer Protection Act, as per the Reuters report.				RBI’s Stand on Cryptocurrency				Since 2018 RBI has been in a state of uncertainty about cryptocurrency. It highlights the risk of tax evasion and the adverse effects on fiscal stability. It perceives decentralized peer-to-peer activities as voluntarily based, which may cause difficulties in control and supervision. The RBI in addition is concerned that the loss of income due to cryptocurrencies may be the result of money creation. While the RBI's 2018 directives to financial institutions were suspended by the Supreme Court, the RBI has still emphasized the need for tight Anti-Money Laundering and Foreign Exchange regulations, thus keeping cryptocurrencies out of the Indian formal financial system.				What’s next?				With SEBI considering regulatory options and RBI's cautious stance, India's cryptocurrency landscape is at a turning point. If SEBI proceeds with regulating certain crypto assets, it could bring clarity and legitimacy to the market, akin to the US SEC's oversight. This could attract more investors and encourage innovation in blockchain technology. 				Additionally, the resolution of investor grievances under consumer protection laws indicates a growing recognition of cryptocurrency's importance. Hence, this potential shift suggests a more inclusive approach to cryptocurrencies in India's financial ecosystem, promoting growth and opportunity.

Ethereum/Bitcoin Price Dropped to Its Lowest Level Since 2021! What Does It Mean? - Bitcoin Sistemi

The ratio between dollar prices of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) has reached its lowest level since April 2021, signaling a significant shift in market sentiment and dynamics in the cryptocurrency space.
Ethereum/Bitcoin Parity Reached Lowest Level Since April 2021

On the Binance exchange, ETH/BTC fell to 0.04563, indicating a decline of approximately 16% since the beginning of the year.

This trend was further emphasized by the bearish trend observed a month ago, which points to a prevailing trend towards Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap.


The downward trend in the ETH/BTC price can be attributed to several factors, including reduced demand for Ethereum-linked exchange-traded products (ETPs).
Latest data from Bloomberg, cited by ETC Group in its weekly report, revealed that there was a net outflow of approximately $63.5 million from global Ethereum ETFs, particularly affecting exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in Hong Kong.





Analysts point to several key factors contributing to Ethereum's fall out of favor with investors. Coinbase Institutional Research analyst David Han highlighted ongoing uncertainty regarding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the US.

This uncertainty contrasts with the clear regulatory pathway for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a store of value and macro asset.


Additionally, the emergence of competing layer 1 blockchain networks such as Solana has shifted attention away from Ethereum as the primary platform for decentralized application (dApp) distribution.
Solana's increasing market share in decentralized exchange volumes underscores this trend and poses a competitive challenge to Ethereum.





Despite the potential of Ethereum ETF approval to attract new capital, traders remain skeptical about the SEC's timeline.
Polymarket data shows the SEC has only a 10% chance of approving a spot Ethereum ETF by the end of May, with pending filings from VanEck and BlackRock awaiting regulatory decisions.

‘We’re just scratching the surface’ of crypto and AI - Microsoft exec

Microsoft believes that artificial intelligence (AI) is “the defining technology of our time,” and it has been on the cutting edge of both AI research and investment. But that doesn’t mean the Seattle-based tech giant isn’t paying close attention to the cryptoverse too, including ways that blockchain technology and AI might one day support each other. At the recent Cornell Blockchain Conference in New York, Yorke Rhodes, Microsoft’s director for digital transformation, blockchain and cloud supply chain, was asked how the company viewed this possible intersection of technologies.“I do think that as these two technologies progress, you can create agents that bring together the power of both. We’re just scratching the surface,” he said.In a panel discussion titled “Crypto x AI,” Rhodes’ views were further probed by moderator Alex Lin, co-founder and general partner at Reforge, who asked: Will Microsoft have its own blockchain one day?“There’s already a massive amount of interesting stuff going on” in crypto, including in the open source community, responded Rhodes, so “why would we try to recreate something that [already] has so much investment?” Rather, Microsoft’s focus today is more on optimizing existing technologies, such as layer-2 blockchain rollups. Rhodes added:“But would we [Microsoft] ever build an L1 blockchain? I don’t think so.”Crypto is “well positioned”Rhodes and Lin were joined on stage at the April 26 event at Cornell Tech by Neil DeSilva, chief financial officer at PayPal Digital Currencies; Matt Stephenson, head of research at Pantera; and Jasper Zhang, CEO and co-founder at Hyperbolic Labs.Stephenson opined that “crypto is pretty well positioned to be the ‘picks and shovels’ of a certain type of AI,” particularly transformer and diffusion models. This is especially so given the likelihood of a “decentralized, multiagent” AI future. Still, crypto may have to play a secondary role to AI’s lead. Rhodes acknowledged that a “massive trend” like AI tends to “suck a lot of the air out of the room” for other emerging technologies, including crypto/blockchain and Web3. “It’s a hot topic — intersection or symbiosis between blockchain networks and AI,” commented Lin. But it’s also susceptible to exaggerated claims, and it can be hard at times to separate what’s hype from what’s real. There’s been a lot of talk about decentralized graphics processing units (GPUs), for instance, continued Lin, “but no one talks about latency,” i.e., the time it takes for data to transfer across a network. Recent: Does Trump care about crypto? Bitcoin is latest battleground in US electionThese days, AI requests or recommendations from a centralized network can be obtained fairly quickly. However, due to “latency,” Lin said, decentralized networks won’t produce those results as quickly. Hyperbolic Labs’ Zhang didn’t think this would be a problem for decentralized networks like blockchains, however. “Inference is doable,” he said. Take a centralized network with a data center based in Texas that receives a request from a user in the United Kingdom, for instance. That data request “needs to travel from the U.K. across the ocean to Texas and then back again. So that actually has a very huge delay,” said Zhang. By comparison, with a reasonably sized decentralized network, a user could easily find a node in London to process that request locally, which would “actually reduce the communication overhead.”Indeed, Hyperbolic Labs recently launched an AI inference interface on the firm’s decentralized network and achieved latency results comparable to those from centralized solutions, Zhang recounted. A growing trend: Small language modelsMuch conversation in AI these days focuses on large language models (LLMs) that require massive amounts of computing power. However, according to Rhodes, “a lot is going on in what you could call edge AI — getting smaller language models that actually run efficiently on phones and on laptops.” That is:“There is much more compute available at the edge because the models are getting smaller for specific workloads, [and] you can actually take a lot more advantage of that.”Microsoft has been developing small language AI models that require less training data and computational power to develop and run, including its Phi-3 family of open models. Its capabilities “are really starting to approach some of the large language models,” recounted Rhodes.Regulators have AI in their sightsAI is likely to encounter intense scrutiny from regulators around the world in the coming years, much as cryptocurrencies have. What hurdles did panelists anticipate with regard to governmental rules and regulations? “I think the United States, in particular, is bad at it [regulation],” said Lin, who referenced the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s heavy-handed approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. “Now, [SEC Chair] Gensler has come out and said we’re going to regulate AI even more aggressively than blockchain’s digital assets.”Fintech powerhouse PayPal launched its own USD-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), seven months ago, and so Lin asked DeSilva for his take on U.S. regulation. “I don’t think the U.S. is bad at regulation,” said DeSilva. “Look at all the innovation that’s here in the United States.” Sure, it can be frustrating at times dealing with governmental authorities, but “regulators have a mission,” he explained: “Do no harm to customers.” They’re trying to protect consumers, and there’s nothing inherently wrong with that. Or, as he said from the stage:“If you want your technology, your innovation, to be used by millions or billions of customers, you’re going to have to engage with regulators.”Still, other jurisdictions, including the European Union, are becoming more welcoming to stablecoin issuers, and the U.S. needs to be mindful of that. “If the U.S. doesn’t move faster, that’s an advantage that will fritter away,” acknowledged DeSilva. “The U.S. has struggled with getting the right urgency level there.”Finding just the right amount of regulation could be even more challenging with artificial intelligence. It will be difficult for regulators to manage the potential harm to consumers given AI’s opaque decision-making process — the so-called black box problem — “and I think the regulators will struggle with that,” added DeSilvaThat opaqueness could actually provide an opportunity for blockchain technology with its transparency, immutability and tracking capabilities. Lin said:“You [can] have blockchains coming in as a kind of lord and savior, saying: ‘Regulators, we have this mechanism that can clear up the opacity associated with these black boxes.’”Wherefore AGI?Lin concluded the session by asking panelists to share their visions of AI’s future. Will artificial generalized intelligence (AGI) become a reality within the next five to 10 years, for example? And what might one expect in the shorter term?“In the near future, AI can be powerful enough that everyone will start using it,” predicted Zhang. “Every company will be an AI company, just like every company is an internet company now.” “I think in five to 10 years, AGI will become possible,” continued Zhang. “Look at how fast AI models improve now, and with the help of decentralized infrastructure, we can aggregate the compute,” i.e., boosting the overall volume of available GPUs, which should also enable smaller players to participate. Elsewhere, zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) “will be gone in three years,” predicted Rhodes, superseded by fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), a technology that achieves zero trust by “unlocking the value of data on untrusted domains without needing to decrypt it,” according to IBM. Reader: MakerDAO and Aave’s DeFi conflict reopens over DAI’s perceived risk growthFHE will solve a lot of privacy problems, said Rhodes, and could be particularly useful for the healthcare industry, including clinical trials that involve sensitive personal data. Rhodes, summarizing, recalled the words of the Wharton School’s Ethan Mollick: ”The AI that you’re using today will be the worst version of AI you ever use.” The same could be said with regard to ZK-proofs and fully homomorphic encryption. Overall, computing frameworks that secure privacy are going to get much better, he claimed. DeSilva has been working in tech and finance for several decades and has seen many concrete predictions come and go. “But I find that optimism [often] wins the day,” he told the gathering, adding:“So my prediction is you [will] get to AGI in time, and that it's a beneficial thing for people. That will take everybody’s work.”

XRP Skyrockets 23% in Volume Amid Mysterious 100 Million XRP Transfer


The trading volume of the popular cryptocurrency XRP has surged by an impressive 23% over the last 24 hours, reaching a staggering $1.27 billion, as reported by CoinMarketCap. This surge in trading activity coincides with a noteworthy uptick in XRP's price, which experienced a notable 3.7% increase yesterday, peaking at $0.5196. However, today, the price is undergoing a minor correction of 0.6%. These fluctuations in price come amid a broader surge in volatility across the cryptocurrency market.XRP to USD by CoinMarketCapOf particular interest is the revelation that 100 million XRP tokens were withdrawn from the Coincheck exchange today, amounting to approximately $51.6 million. The withdrawal was directed to an address identified as "r99Q," which has been active since February, with an initial transfer from the same exchange.Analysis of the address's transaction history reveals a consistent pattern of receiving XRP transfers from Coincheck, strongly indicating that the address is affiliated with the exchange itself. Coincheck is a prominent cryptocurrency exchange known for its strong presence in Japan. It is regulated by the country's Financial Services Agency (FSA) and audited by the Japan Blockchain Association. It boasts substantial liquidity, $100 million trading volume and traffic, positioning it as a key player in the Asian region.The mysterious transfer of 100 million XRP from Coincheck raises intriguing questions about the exchange's internal operations and its potential implications for market dynamics. While the exact motive behind the transfer remains undisclosed, it has undoubtedly contributed to the surge in XRP trading volume observed in the past 24 hours.

Kevin O'Leary Says He Would Never Buy Bitcoin ETFs: 'Just Own the Coin Directly' - Benzinga

Known for his many businesses and starring on Shark Tank, Kevin O'Leary certainly has a wealth of business expertise. However, in 2024, he shifted his focus more toward cryptocurrency, discussing it in several interviews and even investing in some cryptocurrency businesses. He recently discussed his views on the slew of bitcoin ETFs that were released in January 2024.Don't Miss:These ETFs were approved by the SEC in early January and allowed some of the largest names in finance and asset management to begin offering spot bitcoin ETFs. Firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity began offering the ETFs to their customers, and they have become the most successful ETF launch in history, amassing tens of billions in investment within months. However, O'Leary does see the value of a personal investment in the ETF. "I think it’s great that finally we have a Bitcoin ETF because there’s many people that would own Bitcoin through an ETF. I would never do that. Why would I pay the fees? There’s no added value to an ETF. I just own the coin directly," he noted. According to O'Leary, the management fees on the ETFs are a deterrent to his investment. The ETFs charge anywhere from 0.24% to 1.5% as management fees for purchasing and holding the bitcoin for their customers. This means that the sponsor of the ETF will require an annual payment, usually taken from the gross returns of the fund on top of any fees that the brokerage may charge. So, if you make $100 from the spot bitcoin ETFs, you will receive anywhere from $99.74 to $98.50 after the fees are taken out. Trending: How much Bitcoin did Michael Saylor says you need to become a millionaire? The number may shock you.However, this contrasts with owning bitcoin directly. Since bitcoin is decentralized, the only fees that are charged are those that cover the transaction cost. While the fees can vary based on the supply of verifiers and the demand for transactions, the average transaction fee usually hovers between $1 and $2. Additionally, owning bitcoin directly allows for other benefits. As a direct owner, you have discretion over how the tokens are used. This means that you can stake the tokens to receive interest or send them to others as a form of payment. Owning bitcoin directly allows you to use bitcoin to the fullest extent, whereas the ETFs simply allow you to access the price movements.While owning the token directly has its benefits, O'Leary still acknowledges that the ETFs are a positive for the crypto community. "What I really like about it is it’s sending a signal that the era of the crypto cowboy is over and that now financial services companies that are forced, and want to be regulated because that’s how they do business, can start to embrace crypto technology, including digital payment systems, into their portfolios. And so the first step is this bitcoin ETF, and it was well received," he said. With all of that in mind, O'Leary is bullish on bitcoin and owns a "5% weighting" of bitcoin in his portfolio. Read Next:

Boosting female leadership in crypto through quotas and proactive networking discussed in London

On April 24, the ‘Women in Crypto for Boards‘ series in London brought together C-level and Board-level women from the digital asset industry to address the underrepresentation of women in Web3, showcasing both the challenges and the opportunities for advancing gender equality in this rapidly evolving field.The event’s founder, Tim Connolly, highlighted the importance of diversity in enhancing businesses’ commercial profitability and governance. Connolly’s personal commitment to gender equality, stemming from witnessing the challenges faced by his mother and sisters, set a passionate tone for the discussions that followed.Challenges in RepresentationThe conversation quickly turned to the significant gender disparity in the crypto industry. Elizabeth Rosiello, CEO and Founder of AZA Finance, pointed out a novel issue: the lack of traditional board seats in many crypto companies. She noted, “A good chunk of crypto is not interested in human governance. So already we have fewer board seats available.” This lack of governance structures inherently limits opportunities for women to ascend to visibly aspirational leadership positions.Hedwige Nuyens, Chair of ‘European Women on Boards’ and CEO of the International Banking Federation, highlighted the compounded challenges in the crypto space, which combines the male-dominated fields of technology and finance. Nuyens stressed the need for the industry to evolve and mature.Visibility and NetworkingA recurring theme was the importance of visibility and proactive networking. Jeanette Seng, Global Partnerships Managing Director at FIS, emphasized the need for women to support and recommend each other for board positions. Hemilly Rodrigues, Founder & CEO of R&Co web3 AI agency, highlighted the necessity of maintaining a balanced approach in interactions, noting,“You need to keep a balance, not too tough, not too sweet. It’s pretty challenging still.”The panelists agreed that women must actively build their profiles and networks. Nuyens offered practical advice: “In your LinkedIn, just below your name, you start by saying the next role you have in mind… how I contribute to companies is. So you just give your elevator pitch.” This approach can significantly enhance visibility and open doors to board opportunities.Educational and Institutional SupportEducation and institutional support emerged as vital components for fostering diversity. The panelists called for implementing company training programs to educate employees on the benefits of diversity and inclusion. Such initiatives can help create a more welcoming environment for women.Additionally, the role of regulatory bodies was discussed. Nuyens cited the example of the European Banking Authority, which has mandated diversity in bank boards, leading to more profitable and less risky operations. Similar regulatory frameworks in the crypto industry could drive significant improvements.Quotas and TargetsThe contentious yet impactful topic of quotas was also addressed extensively during the roundtable. Several audience members raised questions and shared observations regarding implementing quotas in the crypto industry. One participant suggested having quotas on conference panels to ensure more female visibility. Others supported this idea, emphasizing the importance of showcasing talented women in the field to inspire and attract more female participation.Elizabeth Rosiello passionately advocated for quotas as a necessary measure to initiate change. She highlighted the resistance to change within the industry and stated,“I think the only answer right now is quotas. And you know what, are you going to go there and change everybody’s DNA and go back? Or are you going to be like, let’s start with a quota, and then that becomes the behavior.”Her point underscored the difficulty in altering deeply ingrained biases and the need for enforced measures to pave the way for more inclusive practices.Hedwige Nuyens added that quotas, while initially met with resistance, often lead to positive outcomes once implemented. She explained,“When you have more women, your business case improves, and there are numerous studies that have evidence of a stark correlation between female representation and attention to a better environmental score.”This evidence supports the argument that diversity promotes equality and enhances business performance.Utilizing Media for AdvocacyThe role of media in shaping perceptions and inspiring future generations was another focal point. Panelists suggested leveraging traditional and social media to highlight successful women in the industry. By celebrating achievements and sharing stories, the media can help dismantle stereotypes and attract more women to Web3.The roundtable concluded by acknowledging that while progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. Practical steps such as enhancing visibility, implementing educational programs, setting quotas, and utilizing media can collectively drive the change needed to achieve gender parity in Web3. As Nuyens aptly said, “It’s not about how to get your point across. It is about how to get in the dynamic of the discussion.”The Women in Web3 roundtable was a powerful reminder of the collective effort required to advance representation. The industry can work towards a more inclusive and equitable future by continuing these discussions and implementing the proposed solutions.Latest Alpha Market Report

EOS Blockchain Making a Return in 2024 with Peak Revenues: Messari Research | Cryptopolitan

The EOS blockchain started reinventing itself at the end of 2023, and has shown rapid revenue growth by the end of Q1. Recent Messari research shows EOS may emerge from years of obscurity and find its spot in the renewed drive for decentralized platforms. EOS earnings rose due to a higher transaction count, as well as fees for shared RAM resources.One of the key drivers of EOS in the coming months may be Bitcoin-based finance, where fractions of a BTC coin will be represented on the Bitcoin network. The EOS revenues are still around $1M per year, a small fee compared to other networks. However, the rising activity is seen as a positive sign for building after a long period of stagnation. Is EOS Making a Comeback?EOS launched back in 2017, after a long period of auction-based token sales. This helped EOS build a significant treasury in ETH tokens, while the network searched for projects and real-world applications. The EOS network will also go through an overhaul in the summer months. For one, the supply of tokens will grow to 2.1B, injecting another 900B into the market. EOS currently has around 1.2B tokens in circulation, some held in relatively old wallets.The new tokens will be paid out first to block producers, and will be used in the RAM market. The EOS network has a unique feature where it shares RAM resources for decentralized activities, and relies on fees to buy a part of the RAM on the virtual machine. RAM prices rose by 10X in 2024, showing a rise in usage and possibly a speculative market. The EOS RAM market is also among the top drivers of value for the network. Source: EOS AuthorityThe EOS network is also planning to increase the number of block producers and boost the speed of finalized transactions. EOS is different from other networks in that transactions have a grace period to fix errors before becoming permanent. Savanna Consensus Coming to EOS in JulyThe EOS Foundation has already locked the date for the Savanna consensus update. The new version is already running on testnet, and will be launched on the EOS main network from July 31. The Savanna upgrade may bring attention to EOS, along with altered rules, a higher number of block producers and a shorter time until transactions are finalized. The Savanna consensus has been proposed a few months back, and will contain mechanisms to transfer RAM tokens between accounts, or burn RAM to decrease supply. The July upgrade will also open the door for building more distributed apps on EOS, making the network overall more user-friendly. EOS to Carry Tokenized BitcoinThe most significant addition to EOS would be a new DeFi tool using Bitcoin representation on the EOS blockchain. The ExSats project was introduced in May, and has already outlined its goals of creating a docking layer to connect Bitcoin to other networks. With the ExSats protocol, EOS plans to carry a Layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin. This will create a new type of asset, capable of interacting with other blockchains and the Ethereum ecosystem. The ExSats solution will join a growing list of attempts to bring DeFi to Bitcoin, including RGB technology, Ordinals, and Runes. The ExSat network will have a significant barrier to entry, where each validator must stake at least 100 BTC.Can the EOS Market Price Recover?EOS is trading at $0.80, keeping to a tight range after years of stagnation. Even with increased usage, EOS has remained stuck in sideways trading. The asset, once a top-10 token, fell to position 86 based on market capitalization. The EOS market will now have to absorb the additional tokens, which may decrease the price. EOS has a relatively stable trading volume of around $130M per day. EOS is spread out in minor trading pairs, with sales slippage over $400K. During the Web3 boom, the EOS network found support from several decentralized apps. EOS and WAX supported the Wombat Dungeon Master game. The most active app on EOS remains Uplant, a metaverse game with more than 25K daily players. Cryptopolitan reporting by Hristina Vasileva

Subsquid SQD Token Lists on Multiple Global Crypto Exchanges After Funding Announcement



                    
Zug, Switzerland, May 16th, 2024, Chainwire


Web3 data access layer Subsquid has confirmed that its SQD token is to list on several tier-one crypto exchanges. The native Subsquid token will be simultaneously listed on Gate.io, Bybit, KuCoin, CoinList and MEXC Global on May 17th, 2024. 
Markets for trading SQD will open at 8:00 UTC, with an initial launch price of $0.094. The multiple exchange listing follows an oversubscribed token sale on Coinlist that raised $6.3M. The addition of SQD to tier-one exchanges will increase liquidity and access to the native Subsquid token.
SQD plays a critical role in the Subsquid ecosystem. In addition to aligning incentives between infrastructure providers, the token is used to reward node operators that provide computation and storage resources. Other use cases include node curation and facilitating protocol governance.
Marcel Fohrmann, Co-Founder of Subsquid said: “We’re excited to see our token go live on various trading venues. We’ve been working on getting Subsquid to market and onboard hundreds of worker nodes. With Subsquid Network even petabytes of on-chain data can be accessed and queried in a trustless and permissionless way, gradually replacing RPC nodes for data reads.  We believe that this is another step towards powerful, fully decentralized web3 dapps and analytics.”
The listing of SQD on global exchanges will support Subsquid’s goal of decentralizing its network and opening it up to as many web3 users as possible. This will empower SQD holders to utilize Subsquid’s protocol and participate in its permissionless data economy.

Coinbase targets self-managed pension funds in Australia

Coinbase plans to introduce a service dedicated to targeting the self-managed pension sector in Australia. 
The CEO of the Asia-Pacific exchange, John O’Loghlen, told Bloomberg: “We do not consider it cannibalization of ETFs.” Let’s see all the details below.

Australia: Coinbase’s approach to attract and retain pension funds
As anticipated, Coinbase is currently developing a targeted service for the self-managed pension sector in Australia, as reported by the CEO of the exchange for the Asia-Pacific region, John O’Loghlen, in an interview with Bloomberg.
The involvement of cryptocurrencies in the pension landscape is not a novelty. In fact, starting from March 2019, self-managed funds in Australia have seen a significant increase in investments in cryptocurrencies.
According to the most recent data from the Australian Taxation Office, investments in cryptocurrencies have reached almost 1 billion Australian dollars (equivalent to 664 million US dollars). 
Thus marking a sharp increase compared to the 197 million Australian dollars recorded in December 2019. However, it has emerged that thousands of Australians have suffered significant losses. 
In particular, losing millions of dollars, using self-managed pension funds to invest in cryptocurrencies, as reported by Reuters in March 2023.
O’Loghlen emphasized that “Self-managed super funds could simply make a single allocation, set it and forget it.”
Indicating therefore that Coinbase is actively working on a targeted offer to meet these specific customer needs, with the goal of attracting and retaining them within the platform.
The growing interest in cryptocurrencies in the self-managed pension sector could be fueled by the enthusiasm generated by the recent approvals of spot ETFs in the United States. 
Furthermore, also from the expectations that Australia may follow the same path during this year.
O’Loghlen clarified that this new service is not seen as a threat to ETF operators, but rather as a response to the growing interest, providing potential investors with direct access through their self-management portals.
Resumption of Coinbase operations after a four-hour interruption
Coinbase has finally resumed operations after an interference of the system that left users locked out for hours.
On May 14th, Coinbase announced that it had been hit by a serious system issue that caused significant disruptions for both desktop and mobile users.
Through a social media post shared on various platforms, the company described the event as a “system-wide disruption,” which resulted in a temporary unavailability of its services.
The interruption started around 4:15 UTC on Tuesday and persisted for several hours, leaving users unable to access their accounts. 
However, the company’s support team later announced that the services had been fully restored.
Initially, attempts to access the Coinbase website returned users an error message “Service 503 temporarily unavailable.” 
Despite repeated attempts to request details on the exact cause of the problem, the company has not been able to provide a definitive explanation. 
However, it fueled speculation about the possibility that it was due to system overload issues or server maintenance.
Even though Coinbase assured users that their funds were safe during the outage, the lack of a clear explanation has fueled further speculation among industry observers.

Three Reasons Why Solana's (SOL) Price Soared Past $160


																Solana’s native token, SOL, surged by double digits within a 24-hour period. At the time of reporting, SOL is valued at $161 after tapping $165 earlier, with a 24-hour trading volume of $3.7 billion, marking an increase of 56.6%.
According to CoinGecko data, SOL is the fifth largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $73.1 billion.
Robinhood and Infinex’s Announcements
This surge in SOL’s price can be attributed to several recent developments within the crypto space, notably involving major platforms such as Robinhood, Infinex, and MarginFi.
In a May 15 announcement on Solana’s official X account, the Vlad Tenev-spearheaded firm announced that Robinhood Crypto, a digital asset trading platform, will launch a Solana-staking feature in Europe.






“Robinhood Crypto is excited to announce a series of new features specifically designed for its customers in Europe, including staking, localized apps, crypto rewards for new customers, and updated Learn & Earn modules,” the company stated.
Through the Robinhood Crypto app, customers can now stake their Solana (SOL) holdings, granting them the opportunity to earn rewards while maintaining the flexibility to unstake as desired.
The company also announced a bonus program for new customers, wherein they can receive a 10% bonus on their net purchases during their initial 30 days on the platform, with bonuses disbursed in USDC stablecoins.
Infinex, a decentralized perpetual contract trading platform launched by Synthetix, has also announced its support for Solana.


The integration of Solana into the Infinex platform opens up new opportunities for users, with the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the platform reaching 71,185,763.71 USDC since its launch. According to Infinex’s website, over 4.1 million USDC has already been locked in Solana.
Marginfi Reveals Solana’s First Liquidity Layer
In a May 15 announcement on X Marginfi, a decentralized portfolio margining protocol for trading on Solana revealed the L1 blockchain’s first Liquidity Layer.


Described as a new layer for performant DeFi, Marginfi’s Liquidity Layer offers a range of integrated, native yields, including natural staking yield through LST, native token yield through mrgnlend, and native stablecoin yield through YBX.
The surge in SOL’s price coincides with broader gains across the crypto market, which has risen by 4.7% in the last day to reach a total market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.
At writing time, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $66,000, marking a 5.7% increase in the last 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a 3.3% increase and is now trading at around $3,000.

Stocks to Watch Today: Walmart, Chubb, and 3M - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



In today’s stock market news, three major companies – 3M (NYSE: MMM), Chubb (NYSE: CB), and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) – are making headlines. These companies have experienced notable changes in their stock prices, driven by factors such as analyst upgrades, high-profile investments, and impressive quarterly earnings reports. 



3M Stock Surges on Positive Developments



3M (MMM) stock has seen a surge in value, currently trading at $104.14, up $2.86 (2.86%) from the previous close. This increase comes from a positive analyst upgrade from Vertical Research Partners, who moved their rating from “Hold” to “Buy” based on a favorable risk/reward outlook. Additionally, under the leadership of new CEO Bill Brown, who took the helm on May 1, 2024, 3M has undergone significant corporate restructuring, including the spinoff of its healthcare business into a new company called Solventum. The company has also settled major lawsuits, agreeing to pay approximately $18 billion over several years to resolve liabilities from water pollution and military earplug issues. Despite struggles in recent quarters, 3M reported a 0.8% year-over-year growth in first-quarter sales, marking its first positive growth in five quarters.





Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Invests in Chubb 



Chubb stock is making waves following the news that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) has acquired about 26 million shares worth approximately $6.7 billion. This significant investment, revealed in a regulatory filing, caused Chubb’s stock to surge above its official buy point, jumping 5.9% and showcasing strong market confidence bolstered by Buffett’s move. The investment is seen as a return to Buffett’s roots in the insurance industry, an area where Berkshire Hathaway has historically found substantial success. Currently, Chubb’s stock is trading at $263.08, up $10.11 (3.99%) from the previous close, with a market cap of $106.824 billion.



Walmart Posts Strong Q1 Results



Walmart stock is also experiencing a significant increase. It is currently trading at $63.75, up $3.92 (6.55%) from the previous close. The company has a market cap of $513.812 billion. This surge comes after the company reported impressive first-quarter results. Revenue grew by 6.0% to $161.5 billion, exceeding market expectations. Walmart’s adjusted operating income rose by 13.7% due to higher gross margins and increased membership income. The company’s eCommerce revenue also saw a substantial 21% growth, largely driven by its store-fulfilled pickup and delivery services and its thriving advertising business. Additionally, Walmart reported a 2.7% global inventory decrease, indicating effective management practices.







Do you think the stock market is heading for a soft landing in 2024? Let us know in the comments below.

XRP whales add $55 million, but the price falls again - What's happening? - AMBCrypto



XRP whales have increased their accumulation of the token over the last 14 days
However, this failed to affect the altcoin’s price positively

XRP’s price has maintained a downtrend on the charts lately. This, despite the spike in whale activity over the past two weeks. 
In fact, on-chain data from Santiment revealed that XRP whales that hold between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 tokens acquired 110 million XRP worth around $55 million over this period. 
Source: Santiment
Contrary to expectations though, after the altcoin’s price peaked at $0.56 on 6 May, it has since declined by 9%. At press time, XRP was trading at $0.51 on the charts. 
XRP’s on-chain demand has cratered
While a cohort of XRP whales has intensified accumulation, the market has seen a general decline in demand for the altcoin. For instance, according to Santiment’s data, XRP’s daily active address count observed using a seven-day moving average (MA) fell by 27% in the last week.
Likewise, new demand for XRP plummeted during the same period. Also observed using a seven-day MA, the daily count of new addresses involved in XRP trades over the past week dropped by 16%.
Source: Santiment
The reason for this is plausible. Amid the general market uptick over the last seven days, XRP investments have mostly returned losses. 
AMBCrypto assessed the daily ratio of XRP transaction volume in profit to loss (7-day MA) and found that in the last week, for every transaction involving the altcoin that ended in a loss, only 0.91 transactions returned a profit. This means that XRP investors have recorded more losses than they have made a profit in the last seven days.
As a result, the negative sentiment trailing the altcoin gained momentum. At the time of writing, the token’s weighted sentiment had reading of just -0.56. 

Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2024-25

Futures traders remain focused
Interestingly, despite XRP’s low price action over the past week, its Futures traders have maintained a bullish outlook. 
The token’s open interest has been on an uptrend since the beginning of May. With figures of $583 million at press time, it has since hiked by 9%, according to Coinglass data. 
Furthermore, the token’s funding rate across cryptocurrency exchanges remains positive too. Here, funding rates are a mechanism used in perpetual Futures contracts to ensure the contract price stays close to the spot price. 
Source: Coinglass
When an asset’s funding rate is positive, its contract price is higher than its spot price. This is a sign that more traders are holding long positions and are expecting a price rally on the charts.

'Lots of Professional Firms Own Bitcoin ETFs,' Says Bitwise Asset Management CIO | Cryptoglobe


                                
Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Asset Management, recently published an in-depth analysis of the success of the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 10 January 2024. Since their launch, these ETFs have attracted over $12.15 billion in assets, making them collectively the most popular ETF launch in history.







Hougan emphasizes the significance of identifying whether professional or retail investors are driving these inflows. The involvement of professional investors is particularly important because it suggests a substantial and growing pool of capital investing in Bitcoin. Initially, it was challenging to determine the source of the inflows due to the anonymous nature of ETF purchases through brokerage accounts. However, quarterly “13F” filings, mandated by the SEC for investors managing more than $100 million in publicly traded securities, have provided clarity.



Analyzing 13F filings as of 9 May 2024, Hougan discovered that numerous professional investment firms own substantial amounts of Bitcoin ETFs. Notable firms include Hightower Advisors, Bracebridge Capital, Cambridge Investment Research, Sequoia Financial Advisors, Integrated Advisors, and Brown Advisory. Collectively, 563 professional investment firms reported owning $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs. Hougan anticipates that by the 15 May filing deadline, this number could exceed 700 firms, with total assets under management (AUM) nearing $5 billion.



Hougan says this level of professional investor involvement is unprecedented for a new ETF launch. He says that Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has described the scale of ownership as “bonkers,” highlighting its historical significance. 











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

According to the Bitwise CIO, despite the impressive professional participation, retail investors currently hold the majority of the Bitcoin ETF assets, accounting for approximately 90% of the total $50 billion in AUM.



Hougan points out that this high level of retail investment should not overshadow the significant institutional interest. He explains that professional investors typically follow a phased approach to new asset classes, involving due diligence, personal allocations, isolated client allocations, and eventually platform-wide allocations. Hougan believes the initial allocations seen in the 13F filings represent only the beginning of a broader trend. For example, he points out that Hightower Advisors’ $68 million allocation to Bitcoin ETFs is just 0.05% of their total assets, suggesting considerable potential for future growth.



Hougan concludes that the substantial initial investments by professional firms are a promising indicator of Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and integration into traditional financial portfolios.

XRP Whales Surge into Bullish Outlook as Market Confidence Skyrockets

Crypto analyst Ali has spotted an interesting trend among XRP whales. According to Ali, XRP whales have purchased approximately 110 million XRP tokens in the last two weeks, totaling $55 million in value.The term "whales" often refers to entities or persons who own a large amount of a certain cryptocurrency. This aggressive accumulation is typically a positive sign since it may indicate more buying pressure from market players. Ali referenced Santiment data to show that XRP whales with 1 million to 10 million coins had been aggressively accumulating the digital currency, with noteworthy transactions occurring in the last two weeks.These large-scale purchases have resulted in a net rise in whales' XRP holdings, signaling confidence and bullish sentiment toward the cryptocurrency.This has piqued the interest of the crypto community, prompting speculation regarding the reasons behind such a large accumulation and its potential implications for XRP's price trajectory.XRP price actionXRP price has largely consolidated in a range since mid-April. Bulls' attempts to push XRP price beyond the $0.57 level was rebuffed by bears on two occasions. This suggests a near-term resistance around this region, which needs to be breached for the XRP price to advance.After hitting a low of $0.4841 on May 13, the XRP price began to recover. Although slight selling has hampered its rebound, XRP reached intraday highs of $0.523 during today's trading session.At the time of writing, XRP had risen 1.69% in the last 24 hours to $0.514. If XRP's price can maintain its present levels, it may rally to the overhead resistance of $0.57. This level may prove to be a difficult obstacle to overcome. If this is surpassed, XRP might rise as high as $0.64 or perhaps $0.74 on a breach of its daily moving averages.Alternatively, if the price falls from its current level, bears may attempt to strengthen their position by bringing the price to the important support of $0.46. Buyers are anticipated to defend this level vigorously. A robust rebound from $0.46 might indicate that the range-bound activity may continue for some time.

Are Foreign Cryptocurrency Exchanges Banned in Turkey? Should Investors Withdraw Their Money? - Bitcoin Sistemi

After the AK Party announced the cryptocurrency bill, investors who kept their investments in global stock exchanges felt uneasy with the statement that “foreign stock exchanges are being banned.”
So are foreign exchanges really banned? Should investors holding crypto assets on foreign exchanges withdraw their money?
According to the proposal announced by AK Party Group Chairman Abdullah Güler, a licensing system is being introduced for crypto asset exchanges in our country, as in the USA and many European countries.


Foreign exchanges that operate abroad and have not yet established a company in Turkey will be able to operate in our country by first establishing a company in Turkey and fulfilling the necessary conditions to obtain a license announced by the CMB.
Foreign stock exchanges that already have companies in Turkey will be able to continue their activities in our country by fulfilling the necessary conditions to obtain a license to be announced by the CMB.





We see that the main criterion here is not the foreign origin of the company, but whether it has a company established in Turkey. It seems quite possible that stock exchanges will establish a separate company in Turkey, obtain a license and continue their activities in Turkey in this way.
We have observed that similar initiatives have been made in licensing studies for Binance and other cryptocurrency exchanges in many European countries, and that the exchanges have established a new company in the relevant country, obtained a license through this company and continue their activities. We think that this issue will be similar in Turkey and stock exchanges will comply with legal regulations.


The fact that many global stock exchanges (BinanceTR, GateTR, OKXTR) already have companies established in Turkey shows that a transition process in compliance with the law can be achieved in this process.
For example; Currently, US-based CitiBank has received a CMB license and operates as a brokerage house through Citi Menkul Değerler A.Ş., which it opened in Turkey. When you examine the CMB's list of intermediary institutions, you can see that many foreign companies can obtain a license by establishing a company established in Turkey.





Should We Withdraw Our Crypto Assets from Foreign Exchanges?
In this regard, we would like to remind you that, in principle, you should store your crypto assets in your personal wallets, not in exchanges. However, we felt the need to make this statement in case you are worried about the recent news.
With the 17th article of the bill, the provisional article 11 was added to the law no. 6362. This article foresees the transition period after the law comes into force. Therefore, there is no such thing as a law passed tomorrow, let's close access to these exchanges, you can't withdraw money anymore.
The 4th paragraph of the provisional article 11 regulates the transition period for stock exchanges that are not resident in Turkey. The full text of the paragraph is as follows:


“Crypto asset service providers located abroad shall terminate their activities towards persons resident in Turkey, as specified in the first paragraph of Article 99/A of the Law, within three months following the date of entry into force of the Law.”

As can be seen from this article, a 3-month transition period is foreseen in the law for stock exchanges that are solely located abroad and do not intend to obtain any license in Turkey. This transition period is a regulation introduced to prevent investors from being victimized.
In summary, investors will be able to withdraw their assets from foreign exchanges within 3 months if the law is passed by the parliament in its current form and the proposal becomes law.
Considering that the law is still at the proposal stage and its transitional provisions, lawyers state that there is no reason for investors to panic.

Bitcoin Selling Pressure on Coinbase Eases as BTC’s Price Surges Over 8% in a Day | Cryptoglobe


                                
Selling pressure on the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has eased as the well-known Coinbase premium, which tracks the price difference of Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges, has significantly narrowed.



The “Coinbase Premium Gap,” as on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant shows, has narrowed after dipping into significantly negative territory this week, suggesting significant selling pressure on the exchange that is known to be used by institutional investors entering the cryptocurrency space.



The narrowing of the gap indicates that selling pressure has eased, likely as flows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) started stabilizing and as the price of the flagship cryptocurrency started surging.







According to popular analyst Maartunn, who shared a chart of the Coinbase Premium Gap on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the gap’s drop could “create some short-term upside opportunity.”



However, the analyst also noted there has been a sharp rise in Bitcoin’s open interest, which indicates the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts, increased by 9% in “just a few hours” in a move the analyst said “doesn’t look healthy.”



These changes came as the price of the flaghip cryptocurrency Bitcoin seemingly started breaking out of a range it has been holding onto for over a month, surpassing the $65,000 mark to now trade above $66,000 after rising more than 8% over the last 24-hour period.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Notably, the cryptocurrency rose after inflation data in the United States revealed consumer prices rose 3.4% year-over-year in April, compared to a 3.5% rise in March.







Recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have been revealing hedge funds and Wall Street giants added exposure to Bitcoin via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the first quarter of the year, with Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund managing roughly $12 billion in assets, buying up $360 million over three funds.



The disclosure comes amid several others, with the U.S. state of Wisconsin recently becoming the first local government entity to reveal an investment in Bitcoin after purchasing 94,562 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), worth nearly $100 million, in the first quarter of the year.



The move sees the state of Wisconsin join several Wall Street giants, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, in revealing BTC exposure through investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to 13F filings.



JPMorgan revealed an investment of $731,246 in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC, while Wells Fargo disclosed $141,817 in GBTC holdings. BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon have also made similar disclosures.



BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin in the first quarter of the year as well by purchasing shares of IBIT.

Renowned scholar, former option trader and risk analyst Nassim Nicholas Taleb is known to a wide audience thanks to his popular books “Black Swan”, “Antifragile”, “Skin in The Game”, etc.Less than an hour ago, Taleb revealed the title of his next book and what it will be about in a post published on the X social media platform. Taleb is also a major Bitcoin critic who came to it all the way from adoring BTC.Taleb shared that his next book will be called The Lydian Stone (also known as the “touchstone”) that is a flint stone that was used by ancient peoples to verify the quality of silver and gold. As for the subject of this new book, the scholar wrote that it will be “partly on how humans get confused by sequences.” “It also maps to the arrow of time and Entropy.”Three years ago, Taleb made a loud reverse from Bitcoin, turning into a BTC critic. He tweeted that he had begun selling his BTC. One of the reasons for that was its high volatility and he stated that a currency cannot be more volatile than things you buy with it. He also stated that Bitcoin for him had failed to work as a store of value. Since then, he has been constantly criticizing BTC on his X account and once even referred to it as a tumor.Considering the large amount of critiques he has poured on Bitcoin, the odds are that Taleb could mention Bitcoin in his new book.

Vanguard's new CEO upholds firm's stance against Bitcoin ETFs despite crypto enthusiasm

Vanguard’s newly appointed CEO, Salim Ramji, has scuttled notions that he might reverse the investment giant’s decision against launching a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) due to his pro-crypto stance.Ramji’s May 14 appointment at Vanguard had led to speculations that the investment firm might reverse its anti-BTC stand, with Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas saying:“[Ramji] has been quoted about his interest in digital assets although I’m not sure that’s going to change Vanguard’s stance but he will be the CEO. Who knows. Door much more open now IMO.”Ramji, who will take over at Vanguard by June 8, previously headed BlackRock’s ETF division and was a crucial player in the launch of the asset manager spot Bitcoin ETF product IBIT. Notably, he left his BlackRock position in January.However, in a May 15 interview with Barrons, Ramji revealed that he would maintain “consistency” with what Vanguard stands for and “the products and services they offer.” He added:“I have heard [chief investment officer] Greg Davis’ explanation and I think it is entirely consistent with Vanguard’s investment philosophy. It is a logical and consistent point of view.”Earlier in the year, while the Bitcoin ETF approval euphoria still gripped the market, Vanguard decided against offering its clients access to Bitcoin ETFs because the flagship digital asset was “immature” and did not align with the company philosophy.Former CEO Tim Buckley further explained that the firm does not intend to change its stance toward the spot Bitcoin ETFs, primarily because it does not believe they belong in long-term and retirement portfolios.Ramji’s promise to keep towing this path might anger long-time customers who had previously threatened to close their accounts because of the firm’s anti-BTC decision.Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, said:“He didn’t specifically comment on whether Vanguard would allow spot bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform, but this doesn’t look positive.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Crypto Exchange Coinbase Adds Solana-Based DEX to Listing Roadmap - The Daily Hodl


								Coinbase has added a new Solana (SOL)-based decentralized exchange (DEX) altcoin to its listing roadmap.
On Tuesday, the top US crypto exchange put Drift Protocol (DRIFT) on the path towards being tradeable on its platform in the future.










Drift is an open-source DEX that enables transparent and non-custodial trading.
Explains the project,
“Drift was designed with a goal to be capital-efficient but also protective of your assets. We achieved that by setting up sophisticated cross-margined risk engine – a system of tools with an extensive protection from over-extending risk. For instance:

In the lend/borrow markets, you can also use collateral for perpetual futures and trade more efficiently with spot assets.
Every token you deposit can earn you more through borrowing and also act as a collateral for perpetual swaps.
Borrowers can only borrow if they have more collateral than needed, following multiple safety measures for extra protection.”

The Drift Foundation plans to airdrop 12% of DRIFT’s supply (120 million tokens) on Thursday. The asset is not yet trading at time of writing.
Explains the foundation,
“This marks a significant step towards decentralizing Drift Protocol, acknowledging loyal users, and empowering the community with a greater voice in the protocol’s future development.”
Coinbase created its listing roadmap in 2022 to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of investors front-running new trading support announcements.

Fordefi: security in the crypto ecosystem thanks to Munich Re

Fordefi, a company specialized in crypto wallets for DeFi, has secured insurance coverage against crimes and cyber threats thanks to Munich Re, a major German carrier.
The policy, with an unspecified value in dollars, was orchestrated with the assistance of blockchain experts from Lockton’s Emerging Asset Protection team, an insurance broker. Below we see all the details. 

The strategic partnership with Munich Re ensures the protection of Fordefi’s digital crypto wallets
As anticipated, Fordefi, a crypto wallet designed for decentralized finance (DeFi), has formed a partnership with the German insurance giant Munich Re. As announced by the companies in a blog post.
The Fordefi wallet policy, which covers cyber attacks, internal fraud, and collusion, was facilitated by the insurance broker Lockton based in Kansas City. This is in contrast to protection based on smart contracts.
It is emphasized that the amount of coverage in dollars has not been disclosed. 
However, in addition to the general coverage offered for the Fordefi portfolio – which leverages intelligent key sharing features such as multi-party computation (MPC) – customers have the opportunity to increase coverage individually through Munich Re. 
The growing range of decentralized and on-chain trading platforms in the DeFi has been described as a “hacker’s playground.” Making it a challenge even for insurers more focused on digital assets.
Protecting private keys and wallet components
Regarding this, the CEO of Fordefi, Josh Schwartz, stated that the new product has naturally sparked interest from Munich Re in further exploring the DeFi arena. Furthermore, further developments are expected to come.
Schwartz, previously chief operating officer of Curv, a cryptographic custody company acquired by PayPal in 2021, was one of the first to collaborate with Munich Re.
Schwartz stated in an interview that the policy covers external cyber threats and attacks that could compromise the platform, as well as internal fraud or collusion among employees. 
Munich Re is not involved at the smart contract level. However, they are engaging with active participants in DeFi, starting from a framework they consider secure. Namely, the protection of private keys and wallet components.
On the front of risks related to smart contracts, Sarah Downey, blockchain manager of Emerging Asset Protection (LEAP) at Lockton, stated that the insurance sector is progressing in the right direction.
 In terms of solutions available on the market, Chainproof offers coverage to DeFi users for technical code failures. On the other hand, there is the decentralized approach of the capital pool created by Nexus Mutual.
The previous $10 million funding round of Fordefi 
Fordefi aims to bring web3 wallets into the financial mainstream. 
So, recently, it successfully completed a strategic funding round of 10 million dollars, defined as a seed extension after the recent 18 million dollar round. 
This time, Electric Capital led the round, with Paxos Trust Company and Alchemy among the new investors.
With this new injection of capital, Fordefi aims to further develop its wallet-as-a-service (WaaS) offerings. In particular, focusing on providing self-custody wallets for institutional investors directly through their applications.
The company has already made significant progress in becoming one of the leading providers of MPC wallets for this market segment, with prominent clients such as Flare Network, DeFiance Capital, and Pantera Capital.
Fordefi’s products are already integrated with the Ethereum, Cosmos, and Solana ecosystems. This facilitates multi-chain compatibility and records an on-chain transaction volume of over 3 billion dollars to date.
With the web3 industry and digital assets in full growth, Fordefi is preparing to offer additional secure self-custody wallet services in collaboration with institutional partners. 
The company aims to expand its portfolio and security infrastructure, thus consolidating its competitive advantage in the sector.

Bybit Returns 2% to Bybit Card Users via Cashback Campaign | Coinspeaker



Bybit has announced a 2% cashback in USDT for all users, who spend crypto or fiat using the exchange’s Bybit card.

Major cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has launched a cashback offer for users of its Bybit Card. All users who make purchases via fiat or crypto will receive 2% of their purchase, paid directly to the users’ accounts in USDT.
Bybit Cashback to Encourage Crypto Transactions
According to an official press release, the cashback offer is the exchange’s way of contributing to integrating digital assets in daily user transactions. Bybit Sales and Marketing Director Joan Han stated:




“Bybit is dedicated to pioneering the cryptocurrency landscape by partnering with leading projects that enhance the overall market and deliver significant benefits to our users. Through the Bybit Card, we are committed to simplifying cryptocurrency access, effectively narrowing the divide between conventional finance and the digital economy.”
The release also states that users can activate an Auto Cashback function that automatically converts all cashback points earned into USDT. This allows cardholders to earn effortlessly without any extra submissions or applications. ByBit will issue cashback points within a few days of each transaction. Each user’s balance will be available in Bybit’s Reward Market under “Earned”.
Bybit initially launched the Bybit Card last March, available as a virtual card in select European countries. The exchange later launched a physical plastic card in April, with support for a few cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, USD Coin (USDC), and USDT. According to ByBit’s website, the Bybit Card is available to residents of Australia, and the European Economic Area (EEA), except Romania, Liechtenstein, Ireland, Iceland, and Croatia. Bybit charges 5 EUR/GBP/USDT for the physical card, and zero fees for the virtual card.
Bybit is one of a few cryptocurrency companies that launched debit crypto cards. In October 2018, Crypto.com began shipping Visa cards to Asia-Pacific (APAC) customers. According to Crypto.com’s website, cards are available in Canada, Brazil, Australia, and several European countries. Crypto exchange Blockchain.com also launched a card in 2022 in partnership with Visa. Like Coinbase’s crypto cards, Blockchain.com crypto cards are currently only available to US customers.
Bybit Payments and Investment Tools
Last month, Bybit announced it has integrated Google Pay, to support simple crypto purchases across 35 currencies. Before now, users buying digital assets on Bybit required third-party payment processors, bank transfers, or other time-consuming processes. With the Google Pay integration, users can buy crypto in one click using payment information available in Google wallets. The exchange guarantees that the integration is secure and takes advantage of Google’s verification and protection protocols.
According to CoinMarketCap data, Bybit is the world’s third-largest exchange by trading volume, with more than $4.2 billion traded in the last 24 hours. As part of efforts to support cryptocurrency usage and adoption, Bybit recently launched a free Crypto Investment Analysis Toolkit. The aim is to help investors with all they need to properly appraise crypto projects for better-informed decision-making. The toolkit assesses projects based on metrics beyond price analysis. It uses insights from data points, economic factors, and assessments from internal experts.

Tokenized Treasuries Are An Emerging Asset Class, But RWA Adoption May Take Time


                        
                            Tokenized Treasuries Are An Emerging Asset Class, But RWA Adoption May Take Time

                        Demand for tokenized treasuries is on the rise. Recent data indicates that more than $1 billion in treasury notes has been tokenized on public blockchain networks.Andrew O’Neill, Digital Assets Managing Director of S&P Global Ratings, told Cryptonews that the recent launch of BlackRock’s BUIDL fund – currently the world’s largest tokenized treasury fund – seems to be accelerating this trend.“As shown in the chart, the launch of the BUIDL fund has steepened growth in outstanding volume,” said O’Neill.Source: S&P Global Ratings“It’s also interesting to note Larry Fink’s public statements on the role of tokenization in the future of BlackRock and financial markets, to understand the context in which this is being done,” O’Neill added.What Are Tokenized Treasuries?
Indeed, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently mentioned that capital markets could be made more efficient by moving on-chain.“Tokenized treasuries are digital tokens created on a blockchain that are backed by a portfolio of U.S. government obligations,” O’Neill explained. “These assets are issued both by blockchain-native firms and traditional institutions.”O’Neill believes that tokenized treasuries are becoming more important because they can help money market funds and their investors manage liquidity.Tokenized Treasuries Help With Liquidity Challenges 
For example, O’Neill noted that in times of market volatility, investors may need to meet margin calls on some positions.“Money market fund investors may seek to redeem their shares in the fund for cash to meet these obligations,” said O’Neill.O’Neill noted that if many investors redeemed at once, however, this would increase the fund’s liquidity risk.While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently increased funds’ minimum liquid assets requirements to mitigate this risk, O’Neill believes that tokenization can be beneficial.“Investors can now have round-the-clock access to liquidity on-chain,” he said. “For example, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, issued on Ethereum (a public blockchain), allows investors to redeem their shares for USDC stablecoin through a smart contract, without relying on any intermediary.”He further added that investors can use their tokens as liquid collateral rather than needing to redeem them. In turn, this could reduce the risk of a run on a fund.Franklin Templeton recently enabled peer-to-peer transfers on tokens from its FOBXX fund to support such a capability.Chris Yin, CEO and Co-founder of Plume Network – a layer-2 focused on RWAs – told Cryptonews that FOBXX seeks to provide investors with a secure and liquid investment vehicle.“FOBXX utilizes the Stellar blockchain for transaction processing, aiming to enhance transparency and reduce operational costs,” said Yin. “It is accessible through the Benji Investments app, which further allows for digital wallet integration.”Tokenized Treasuries Enable RWAs
Yin added that the real game changer behind tokenized treasuries is the enablement of fractional ownership of real-world assets (RWAs).“This approach enhances efficiency and allows for fractional ownership, expanding access to a broader base of investors,” Yin explained.While the concept is still new, tokenized treasuries could be divided into smaller units. Unlike traditional treasury notes with high minimum investment requirements, tokenization allows for even small investors to participate.“By starting with U.S. Treasuries, which are low-risk and familiar, they provide a gateway for investors to engage with on-chain assets,” said Yin.Will Tokenized Treasuries Appeal To Investors? 
While tokenized treasuries provide a number of benefits, how investors will engage with these new assets is unclear.This asset class is still emerging, and investor interest likewise,” said O’Neill. “A significant jump in investor interest requires that investors can fully realize the benefits of holding a tokenized asset.”To achieve this, O’Neill believes that blockchain interoperability is needed to support active secondary markets.“The ability to mobilize the tokenized asset itself as collateral, rather than having to redeem shares in a fund, is attractive, and this is already technically possible in some cases,” said O’Neill. “However, there is not yet a meaningful secondary market for trading these assets.”Additionally, O’Neill noted that solutions are required to bridge cash transactions on-chain.The other important aspect is enabling on-chain cash legs to support delivery-vs-payment transactions,” he said. “If a tokenized asset can be transferred on-chain, but the actual payments for a transaction are made off-chain in a traditional way, there is little gain for investors.”While this may be the case, Blackrock’s BUIDL fund illustrates how investors can access 24/7 liquidity through a smart contract using a stablecoin. O’Neill believes that regulatory clarity around stablecoins will help investors engage with these types of features moving forward.Tokenization Will Help Institutions, But Challenges Remain
Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Research Analyst James Seyffart told Cryptonews that firms including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and WisdomTree are demonstrating how blockchain can streamline aspects of traditional finance.“We’re in the very early innings for all of this, but firms are trying many different things and the market will ultimately decide what sticks,” said Seyffart.Yet, for tokenized treasuries to be successful, O’Neill believes that investors require direct access to the blockchains on which the tokenized assets are built. He also mentioned that institutions need to connect their legacy systems to those blockchains.With this in mind, Yin explained that Plume Network seeks to simplify the process of RWA project deployment, while presenting investors with a blockchain ecosystem to cross-pollinate and invest in various RWAs.“Plume Network enables RWA composability through its thriving DeFi applications and provides access to high-quality buyers to increase liquidity for all RWAs,” he said. “Through the various projects in our ecosystem, we provide crypto use cases – borrow/lend, trade, speculate, yield farm, etc. – to RWAs in order to uncover net new liquidity.”Yin also thinks that as institutional investors increasingly adopt RWAs, a new wave of retail investors will inject capital into blockchain ecosystems like never before.“By initially focusing on building traction within this community and gradually expanding towards institutional adoption, where the pace is typically slower, sustainable growth and mainstream acceptance can be achieved,” Yin remarked.O’Neill further stated that emerging regulatory frameworks in key jurisdictions will enhance investors’ appetite to engage with stablecoins and the features they enable.“Such as the BUIDL fund example of disintermediated redemption through a smart contract,” he said.

Why the Dow Jones Industrial Average Just Hit a New Record High - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) reached a historic milestone on Wednesday, surpassing the 40,000 mark for the first time in its nearly 128-year history. The blue-chip index, along with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, closed at record highs, marking a significant day for the U.S. stock market. At the time of writing, the DJIA has touched an intraday high of 40,004.23, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached 5,319.63 and 16,778.31, respectively. This achievement comes just over three years after the Dow first closed above 30,000 in November 2020 and less than three months after it surpassed 39,000 in February 2024.



Dow Jones Rises to Record High at 40,004.23



The DJIA’s recent surge can be attributed to several factors, including optimism about potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year and a slightly easing inflation report. Strong performances from major companies like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Boeing (NYSE: BA) also contributed to the index’s rise above 40,000. Walmart reported impressive sales growth and raised its earnings outlook, leading to a boost in its shares.



Additionally, Chubb (NYSE: CB) shares rose after Warren Buffett revealed the company as his mystery stock pick.Positive sentiment in Chinese property stocks, driven by government plans to purchase excess housing, also helped lift regional stock indexes. Furthermore, strong earnings reports from companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL), and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) played a role in the ongoing market rally.





What is the Dow Jones?



The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 30 large, publicly-owned companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. Established on May 26, 1896, the index closed at 40.94 points. It is one of the world’s oldest and most widely followed equity indices.



The DJIA has reached significant milestones throughout its history. In March 1999, the index reached 10,000 points, taking nearly 103 years. Since then, the pace of growth has accelerated, with the Dow hitting 20,000 in January 2017, 30,000 in November 2020, and now 40,000 in May 2024. 







Do you think the US economy is heading towards a better landing now that inflation fears seem to be easing, or is this a temporary gain? Let us know in the comments below.

Cardano Founder Hoskinson Teases 'Genesis Is Coming'


								Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently stoked the excitement of the cryptocurrency world with a succinct yet evocative post on X stating, “Genesis is coming.” This proclamation was linked to an in-depth blog entry by Nicholas Frisby, a software engineer at IOHK, shedding light on the forthcoming Ouroboros Genesis protocol, a significant update aimed at enhancing the foundational consensus mechanism of the Cardano blockchain.


Cardano: Deep Dive Into Ouroboros Genesis
The Ouroboros Genesis protocol represents a significant step forward in the development of Cardano’s underlying consensus mechanism. Building on the previous iterations—Ouroboros Classic, Ouroboros BFT, and Ouroboros Praos—Genesis introduces critical enhancements aimed at protecting network nodes when they are most vulnerable: at the time of their initial connection to the network or upon rejoining after a significant absence.

The update brings several innovative features to address the unique challenges faced by new or returning nodes:

Ledger Peers: A new component in the node architecture to enhance security by ensuring that nodes connect to trusted network participants, thus reducing the risk of eclipse attacks.
Lightweight Checkpointing: A mechanism that provides a fallback option during critical situations, allowing the network to quickly establish a consensus on the correct version of the blockchain history.
Limit on Eagerness (LoE): This feature prevents nodes from prematurely committing to a blockchain that hasn’t been fully validated by trusted sources.
Genesis Density Disconnections (GDD): A protocol to disconnect from peers that suggest a denser but potentially dishonest version of the blockchain.
Limit on Patience (LoP): Ensures that nodes only maintain connections with peers that deliver blockchain data promptly, reducing the risk of stalling attacks.


Moreover, Ouroboros Genesis goes beyond mere incremental improvements by deeply integrating mechanisms that significantly elevate the security posture of the network:

Rollback Limits: Retaining a set rollback limit from previous iterations (2,160 blocks), Genesis ensures a balance between flexibility and stability, preventing potential abuses in rollback capabilities while maintaining essential safety checks.
Peer Selection Logic Revision: The updated peer selection logic in Genesis leverages recent stake distributions to choose peers, increasing the probability of connecting to honest nodes and reducing the likelihood of eclipse attacks.
Adaptive Network Adjustments: The protocol features dynamic adjustments, such as modifying the number of ledger peers during a node’s syncing phase, which is crucial for maintaining robust defenses against network segmentation or isolation.

The introduction of Ouroboros Genesis is expected to mark a significant leap forward for Cardano’s security. With a projected release in Q3 of 2024, it is currently undergoing the final development and testing phases. This period is critical in ensuring the seamless integration of new features with existing systems, as well as their performance under diverse operational conditions.
At press time, ADA traded at $0.454.

Is Arbitrum's latest record good news for ARB's price? Metrics say... - AMBCrypto



Arbitrum active addresses registered figures of 900,000 for consecutive days
ARB’s market trend has continued to fall though

Arbitrum is in the news today after it seemed to solidify its position and asserted itself in the Layer 2 ecosystem. It did so after maintaining a level of active addresses above a certain threshold, setting a new record for daily active addresses by doing so. 
Additionally, its transaction count has seen a notable increase lately too. Despite these developments, however, the volume and price of its native token have remained relatively stable on the charts. 
Arbitrum sets record for active addresses
An analysis of active addresses on Growthepie revealed that Arbitrum achieved a record number of active addresses on 15 May. The chart illustrated that the active addresses surpassed 972,000, setting a new record for the L2 network and all Layer 2 networks. Also, Arbitrum maintained an average of over 900,000 active addresses over the last seven days – another record. 
At the time of writing, the network had registered over 786,000 active addresses in the last 24 hours. Base, the closest L2 competitor, noted just around 299,000 active addresses, highlighting Arbitrum’s significant influence. 
Additionally, an analysis of the transaction count revealed that Arbitrum led other L2 networks with approximately 2.1 million transactions, at the time of writing. This hike in active addresses positively correlated with the rise in transaction count, demonstrating its dominance in the L2 space.
Arbitrum volume remains steady
Arbitrum has seen record activity regarding active addresses over the past few days. However, an analysis of its volume did not reveal any significant movements. In fact, data from DefiLlama revealed that there were no notable changes in L2 volume over the past seven days. 
Nevertheless, the network recorded its highest volume within this timeframe in the last 24 hours, totaling around $483 million. 
Source: DefiLlama
Additionally, Arbitrum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) saw a slight hike of over 1% in the last 24 hours. 
According to data from L2 Beats, Arbitrum’s TVL surpassed $16 billion, at the time of writing, after climbing by over 1.2%. 
ARB remains bearish
However, the momentum seen in Arbitrum’s active addresses and Total Value Locked (TVL) did not translate to its native token – ARB. In fact, an analysis of ARB on the daily timeframe chart revealed a downtrend since March.

– Realistic or not, here’s ARB’s market cap in BTC’s terms

According to the price range tool, ARB has fallen by approximately 55% since the downtrend began back then.

Understanding the Meme Stock Phenomenon: Robinhood’s Steve Quirk Explains Market Dynamics | Cryptoglobe


                                
On May 16, Steve Quirk, the Chief Brokerage Officer at Robinhood, appeared on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” to discuss the recent resurgence of meme stock trading and its implications for the market and retail investors. 







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

These were the main highlights of the interview:



Volume and Participation Shifts: Quirk observed a shift in trading volumes compared to previous meme stock rallies. Initially, trading volumes were much higher, but the current volume suggests a more mature, diversified approach by retail investors. Notably, 80% of the newcomers during the initial rally are still with Robinhood, transitioning towards more stable financial vehicles like retirement accounts.Market Behavior and Volatility: The focus shifted to the discussion about market volatility and investor behavior, with significant trading days not directly linked to meme stocks but rather to major corporate announcements, like Nvidia’s earnings. This shift indicates a broader interest in fundamental investment opportunities over speculative trades.Market Integrity and Speculation: Quirk expressed concerns similar to those of Jay Clayton, former SEC Chairman, about the integrity of the market when stocks are driven by speculation rather than fundamentals. He highlighted the increased market participation against the backdrop of fewer tradable instruments, leading to potential market concentration and volatility.Investor Behavior and Speculation: Quirk described how investors view meme stocks as trades rather than long-term investments, contrasting their speculative activities with their core, more stable investments.

Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL) to Surge 13,000% as BitMart Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because DOGESOL has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on BitMart.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Baby Doge on Sol can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Baby Doge on Sol could become the next viral memecoin.



Baby Doge on Sol launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Baby Doge on Sol on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the BitMart listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Baby Doge on Sol by entering its contract address – G5GEMyeea1HqS2KnpazPiMuTy3sqS1UdQegsbNLGpF7U – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGESOL.

Solana Surpasses Ethereum By Revenue After Parabolic Fee Spike - The Defiant

The Solana community is celebrating record-high revenue, but the milestone is a sign users are paying high transaction fees.The turf war between Solana and Ethereum supporters continues to heat up, with the Solana community celebrating the network overtaking Ethereum by daily revenue for the first time.On May 12, Solana’s total economic value — transaction fees combined with Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) — surpassed that of Ethereum for the first time, according to data from Blockworks Research.The chart, which received widespread circulation on social media, shows Solana hosting nearly $2.25 million in 24-hour revenue — beating out Ethereum’s $1.98 million by nearly 13%.The milestone was celebrated across the Solana community, with supporters heralding it as signaling Solana will soon enjoy a flippening over Ethereum.“For the first time ever, Solana has recently eclipsed Ethereum in daily economic value,” said Joe McCann, the founder of Asymmetric, a cryptocurrency investment firm. “Friendly reminder that SOL is currently 1/5th the value of ETH.”“[Solana] is still 100x cheaper to transact on for users,” tweeted Ansem, a popular trader and influencer. “Explain to me in detail why ETH is still worth 5x more by market cap.”But not everyone was convinced, with Ethereum’s bustling Layer 2 ecosystem notably absent from Blockworks’ data.“It's crucial to remember this comparison only includes the Ethereum mainchain, not accounting for ETH's value as a payment method and fuel for transactions for various Layer 2 networks,” retorted Leon Waidmann, an analyst at BTC-Echo. “This makes the comparison flawed… people underestimate how positive the adoption of L2s is for the monetary premium of Ethereum.”Solana fees skyrocketSolana’s recently rocketing fees were also conveniently ignored among celebrations of the network’s revenue milestone.One of Solana’s core value propositions is its high throughput, with the network consistently hosting between 2,000 and 3,000 transactions per second (TPS) in recent days.However, recent network congestion has resulted in a volume of transactions failing to execute, with data from Dune Analytics indicating more than 60% of Solana transactions have failed over the past month. The number of successful Solana transactions also dropped more than 50% since the start of November.To combat the congestion, Solana users have been forced to pay increasingly high fees to ensure their transactions execute. Average Solana transaction fees broke into new all-time highs above $0.018 in March and posted an all-time high of $0.06 on March 18.Average Solana transaction fees. Source: Dune Analytics.Although Solana fees have since fallen to $0.0136, Solana users are still paying significantly higher sums to transact compared to leading Ethereum Layer 2s following the Dencun upgrade in March. According to data from GrowThePie, average transaction fees on Arbitrum, Optimism, and Linea currently sit at $0.005, $0.006, and $0.012 respectively.Data from The Block also shows that more than 75% of Solana’s transaction revenue was attributed to non-vote priority fees from February through May.Non-vote priority fees are additional fees users pay to prioritize their transactions over others in a congested network, excluding votes for network validators. These fees help ensure that their transactions are processed faster even during heavy network traffic.Ethereum's continued dominanceDespite the buzz surrounding Solana’s revenue milestone, Ethereum continues to lead web3 by many key metrics.Ethereum continues to beat out Solana by decentralized exchange volume, enjoying a daily lead of 33% and weekly primacy of 26%, according to DeFi Llama.Further, analysis from Messari shows Ethereum boasting a 300% lead according to its “real volume” metric — which seeks to filter out wash-trading when measuring the value of on-chain activity. As of May 13, Solana's real volume is $6.77 billion, significantly lagging behind Ethereum's $24.8 billion.Ethereum’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) is also $53.6 billion, sizably overshadowing Solana’s $4.5 billion. Ether also boasts a market cap of $354.8 billion compared to $111.3 billion for SOL.

Charles Hoskinson Spotlights Important Cardano Update: Details

Charles Hoskinson, founder of the blockchain platform Cardano, has focused the community’s attention on an important update: the Ouroboros Genesis design. Hoskinson created excitement about the update with an interesting Gif that seems to portray users’ impatience to welcome Genesis.Genesis's evolution over timeOuroboros Genesis builds upon the foundation laid by previous iterations of the Ouroboros protocol. It introduces enhancements aimed at protecting network nodes, particularly those that are new or returning after an absence. The goal is to strengthen Cardano's resilience and scalability.All blockchains have a consensus protocol, which ensures the consistency and immutability of the distributed ledger across network nodes. Ouroboros Classic served as the initial proof-of-stake protocol, followed by Ouroboros BFT, then Ouroboros Praos.Now, Ouroboros Genesis represents the next phase in this evolution, addressing key challenges faced by network nodes, particularly during the initial synchronization process or after prolonged periods of absence.Key features of Ouroboros GenesisThe Ouroboros Genesis update introduces several new concepts and mechanisms to enhance the security and reliability of the Cardano blockchain. Some of these include Ledger Peers, Lightweight Checkpointing, Limit on Eagerness (LoE), Genesis Density Disconnection (GDD), Limit on Patience (LoP) and Genesis State Machine.The Ledger Peers are crucial in preventing eclipses, a potential threat to syncing nodes. The function is to reduce the probability of selecting malicious nodes, thereby enhancing network security. Lightweight Checkpointing activates when there is a severe network outage.Limit on Eagerness ensures that nodes only select blocks that all ledger peers agree on. This prevents syncing nodes from committing to malicious blocks. A Genesis node employs GDD to disconnect from peers serving alternative chains to maintain network integrity and prevent nodes from committing to adversarial chains.Cardano is long known as a major development hub. The Ouroboros update is one of the many recent attempts the protocol is exploring to outrank Ethereum and other competing blockchains.

Tornado Cash developer challenges conviction in Dutch court

Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev has reportedly filed an appeal with the Dutch s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal following his recent conviction on money laundering charges.The appeal follows Pertsev’s May 14 sentencing to a 64-month prison term by a Dutch court. The court found him guilty of laundering approximately $1.2 billion through the Tornado Cash crypto mixer between July 2019 and August 2022.Pertsev’s appeal was filed within the 14-day window mandated by the court for challenging its ruling. However, approval and scheduling for the appeal hearing may entail a considerable period, potentially stretching into months. Pending the commencement of the appeal proceedings, Pertsev remains free on bail.Pertsev’s conviction had attracted steep criticism from crypto stakeholders who viewed it as an affront to privacy, crypto, and open-source technology. Joel Valenzuela, a business development officer for Dash, said:“Tornado Cash is a smart contract on Ethereum which provides much-needed privacy to users. After it was deployed, anyone could interact with it, and no one could prevent anyone from using it. Because a certain amount of known hacked or sanctioned funds used the protocol, its founders came under threat.”Meanwhile, the ramifications of his sentencing could reverberate in the ongoing trials of the protocol’s co-founder in the United States. In August 2023, the Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm on money laundering charges and violations of sanction laws.Tornado Cash is still in useDespite the protocol founder’s ongoing legal troubles, the crypto community still uses Tornado Cash. The host of the Proof of Decentralization Podcast Chris Blec said:“Alex Pertsev received a 5 year prison sentence but Tornado Cash is still operating and being used on Ethereum and there’s not much the government can do about that.”Furthermore, a recent United Nations report also noted that the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group was also using the platform for its illegal activities. According to the report, the hacker group laundered $147.5 million through the crypto mixer in March 2024.Mentioned in this articleLatest Netherlands StoriesLatest Alpha Market Report

Billionaire Friedland Slams Bitcoin's Energy Use


During his appearance at the Qatar Economic Forum, American-Canadian financier Robert Friedland slammed Bitcoin mining as an "energy obscenity.""Huge amounts of energy being sort of used up for nothing," Friedland said.According to the most recent data, Bitcoin consumes more energy than the entire state of Utah (or roughly 2% of U.S. electricity consumption).   "A lot of people get the idea that the internet is green. There is nothing whatsoever green about the internet," he said. "When you do a Google search…you are using a quantum of electrical energy about the same as running a 100-watt light bulb for 10 seconds. When you do an AI search, you are using up to 30, 35 times more energy or enough to run that lightbulb for two or three or four or five or ten minutes."The billionaire has predicted that energy demand will go "to infinity" due to the growing popularity of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will have to compete with cryptocurrency mining for power. This is the sentiment shared by some industry leaders, including Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel. Some miners have even pivoted to AI in order to diversify their business models.  Friedland also took a shot at the gold mining industry for wasting too much electricity. "I think most of the world's gold mines could close today and humanity wouldn't be materially worse off," he said.

Crypto Experts Pile Into New Solana Project - Next 100x Meme Coin?

Sealana is one of Solana's most popular presales.
                        Is this the next 100x meme coin? Some would say so. In just under three weeks, Solana’s all-American hillbilly $SEAL has attracted over $1.2 million catching the attention of investors worldwide.That’s because, hilarious as he is, Sealana is at the forefront of a new wave of meme coins that are helpingSolana challenges Ethereum’s dominance as the go-to blockchain for viral meme coins.Sealana comes waddling in behind wildly successful predecessors DogWifHat ($WIF), Bonk ($BONK), Book of Meme ($BOME) and Popcat ($POPCAT), all of which shot up to become top ten meme coins by market capitalization.He’s also preceded by another recent viral Solana meme coin ICO – Slothana ($SLOTH). Sealana’s 420-friendly chain-mate raised an eye-watering $15 million in a recent one-month presale.Now it looks like $SEAL is Solana’s next viral lazy guy meme coin, but little is known about the project. There are hints that the team behind it may have previously launched the infamous and wildly successful Slerf ($SLERF) meme coin.Crypto’s original sloth-themed meme coin, Slerf, launched back in March but the presale went south when the team accidentally burned some $10 million in tokens allocated for ICO investors. The team then watched Slothana outraise Slerf and then returned with their new offering, Sealana.Although his original home was Solana, $SEAL is technically multichain and anyone with SOL, ETH or BNB in their wallets can purchase it now at a fixed presale price of $0.022.But who exactly is Sealana?Solana’s chunkiest bedroom patriot is Making Meme Coins Great Again.Doesn’t Sealana Remind You of Someone?
Look familiar? Perhaps you recognise the cross-eyed, screen-locked gaze but maybe you don’t connect the dots. Sealana’s main source of inspiration is South Park’s Gamer Guy, aka Fat Computer Nerd, who was immortalised as a viral meme legend by the internet.Gamer Guy first appeared in the hit cartoon’s side-splitting World of Warcraft episode and in meme form has come to symbolize anyone with unhealthy screen time, from the legions of disgruntled keyboard warriors writing sharp, acerbic opinions in internet comments sections, to the lazy guy in everyone.Beached at his desk and ballooning by the day, when he’s not making degen Solana trades, Sealana’s roving flippers fumble across his desk for sustenance of chips and tinned tuna.Why does the hungry $SEAL love Solana so much? Because crypto’s second-most commercially important blockchain is currently the best Layer 1 blockchain to launch high-volume meme coins.The market is hungry for more and Sealana feels a tingling in his blubber. Solana could flip BNB to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a positive boon for all its affiliated projects.Solana currently hosts a digital economy storing over $4.496 billion in total value locked (TVL) across various apps and financial services, with 1.16 million active users transacting daily and over 2,500 monthly active developers.There are also some potentially market moving events ahead that could add billions to the Solana network across all its projects.The Halving and ETF Effects on Solana
Recent disappointing crypto prices after some early-year rallies reflect a market that is briefly consolidating before the economic effects of a Bitcoin software update known as “the halving” kicks in.If analysts are right, then $SEAL and other Solana meme coins could attract some feverish speculation in the coming year.That’s because the halving slashed mining rewards from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125, effectively halving the issuance of new BTC.Now, with Bitcoin setting new all-time highs this year after the US approval of spot Bitcoin investment products back in January, many analysts say crypto is set to become much more valuable, thanks to the bottlenecked new supply colliding with increased demand.The past three halvings have added significant value to the market well within a year of the update.More market-wide bull runs will prompt further meme coin gold rushes in the near future. This time, Solana tokens will be leading the rallies, ahead of their ERC-20 counterparts.The potential US approval of Ethereum ETFs on Thursday next week could also be a boon for Solana meme coins like $SEAL.Builders on Solana often boast their network is the number one “Ethereum-killer” and so its tokens often react bullishly to positive Ethereum news.Follow the latest developments on Sealana’s X account.Buy Solana’s laziest $SEAL at the official website here.

Altcoin Season On The Horizon? Analyst Predicts Ethereum Breakout That Will Kickstart The Rally | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Javon Marks recently suggested that the Altcoin season might be imminent, and Ethereum might be the cause. As part of his analysis, the analyst predicted that Ethereum would likely kickstart the rally these crypto tokens are expected to record once the Altcoin season begins. 
Altcoins To Follow Ethereum’s Move
Marks remarked in an X (formerly Twitter) post that a new all-time high (ATH) for Ethereum could be of “major service in many Altcoin progressions.” The analyst made this statement while highlighting a bull flag that had formed on Ethereum’s chart. He claimed that a breakout from that flag could spark a massive rally for Ethereum, which would, in turn, positively affect other Altcoins. 

Ethereum periodically outperforms the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, which inspires other crypto tokens to make significant rallies instead of mirroring Bitcoin’s price action. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe indicated that the news around the Spot Ethereum ETF will likely trigger this move for Ethereum and other altcoins. 
He also revealed that Bitcoin’s dominance has peaked, meaning that the flagship crypto might cool off while these altcoins enjoy an upward trend. Van de Poppe had previously predicted that the narrative would shift to Ethereum and that he expects altcoins to bounce in their Bitcoin pairs post-halving. 
In a more recent X post, the crypto analyst also suggested that a significant rally is on the horizon for Ethereum. According to him, the second-largest crypto token by market cap is currently at the end stage of the correction. “The good times are there in a few weeks time,” he added. 
These “good times” are also on the way for other altcoins, as Van de Poppe revealed that he is currently seeing a period of consolidation on the Altcoin market cap charts, which is what comes before the “next big push upwards.”
Altcoin Season Might Still Take A While 
Crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggested it might still take a while before the market witnesses Altcoin season. In an X post, he stated that “the window for Altcoin bottoming has just begun,” meaning that these crypto tokens are still likely to drop lower before they experience a trend reversal and make parabolic moves to the upside. 
Source: X
In another X post, the analyst again reaffirmed this sentiment, stating there is “still time left before the Q2 Altcoin Hype Cycle takes off. However, he noted that altcoins are already getting primed for this move, claiming that the “very foundations of the next wave of Altcoin rallies are being built as we speak.”

Rekt Capital assured that this period of consolidation from altcoins was necessary before they could experience any significant price surge. “Market-wide breakouts can’t occur without the market first experiencing slow consolidation periods,” he claimed. 
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,000, up over 3% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin's affair with Coinbase - Over $1 billion in BTC moved and more... - AMBCrypto



There have been seven batches of outflows of over 15,000 BTC from Coinbase since February
BTC also recorded its highest netflows since December 2023

A recent analysis has identified a consistent pattern of Bitcoin outflows from a specific exchange. These outflows have been observed over several months. This pattern contributed to Bitcoin noting record netflows, with the same coinciding with the king coin climbing to $66,000 on the price charts. 
Bitcoin ‘sexchange outflow pattern
Recent data from CryptoQuant revealed significant outflows of 16,021 Bitcoin from Coinbase on 15 May. While such an outflow might not immediately raise concerns, further analysis uncovered a pattern that has been consistent since February. Over this period, seven outflows have exceeded 15,000 BTC, establishing a noticeable pattern on the exchange. 
The latest outflow episode was valued at over $1 billion, considering BTC’s press time price above $66,000 on 16 May. And, the same transpired in the middle of a notable hike in overall volumes. 
Bitcoin sees record netflows
An analysis of Bitcoin’s outflow chart from CryptoQuant revealed a significant surge in outflows on 15 May, marking its highest level in weeks. The outflow volume was over 55,217 BTC, equivalent to over $3.6 billion. This outflow level had not been observed since 28 March, coinciding with a period when Bitcoin’s price reached around $70,000.
Furthermore, BTC registered its highest netflow in months on 15 May, as indicated by the exchange netflow chart. The netflow recorded a volume of over -23,359 BTC, indicating that substantial outflows exceeded inflows across all exchanges. 
This negative netflow level was yet to be seen since December 2023. At press time, outflows continued to dominate exchange flows, suggesting the ongoing movement of BTC away from exchanges.

BTC re-enters the $66,000 price range
Bitcoin’s price surged by 7.65% on 15 May, propelling it to $66,244, at press time. This marked a return to the price range unseen since its decline below this level around 12 April.

Additionally, this recent price movement has pushed Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) above the neutral zone. 
In fact, an analysis of the RSI indicated that it was trending above 50 after several weeks below this threshold. This shift in the RSI can be interpreted to be a positive sign for Bitcoin’s bulls.

U.S. Senate Votes to Kill SEC's Crypto Accounting Policy, Testing Biden's Veto Threat

The U.S. Senate joined the House of Representatives on Thursday in seeking to erase the controversial Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crypto policy known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, though President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the resolution.

The Senate voted 60-38 on the effort to overturn the policy, commonly referred to as SAB 121, though the crypto industry may not breathe a sigh of relief over the initiative's banking constraints, because Biden said that letting the rule be removed this way would disrupt "work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system."

The Senate overturned SEC's SAB121 in an overwhelming vote Thursday.
                        The U.S. Senate voted to formally issue a disapproval of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) controversial staff accounting bulletin SAB121 on Monday afternoon following long standing scrutiny of the federal agency’s guidelines.Thursday’s vote garnered significant bipartisan support, with Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer (NY), Cory Booker (NJ), and Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) voting in favor of the effective “reversal.”Launched in April 2022, the SEC claims SAB121 is meant to safeguard digital asset use, though crypto-friendly lawmakers have pushed back against the federal agency’s rhetoric.Critics argue that capital requirements on financial institutions brought forward by SAB121 go too far, with banks required to list clients’ custodied assets with liabilities on their balance sheet.Lawmakers have further condemned the commission’s failure to follow procedural rules in SAB121’s creation as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently found that the SEC did not report the rule change under the Congressional Review Act (CRA).The vote comes just a little over a week after the House voted on a companion bill brought forth by  Representatives Mike Flood (R-NE) and Wiley Nickel (D-NC).Editorial note: This story is currently being added to.

Options Earthquake in Bitcoin: What to Expect in BTC Price in the Short Term and Long Term? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Despite the recent decline in the US CPI inflation report, investors are still willing to pay a premium for short-term downside protection, according to a new analysis of Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures options by CF Benchmarks.
CF Benchmarks analysts noted that although Bitcoin broke above $66,000 following yesterday's softer inflation data, there was “higher implied volatility for out-of-the-money (OTM) put options compared to call options.”


This willingness of derivatives traders to pay high premiums for OTM put options is considered a bearish trend among short-term market indicators, according to analysts. The increased implied volatility (IV) for OTM put contracts suggests that traders are essentially hedged against a potential decline in BTC value.
Implied volatility is a measure used in the options market that represents the market's estimate of the likely future movement or price fluctuations of an asset or security.






However, the short-term outlook contradicts analysts' observations about long-term prospects. They noted a “flatter” volatility curve between long-term puts and calls, with a slight bias towards calls. “This suggests that investors are more optimistic about Bitcoin's long-term prospects, and it is worth watching to see whether the buying trend will increase if disinflation expectations begin to accelerate after the positive CPI report,” the analysts said in an email.
The CF Benchmark analysis also said longer-dated puts and calls are relatively flat, which could indicate increased institutional participation “as these investors are less prone to extreme swings in sentiment.”

Bitcoin Price Pumps Higher as Morgan Stanley Reveals Significant Holdings in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs – Here's the Latest / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Bitcoin (BTC) price has been pumping higher this week in wake of US CPI data that pointed at moderating price pressures, and as major financial institutions including Morgan Stanley reveal significant holdings in US spot Bitcoin ETFs.Bitcoin was last changing hands just below $66,000, having hit new monthly highs above $66,750 earlier in the day.Morgan Stanley revealed significant holdings of $270 million worth of spot Bitcoin ETFs in a Wednesday 13F filing.The US investment banking and asset management giant had signaled back in February that it intended to gain BTC exposure.The bank is also paving the way to begin recommending spot Bitcoin ETFs to its clients.Morgan Stanley’s BTC holdings reveal comes at a time when droves of other institutional investors are also revealing holdings.As of Thursday, Q1 13F filings show that over 500 asset managers have exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs.Millennium Management is the largest known holder at present with nearly $2 billion in holdings. That’s roughly 3% of the hedge funds’ $64 billion in AUM.As per Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, Millenium is the current “king” of ETF holders.Balchunas notes that the new spot Bitcoin ETFs have about 200x the average number of holders for a new ETF.It’s “impressive just how many different institution types represented in first 13Fs”, he continued.These holders included a state pension fund – the State of Wisconsin Investment Board revealed it now holds almost $100 million in spot BTC ETFs.Can the Bitcoin Price Retest Yearly Highs?
Bitcoin bulls are hoping that renewed optimism about Bitcoin’s institutional adoption via ETFs plus macro headwinds can lift it back above $70,000 soon.Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of over $300 million on Wednesday after positive US CPI numbers, as per The Block.Indeed, Wednesday’s push higher helped Bitcoin move back above its 21 and 50DMAs and to fresh monthly highs.To continue higher, the Bitcoin price needs to break above its late April highs above $67,000.To continue higher, the Bitcoin price needs to break above its late April highs above $67,000. Source: TradingViewThat could open the door to a pushback above $70,000 and a potential retest of yearly highs.US equities could be a lead indicator for Bitcoin here. The S&P 500 is currently carving out new record highs above 5,300, having retraced.US equities could be a lead indicator for the Bitcoin price. Source: TradingViewBitcoin could soon be carving out its own fresh record highs above $74,000.Of course, nothing is guaranteed heading into the summer and with only one month gone since the halving.Summers tend to be a choppy/bearish time for risk assets like stocks and Bitcoin. Some have noted this rule tends not to apply in election years, however.Meanwhile, post-halving rallies don’t typically get going for 4-6 months after the halving, not after one month.So a surge to new record highs in the next few weeks could be a bit “premature”.That said, this Bitcoin bull run is breaking historical patterns/norms.ETF optimism already powered the Bitcoin price to new record highs before the halving. New record highs have historically come after the halving.Bitcoin is maturing into a fully-fledged macro asset, which doesn’t tend to have highly obvious/predictable long-term patterns, such as Bitcoin’s three-year pump/one-year dump patterns that has been more or less in place over the past 12 or so years.

                        Over the last seven days, popular ERC-20 meme coin Floki ($FLOKI) outpaced crypto’s favorite doggy meme coins and rallied a blistering 23.7% to trade at $0.0002138.Floki’s rally comes as a sea of green candles across most leading cryptocurrencies makes for an emerald market.Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) is the usual pacesetter, and in the last seven days, it appreciated by 8.4% to trade at $66,293 as of this writing.The token underpinning DeFi’s busiest blockchain, Ethereum ($ETH), barely grew in price at all. It’s still trading at around $3,000 as it did this time last Thursday.That means Floki outpaced both the market leaders and the three biggest canine meme coins this week. In comparison, Dogecoin ($DOGE) only grew 6.5%, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) added 11.7%, DogWifHat ($WIF) grew 4.5% and Bonk ($BONK) climbed 9%.Floki is also one of the few leading cryptocurrencies that depreciated in the last 24 hours. It’s now down 2.9% from yesterday. The only other popular meme coin that fell overnight is Pepe Coin ($PEPE). The viral frog meme coin shed 5.7% overnight but led meme coin gains over the last seven days with a meaty rally of 29%.Over on FLOKI’s trading chart we can see the token has come down from a mid-March peak to lows of almost $0.0001, although its support level has since been climbing higher.Since coming down from $0.00022 in mid-April, the token has found stiff resistance at $0.0002, but today’s price represents a potential breakout.Source: TradingViewRelative strength index (RSI) signals are promising. The token’s RSI is 53 and falling which indicates strong short-term stability.WienerAI ($WAI) Makes Floki Look Dated, Raises $1.9 Million in Meme Coin ICO.
Floki is a meme coin named after Elon Musk’s dog. It’s also one of not two, not three, but five meme coins based on viral shiba inus, all of which are top ten meme coins.Before FLOKI, there was Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, after it there was Bonk and DogWifHat, with little to differentiate each from the other except novelty, tech specs, and/or blockchains.However, for those who believe in crypto’s longevity, a new generation of meme coins is cropping up which brings bundles of utility along with the laughs.Leading this new generation of coins is WienerAI.$WAI is a brand new meme token and AI companion that may yield potentially eye-watering rallies once word gets out about its core offering.The presale is only a month old, and it has already attracted close $1.9 million in investments.Touted as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner”, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.The WienerAI smart contract was audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms.Around 20% of $WAI’s supply is for staking.WienerAI’s website offers buyers the ability to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 508% APY.Stay on top of WienerAI news over on X and Telegram.Join the presale now over on the WienerAI website.

Before You Trust Another Crypto Guru, Read This Study's Results - Benzinga

A fresh study has provided a detailed analysis of the influence of crypto influencers on Twitter, with findings that carry significant implications for investors.The study by scholars from Indiana University, Harvard Business School, and Texas A&M University meticulously examined approximately 36,000 tweets from 180 prominent crypto-influencers over two years, shedding light on how these social media figures impact cryptocurrency prices.The study reveals that tweets from crypto-influencers are initially associated with positive returns. “The mean one-day return for crypto-influencer tweets is 1.83%,” the paper states, adding that “the return rate for small-cap tokens after one day is a notable 3.86%.” This initial surge in price highlights the significant short-term impact these influencers can have on the market.However, the research also points to a sobering reality for investors looking for long-term gains. “These tweets are followed by significant negative longer-horizon returns,” the authors report. Specifically, the study found that the average cumulative returns after 10 days were -2.24%, and this trend worsened over time, reaching -6.53% after 30 days.Also Read: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Pocket $303M Net Inflows On Wednesday: ‘Stars Seem To Be Aligning On This Breakout,’ Analytics Firm WritesWhy It Matters: The paper emphasizes, “Our results indicate that crypto-influencers’ tweets generate minimal long-term investment value.”The scholars highlight that these effects are particularly pronounced for influencers who proclaim themselves as “crypto experts” and have a substantial follower base.The study underscores the potential for conflicts of interest, with influencers possibly promoting cryptocurrencies for personal gain. “Our evidence supports ongoing regulatory concerns regarding investors being misled by social media influencers,” the authors caution.In their analysis, the researchers utilized machine-learning methods to classify tweets and found that the pattern of results was stronger when the tweets had a more positive sentiment or were retweeted extensively. This reinforces the idea that the influence of social media on cryptocurrency markets is both powerful and complex. However, the study did not look at individual cryptocurrencies. Particularly meme coins, such as Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD and their copycats are What’s Next: The findings of this study are especially relevant as the industry looks forward to Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on November 19.This event will provide a platform to discuss the evolving landscape of digital assets, the role of social media influencers, and the regulatory challenges that come with it.

ShibaSwap 2.0 on Shibarium Boosts SHIB and Burn Rate


Shiba Inu’s native decentralized exchange (DEX) platform, ShibaSwap, has officially launched on Shibarium. 
The DEX will be available on both Ethereum and Shibarium, the project’s Layer-2 scaling solution focused on fast and cheap transactions.
ShibaSwap on Shibarium: Uncovering New Functionalities

ShibaSwap’s migration to Shibarium brings several new features. Users now can create new liquidity pools, swap tokens on the network, and earn fees for providing liquidity. Other notable changes include discovery charts for new and trending tokens, and onboarding of new assets into the ShibaSwap.
The SHIB team asserts that the new strategy will enhance the value of LP tokens, benefiting the entire yield farming community. Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, encouraged users to try out the new swap and seamlessly port existing Shibarium tokens over to it. 
Kusama described ShibaSwap 2.0 as “redesigned beating heart of a freshly forked Shibarium,” highlighting its role in enabling community tokens to flourish.

“Rest assured, this new user experience is still an early version of Shibaswap, with more updates on the way,” he added.

With ShibaSwap on Shibarium, transactions will increase on the Layer-2 network. This heightened activity will accelerate the token burn rate, reducing the circulating supply of SHIB and potentially increasing its price. The protocol has explored various methods to boost the burn rate, and ShibaSwap’s integration might significantly impact this aspect.

How and when to sell your crypto - a simple guide

Missing out on a crypto bull market is tough, but what’s worse is watching your crypto wealth skyrocket only to crash before you can take profits.In the latest Cointelegraph video, we explain how to build your crypto exit strategy in a few simple steps.Taking profit means turning your digital gains into real money. There are two main ways to cash out in crypto: convert your assets into stablecoins and transfer them to your crypto wallet, or sell your crypto for fiat and transfer the money to your bank account.Deciding when to sell, which crypto to sell, and how much to sell depends on your financial situation, life stage, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Avoid trying to time the market perfectly. Instead, set clear price targets for selling your crypto and determine the percentage to sell at each target. For example, if you invested $25,000 in a particular coin, you might sell 20% when your portfolio reaches $50,000, 30% when it reaches $75,000, and so on.A popular strategy is the “house money” approach: when your investment significantly increases, cash out your initial investment and let the profits ride. This minimizes emotional stress, as you've already secured your initial funds.Remember, transaction fees and taxes can impact your net gains, so account for these costs. Ultimately, while holding crypto is beneficial, the goal is to use the profits to improve your life. Developing a disciplined exit strategy is key to achieving this balance.To find out more about how to best take profit out of crypto, check out the full video on our YouTube channel and don’t forget to subscribe! VIDEO

M2 money supply ‘holds the key’ for Bitcoin’s next move - Market analyst

The growing money supply in the United States could be the key to unlocking more upward momentum for Bitcoin (BTC), according to market analysts and historical chart patterns.M2 money supply growth could catalyze the next bull runThe M2 money supply estimates all cash and short-term bank deposits across the United States, and its growth has historically been correlated with previous Bitcoin bull runs.The growth of the money supply could hold the key for the next leg up for the Bitcoin cycle, according to Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Realvision, who wrote in a May 16 X post:“This is due to a high correlation with $BTC bull cycles. Of the big 3 I track in my Bitcoin/Liquidity framework, Global M2 appears to capture the most of the moves.”However, the changes in the money supply seem more important for Bitcoin price than the nominal value, according to Coutts:“The rate of change in money supply is more important than the nominal value.

Why CZ, Former Binance CEO Sentenced to Four Months in Prison, Still Hasn't Been Jailed? Here's Why and What Will Happen - Bitcoin Sistemi


Although Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison, he is not yet in prison due to formalities in the criminal justice system, a world-class team of lawyers, and the right to a fair trial protections in the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution.
According to the judge's signed decision, Zhao “was to surrender to serve his sentence as notified by the Probation and Pretrial Services Office.” However, these offices have not yet notified Zhao that he must report to prison in California.


According to Federal Law 18, a criminal's sentence begins when that person is 'detained or voluntarily surrendered while awaiting transfer to an official detention facility where the sentence will be carried out.' Although this sentence can begin immediately on the day of sentencing, there are three possibilities for delay.
A judge may first force the defendant to surrender to the U.S. Marshals Department, which may then escort the defendant or physically notify him when to report to prison.






The judge may authorize the Office of Probation and Pretrial Services to notify the defendant of the prison entry date.
The judge may allow the defendant to go to prison voluntarily. Judges generally reserve this option for defendants who receive the shortest sentences or are least likely to escape.


Zhao made the second type of decision. Authorities did not immediately detain Zhao because he was not sentenced to a multi-year prison sentence. Instead, the judge gave Zhao the second-most lenient method. He is awaiting notification by the Office of Parole or Pretrial Services.

Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Competitor To Rip Higher, Predicts Outlook on Dogecoin and One More ETH Rival - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst predicts one Ethereum (ETH) competitor is about to have a massive breakout against Bitcoin (BTC).
Pseudonymous trader Kaleo tells his 638,000 followers on the social media platform X that the smart contract platform Avalanche (AVAX) could soar against BTC by more than 84% from its current value.










“AVAX/BTC: I might be crazy bros, but I still believe AVAX rips higher from here.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests that AVAX/BTC is printing a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart and could soon reach 0.000950 BTC ($62.13).
AVAX/BTC is trading for .000515 BTC ($33.89) at time of writing, down more than 3% in the last 24 hours.
Next, the analyst predicts ETH competitor Solana is about to soar against Bitcoin (SOL/BTC) after printing a bullish pattern on the daily chart of higher high prices and higher low prices.
He believes SOL/BTC could soon cross the 0.0032 BTC ($209) level.
 “SOL/BTC: Solana is still one of the biggest no brainer long plays out there. Don’t fight strength.”
Source: Kaleo/X
SOL/BTC is trading for 0.00243 BTC ($160) at time of writing, up more than 3% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the analyst predicts that Dogecoin (DOGE) will breakout based on a 2021 pattern when the memecoin rallied after the soaring meme stock GameStop (GME) hit a market top. GME had a massive rally this week but has since retraced.
“I’m going to make this simple for you. Here’s a chart of Dogecoin versus GME. You may not remember this, but it was GameStop that led the way back in early 2021. It wasn’t until after it topped that DOGE started sending. Dogecoin is overdue for a good pump. It’s almost time.”

DOGE is trading for $0.15 at time of writing, up slightly in the last 24 hours.

US Senate votes to overturn SEC rule, allowing regulated firms to hold Bitcoin - CoinJournal



                    

                    
60-38 in the Senate voted in favour of overturning the SEC rule.
Bipartisan support signals a potential shift in crypto regulation.
Presidential veto possible.

In a landmark decision, the US Senate has voted to overturn a key Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule that barred regulated financial firms from holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The legislation, known as H.J. Res. 109, previously passed in the US House with bipartisan support and the Senate’s support signals a potential shift in the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States.
Bipartisan support for H.J. Res. 109 reversal
The decision to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121 garnered significant bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.
The rule, which had been in effect for two years, prohibited regulated financial institutions from holding cryptocurrencies.
However, lawmakers have moved to invalidate this restrictive regulation with a vote of 60-38 in the Senate and a 228–182 vote in the House.
Supporters of the legislation argue that allowing regulated firms to hold cryptocurrencies will provide consumers with more options and opportunities in the rapidly evolving digital asset market. They contend that regulated institutions are well-equipped to handle the risks associated with cryptocurrency custody, given their existing compliance frameworks and security protocols.
Potential presidential veto
After the overwhelming support for overturning the SEC rule in Congress, the legislation now faces its final test on the desk of US President Joe Biden.
While the White House has indicated that the measure may be vetoed, citing concerns about disrupting the SEC’s work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets, proponents remain hopeful that Biden will recognize the importance of allowing regulated firms to engage in cryptocurrency custody.
Critics of the SEC’s rule argue that it stifles innovation and hampers the ability of financial institutions to meet the growing demand for cryptocurrency services. They point to the recent approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) by the SEC as evidence of the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and the need for regulatory flexibility in this rapidly evolving space.
Senate decision met with enthusiasm
The decision to overturn the SEC rule has been met with enthusiasm by industry stakeholders, who see it as a positive step towards greater institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Many believe that allowing regulated financial firms to hold cryptocurrencies will help to legitimize the asset class and attract more institutional investors.
However, some industry experts caution that regulatory clarity is still needed to ensure the long-term stability and growth of the cryptocurrency market. They emphasize the importance of striking a balance between innovation and investor protection to foster a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for digital assets.

Bitcoin to $66,000 - Is this why CME Group is planning to launch BTC trading? - AMBCrypto



CME’s Bitcoin trading plan signals Wall Street’s acceptance of crypto
Surge in institutional investments highlights Bitcoin’s mainstream growth

It has been a good day for Bitcoin [BTC] after the cryptocurrency climbed as high as $66,333 on the charts after weeks of trading between $58k and $63k. In fact, at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency was up by 5.78% in the last 24 hours alone.
That’s not all as according to TradingView, Bitcoin currently accounts for approximately 56% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.
Source: TradingView
CME Group turns to Bitcoin 
In response to the hike in Bitcoin’s dominance, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, the world’s largest Futures exchange, may soon reveal its plans to launch Bitcoin trading.
This move will be part of the firm’s strategy to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency sector and capitalize on the increasing demand from Wall Street money managers in 2024.
This is a welcome development for many in the crypto-space, with Alessandro Ottaviani, Co-Host @StoreofBitcoin, claiming,
“The ‘bending the knee to Bitcoin’ process is continuing.”
How can CME benefit from this move? 
Though the plans are still uncertain, CME Group’s initiative to introduce spot Bitcoin trading marks a pivotal step for Wall Street’s involvement in the cryptocurrency space. Coupled with the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs, it all signals growing regulatory acceptance.
Interestingly, with this move, CME could streamline basis trades by integrating spot Bitcoin trading with its established Bitcoin Futures market. This strategic move would enhance trading efficiency and reinforce the CME’s position in the cryptocurrency market.
This update comes within days of Michael Saylor, former CEO of MicroStrategy, commenting,
“There are thousands of pension funds in the United States managing ~$27 trillion in assets. They are all going to need some #Bitcoin.”
It also underlines Bitcoin’s evolving role from a niche digital asset to a mainstream financial instrument with significant institutional and regulatory support.
Not everyone is happy!
That being said, there are others who feel otherwise too. According to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, for instance,
“Crypto exchanges might lose some business with the potential debut of a bitcoin spot market on the CME, a global derivatives giant, as the present bull run is particularly driven by institutions, who prefer to trade on regulated avenues.”
If this were true, however, then major hedge funds like Bracebridge Capital and pension funds such as the Wisconsin Investment Board wouldn’t have contributed over $10 billion into investment vehicles managed by firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark.
The future looks bright though 
Hence, despite BTC falling by over 20% from its March peak of over $73,000, Bitcoin ETFs have rapidly become the fastest-growing ETFs in history.
Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, put it best when he said,
“Bitcoin is a great potential, long-term store of value.”

Crypto analyst touts U.S. money supply boost could propel Bitcoin

Analysts are eyeing a less conventional indicator to predict Bitcoin’s trajectory: the M2 money supply, where M2 corresponds to the total number of different currency and commercial paper units in circulation. This metric, the sum of all the marketable US cash and short-term money in circulation, has a trend similar to Bitcoin’s bullish cycles, thus creating doubt about its future role as an influencer in the market.Also read: Bitcoin bullish trendHistorical correlation of US money supply and  Bitcoin’s rallyAs with the markets and considering their historical data, the growth of M2 money supply may be a tool for boosting BTC’s rally. In referring to his recent analysis, Jamie Coutts, a crypto analyst, explains why strength in the US dollar is strongly correlated with weakness in cryptocurrencies. Among the multiple parameters Coutts mentions in his Bitcoin/Liquidity framework, M2 – a measure of the aggregate money supply in circulation globally—is the index globally showing the strongest association with Bitcoin’s bull cycleImportance of money supply rate change to BitcoinThe amount of money required will not be the most crucial point to this change, but the rate at which the amount is set. Coutts underlines that the speed of the M2 volume variations and Bitcoin price interrelations are the most significant factors here rather than absolute quantities.The central banks view a rise in this reading as a positive signal of a potential improvement in conditions. Developments related to the M2 money supply have become so significant that even investors cannot resist paying attention. By the end of May 2033, M2 money stock exhibited a positive increase in annual comparisons for the first time since November 2023. This turnaround hints at a possible channel control change as investors are convinced to invest less in assets like Bitcoin due to inflation.Source:ycharts Dollar dynamics and Bitcoin In addition to the M2 amount, which analysts watch for signs of a market catalyst, they also pay attention to the USD behavior, which is prone to have a big effect on the Bitcoin price dynamics. Also read: US dollar weakensCoutts mentioned that the dollar’s movement determines the direction of Bitcoin’s growth or fall, explaining that the slump below the 101 barrier will strengthen the upward trend. The dollar has traded in a narrow range, sending waves of fear among market players. They are all focused on the charts and looking for levels of support, hoping to either prolong the status quo or begin a corrective trend.Source: Trading View

                        The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to decide on spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On May 16, Billy Markus, co-founder of Dogecoin, voiced his doubts about their approval, saying that the SEC is “compromised” and may not approve the ETFs.Markus made his skeptical comment in response to an X post discussing the importance of the approval of spot Ether ETFs for the ecosystem and the potential impact of a negative decision on Ethereum. He tweeted a response that “nothing good will come out” of the spot ETH ETF application.Spot Ether ETF Approval “Not Important” to Drive Ethereum
Markus’ comment reflects a broader pessimism about the SEC’s ability to make fair and unbiased decisions regarding Ethereum and cryptocurrency.Given this, Markus believes the regulator’s decision on spot Ether ETFs won’t negatively impact Ethereum’s trajectory or the cryptocurrency market as a whole. The Dogecoin creator’s views also echo the prevalent skepticism surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs.Recently, finance lawyer Scott Johnsson suggested that Ethereum’s legal classification will play an important role in the upcoming ETF decisions.Johnsson’s view shows a key distinction in the SEC’s approach to Bitcoin and Ethereum.Ethereum’s classification is receiving more regulatory scrutiny than Bitcoin, where its security status wasn’t a major focus during spot ETF filings. This shows a shift in focus between the two cryptocurrencies, suggesting a changing regulatory process for digital assets.US SEC Previously Acknowledged Ethereum’s Non-Security Status
The upcoming decision dates for VanEck and ARK Invest’s applications for Ethereum ETFs, scheduled for May 23 and May 24, respectively, have sparked intense speculation within the crypto industry.The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs is not just about price movements; it also carries symbolic importance, solidifying crypto’s legitimacy as an asset class and reaffirming its role in the evolving financial industry.The trend toward regulatory clarity is evident, as seen in the SEC’s recognition of Ethereum’s non-security status through the approval of an Ethereum futures ETF for trading in October 2023. Thus, the SEC established a clear precedent for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.Experts believe any deviation from this path would create regulatory uncertainty and weaken market confidence.Hong Kong’s approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, as well as their trading, demonstrate the increasing global acceptance and recognition of the potential of Ethereum-based financial instruments.

Early Shiba Inu Investors Move Funds to New Token, Seeking 987% Profits / Source: Cryptonews
                        As Shiba Inu (SHIB) eyes a potential push higher following a recent bullish pattern breakout and amid positive news for its DeFi ecosystem, early investors are moving funds to a new token called 99Bitcoins (99BTC) as they seek 987% profits.SHIB was last trading down 3.3% on Thursday around $0.00002450, having earlier pushed towards $0.000026.The meme coin, the second largest by market cap after Dogecoin, broke out of a multi-week pennant pattern on Wednesday.Technical analysis suggests risks are tilted towards a retest of late-March highs.As SHIB eyes a possible near-term rally, a new token is attracting attention. Source: TradingViewAnd news that ShibaSwap has finally migrated to Shibarium could help ignite fresh bullish sentiment.Shiba Inu developers launched Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain designed to be the home of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, last year.But so far, it’s largely been a dud, with barely over $2 million in TVL as per DeFi Llama.ShibaSwap, Shiba Inu’s previously Ethereum-based DEX, has been more successful.The DEX routinely logs daily trading volumes in the millions of dollars, CoinGecko data shows.ShibaSwap’s expansion to Shibarium should bring some much-needed liquidity to the struggling blockchain.Not only is that a boost to the Shiba Inu web3 ecosystem, but should also lift the SHIB burn rate.Investors Move Funds to New Token 99Bitcoins (99BTC) – Here’s Why
SHIB could see near-term upside, but a new token in the learn-to-earn (L2E) niche is attracting a lot of hype.Well-established crypto education platform 99Bitcoins is launching a new token that will reward users for learning about crypto.And investors are flooding in to get in on the presale before it sells out.99Bitcoins’ has over 700,000 YouTube subscribers, over 100,000 enrolled students and a huge 2.5 million mailing list.That positions it to immediately become a leader in the L2E space.The new token will initially launch on Ethereum, but eventually, as BRC-20 to pioneer L2E on the Bitcoin blockchain.Investors have already piled nearly $1.3 million into the presale. And potential investors better move quickly, as when $2 million is hit, the 99BTC price will rise.99BTC will power 99Bitcoins’ L2E platform, whilst offering investors a healthy staking yield.As per the official website, this yield was last around 1,333%, though will drop quickly as the presale progresses.99Bitcoins is also running a whopping $99,999 BTC airdrop.Should new token 99BTC become a market leader, presale investors could easily be looking at 10x or 987% gains.

DePIN is a lifeline for Bitcoin miners, says Livepeer CEO - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bitcoin (BTC) miners might turn to the DePIN ecosystem to turn mining facilities profitable after the latest halving cut block rewards to 3.125 BTC, shared Livepeer CEO Doug Petkanics with Crypto Briefing. DePIN is short for decentralized physical infrastructure network, a blockchain industry sector that brings transparency and decentralization to the real world.Petkanics highlights that this movement to DePIN, where the business model is usually providing computing power through GPUs to artificial intelligence-focused companies, is met with good and bad news for Bitcoin miners.“The hardware that they’ve bought and deployed and paid for Bitcoin mining are really specific to Bitcoin. Their ASICs, they can only mine Bitcoin. They can only do that specific cash function. They really can’t be redeployed into other networks. I think that’s the bad news. But that’s not surprising. That’s what they knew their investment was and they knew they were optimizing for.”On the opposite side, the expertise and surrounding infrastructure that the facilities built up around mining crypto are really efficient when it comes to energy usage, bandwidth, and operational management, Petkanics points out. This characteristics can be proven useful when managing aThe expectation after the April 20 halving is that electricity and overall production costs will nearly double, according to a report by asset management firm CoinShares. The report also sheds light on that mining companies like BitDigital, Hive, and Hut 8 are already generating income from artificial intelligence (AI).“All that expertise and resources absolutely can be repurposed into one of the sort of biggest opportunities of this point in time that we’re in right now, due to the just massive amount of computing resources that are going to be required when it comes to this paradigm shift of artificial intelligence models being this new technology that’s changing everything about how people interact with technology.”Fostering developmentAccording to Livepeer CEO, decentralized computing power networks offer benefits in different layers. The first is related to how the GPU market is organized, where tech firms must buy large batches of graphic chips to achieve a cheaper acquisition price.However, these companies usually don’t have immediate usage for all the GPU acquired, and that’s where DePIN shows its potential by letting computing power be lent.“I think that actually fits really neatly into this notion that decentralized networks can let anyone who’s paid for that capacity, but has it sitting idle, make it available to developers that want to use it temporarily via open marketplaces.”Moreover, the necessity to buy large batches of GPU is also a threshold to companies such as data centers and infrastructure providers. This is also another issue that can be solved by DePIN, as these smaller companies can tap into the dormant capacities of these idle graphic chips via an open marketplace, Petkanics underscored.“You don’t have the overhead or the bureaucracy of needing contracts and customer relationships and sales and the stuff that adds a lot of cost on top of just sort of connecting directly to the computing power.”

PEPE Price Cooling Down From Highs: Is a Correction Coming?


PEPE price emerged as one of the most impressive tokens this bull run as the meme coin hit a new all-time high this week.
The meme coin craze, however, will result in profit-taking, which could lead to a considerable drawdown.
PEPE Investors Look to Sell

PEPE price breached the key resistance of $0.00001007, which enabled the meme coin to hit a new all-time high. However, this has also set the meme coin enthusiasts up for selling. This is because the investors are seeing solid gains at the moment.
According to the realized profits, PEPE holders note the highest gains recorded on the network in almost two months. Spikes in this metric are a sign of profit-taking, and this sentiment could extend to other investors as well.

This sentiment can already be observed taking over the investors upon distributing active addresses by profitability. Currently, over 40% of the investors participating on the network are witnessing gains.

This is the most profit-bearing PEPE holders have been active, dominating the active addresses. This translates to selling since these investors are looking to secure their gains.

Consequently, the PEPE price would take a major hit as selling ensues.
PEPE Price Prediction: A Downfall on the Cards?
PEPE price can be seen trading at $0.00001020 after forming the new ATH at $0.00001161. The meme coin is holding above the support at $0.00001007. Falling through this support will likely send PEPE down to $0.00000900.

If profit-taking intensifies, a drop to $0.00000750 is also likely.

However, if the PEPE holders decide not to sell but to HODL for further gains, the meme coin would have a shot at recovery. Bouncing off $0.00001007 would enable the PEPE price to climb to the new ATH again, invalidating the bearish thesis.

                        A bipartisan group of four senators urged Congress to take bold, decisive action to secure American leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector on May 15.The senators’ AI investment plan, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, is pushing for $32 billion in funding over the next three years to develop AI in the country.US Senators’ AI Investment Proposal Integrates Strategic Roadmap
In a 31-page document titled “Driving U.S. Innovation in Artificial Intelligence,” the group of two Democrats and Republican senators outlined a roadmap that would see the US take proactive steps to “harness the opportunities and address the risks” of the rapidly developing technology.The proposed funding would primarily cover non-defense applications of AI, though the senators are also considering a major allocation for defense-related AI projects. Additionally, they proposed funding for cross-government AI research and development, including initiatives for AI-ready data and government AI testing and evaluation infrastructure.“If China is going to invest $50 billion, and we’re going to invest in nothing, they’ll inevitably get ahead of us. So that’s why even these investments are so important,” Schumer stated.Many commentators believe the senator’s AI investment plan could help the country address increasing concerns about China’s advancement in the sector. Washington fears that Beijing could use AI for malicious purposes, such as meddling in the Presidential elections or launching cyberattacks.Additionally, the US lawmakers recommended the creation of a federal data privacy law and expressed support for legislation to prevent the use of “deepfake technology in election campaigns.” They also called for regulatory measures to address issues such as health and financial discrimination, job displacement, and copyright violations caused by AI.Commenting on the latest senator’s AI investment proposal, Amy Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota, expressed support for the recommended framework for AI, particularly in Journalism, where copyright infringement has been an issue.Lawmakers Express Concerns on AI Threat to Election
Meanwhile, US Senators are sounding the alarm about AI’s threat to elections, specifically its potential to deceive voters.To this end, the Senate Rules Committee advanced three bills on May 15 to combat this issue – the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, the AI Transparency in Elections Act, and the Preparing Election Administrators for AI Act.The Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar and co-sponsored by Senator Josh Hawley, would prohibit using AI video or audio related to federal candidates.The AI Transparency in Elections Act would require AI disclosures in political ads, while the Preparing Election Administrators for AI Act would develop guidelines to counter external AI threats, especially from foreign adversaries.Recent incidents underscore the importance of these bills. In February, a robocall impersonating President Joe Biden and a video from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ campaign last June using AI-generated images of former President Donald Trump have exposed the dangers of AI in elections.These incidents highlight the urgent need for measures to protect the integrity of democratic processes from AI-based deception, which the EU has also been working on.Recall that the EU set a precedent by passing the AI Regulation Act in March 2024 and has gone grill Big Tech on AI risks to elections. This is because of the content these firms allow their users to create.

                        JASMY has jumped by 12% today, with the Jasmy Coin price scaling to $0.02051 and outperforming the market as a whole, which is up by 5% in 24 hours.This price also means that JASMY has gained by 14% in a week, 24% in a fortnight and 17% in the past month, with the utility token outperforming other comparable coins over these timeframes.And with Jasmy as a platform continuing to grow steadily and welcome new partnerships and launches, the JASMY price could continue to rise consistently in the coming weeks.Jasmy Coin Price Prediction as JASMY Rockets Up 12% – Are Whales Buying?
JASMY has had a strong couple of days, with its indicators now showing plenty of momentum that could continue until the end of the week.In particular, its 30-day average (orange) jumped over its 200-day (blue) yesterday and is racing ahead, a sign of a breakout.Source: TradingViewJASMY’s relative strength index (purple) is also looking promising, having recovered from lower levels last weekend and hitting 80 yesterday.While it has dipped a little since then, it remains above 60 and could stay high for the next few days, as the coin’s price pushes up some more.It’s also highly encouraging the JASMY’s trading volume has risen to $100 million, which may be low in view of bigger tokens but is actually JASMY’s highest level in a month.The expectation is that JASMY will see continued gains in the near term, while its long-term picture also looks very bullish.This is because it’s the native token of Jasmy, a layer-one blockchain platform that has been gaining traction in recent months.Most famously, it announced a partnership in March with major electronics manufacturer Panasonic, with which it will be developing an Internet-of-Things platform.And with partnerships with other recognized names such as Nippon Travel Agency, such developments are likely to help Jasmy grow in stature and importance within the cryptocurrency sector.JASMY is therefore in line to benefit from its platform’s recent growth, while it will also benefit from the ongoing recovery and growth of the wider cryptocurrency market.It’s possible that the market could see another bull run in the next few months, particularly if the Federal Reserve announces rate cuts.Based on this, the Jasmy Coin price could hit $0.03 in the next few weeks and $0.1 towards the end of the year.Diversification with High-Potential Meme Tokens
Traders should be aware that JASMY isn’t the only low-cap alt in the market with promise, with a variety of newer meme tokens also looking ready to surge.While meme coins can be very hit and miss, one new example with strong fundamentals is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE).DOGEVERSE is a multi-chain meme coin that has raised over $15 million in its token offering, which is in its final phase before the token lists.Source: DogeverseWhat’s special about Dogeverse is that it’s the first ever Doge-themed multi-chain cryptocurrency.Accordingly, it will operate not only on Ethereum, but also on Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.This gives it some very strong potential, in that it could enter multiple ecosystems and gain usage on many more apps and trading platforms than it would have otherwise.As a token, it will have a hard cap of 120 million, which stands in contrast to tokens such as Dogecoin, which is infinitely inflationary.And when combined with a generous staking system, DOGEVERSE could become deflationary very quickly.VIDEONew investors can get involved in its presale via the official Dogeverse website, where 1 DOGEVERSE is selling at its final presale price of $0.00031.Once its sale ends, buyers will receive their tokens through Dogeverse’s airdrop, at which point they will be able to sell their coins (or hold) and potentially make a big profit.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Bitcoin ‘could’ consolidate for ‘4 or 5 months,’ but big cup and handle looks promising - Analyst

According to Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards, stock and crypto market seasonality, along with Bitcoin on-chain data, suggest that BTC price could consolidate for 4 to 5 months. In a new report, Edwards said that Bitcoin continues to oscillate within the cycle range highs in the $58,000-65,000 region, with continuous weekly closes above the $58,000 “supportive of the long-term trend continuation.”Likening BTC’s price action to gold, which formed a “massive cup and handle” pattern over the last 13 years, with the “cup” lasting four years, Edwards noted how Bitcoin appears to show the same chart pattern.Edwards noted that given the similarities between Bitcoin and gold, there is a possibility that BTC could spend “up to 9 months in the range high forming a cup before a measured move up.”Edwards said,“The technical picture remains bullish, provided the price holds above $58K. The longer we spend in the range highs, the more likely this structure will merge into a classic ‘cup and handle’ pattern, which would typically see strong price appreciation following.”BTC/USD weekly chart. Source: TradingViewDespite the promise of the cup and handle pattern, Edwards observed that Bitcoin’s Supply Delta and 90-Day Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metrics had formed rounded tops. Edwards explained that Capriole Investments uses each to identify cycle tops and that “we are at a comparable mid-cycle pit stop.” “Regardless, this chart is telling us to expect at least a few months (possibly up to 6 months) of sideways chop and volatility before trend resumption. We are at the two-month mark today.”Bitcoin Supply Delta and 90-day CDD.

ARK Invest analysts demonstrated that previous halving events set the stage for long-term momentum for BTC. The report noted that each halving has been a “precursor to upward momentum on a long-term time horizon,” adding,“Assuming a 3x Bitcoin price increase a year after the halving this time around might be too optimistic. That said, this chart highlights the case for Bitcoin’s increasing scarcity over a meaningful time horizon.”BTC performance since halving day.

DTCC's pilot project with Chainlink drives blockchain data to expand fund tokenization - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system, has completed a pilot project called Smart NAV in collaboration with blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK). Major financial institutions from the US also participated in the pilot.According to a report published by DTCC, the pilot was initiated to establish a standardized process for bringing and disseminating net asset value (NAV) data of funds across multiple blockchains. With the standardization, the tokenization of funds becomes easier and more efficient over time.The Smart NAV pilot, which included participants such as JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, BNY Mellon, and State Street, explored a digital extension to DTCC’s Mutual Fund Profile Service (MFPS I) to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT) for data dissemination and consumption.By delivering structured data onchain and creating standard roles and processes, the pilot found that foundational data could be embedded into various on-chain use cases, such as tokenized funds and “bulk consumer” smart contracts, which hold data for multiple funds.The pilot successfully demonstrated the feasibility of integrating structured NAV data onto blockchains, ensuring consistency and accuracy. It also established automated data routing via smart contracts, promoting dynamic data management and preventing fragmentation through Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).Notably, the project had a limited impact on existing market practices by allowing clients to use current channels and providing automated access to historical data without manual record-keeping.Clients involved in the project gained the ability to consume price and rate data in real-time through new interfaces, including APIs and smart contracts. The new data consumption methods include real-time API services and smart contracts designed for single funds or bulk fund groups, enabling instant updates and facilitating various use cases, such as automated portfolio rebalancing.Once fully deployed, the Smart NAV would open opportunities for expanding the scope of data dissemination to include key reference data and other blockchain-triggered workflows. Such an infrastructure would provide the foundation for more streamlined and efficient operational processes across the financial industry, as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) such as bonds, funds, and other traditional investments has become one of the most sought-after use cases for blockchain technology.

                        Thursday, May 16, 2024 – As the Solana price sets its sights on $200, it is meme coins like Sealana ($SEAL) that are making a splash, as its presale accelerates towards the finish line.Sealana has raised $1,230,000, with no sign that the appetite for SOL meme coins is letting up. The opportunity to catch a swim with the next big thing in Solana meme coins is too good to miss.Selling at a fixed price of $0.022, the new meme coin can be bought with SOL, ETH, USDT or USDC, as well as a fiat option using a bank card.From $WIF to new breed $MANEKI, Solana-based meme coins are all the rage as the Layer 1 Solana chain demonstrates a stability that was lacking in its earlier days and an efficiency and cheapness of transactions that threatens to leave Ethereum struggling to compete.Since March 12 Solana has been consistently outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the chart below shows:Notable antecedents to Sealana include both SLERF and newer slitherer Slothana ($SLOTH). The latter, in the space of a month, raised $15 million in its presale.Trading on Raydium and centralized exchanges Poloniex and XT.com with a top-10 exchange rumored to be named this week, SLOTH recently hit an all-time high of $0.056.Slothana token’s price appreciation is in no small part due to a token-burning mechanism that kicks in each time the price puts on another 1 cent.Although there are similarities between the approach of $SLOTH and $SEAL, which has led some to surmise that the two may have related teams, the fact that $SLOTH breached the $100m market cap on Tuesday won’t have gone unnoticed by $SEAL buyers.Sealana Is Part of Solana’s New Wave of Meme Coins
Meme coins continue to lead the crypto pack and that’s good news for those who have joined the Sealana colony.$SLOTH is up 26% so far today, valued at $0.0451. $CWIF (CatWifHat) is up 38% at $0.0000007759, and Book of Meme ($BOME) is printing $0.0123, at 15% higher. $SLERF, which famously managed to burn a chunk of its supply allocated to presale buyers, is not going anywhere, up 15% at $0.310.Elsewhere, a relative old-stager $BONK, the leader of the first wave of successful Solana meme coins, is 10% the better at $0.0000252.Over on the Base chain, $SHIBA is priced at $0.001805, up a chunky 30%. Meanwhile, $BONE is advancing 11% to $0.633 and four-month-old Solana darling $PONKE is climbing 14% to $0.245.YouTubers like presale expert Jacob Crypto Bury have Sealana right up there among the top picks for 100x returns.VIDEOMedia convergence in Bitcoin.com, Crypto Potato, The Economic Times and Cryptonews shows that the word is spreading fast, hence the quickening run rate for the presale.Solana is growing up fast and that’s great news for Sealana
If Sealana buyers need further confirmation that they are in the right place to find outsized return on investment, then a quick run through of the Solana Q1 report should get investors into a joyous flap.In the three months to the start of April, Solana’s average DEX trading volume increased 319% quarter on quarter to $1.5 billion.This is a reflection of Solana becoming the go-to destination for retail and, in particular, meme coin traders and investors.According to Messari, projects built primarily on Solana raised $89.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 – that works out to $2.5 million more than the amount raised in the whole of 2023.On the protocol side, the ecosystem launched its much-heralded token extensions technology, which makes SPL tokens even more configurable and useful. Extensions have been taken up enthusiastically by a number of stablecoin issuers, notably Paxos.The broader Solana ecosystem is expanding too. A new developer shop called Anza has been well received as has the founding of Colosseum, dedicated to encouraging the growth and adoption of Solana.Although there are still some teething pains given that Solana did have its first outage in almost a year, related to a legacy loader issue, it has done nothing to slow down the growth momentum of the chain.Indeed, the fact that usage has mushroomed, yet the network coped admirably, underscores its stability and approaching readiness for commercial prime time.Sealana and Dogeverse leading the way forward for meme coins
Sealana does not profess to be anything other than a meme coin. However, its potential to achieve virality demonstrates the solidity of the Solana technology.Its future success will also show how Solana can become the scaffolding that holds up highly engaged meme coin networks such as Sealana, able to sustain realtime decentralized value-transfer interactions that could end up encompassing hundreds of thousands of users.Sealana is fun, will likely explode in value and could be the future of meme coins that grow from pups into sea lions.Another coin alpha-hungry traders like the look of is the new multichain darling Dogeverse, which is taking meme coins in new directions with its six-chain bringing unrivaled interoperability to the scene.It is definitely worth a contribution, but after raising $15 million in double-quick time, Dogeverse is now in an oversale stage which means it could close at any time after already achieving its stated hard cap target. A listing will likely be coming in the next week or so. $DOGEVERSE is priced in its presale at $0.0003.Buy Sealana at the official website here.

Bitcoin Bulls Crush $93M Crypto Shorts As BTC Breaks $66,000


								Data shows a mass amount of short contracts have seen liquidation in crypto derivatives during the past day following Bitcoin’s rally above $66,000.
Bitcoin Recovery Has Triggered Large Derivatives-Related Liquidations
According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency market as a whole has observed a large amount of liquidations on the derivatives side over the last 24 hours.

“Liquidation” here naturally refers to the process that any contract undergoes after accumulating losses of a certain degree, where its platform has to close it up forcibly. Below is a table that shows the total amount of liquidation over the past day.

Looks like a large amount of contracts have been flushed during this period | Source: CoinGlass
As is visible, more than $135 million in cryptocurrency derivatives contracts belonging to over 52,000 traders were liquidated during this window.
This derivatives flush has disproportionately affected the short holders, as $93 million of their contracts were caught in it. In more concrete terms, 68.4% of the liquidations involved the shorts. This is natural because Bitcoin and other assets have seen green returns in the past day.
More than $42 million longs still managed to get liquidated despite the positive performance, suggesting that speculators jumped on with overleveraged positions when the surge took place. Still, they arrived too late and found liquidation when the initial leg-up cooled off.
As is usually the case, Bitcoin-related contracts contributed the most to this liquidation event, as the heatmap below suggests.

The breakdown of the liquidations by symbol | Source: CoinGlass
BTC’s $47 million liquidations significantly outweighed Ethereum’s this time, whose $16 million figure is more similar to Solana’s $12 million share. This would suggest the appetite for speculation around ETH has been unusually low recently.
A mass liquidation event like today’s is popularly known as a “squeeze.” During a squeeze, a sharp swing in the price triggers a large number of liquidations, which only feed back into the price move, thus unleashing a cascade of liquidations.
The shorts saw the most liquidations the past day, so the event would be called a short squeeze. Historically, such large liquidations haven’t exactly been rare in the cryptocurrency market.

This is because most coins can be quite volatile, and speculation is rife. Overleveraged positions can be quite risky in this market, so it’s not surprising that when volatility like today’s emerges, many traders get caught off guard.
The warning signs that liquidations would pop up had already appeared when the surge began yesterday, as the Bitcoin futures Open Interest, a measure of the total amount of open positions, had shown a rise.

The value of the metric appears to have gone up over the past couple of days | Source: CoinGlass
The chart shows that Open Interest is still high even after the surge, suggesting that the squeeze hasn’t been able to put off the speculators.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,000, up 8% over the past seven days.

BREAKING: Turkish Government Announces Another New Statement on Country's Cryptocurrency Law - Bitcoin Sistemi


AK Party Deputy Chairman and Head of Information and Communication Technologies Ömer İleri made new statements about the new cryptocurrency law.
Forward shared his post in order to clear up some of the confusion discussed in the public about the law.


Regarding TÜBİTAK's role in altcoin listings on cryptocurrency exchanges, İleri said the following:

“In principle, an approach has been adopted not to interfere with the crypto assets to be listed on the platforms. However, in order for the listings not to be random, platforms will be required to create a written procedure for determining the crypto assets to be traded on them. It is envisaged that the Capital Markets Board may regulate the principles and principles regarding the listing procedures. It will be determined by the CMB. “In the principles and principles, opinions of TÜBİTAK or other organizations may also be taken and technical criteria regarding the technological features of crypto assets may also be included. Therefore, an approach such as TÜBİTAK directly determining the assets to be listed is not included in the bill.”

Regarding the taxation of cryptocurrencies, İleri said the following:






The statement in the proposal, “Each year, one percent of all revenues of the platforms, excluding the interest revenues of the previous year, are paid to the Board and one percent to the TÜBİTAK budget by the end of May of the relevant year and recorded as income” relates to the payments to be made by the platforms. The bill does not include any tax regulations for end users who buy and sell through the platforms.

$1,700,000,000 Hedge Fund Hacked for Unspecified Amount in Crypto Assets, Perpetrators Not Arrested: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A major crypto investment firm is reportedly the latest victim of a security breach in the digital asset industry.
Bloomberg reports that hackers have compromised and partially drained the main hedge fund of BlockTower Capital.










The institutional investment firm with $1.7 billion in assets under management (AUM) has made investments in several Web3 firms, including blockchain and non-fungible token (NFT) developer Dapper Labs, gaming studio Sky Mavis and the collapsed cryptocurrency firm Terra Labs.
The stolen funds are still missing and the perpetrators have not yet been arrested, but the firm already employed blockchain forensics analysts to find out how the money was stolen, according to people familiar with the matter.
Last year, BlockTower Capital also suffered nearly $1.5 million in losses when hackers exploited the decentralized exchange aggregator Dexible and stole the crypto assets of users who authorized the app to move their tokens.
Hacking incidents continue to plague the crypto space. According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, there were over 600 major hacks in the crypto industry last year, resulting in around $2.61 billion in losses. Of these, only $674.9 million were recovered.
Last month, the crypto space suffered from around 40 hacks causing around $60.2 million in financial losses.

‘Notcoin’ Trading Volume Tops $1 Billion in 2024's Biggest Gaming Token Drop - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsMore than four months after the game launched via messaging app Telegram, Notcoin debuted its NOT token Thursday via The Open Network (TON)—and the massive airdrop yielded the largest gaming token launch of 2024 so far, along with over a billion dollars worth of trading volume so far.The NOT token is currently trading at a price of approximately $0.0076, per data from CoinGecko, giving it a market cap of about $776 million with the entire supply of 102.7 billion tokens minted right from the start.Some 35 million players were able to claim NOT tokens from playing the game, plus Notcoin launched staking rewards campaigns through Binance and OKX earlier this week.Both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap show the token price plunging soon after launch, as more and more players claimed their tokens and sold them into the market, though they disagree on how high the price went. CoinGecko points to a peak of $0.0215 while CoinMarketCap goes much lower at $0.0144.That’s reflected in the estimated size of the price drop, with CoinGecko showing NOT down 65% on the day, while CoinMarketCap says it’s down 48%. In any case, new crypto tokens often see volatile pricing right out the gate due to limited liquidity, and we’ve seen these types of tracking disparities with other recent launches as well.In any case, that also puts the token’s peak market cap at different levels, with CoinGecko pointing to a $2.21 billion market cap at the highest price, while CoinMarketCap says NOT peaked at a market cap above $1.48 billion.Either way, Notcoin stands well above the competition when it comes to this year’s biggest gaming token launches by market cap. The runners-up are Pixels (PIXEL), which peaked at $731 million according to CoinGecko, and Saga (SAGA) at a peak cap of $684 million.Notcoin trading has already topped the billion-dollar mark in a matter of hours, with CoinMarketCap reporting about $1.07 billion worth of trading volume. That makes it the 14th most-traded coin by that metric over the last 24 hours.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Revolutionary Voting Concluded in the USA: Decision is in Favor of Cryptocurrencies - What Will Happen Now? - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a landmark decision, the U.S. Senate voted to repeal the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) SAB 121 rule. This rule had previously prevented regulated financial institutions from storing Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Cancellation of this rule may now pave the way for these institutions to engage with cryptocurrencies more freely.
But the war is not over yet. The decision now goes to President Joe Biden, who last week expressed his intention to veto the Senate's repeal. If the president vetoes, the issue will go back to the House and Senate. Both chambers would need a two-thirds majority vote to override the veto, setting the stage for a significant legislative fight.



Sen. Cynthia Lummis celebrated the Senate's decision, calling it “a win for financial innovation” and “a clear challenge to the way the Biden administration and Gary Gensler are persecuting crypto.” He also emphasized the importance of this event, stating that “this is the first time Congress has passed independent crypto legislation” and promised that “we are just getting started.”
Meanwhile, Congressman Tom Emmer described the situation as “a policy conflict between the Executive and the American people.” He noted that the bipartisan passage of the repeal of SAB 121 by Congress indicates strong support for cryptocurrencies. But he warned that if Biden vetoed the resolution, it would show his willingness to “kill opportunity for Americans at the expense of Americans.”

Pump.fun pauses trading after apparent flash loan attack - Blockworks


Pump.fun was attacked Thursday by an exploiter who seemingly used flash loans to buy out the bonding curve. 
In a post on X, Pump.fun said that it was “aware” that the contracts were compromised and were investigating. 
“We have upgraded the contracts so the attacker cannot siphon any more funds. The TVL in the protocol right now is safe,” the team said. “We’ve paused trading — you cannot buy and sell any coins at the moment. Any coins that are currently in the process of migrating to Raydium cannot be traded and will not be migrating for an indefinite period of time.”
Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute, analyzed the situation in a series of posts on X, saying that the key was compromised, “though the possibility of an inside job remains.”

Igamberdiev said that the amount lost by Pump.fun is “at least” 12,000 SOL, or roughly $2 million.
An account on X going by Stacc seemed to take credit for the attack, writing “I’m about to change the course of history” in a post. 
Stacc seemed to imply in his posts that he didn’t intend to keep the stolen funds, but rather planned to transfer the “remaining balances of bonding curves” to some token users. 

It’s not clear as of publication how Stacc was able to execute the attack, or if they’re distributing the balances to random people. 
As Blockworks previously reported, Pump.fun lets developers launch tokens without seed liquidity for a couple of dollars. Its revenue comes from users buying and selling tokens. 
Tokens that exceed market caps of $69,000 can then be listed on the Raydium DEX. 
This is a developing story.

Donald Trump Received $5 Million In Crypto Donations - But Not For His Election Campaign - Benzinga

Donald Trump has recently made headlines for his involvement with cryptocurrency. In early May, he hosted an NFTs event where he had dinner with supporters of one of his NFTs projects. At the dinner, he voiced support for cryptocurrency and that he wanted to create an environment where cryptocurrency companies could operate in the U.S. without fear of regulation. These comments came after Trump made millions on cryptocurrency from a handful of sources, all of which were free donations. Don't Miss:Trump first began earning cryptocurrency in late 2022, following the release of the Trump Digital Trading Cards NFTs collection. The project used Trump's name, image, and likeness to release 45,000 NFTs priced at $99 each. Trump received royalties for allowing the company, Collect Trump Cards, to release the collection. In total, Trump has received over 1,800 ETH from the project. In late 2023, Trump sold 1,075 of the ETH to generate proceeds of $2.4 million. Trump still owns over 800 ETH, currently worth $2.4 million. However, the ETH is not necessarily a donation, as Trump earned the royalties by allowing another company to market the NFTs. Trump has earned more than $5 million in donations from other cryptocurrency companies. Trump received 580,000 Maga Coin (TRUMP) tokens when the project launched in August 2023. The meme coin is focused on providing Trump supporters with a token to invest in that serves as "this kind of de facto betting market on the election for many investors," according to Steven Steele, the project’s marketing director. The founders of the project sent the tokens to Trump as a marketing ploy to show their support for the former president. Trending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets — has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?When Trump first received the tokens they were trading for less than $0.01 each, and the total position was worth just a few thousand dollars. However, as Trump has continued to make headlines, a memecoin craze has occurred, and the presidential race heats up, the price of the token has surged. In March 2024, the token reached an all-time high (ATH) of $11.56, which meant that Trump's 580,000 tokens were worth over $6.7 million. While the price of the token has since fallen, it has remained well above the $5 level and has performed well in May. The recent spike in price was likely due to comments Trump gave at the NFTs dinner event, where he said that "if you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, you better vote for Trump." Trump's current holdings in MAGA Coin are worth over $5 million. While it is unclear whether or not Trump will sell the position or even is aware of them, the amount is certainly noteworthy, considering that Trump's election bid has raised over $200 million in total.Read Next:

Spot Bitcoin trading coming to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange

Illustration: Benoit Tessier (Reuters)Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, will soon offer spot Bitcoin trading as crypto is becoming mainstream and demand is surging, reports the Financial Times.Nvidia stock has all-time closing high in its crosshairsCME is the world’s largest futures Bitcoin trading platform and has been in discussions with cryptocurrency traders to establish a regulated marketplace for spot Bitcoin trading. According to the report, EBS, a Swiss-based currency trading platform known for its strict crypto asset trading regulations, is expected to run the platform.Spot trading crypto involves buying or selling at the current market price, as opposed to futures which allows traders to bet on the up or down movement of cryptocurrency prices without actually owning them. While the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices makes things tricky, spot trading poses a relatively low level of risk because traders are only exposed to their crypto’s price movements. Returns on spot trades, however, tend not to be as high as those from futures trading.Spot trading for Bitcoin on CME would enable traders to engage in basis trades, a strategy designed to profit from the small price differences between futures contracts and the underlying spot Bitcoin. The exchange has not commented in detail about the offer, but the move highlights how crypto has become more mainstream and how big financial players are taking an interest in it.The move follows the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which allowed giant financial institutions, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and others, to jump into the new era of digital assets.

US Senate passes resolution overturning SEC crypto rule on banks

A majority of lawmakers in the United States Senate have passed a joint resolution calling for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to strike down a rule affecting financial institutions doing business with crypto firms.In a 60 to 38 vote on May 16, U.S. Senators passed H.J.Res. 109, a resolution nullifying the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121. The commission’s rule requires banks to keep customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets, with capital maintained against them — a measure many lawmakers and industry leaders have criticized as stifling innovation.“The tally, a stunning 60 ‘Yeas’ in the Senate vote, sends a strong signal that both houses of Congress, across the political divide, clearly disapprove of this rule,” said the crypto advocacy group Blockchain Association in a May 16 X post. Source: Senate.govOn May 8, before the resolution passed the U.S. House of Representatives, President Joe Biden said he intended to veto the bill to “protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.” If the U.S. President vetoes the legislation, it will return to Congress and require a two-thirds majority vote to pass again.“The threat of a presidential veto denies the fact that there is a growing awareness among the voting public, particularly young people, that crypto is something our elected officials should care about,” said the Blockchain Association.Related: Proposed US Blockchain Integrity Act would ban crypto mixers for 2 yearsThe vote represented an atypical bipartisan move by the U.S. Senate, split 51-49 in favor of Democrats. According to Senator Cynthia Lummis, it was the first time this session of Congress passed “standalone crypto legislation.” The White House did not immediately release a statement on the resolution passing.“It is clear there is overwhelming opposition to SAB 121, and I urge [President Biden] to reconsider his previous statement of intent to veto the resolution,” said Representative Mike Flood, who sponsored the resolution.The joint resolution could be a bellwether for a different crypto bill, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. The legislation clarifies the roles the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission would have in regulating digital assets. It passed out of committee in July 2023 and is expected to be introduced in the House for a floor vote in May.Magazine: ‘Crypto is inevitable’ so we went ‘all in’: Meet Vance Spencer, permabull

Are Bitcoin ETFs Poised To Reshape China’s No-Crypto Stance? - DailyCoin


        

Bitcoin ETFs have recently launched in Hong Kong.



Emerging reports have suggested that the launch may catalyze the embrace of crypto in mainland China.



Bitcoin ETFs have not been launched in China.




China, the powerhouse of the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, has maintained a consistently negative stance against the crypto industry over the past years. Despite contenders like Hong Kong and Japan vying for dominance as the leading Asian digital hub, mainland China remains firm in its anti-crypto stance.



However, the recent launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong hints at a potential shift for China.



Bitcoin ETFs in China?



Central to the speculation is a local media Caixin report on May 16, 2024, which stated that most Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF issuers’ headquarters are under Beijing’s regulatory authorities, which suggests their alignment with China’s regulatory requirements.




While the ETFs offered by three Chinese asset managers, Harvest Global Investments, Bosera Asset Management, and China Asset Management, are currently inaccessible to Chinese investors, they are expected to serve as a conduit for a more accessible and regulated crypto ecosystem.



“What I’m optimistic about is, with these rules and these regulations now in place, Hong Kong actually may find a way to be this bridge for China to Bitcoin and the greater crypto ecosystem in a way that’s safer, more controlled or regulated,” stated a Bitfarms executive to the South China Morning Post at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong.



Reports that the ETFs may be heading to the Chinese stock exchange Stock Connect, as suggested by X user Richard Byworth in a May 1 tweet, further fuel the chances.







Byworth emphasized ongoing talks within the Hong Kong market, hinting at the possibility of providing access to the asset class and the ability to purchase investments with mainland China currency, the Yuan.




Another point of contention is Harvest Global Investments CEO’s reported emphasis on ongoing efforts to extend ETF offerings to mainland China investors over the next few years. However, despite the positive sentiment, China’s unwelcoming stance towards crypto charts a muffled outlook.



China’s Crypto Antagonism



While there is no outright ban on crypto in China, the Chinese government has continuously reiterated its disinterest in the industry.



Authorities imposed a comprehensive ban on everything from trading to mining in 2017, effectively curtailing all crypto-linked operations among crypto exchanges and investors.



Fraudulent schemes in the industry have further tightened the government’s no-crypto campaign. In February 2024, the Dalian Supervision Bureau of China Securities Regulatory Commission reminded the public to beware of illegal fundraising scams in the name of “virtual currency” opportunities. The commission asserted that such opportunities lure investors, discouraging them within its jurisdiction.



Nevertheless, the Chinese underground crypto space is thriving despite the ban, recording a $86.4 billion crypto transaction volume in January 2024.



On the Flipside




Despite the strict stance in the country, reports surfaced in January 2024, revealing that Chinese officials covertly use cold wallets for bribery.



Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs, launched on April 30, had a lukewarm debut.



In December 2023, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology expressed interest in Web 3 initiatives to advance the local digital landscape.




Why This Matters



Accepting Bitcoin ETFs in China would signify a significant shift in the region’s crypto landscape, indicating a potential easing of the government’s strict stance. Additionally, it could open up an additional pathway to the asset class, further fueling its growing adoption.

DCF Announces Passage of Proposal for Better Liquidity and Efficiency in Cosmos Network | Coinspeaker



The passing of Proposal #912 highlights the proactive and innovative spirit of the Cosmos community.

The Decentralized Cooperation Foundation (DCF) announced the successful passage of Proposal #912, a transformative initiative within the Cosmos network, a leading decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, aimed at improving liquidity and economic stability.
Proposal #912: Milestone for Cosmos Network
Recently approved by the Cosmos community, Proposal #912 introduces a robust framework for liquid staking. This initiative is designed to allow staked assets to be traded freely through derivative tokens, therefore enhancing the liquidity within the network. The passage of this proposal underscores the community’s commitment to continuous innovation and improvement.





The primary objective of the proposal is to optimize the utilization of staked assets by enabling their liquidity. Traditional staking involves locking up tokens to secure the network, which, while crucial for network security, reduces the liquidity of these assets. Liquid staking, however, allows these staked assets to be utilized in other financial activities, improving their efficiency and liquidity.
Implementation and Initial Phase
Proposal #912 directs the strategic allocation of 188,768 ATOM from the Cosmos Community Pool towards liquid staking on the Stride and Persistence platforms, expected to increase capital efficiency by 18%. This projection is based on the improved utility of staked assets, which can now participate in various financial activities without compromising the network’s security. If this initial phase proves successful, after a three-month pilot, an additional 6% of the ATOM tokens will be allocated, bringing the total to 10%.
The Role of the Inter Stable Token (IST)
Central to Proposal #912 is the strategic and expanded utilization of the Inter Stable Token (IST), integral to enhancing liquidity and maintaining economic stability across the Cosmos network. The proposal specifies the use of liquid-staked assets to mint IST from Inter Protocol with a 500% collateralization ratio, aiming to distribute these tokens across various liquidity pools and swapping half of the IST into USDC. These tokens will be provided to significant platforms like Osmosis, Astroport, Axelar, Shade Protocol, and Quasar Finance, projected to yield an overall estimated increase in efficiency of 18%.
DCF’s Commitment to Decentralization and Innovation
Ric Shreves, President of the Decentralized Cooperation Foundation, says:
“The passage of proposal #912 is a testament to the Cosmos community’s commitment to innovation and decentralized governance. We are proud to support such initiatives that align with our mission to promote blockchain solutions that are accessible, efficient, and equitable.”
Future Outlook
The passing of Proposal #912 highlights the proactive and innovative spirit of the Cosmos community. The successful implementation of this proposal is expected to set an example for future blockchain initiatives, stimulating further innovation within the Cosmos ecosystem. By deepening liquidity and increasing capital efficiency, the proposal strives to generate revenue for the Cosmos Hub community pool and benefit all ecosystem participants.

Crypto Analyst Predicts 100% Rise For Dogecoin To $0.3 As Major Metric Explodes | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin seems to have flipped into a bullish momentum, at least in the short term, prompting analysts to predict bullish outlooks in the short term. Particularly, DOGE is up by 7% in the past 24 hours and is still on a 14% increase in the past 3 days. 
Current price action shows the cryptocurrency is moving to break past a resistance level of around $0.16. A crypto analyst known pseudonymously as World Of Charts believes the potential of this breakout happening is very strong and DOGE is primed for a surge to a price target between $0.27 to $0.30, which represents a 100% surge on the upper end.
Major Dogecoin Metric Explodes
Doge is starting to turn bullish in a number of metrics, which in turn has increased investor interest. One of these metrics is the DOGE open interest across crypto exchanges. At the time of writing, Dogecoin’s open interest has spiked by over 12.47% in the past 24 hours to reach $883.89 million in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass data.

Other metrics, such as an increase in derivates volume and a 14.4% increase in trading volume in the past 24 hours, also point to increased activity for DOGE, which in turn could lead to a significant price uptick. 
According to a 12-hour timeframe Dogecoin chart shared on social media platform X by World Of Charts, DOGE is on the verge of breaking out of a descending triangle. This chart shows DOGE has been on an interesting price action formation of lower highs with equal lows since the beginning of April. 
This form of descending triangle is particularly a strong bullish indicator for Dogecoin analysts, especially considering it started to form after a strong DOGE uptrend in February and March. When this pattern occurs within an established uptrend such as this, it generally indicates corrections before the trend continues.

The analyst remarked that DOGE is “on verge of another breakout.” As per his analysis, a successful breakout would push DOGE on the uptrend continuation and a move towards $0.27 to $0.30 for the first time since October 2021.
Despite going on an 182% price increase in February and March, DOGE is yet to break into $0.27 this year. The cryptocurrency peaked at $0.22 before spiraling down and correcting to $0.13, representing a 40% decrease.
At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.156 and could keep surging for the rest of the month. The first step before reaching $0.3 is to break above a resistance around $0.167, If DOGE can surge above $0.17 and the bulls hold this price level, it could continue climbing to $0.22 and beyond.

Global Liquidity Cycle Set To Push Crypto Into Next Massive Bull Market, According to Macro Guru Raoul Pal - The Daily Hodl


								Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal thinks the global liquidity cycle will drive crypto prices higher.
In a new YouTube video, Pal tells his 703,000 subscribers that there are currently macroeconomic sources of liquidity “everywhere,” including upcoming monetary policy choices from the U.S. Federal Reserve.










The Real Vision chief executive also notes that global liquidity increases in “crypto macro summers.”
“Obviously [in] 2020 it went bananas because of the pandemic. But 2016, 2012 – these were good periods for liquidity. And guess what? Crypto, technology, they all rose. Then you get into fall – fall is often when the real fireworks happen. Liquidity keeps pumping and eventually tops out into winter. That’s when you get the corrections, the crypto down cycles. So we’ve got the best two parts of the cycle to come.”
Pal says he’s “pretty much 100%” invested in Solana (SOL) right now, plus a few small memecoins and “other bits and pieces.”
 “The Solana/Bitcoin cross chart [and] the Solana/ETH cross chart look so compelling that I’m like, ‘If my job here is to make as much money as possible, I’m just going to own the thing that I think is going to go up the most.'” 
Solana is trading at $160.33 at time of writing and is up 13.5% in the past 24 hours.

The Curious Case of Bitcoin L2s | Bankless


Bitcoin has had an explosion in development.New primitives like Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20s are taking center stage. This marks a big shift in the vibe of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It’s evolving from being lazer-eyed on BTC as an asset to a more dynamic ecosystem that has different things for people to use, build, and speculate on.Within the Bitcoin ecosystem, L2s are now the new hot thing. Everyone wants a piece of the Bitcoin L2 pie. But what’s the hype all about?In today’s story, we’re zooming out for a full view of the Bitcoin L2 scene. We’ll be answering key questions for those new to the concept of Bitcoin L2s: the necessity of L2s, their present condition, what lies ahead, and their eventual end state. Let's dive in! 👇Why Bitcoin Needs L2sThe Bitcoin network is designed to prioritize security and decentralization, making tradeoffs around its scalability and expressivity as a blockchain. While this makes BTC a more valuable asset, it also means that the network is not the ideal infra for building financial apps, as seen on Ethereum.For almost a decade, the Bitcoin community has grappled with scalability issues, with transactions costing tens of dollars during peak network traffic. And today, the demand for Bitcoin’s block space is exploring new heights, driven by experiments like Ordinals,  Runes, BRC-20s:The vision for Bitcoin is to be universally accessible and adopted. To make that happen, it must scale to handle more traffic without costing a fortune per transaction. The rising demand for Bitcoin’s block space underscores the need to scale Bitcoin, reflecting demand for Bitcoin L2s.The Bankless Guide to Lightning Network on BanklessUpdated: Dec 2023The Current State of Bitcoin L2sThe Bitcoin community has been actively working to improve transaction scalability for many years. A key development in this area is the Lightning Network – a payment channel protocol aimed at enabling faster and more affordable transactions by processing them outside of the Bitcoin L1.The Bankless Guide to Lightning Network on BanklessUpdated: Dec 2023While the Lightning Network has long been the flagship solution for Bitcoin’s scalability vision, the community is increasingly recognizing its limitations. There’s a consensus forming that the Lightning Network might not be the definitive scaling solution for Bitcoin, and there’s a need for better Bitcoin L2s.Eric Wall discussed this need for improved L2s on a recent Bankless episode, suggesting that the future of Bitcoin's scalability may lie beyond what the Lightning Network currently offers.But where does this bring us? How can we build more effective Bitcoin L2s?VIDEOBitVM's Trust-Minimized PromiseCurrently, the spotlight is on BitVM, a new model for executing Turing-complete contracts on Bitcoin that could pave the way for optimistic rollups on Bitcoin.The main reason why the community is rallying behind BitVM over any other approach stems from its compatibility with the Taproot upgrade. This means BitVM can be deployed without further modifications to the Bitcoin network — preserving the network's existing rules. A win-win for all types of people in the Bitcoin community.BitVM's approach involves off-chain execution of transactions with the functionality to verify them onchain within the challenge window through fraud proofs, a mechanism akin to Ethereum's optimistic rollups. This system can operate even with a single Prover but has the trust assumption that there must always be at least one honest verifier in the system that can detect and broadcast malicious transactions. However, this also means that if all Verifiers were compromised, the integrity of Bitcoin would be at risk since the attacker could post fraudulent transactions on the network. Simplified Diagram of the Operation of BitVM. Source: The Bitcoin L2 OpportunityBitVM only allows the creation of trust-minimized Bitcoin L2s like optimistic rollups, and not trustless Bitcoin L2s like ZK-rollups. Moreover, similar to optimistic rollups on Ethereum, BitVM faces challenges such as lengthy dispute resolution times and the necessity for operators to lock up significant capital to ensure liquidity for potential withdrawals. Consequently, there’s a degree of skepticism in the Bitcoin community regarding BitVM’s practicality. But it’s worth noting that BitVM is still in its early stages of development and holds promise for scaling Bitcoin through optimistic rollups.VIDEOZero-Knowledge DreamsThis brings us to the main question – what’s the end-state of Bitcoin L2s? The answer is, ZK-rollups! But building ZK-rollups on Bitcoin isn’t easy, or even technically possible right now… this would necessitate changes to the Bitcoin network through a soft fork, and we all know that’s easier said than done. The soft fork would add a new opcode to Bitcoin, which would enable it to natively recognize and verify zero-knowledge proofs, allowing for trustless interactions between Bitcoin and the rollup. However, as mentioned above, this is a major technical hurdle and its feasibility remains uncertain.But, wait a minute. Given that BitVM is still early, and neither optimistic nor ZK-rollups are currently possible on Bitcoin, how do we have so many Bitcoin L2s in the ecosystem already?Well, the reality is that, technically, real Bitcoin rollups don’t exist yet. What we’re seeing is a bunch of dedicated teams laying the groundwork for future Bitcoin L2s.BOB’s phase-wise approach to building a Bitcoin L2. Source: BOB official websiteFor example, some rollup teams, like BOB, are taking a phased approach. They’ve started by bootstrapping an ecosystem as an EVM rollup, attracting users, liquidity, and applications. Then, they plan to transition to an optimistic rollup using BitVM once the technology matures, and eventually, they aim to evolve into a zk-rollup, contingent on if Bitcoin undergoes a soft fork to add the necessary opcode.Closing ThoughtsWith great hype comes great potential for scams. Amid the buzz, there are many projects falsely claiming to be Bitcoin L2s, so it's important for investors and users to remain cautious. The jury is still out on whether many self-proclaimed projects are actually L2s or if they are merely using buzzwords to attract venture capital and retail investment.Nonetheless, these are exciting times for the Bitcoin community. From the launch of the Bitcoin spot ETF, which marks a milestone in institutional adoption, to primitives like Ordinals, BRC-20s, and Runes, the Bitcoin ecosystem is experiencing unprecedented growth and innovation. The prospect of Bitcoin L2s adds to the excitement about the future of Bitcoin.🗣️ What's your take on the potential impact of Bitcoin L2s on BTC adoption overall? Do you think they’re here to stay, or just a fleeting trend?8 Bitcoin L2s You Should Be Watching on BanklessBitcoin’s L2 narrative is scaling up quickly

Crypto Analyst Looks Ahead for Bitcoin After BTC Breaks Downtrend - The Daily Hodl


								One widely followed crypto analyst says Bitcoin’s latest rally is turning an old BTC resistance into new support.
Pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 468,200 followers on the social media platform X that BTC’s 2% leap in the last 24 hours could be the end of a downtrend.










“BTC is breaking its Daily Downtrend”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
According to the analyst, the $60,000 price zone was acting as a barrier to BTC. However, Rekt Capital now believes that the barrier has now been flipped to a foundation.
“Bitcoin has successfully turned the old major resistance into a new major support.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
According to the crypto analyst, BTC’s downtrend has been one month in the making.
“Bitcoin has broken its Daily Downtrend which started one month ago in mid-April
When downtrends get broken, uptrends occur
Bitcoin has finally recorded its first Higher Higher since bottoming at $56,000.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
The analyst also says that BTC is on track to reach a bull market high in the fall or winter of next year.
“In the 2015-2017 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 518 days after the Halving
In the 2019-2021 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 546 days after the Halving
If history repeats and the next Bull Market peak occurs 518-546 days after the Halving…
That would mean Bitcoin could peak in this cycle in mid-September or mid-October 2025
Currently, Bitcoin is accelerating in this cycle by approximately 200 days now
So the longer Bitcoin consolidates after the Halving, the better it will be for resynchronizing this current cycle with the traditional Halving cycle.”

BTC is worth $65,842 at time of writing, up 7% in the last seven days.

Alameda's Sam Trabucco Resurfaces to Defend FTX Exec Ahead of Sentencing - Decrypt

Ryan Salame, the former CEO of FTX Digital Markets, says he had nothing to do with the massive fraud that lost the exchange’s customers over $10 billion—and his “best friend” Sam Trabucco, who once led Alameda Research, has attested to that in writing.In a Tuesday court filing, Salame’s lawyers argued that their client was “not part of Sam Bankman-Fried’s innermost circle” who knew about the fraud at the center of the case. They compiled letters from Salame’s friends and family attesting to his “generous” and “caring” nature.“Simply put, Ryan is my best friend,” Trabbuco wrote in a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan. “He has also committed crimes. He's acknowledged that and is prepared to accept the consequences.”In September, Salame became one of many FTX leaders to enter a plea deal with the Department of Justice (DOJ) following the exchange’s downfall, forfeiting $1.5 billion in the process. That guilty plea related to campaign finance violation charges rather than fraud, however, and Trabuco said his friend’s punishment should fairly reflect that.“Ryan doesn't deserve to be defined by his worst actions,” he said. “He's a complex person who made mistakes, not some one-dimensional villain.”Troy Tsui, another friend and former co-worker of Salame’s at Alameda Research, backed the latter’s “fundamentally decent” character. Another letter from his mom and dad said that “at his core, Ryan seeks to be a catalyst for good in the lives of others.”Going beyond Salame’s character, lawyers noted how even Caroline Ellison—the CEO of Alameda Research and Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend—testified at the latter’s fraud trial that they had “conspired to keep Ryan in the dark about their fraud.”While on the witness stand speaking against her former partner, Ellison said that she “knew that FTX could not meet all withdrawals” during the week of its collapse. However, Bankman-Fried instructed her to tell Salame then that “we can meet a ton, though it’s already getting large.”Salame’s legal team also cited a letter from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas stating that he was the first to inform the commission that client assets at FTX had been transferred to Alameda Research.“The Commission understood Mr. Salame as advising… that such transfers were not allowed and therefore may constitute misappropriation, theft, fraud or some other crime,” the commission stated. The only people with the power to move funds like that, according to Salame, were Bankman-Fried, engineering director Nishad Singh, and FTX co-founder Gary Wang.“For the reasons stated above, a sentence of no more than 18 months’ imprisonment is sufficient,” Salame’s lawyers concluded.His sentencing hearing is scheduled for May 28.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin ETFs attract 937 professional firms in Q1: K33 Research - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) appeared in 937 professional firms’ 13F filings in the US, shared Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research. In stark contrast, gold ETFs only saw investments from 95 professional firms in the same period, according to data from Bitwise. Retail investors continue to hold the majority of the float, but professional investors accounted for over $11 billion in exposure by quarter’s end, which is 18.7% of the total Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM).The trend indicates that larger ETFs are generally more attractive to institutional investors. Notably, ARKB and HODL ETFs have experienced a higher degree of institutional backing, largely due to allocations from prominent firms such as ARK and VanEck.Among the professional firms that held Bitcoin ETF shares are JPMorgan, UBS, and Wells Fargo. Even the State of Wisconsin Investment Board revealed its holdings of over $99 million worth of BlackRock’s IBIT at the end of the first quarter. However, as highlighted by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the 13F Forms are a “snapshot” of these institutions’ holdings as of March 31, and they don’t account for short positions and derivatives.After the US inflation numbers came within the expected, investors turned to ETFs again. As reported by the X user Lookonchain, 9 ETFs added 3,893 BTC to their holdings, which is nearly $256 million.Grayscale’s GBTC registered an outflow of 839 BTC, while Fidelity added 1,989 BTC to its holdings. BlackRock’s IBIT is inching closer to GBTC, falling less than 14,000 BTC short with its 274,755 BTC under management.

Harvard built hacker-proof quantum network in Boston using existing fiber cable

Physicists at Harvard University have built what they believe is the world’s longest secure quantum communications network using 22 miles of currently existing fiber-optic cables.The experiment, published in the scientific journal Nature, connected two functional quantum computer nodes to each other through a strange physical phenomenon called “entanglement.” This allowed them to share data across the 22-mile distance in a paradigm that, according to the laws of physics, is unhackable. Source: Can Knaut via OpenStreetMapQ-DayThe world is currently embroiled in a technological race to shore up global computer security ahead of “Q Day,” a hypothetical point in the near future when bad actors will have access to quantum computers powerful enough to shred current encryption methods. While major institutions such as banks, military installations and the healthcare industry have already begun adopting protocols to protect data, there currently exists no functional replacement for data transmission.Essentially, no matter how well-encrypted data is, any time it is transmitted, there’s a risk of unwanted interception. Quantum computers and quantum networking have the potential to eliminate this risk due to the nature of how quantum data is handled. Quantum networkingData cannot be copied in a quantum system. This is because quantum data is extremely brittle. The slightest permutation, including something as innocuous as performing a simple scientific measurement, changes the data, rendering it unusable. Since quantum data can’t be copied, it cannot be transmitted from one node to another in the traditional sense. Instead, it must be “entangled,” at both points. This is accomplished using diamonds with a specific kind of flaw at their “hearts” that allows scientists to exploit a vacuum space to entangle quantum information. Simply put, quantum mechanics allows for the teleportation of data but not the transmission. Because of this, the big fear isn’t that bad actors will build quantum systems to intercept data — we could be decades away from even the most well-funded adversarial organizations having access to quantum systems — but that legacy data, encrypted with nonquantum protections, will be stolen from today’s systems and transmissions and then stored for decryption at a later date when bad actors can find some way to access a modern quantum computer system. In the meantime, the experimental quantum network systems being built today could one day serve as the primary medium for the distribution of sensitive data.Rather than, for example, sending financial transaction information through the typical banking “wires,” or legacy networks, institutions could store data in well-protected data centers and only “send” it to other institutions or stakeholders via quantum entanglement, where there’s absolutely no chance of hacking. This could have massive implications for the decentralized finance community, as the idea of “owning” data could be upended by a paradigm where access is inextricably confined to entangled nodes. In this way, it’s conceivable that digital assets such as cryptocurrency could be secured against all forms of network-based attacks.

Critical Bitcoin Price Report from JPMorgan - They Revealed BTC Level Needed for Miners to Keep Profiting - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to a research report published today by JPMorgan (JPM), the current hashrate and power consumption of the Bitcoin (BTC) network indicate that the estimated mining cost is approximately $45,000, a significant decrease from the previous cost of $50,000.
JPMorgan had previously predicted a significant drop in hashrate following the halving, as unprofitable miners would be forced to leave the network. This prediction is now coming true, albeit with a slight delay. The four-year halving, a process that slowed the growth rate of Bitcoin supply by reducing miner rewards by 50%, took place last month.


The term “hashrate” refers to the total combined computing power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain. The report suggests that the delay in hashrate decline is most likely due to the launch of the Runes protocol, a next-generation form of tokenization on the BTC network, resulting in a temporary increase in transaction fees.
“The Runes protocol provided a temporary boost to miner revenue in the immediate aftermath of the Bitcoin halving,” wrote analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. “Bitcoin miners were able to offset the loss in new BTC issuance reward due to the halving, along with the increase in transaction fees, keeping block rewards for miners virtually unchanged,” they added.





However, support from Runes was short-lived. User activity and fees for this protocol have dropped significantly over the past week or two. The authors noted that “this heightens the ongoing challenge that Bitcoin miners face to maintain a sustainable source of income, especially in the post-halving environment.”

As market excitement for the Runes protocol faded and temporary support for miners dissipated, the network's power consumption dropped more than its hashrate. According to the bank, this indicates that unprofitable miners with inefficient machines are leaving the network.


The report also highlighted a feedback loop regarding the BTC price. “The further the Bitcoin price falls, the greater the number of unprofitable miners who come under pressure to leave the Bitcoin network, and the greater the resulting drop in hashrate and bitcoin production, i.e. mining cost,” the report said.
In the near term, JPMorgan predicts a limited upside for BTC due to several previously identified hurdles, including a lack of positive catalysts and the disappearance of retail investor buying appetite.

FTX Creditors are Taking What's Theirs, Which is Good News for FTT - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

It was a good week for FTX creditors, words not many thought would be written at the end of 2022 after the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy. But the tides have turned for the defunct entity. For one, crypto asset prices were essentially at their lowest when FTX went under, and its crypto holdings are worth a lot more now than they were before. The bankruptcy estate has managed to sell off shares in GBTC GBTC, its stake in the AI startup Anthropic, and its locked Solana SOL/USD tokens, all of which helped it rake in funds to pay back creditors. Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Senate passes resolution to overturn SAB 121 - Blockworks


The US Senate on Thursday passed Joint Resolution 109, which seeks to overturn the Security and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. The legislation now heads to President Joe Biden’s desk, where it is expected to be vetoed.    
Twelve Democratic Senators voted in favor to pass the resolution Thursday: Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Gary Peters of Michigan, Jon Tester of Montana, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. 
SAB 121, introduced in March 2022 and enacted the following month, states that digital asset custodians should report a liability and “corresponding assets” on their balance sheets for all custodied cryptocurrencies. The practice, SEC staff said, is intended to guard against the “significant risks and uncertainties associated with safeguarding crypto assets.” 
Last week, in the Republican-controlled House, 21 Democrats voted in favor of passing the resolution. The White House said last week that should the legislation make it to President Joe Biden’s desk, he would veto it.

“SAB 121 was issued in response to demonstrated technological, legal and regulatory risks that have caused substantial losses to consumers,” the Biden administration wrote in a statement. “By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, it could also inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto assets including financial stability.”
The president has ten days, excluding Sundays, to veto or sign off once it reaches his desk. 
Rep. Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., who co-sponsored the resolution, on Wednesday asked SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to repeal SAB 121 ahead of the Senate vote.

“Today’s Senate vote to repeal SAB 121 sends a clear bipartisan message: Congress will not stand idly by as Gary Gensler and the SEC deliberately sidestep the statutory rulemaking process and overstep their regulatory authority,” Nickel said Thursday in a statement. 
The SEC did not immediately respond to Blockworks’ request for comment.

'The Hat Is Covering The Eyes Of WIF Holders': Veteran Trader Doubles Down On Meme Coin Bear Thesis - Benzinga

Popular crypto trader DonAlt has voiced his bearish outlook on Dogwifhat WIF/USD and the broader meme coin market in a series of tweets, expressing concerns over market saturation and the current state of Bitcoin BTC/USD.What Happened: DonAlt humorously begins by addressing the recent volatility surrounding WIF. "Pretty sure the hat is covering the eyes of WIF holders and they’re accidentally pressing the wrong buttons trying to liquidate me," he quips. He warns, "Once that’s fixed and they can see again I’m getting ready to get rekt," indicating his readiness for a potential downturn.He outlines several reasons for his bearish stance on meme coins, starting with the sheer volume of memes. "There are infinite memes already," DonAlt points out, highlighting the oversaturation in the market. This influx dilutes the value and potency of individual meme coins, making it difficult for any single meme to stand out and maintain long-term value.He further underscores that the technical outlook for meme coins is discouraging. "Charts don’t look so good across the board," DonAlt observes, indicating that the broader memecoin market is underperforming. Coupled with heavily skewed bullish sentiment, he cautions that the market might be setting up for a reversal.Also Read: Star Trader Points Out Four Key Factors Of Successful Meme Coins: Dogecoin, Dogwifhat, Michi Are ‘Relatable Memes’Why It Matters: DonAlt critiques the current Bitcoin price levels, asserting that the influx of speculators has exacerbated the problem. He thinks that at current Bitcoin price levels, almost all people "willing to buy objectively bad meme coins" have entered the market.The trader also notes the prevailing market sentiment that links the GameStop rally to the meme coin sector. "Bunch of people bought into the GME -> Meme rotation narrative," he states but dismisses the idea as a misguided analogy. This narrative has driven many investors to expect similar explosive growth, which DonAlt sees as unrealistic given current market conditions.In his conclusion, DonAlt highlights the need for either a significant rally in Bitcoin or a massive liquidity injection to rejuvenate the market. "You’d either need BTC to giga print to attract outsiders in or a massive liquidity injection," he suggests.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: This Trader Sees A ‘Barbell Portfolio Of BTC And Memes’ As Most Profitable Trading StrategyThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Synthetic Dollar Slump | Bankless


Fall from Grace. The token of synthetic dollar stablecoin issuer Ethena underwent an impressive post-launch surge, but once the initial rally petered out, ENA found itself caught in a perpetual downtrend! Why has ENA continued to plunge, and what moves is the team making to bolster adoption of its stablecoin? ENA achieved all-time highs in both dollar and BTC-denominated terms on April 11, a mere two days before USDe reached peak supply and broader risk markets took a turn for the worse, seemingly plunging on concerns of elevated conflict in the Middle East.While funding rates on the BTC and ETH perpetual swaps (the predominant source of Ethena’s revenue) cooled significantly coming into April, speculation over the impending second wave of ENA airdrop rewards fueled demand for Ethena assets and allowed yields to remain elevated.This bastion of return support has since crumbled, with fixed yields on USDe swaps from Pendle compressing to 29% from the 100%+ levels seen at the beginning of April.In recent weeks, mounting evidence has begun to suggest that crypto markets may have shifted into a more negative funding rate regime, with funding rates dipping negative for persistence periods of time throughout April and into May.Source: CoinGlassAlthough extremely elevated funding rates as BTC smashed into all-time highs the first two times turbocharged returns on Ethena’s delta-neutral strategy and resulted in an influx of deposits, negative funding rates have begun to eat into yields, reducing the attractiveness of holding USDe and creating concern about future outflows.Due to fact that net negative funding rates would cause the depositors to incur a loss, Ethena established an insurance fund at its inception, which receives a portion of the yield generated and has accrued $39.4M in reserves to safeguard against losses on $2.32B in outstanding USDe liabilities, a meager 1.7% buffer.Today, Ethena announced that it would be reducing the portion of revenues that it retains for the insurance fund from 50% to 20%, allowing returns on sUSDe to nearly double to 37% APY, a change that is expected to last until at least June and coincides with Ethena’s Bybit integration, which will enable users on the CEX to utilize USDe as trading collateral.
Funding rate compression has clearly taken a toll on Ethena, forcing the Protocol to adopt increasingly drastic measures to promote adoption of its dollar-pegged assets. Unfortunately, this most recent action is but a half-measure, providing a fleeting distraction from underlying fundamental issues. Even at a 50% take rate, the Ethena insurance fund was woefully inadequate to compensate depositors for losses from a prolonged period of negative funding rates. Institutional players have begun arbitraging the basis between spot BTC and futures contracts, indicated by the holdings of spot BTC ETF among hedge funds, increasing competitiveness for the types of trades utilized by Ethena and squeezing profit margins.Should crypto truly be transitioning into a more negative funding rate environment, ENA will continue to struggle and it is likely that Ethena will be forced to tap the insurance fund, the depletion of which could spawn a crisis of confidence about the backing of USDe.

                        Thursday, May 16, 2024 – Sponge ($SPONGE), a popular new meme coin that has brought early supporters returns of 10,000%, has launched a social media poll asking the community for direction on how to distribute the project’s lucrative staking rewards.The poll will run from May 16th to May 21st. It asks the Sponge community to decide between accessing the large volume of staking rewards immediately when the claim goes live at the end of May, to lock them for one month, or to vest the reward tokens linearly over either six months or a year.Sponge recently moved from Ethereum to Polygon. As a result, there are three groups eligible to collect tokens through the claim process: those who bought tokens through the presale widget, those who bridged to Polygon before February 5th, and holders who didn’t bridge but who manually moved into a claim contract following a snapshot taken on February 5th after the $SPONGE V1 token was discontinued.Those who held the V1 token on centralized exchanges before its discontinuation had their tokens swapped for the V2 token on Polygon, which also has $SPONGE as its ticker.The team explained the pros and cons of each choice in the poll in a separate X post.Staking rewards are just one reason investors are moving to Sponge in a bid to catch some potentially explosive price action before the presale concludes at the end of May.What’s Different About Meme Coin Sponge?
With global crypto adoption continuing apace, investors are buying up Sponge before it gets listed on major exchanges in the hope that they’ve found the next viral Web3 meme coin.$SPONGE is a unique project that comes with its own staking and video gaming community. In the coming weeks, people can expect two significant milestones: the long-awaited claim of the new Polygon $SPONGE token, and the release of an upcoming Sponge play-to-earn (P2E) gameMeme coins have been rallying and falling harder than most through Bitcoin’s 2024 rebound. The unpredictable price movements on all sides leave the industry wondering if it’s on the verge of another bull run.Any crypto meme project that wants to survive the Darwinistic survival-of-the-fittest pre-adoption market has to offer a little more than just laughs if it’s aiming for longevity.Investors believe $SPONGE is one such speculation. When it launched in May 2023, $SPONGE was priced at $0.000025. In less than a year, it has posted recent highs of $0.002763, or around 10,000% higher!Clearly, early-stage supporters are beginning to care about $SPONGE.$SPONGE’S Voyage So Far
Launched with little-to-no fanfare, $SPONGE V1 won the hearts of investors by offering an alluring ecosystem with lots of opportunities for participants to put their time and money to work to claim staking rewards.Foregoing a traditional prelaunch ICO in favor of direct listing, $SPONGE bounded out the starting gate with a discreet listing on Uniswap, before quickly spreading to centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Poloniex, MEXC, LBank, Gate.io, Toobit, and more.$SPONGE rallied a humbling 4,000% and nearly hit a $100 million market cap less than a week after launch, on May 9th 2023.The token recently upgraded (and migrated) to a V2 on Polygon, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. It is currently $0.001689 in a presale relaunch. This means those that held $SPONGE since the V1 launch, when it was priced at $0.000025, are now in profit by 6756%.Although the move had been in the pipeline since January, a recent liquidity pool attack expedited it.Still, the migration actually furthered the team’s plans by allowing it to deploy a huge early update to the protocol’s staking model and moving forward the still-unconfirmed launch date of the token’s eponymous P2E racing game.$SPONGE’s Mission To Soak Up Value
$SPONGE’s V2 upgrade introduced a couple of key improvements, the foremost of which being a new staking model.This rate yield varies according to the number of stakers and tokens locked up and currently sits at around 335%.Meme coiners expect the number of staked tokens to increase in the coming weeks, particularly as Sponge gains even more traction within the meme sector.That’s because the team hopes to list $SPONGE on some of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges, like Binance and OKX. The move could catalyze further explosive price action as the token becomes more accessible to everyday retail buyers.After claim and potential CEX listings comes the Sponge-themed game, where players can race around Bikini Bottom collecting rewards.With its dual-revenue staking and gaming model, $SPONGE is looking to seriously disrupt low-utility larger market cap rivals like $PEPE, $DOGE and $WIF.Take advantage of this window of opportunity to buy and stake $SPONGE before exchange listings take the project mainstream.Stay updated and join the engaged community of 37,300 followers on X.Buy And Stake SPONGE On The Website
