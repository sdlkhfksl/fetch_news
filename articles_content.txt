EXCLUSIVE: Runes Could Transform Our Understanding Of Bitcoin, Experts Tell Benzinga

With the unveiling of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin BTC/USD is set to make a landmark progression in its technological capabilities, particularly in fungible token issuance. This innovative protocol, created by Casey Rodarmor, is strategically launching in conjunction with the recently concluded Bitcoin Halving event in April, promising to expand Bitcoin’s utility beyond just a store of value.Understanding Runes And Its Operational MechanicsRunes introduces a new token standard that is optimized to reduce the network bloat associated with earlier standards like BRC-20, which congested the network with unnecessary UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). By utilizing a UTXO-based model, Runes ensures that its operations are seamlessly integrated with Bitcoin's existing architecture, improving transaction efficiency and minimizing costs. The protocol employs the OP_RETURN function, allowing for data to be recorded on the blockchain efficiently without impacting transaction outputs, thus facilitating cleaner and more scalable token management.Impact On Bitcoin's Ecosystem And Mining CommunityLennix Lai of OKX Global tells Benzinga that the timely introduction of Runes, which has sparked a surge in transaction activities. This surge is crucial as it mitigates the impact of reduced block rewards from the halving. “Since the launch of our Runes Marketplace, we've seen a significant increase in transactions, which helps compensate miners through higher transaction volumes and fees despite the halving,” Lai explains. This increased activity not only supports the mining community but also bolsters the overall security and robustness of the Bitcoin network.Moreover, the simplicity and efficiency of the Runes protocol are poised to attract a broader range of developers, fostering innovation and potentially increasing the transaction volume and diversity of applications on the Bitcoin blockchain.Darren Franceschini, Co-Founder of Fideum, elaborates on the economic dynamics introduced by Runes, especially concerning Bitcoin’s mining community. Franceschini explains, “Runes enables all sorts of new tokens to be built on Bitcoin. If these tokens become widely used, this would likely lead to a surge in overall transaction volume on the Bitcoin network. As we know, miners get a fee for every transaction they process. So, with more transactions, miners would collect more fees, potentially making up for the decrease in mining rewards.” He uses the analogy of adding new toll roads to an existing highway system to describe how Runes might create new revenue streams for miners, helping to mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards.Also Read: Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETF Debut Records 0.2% Of First-Day US ETF Trading VolumeRunes And The Future Of DeFi On BitcoinEneko Knörr, CEO & Founder of Stabolut, discusses the strategic and functional advancements that Runes introduces to the Bitcoin network. “Runes acts as a bridge, enabling the creation of fungible tokens directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This opens doors for DeFi on Bitcoin, potentially bridging its current gap with Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD in the fungible digital asset arena,” says Knörr. He highlights how Runes’ design addresses limitations of previous token standards by reducing network congestion and elevating transaction efficiency, thus enhancing Bitcoin’s appeal for developing decentralized applications.Post-Halving Outlook And Runes' RoleThe post-halving period is often critical for Bitcoin, with potential implications for its price and market dynamics. The integration of Runes could play a significant role in this phase. The novel applications introduced by Runes could stimulate increased interest and demand for Bitcoin, which, coupled with the decreasing supply due to the halving, might positively influence Bitcoin's price.Furthermore, the introduction of Runes is timed with regulatory advancements such as the acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which could further bolster institutional participation and enhance the overall market stability and growth.Evaluating Bitcoin's Dual Role As A Store of Value And Utility PlatformThe ongoing development within Bitcoin's ecosystem, exemplified by the launch of Runes, is pivotal in shifting perceptions of Bitcoin from solely a store of value to a more versatile platform capable of supporting sophisticated financial applications and systems. This evolution is essential for Bitcoin's long-term relevance and dominance in the cryptocurrency sector.As the Bitcoin community continues to navigate these exciting developments, Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will provide a vital platform for deeper discussions on these topics. Experts will explore the implications of protocols like Runes on Bitcoin’s functionality and its broader impact on the DeFi landscape, offering insights that are crucial for both developers and investors in the digital asset space.Read Next: Consensys Alleges SEC Covertly Targeted Ethereum, Sparking Legal BattleImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Bitcoin Dominance Peaked, Says Analyst, Altcoins to Take Charge? | Coinspeaker



Bitcoin market dominance drops fast as BTC price decreases all the way to $56,500. The Bitcoin demand growth and the whale interest have also been on the decline since March end. 

The world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin has come under strong selling pressure extending its weekly losses to more than 10%. Soon after the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, May 1, Bitcoin (BTC) price tanked another 5% dropping to the lows of $56,500, before bouncing back partially. Popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently stated that the “Bitcoin dominance has already peaked” while it’s time for altcoins to shine. “Altcoins start to wake up in their Bitcoin pairs, which means that the rotation is started,” he added.
Usually, a drop in the Bitcoin market dominance signals market participants that an altcoin market rally is around the corner since investors shift their capital from BTC to altcoins. Considering the huge size of the Bitcoin market cap, the BTC dominance currently in the market stands at around 53.9%. This is after the 1.75% drop in dominance registered over the last week. Despite this, the BTC dominance in the broader crypto market is up over 4.6% since the beginning of 2024.




Several market analysts have pointed out the drop in BTC dominance recently. Crypto trader Matthew Hyland noted a significant loss of support in Bitcoin dominance and expressed the intention to await the weekly close before confirming or negating ‘the breakdown’.
Meanwhile, trading team IncomeSharks observed on May 1 via a post on X that Bitcoin dominance is declining, suggesting potential for altcoins to capitalize if price fluctuations persist for several months. They also highlighted the unexpected resilience of many altcoins on that day.”


On-chain Data Hints at Weakness in Bitcoin, $50,000 Coming?
As said Bitcoin price has faced a severe correction under $60,000 as on-chain data shows weakness in Bitcoin demand growth along with the surge in short positions. This shows that one cannot rule out any further downside in the Bitcoin price from here.
According to CryptoQuant’s report, BTC’s recent decline can be attributed to a reduction in demand, marked by a slowdown in the growth of Bitcoin balances among long-term holders, decreased interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, and a rise in short positions in the futures market.
Data from CryptoQuant indicates that demand from long-term holders, defined as investors who consistently accumulate Bitcoin without selling, decreased by 50% in April. Balances went from over 200,000 BTC in late March to approximately 90,000 BTC.

On the other hand, the demand from Bitcoin whales has also been on a decline since March. CryptoQuant notes: “Bitcoin whale demand growth (purple area) peaked at a monthly growth rate of 12% in late March and has now slowed down to 6%.”
Photo: CryptoQuant
According to renowned analyst Scott Melker, the BTC price is unlikely to drop below $52,000 in the short term. Melker noted that despite the correction, which he considers relatively minor for a bull market, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has not yet reached oversold levels.
“This is still only a 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pullback during this bull market, like those of the past,” he said.

BTC Went on a Rollercoaster After Fed's Announcement, Altcoins' Recovery Begins (Market Watch)


																After several days of nosediving, bitcoin’s price soared by roughly two grand after the Fed’s refusal to increase the interest rates but dropped back down just as quickly.
The altcoins are in much better shape today, with numerous impressive gains from the likes of Solana, Ripple, Polkadot, ICP, PEPE, and others.
Bitcoin’s Volatility Continues
It was just a couple of days ago when the primary cryptocurrency was trading firmly above $60,000 and was even about to challenge the $65,000 level. That happened in the early Asian trading hours of April 30.
However, it failed to breach that level and started to lose value gradually amid large outflows of US ETFs and the disappointing debut of the Hong Kong-based ones. The landscape worsened on Wednesday as bitcoin slumped further to a two-month low of $56,500, leaving more than $500 million in liquidations.
All eyes were then on the US Federal Reserve in anticipation of its decision regarding the interest rates. As the US central bank said there will be no upcoming hike, BTC’s price jumped by two grand and neared $60,000.

However, it failed to maintain its recovery and dropped back down to its starting position. As of now, BTC stands close to $58,000, with its market cap up to $1.140 trillion. Nevertheless, its dominance over the alts has taken a major hit and is down to 50%.
Bitcoin/Price/Chart. 02.05.2024 Source: TradingView
Relief for Altcoins
The alternative coins suffered just as badly, if not worse, than bitcoin in the past few days, but most have reacted better with more impressive gains now.
Solana is among the top performers on a daily scale. SOL is up by 11.5% and trades above $130. PEPE has soared by 16%, while SHIB, DOT, ADA, XRP, AVAX, MATIC, and ICP follow suit with increases of somewhere between 6% and 12%.
The total crypto market cap has managed to regain around $50 billion from yesterday’s low. As such, the metric has neared $2.3 trillion on CG.

Indian enforcement agency collaborates with Binance to bust scam app

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) — an Indian law enforcement agency — seized 90 crores ($10.5 million) from an online scam app called E-Nuggets with the help of crypto exchanges such as Binance, ZebPay and WazirX.According to a report published by the Hindu, the online gaming app E-Nugget had cryptocurrencies worth $10 million stored in 70 different crypto wallet accounts spread across the three crypto exchanges. The ED contacted these exchanges to block the wallet addresses and transfer the crypto assets to the agency’s wallet.Source: Enforcement Directorate In its report, the ED alleged that the E-Nugget app purportedly offered customers large returns on investment while disguising itself as a gaming platform. The app presented a lucrative investment opportunity with several alluring real-money games that offered large commissions and were designed for users to wager on. However, as soon as money was invested, the app went dark, leaving investors stuck and unable to get their money back. Related: Australia’s top exchange may approve spot Bitcoin ETFs this year: ReportThe agency has attached and seized properties valued at over 163 crores ($19.5 million), including cash, cryptocurrency, account balances and office space.The scam app first came under the radar in 2022 when some of the funds from the company were invested in digital assets. The ED investigation found 2,500 dummy bank accounts 19 crores ($2.2 million) worth of cash was found. The suspected scheme mastermind, Aamir Khan, was arrested along with his accomplice Romen Agarwal and is currently in custody.Since the money was being transferred using digital assets, the law enforcement agencies managed to trace it and subsequently freeze and seize it.Although critics often try to point toward the use of cryptocurrency for money laundering, the nature of the blockchain makes it very difficult to launder the funds once identified. In numerous instances, crypto exchanges have traced and frozen funds linked to criminal activities. The most prominent example of transparency and why it is difficult to launder funds using digital assets dates back to the 2016 Bitfinex hack. Hackers managed to steal 119,756 Bitcoin (BTC) from the crypto exchange. However, the perpetrators behind the exploit were eventually caught and arrested in 2022 while trying to launder the funds.Cointelegraph reached out to Binance and ZebPay for comments but had not received a response by the time of publication.Magazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto

Polkadot Launches JAM Combining Elements of Polkadot & Ethereum


							

Michael van de Poppe acknowledges Polkadot as a promising Layer 1 Blockchain outside Ethereum.



Polkadot Founder Gavin Wood recently released JAM Graypaper, introducing the next generation of Polkadot.



JAM intends to bring Polkadot’s capabilities beyond the existing limitations of Web3.




Prominent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe acknowledged Polkadot as a “promising Layer 1 Blockchain outside of Ethereum.” In his recent X post, van de Poppe shared insights on Polkadot’s journey from 2016, when Founder Gavin Wood released the Polkadot Whitepaper, till 2024, when he released the JAM Graypaper.







At Token 2048 Dubai, Gavin Wood shed light on the next generation of Polkadot that envisions revolutionizing the future of Web3. As per an official post released by Polkadot, the network aims to “provide the speed, scale, full decentralization, and ease of use needed to drive forward deep innovation across not just Web3, but the entire tech landscape.”



The principal part of the development is JAM, Polkadot chain’s new version, which intends to expand the network’s capabilities beyond Web3’s limitations. In addition, JAM is expected to bring groundbreaking scalability to the network.









Providing more insights into the matter, Wood released a technical Graypaper. In the JAM Graypaper, Wood introduced the basic concept of JAM, stating




“We present a comprehensive and formal definition of JAM, a protocol combining elements of both Polkadot and Ethereum. In a single coherent model, Jam provides a global singleton permissionless object environment…paired with secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network, a proposition pioneered by Polkadot.”




Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT) has managed to escape the bearish track, showing a notable surge of 6.12% in the last 24 hours. However, DOT, currently trading at $6.88, has marked a significant decline of 21% in one month and a marginal decline of 1.04% in one week.

DeFi Lending Platform Aave Reveals V4 Protocol Upgrade Plans | Coinspeaker



With all the upgrades that the proposal suggests, a notable part focused on growing the protocol’s algorithmic stablecoin GHO.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave Labs has recently shared what it says is its roadmap for the next five years. According to the firm’s proposal, it seeks to upgrade its protocol to the next-generation version 4 but would love to get community feedback on the proposed venture. However, Aave also noted that the V4 upgrade is only a part of a grander plan for the Aave 2030 grant proposal.
Aave V4: The Proposal
Aave Labs’ proposal, which aims at the complete overhaul of the protocol, will include “major upgrades and expansions” to the Aave Network, says the team. These changes will see the network add a cross-chain liquidity layer, deploy non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer-1, while also putting on a “fresh new visual identity”.




The team also noted that the Aave V4 upgrade would be featured on an entirely new architecture from the one featured on the previous three versions. However, for a more seamless integration of features such as its native stablecoin GHO, isolation pools, and RWA modules, the upgrade will also add a “Unified Liquidity Layer”.
Another part of the proposal mentions an automated interest rate feature that can adjust based on market conditions. In line with this, Aave says it is actively working with Chainlink to “define a clear set of data feeds”. Then the team also suggested Liquidity Premiums that factors in a borrowers collateral composition and adjusts their borrowing costs in kind.
Hopes for GHO
With all the upgrades that the proposal suggests, a notable part focused on growing the protocol’s algorithmic stablecoin GHO. Since launching in July 2023, the GHO stablecoin has found it really hard competing with the likes of Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). At least, so does its relatively low market capitalization of $49 million suggest.
To this end, the Aave V4 upgrade proposal floated the idea of improving the liquidation engine, such as variable liquidation bonuses and “soft” liquidations. It also hints at adding options to earn interest to boost GHO.
Furthermore, the big upgrade proposes a quick redemption mechanism in the event that GHO depegs. Although the proposal is still new, gathering feedback is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2024. That will then be followed by an on-chain vote. All things being equal, the team expects to roll out the full Aave V4 by mid-2025.
Aave remains the third largest DeFi protocol with a total value locked (TVL) of around $10 billion, per DefiLlama’s data.

Ripple v. SEC court case update as of May 2, 2024


With the cryptocurrency sector at the edge of its seat regarding the final outcome of the courtroom standoff between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple, the regulator has filed its opposition to the blockchain company’s Motion to Strike its new expert materials.
Indeed, after Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn set the schedule for the two sides to argue the use of the SEC’s expert materials, the securities watchdog has filed its opposition to Ripple’s reasoning, according to the X posts by defense attorney and popular commentator on the case, James K. Filan on April 29.

‘Not an expert testimony’
Specifically, the SEC’s legal team’s five-page explanation as to why the court should deny Ripple’s Motion to Strike asserts that the declaration by summary witness Andrea Fox did not constitute undisclosed expert testimony as the blockchain firm argued, stressing that:



“It is not an expert’s report, does not rely on specialized experience, and does not render any opinions at all, let alone an ‘expert ‘ one. Nor does it present the testimony of a percipient witness. Rather, it applies basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records to streamline the presentation of the evidence to Judge Torres.”

Furthermore, the agency highlighted that Judge Analisa Torres had previously already allowed and cited in the summary judgment another SEC summary witness declaration “over Ripple’s identical objection that it constituted an expert report,” referring to the testimony by the SEC’s accountant Christopher Ferrante.
Finally, the securities regulator pointed out that the “Court’s remedies discovery order did not require disclosure of summary witnesses before remedies briefing,” which means that the “SEC did not violate any rule or order by submitting a summary witness declaration,” therefore “Ripple can claim no surprise or prejudice here.”
Recent Ripple SEC news
As a reminder, Ripple had earlier filed a Motion to Strike the SEC’s new witness materials, arguing that Fox’s declaration represents ill-timed “sandbagging,” as well as opposing the $2 billion in damages over institutional XRP sales and arguing that the regulator has failed to prove reckless disregard for the law. 
Afterward, Judge Netburn gave the SEC until April 29, 2024, to file its response to Ripple’s motion, after which the crypto company had three business days to file a response according to the deadline that will be due soon, as per the information that Finbold reported on April 26.
Meanwhile, XRP, the token at the center of the prolonged court case, was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.51331, which suggests an increase of 6.55% on the day, as it moves to reverse the 2.17% loss from across the week and the 13.75% decline from its monthly chart, as per data on May 2.

LayerZero cross-chain interoperability protocol completes first airdrop snapshot

LayerZero, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, is preparing to launch its long-awaited airdrop for users.LayerZero has completed the first snapshot for its upcoming airdrop on May 2, according to an X post by LayerZero Labs that promised followers “more information coming soon.”Source: LayerZero LabsAirdrops are widely employed by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to create more traction by rewarding early users with newly issued cryptocurrencies.LayerZero’s ZRO was the first Hyperp (Hyperliquid-only perp) that launched on HyperLiquid perpetual futures decentralized exchange (DEX) back in September 2023. The ZRO Hyperp trading at $8.3 could imply a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of around $17 billion, according to Xulian, the pseudonymous core contributor of Hyperiquid, in a May 2 X post.Hyperps trade similarly to perpetual futures contracts but do not require an underlying spot or index oracle price. Hyperliquid is the world’s largest perpetual futures DEX by trading volume and Open Interest.Related: Tether nets record $4.5B profit in Q1 2024 — majority from Bitcoin and goldWhile LayerZero Labs shared no additional details about the airdrop, it previously teased that it is preparing for a token launch in early 2024, according to a Dec. 7, 2023, X post:“LayerZero has always been built with the ability to have a native token within the protocol, as can be seen in the immutable code launched on day 1… We’ll state now in no uncertain terms that there will be a LayerZero token. Its distribution is something we’re committed to getting right and expect it to happen within the first half of 2024.”Are airdrops harming DeFi protocols long term?While airdrops aim to create more protocol usage by rewarding early adopters, it’s not always the users taking the lion’s share of the rewards.Crypto airdrops are often riddled with professional airdrop hunters (or squatters) that farm the same airdrop with multiple cryptocurrency wallets with no intention of using the protocol in the long term and market selling the rewards after claiming.In February, pseudonymous Yearn.finance developer Banteg warned that Starknet’s airdrop eligibility list mainly included airdrop squatters. Approximately 701,544 of the 1.3 million eligible wallet addresses were allegedly linked to repeat or renamed GitHub accounts controlled by airdrop squatters.On May 1, Chinese police captured the StarkNet airdrop identity forger, who assumed other users’ identities, claimed over 40,000 STRK tokens on their behalf, and converted it to around $91,000 worth of Tether (USDT).In March 2023, it was revealed that airdrop hunters consolidated $3.3 million worth of tokens from the then Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets they had controlled.Airdrop squatters tend to sell their compounded rewards as soon as they receive the tokens, which usually results in a sharp decline in the newly airdropped token’s value.VIDEOSolana: Expectation Versus Reality.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Creator Pours Cold Water on SocialFi


In a recent exchange on social media, Dogecoin creator Billy Markus, also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, doused the fervor surrounding SocialFi with a splash of realism. Responding to a post touting SocialFi as the pinnacle of crypto innovation, Markus expressed a pragmatic viewpoint, stating, "I find it interesting when I get money from it and extremely uninteresting otherwise."The term "SocialFi" refers to the convergence of decentralized finance and social networking platforms, promising a revolution in how users engage and transact online. However, Markus's candid response underscores the practical concerns that often accompany such ambitious projects. While some visionaries like Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, advocate for the potential of decentralized social networks like Farcaster, Markus's perspective reflects a more cautious outlook. His assertion hints at the necessity for tangible utility and financial incentive to sustain interest in these emerging platforms.Communications & Social Media Sector by CoinMarketCapDespite the buzz surrounding SocialFi, its current market valuation stands at just over $1.33 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, industry analysts anticipate a potential upheaval in valuation as projects like friend.tech gear up for token launches. The imminent distribution of the FRIEND token, expected to exceed a billion dollars, signals a pivotal moment for the SocialFi landscape.Markus's pragmatic stance serves as a reality check for enthusiasts swept up in the hype surrounding SocialFi. While the concept holds promise, its long-term viability hinges on factors beyond just novelty.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Decline, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Advancements, Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions: Bits Recap May 2


																TL;DR

Bitcoin (BTC) experienced another sharp decline, falling to a multi-month low of approximately $56,600.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw its price fall by 13% over the week, despite advancements in its ecosystem and a significant increase in its token burn rate, aimed at reducing supply.
Ripple’s XRP maintained relative stability in a turbulent market, with analysts predicting substantial future price increases based on strong technical signals.


BTC Price Swings
The cryptocurrency market flashed red in the past several days, with vitcoin (BTC) among the heavily affected assets. Its price briefly surged to over $67,000 shortly after the halving but headed south towards the end of April.
It plummeted below the $60K mark on May 1, with the freefall eventually leading to a multi-month low of approximately $56,600 (per CoinGecko’s data).
The bulls witnessed a dose of optimism several hours ago when BTC reclaimed some lost ground, jumping to $58,500. This happened right after the US Federal Reserve announced no additional interest rate hikes at its latest FOMC meeting.




However, the bullish momentum was short-lived, and BTC dipped once again to its current level of around $57,500.
Despite the somewhat grim reality, there are numerous factors indicating that the trends may change soon. Such examples are BTC’s negative exchange netflow in the past week, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric which has experienced a downfall, and the rising open interest (OI) weighted funding rate.
Perhaps the most obvious element hinting that a BTC bull run is still in the cards is the halving that took place last month. Historically, the event has been a precursor of a major resurgence for the asset and the entire cryptocurrency market. Those willing to learn more about its specifics, please take a look at our dedicated video below:
VIDEO
SHIB Developments 
The second-largest meme coin by market capitalization has also underperformed as of late, with its price tumbling by 13% on a weekly scale. On the other hand, it witnessed multiple advancements related to its ecosystem.
As CryptoPotato reported, the SHIB burn rate soared by 90% on May 1, whereas the destroyed assets throughout April equaled almost 1.7 billion. The program’s ultimate goal is to reduce the circulating supply of the meme coin, making it scarcer and potentially more valuable in time.
Shibarium also made the headlines. The layer-2 scaling solution experienced an important upgrade last week and is scheduled to undergo another one today (May 2).
XRP Forecasts
Despite briefly falling below the $0.50 level, Ripple’s XRP remained rather steady during the latest market turbulence. In fact, its price is slightly in the green today and up 3% on a two-week scale.
Numerous analysts believe the asset’s best days are yet to come, envisioning wild targets for the following months. The X user Dark Defender claimed XRP could explode to $5.85 and eventually to a whopping $18.22 as long as it trades above the two major support levels – $0.46 and $0.39.
EGRAG CRYPTO outlined a bullish prediction, too, based on the token’s latest weekly candles that have not dropped below a certain resistance zone.
“Remarkably, not even the body of the weekly candles is closing below the arc, which is incredibly bullish! XRP Army, STAY STEADY! The XRP bulls are showing remarkable resilience, strength, and power in this battle,” the analyst concluded.

Riot Platforms Q1 Earnings Surge as the Stock Price Drops


Riot Platforms, a US-based Bitcoin mining company, recently unveiled a remarkable financial performance for the first quarter 2024. The company announced total revenues of $79.3 million, a noticeable uptick from $73.2 million during the same period last year.
Riot also reported a net income of $211.8 million, earnings per share of $0.82, and $245.7 million in adjusted EBITDA—new highs for the company’s quarterly financial performance. A significant 131% rise in Bitcoin prices, compared to the same three-month period in 2023, largely accounts for this increase.
Bitcoin Price Surge Drives Record-Breaking Quarter for Riot Platforms
Riot’s report revealed that it secured $5.1 million in power curtailment credits. The number is a boost from $3.1 million last year, demonstrating adept management of operational efficiencies.
The Bitcoin Mining segment alone brought in $74.6 million. The number is significantly higher than last year’s $48.0 million, driven by the favorable Bitcoin pricing environment. Conversely, the Engineering segment declined, generating $4.7 million compared to $16.1 million in the previous year.
Riot maintains a robust financial position with $692.5 million in working capital. It also reported $688.5 million in cash and 8,490 unencumbered Bitcoin valued at approximately $605.6 million as of March 31, 2024.
Additionally, the energization of the Corsicana Facility substation was a significant development in the quarter. The facility is slated to be the world’s largest Bitcoin mining facility upon full development.

Besides the Corsicana Facility, Riot also expects its previous purchase from MicroBT in June 2023 to enhance self-mining hash rate capacity. The deployment of these miners has begun and is projected to conclude by the second half of 2025.

“We remain on track to increase our self-mining hash rate capacity to 31 EH/s by the end of the year, which will nearly triple our existing hash rate capacity. With up to 1 GW of total capacity when fully developed, the Corsicana Facility … gives us a strong foundation upon which we will continue scaling our Bitcoin mining business in the future,” Jason Les, Riot Platform’s CEO, stated.

However, Riot experienced a reduction in its Bitcoin production. Riot mined 1,364 Bitcoins in the first quarter, marking a 36% decrease from the 2,115 Bitcoins produced in Q1 2023.
The downturn in production can be traced back to the soaring Bitcoin network difficulty, which has more than doubled since January 2023. This presents a formidable challenge for miners.
Furthermore, the average cost to mine a single Bitcoin soared to $23,034, dramatically increasing from $9,438 in the previous year. This surge reflects the 89% increase in the global network hash rate over the same period. At the same time, it also presents the escalating operational challenges in the mining industry.

Indeed, the mining sector remains fraught with challenges. The escalating electricity costs and the impending reduction in Bitcoin supply due to the halving event could squeeze operational margins. Regarding the current Bitcoin production cost, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Fund, shared his perspectives.

“This means 1 of 3 things happens now: 1. Price skyrockets, 2. ~15% of miners shut down, 3. Transaction fees remain a lot higher on average,” Edwards wrote while admitting he is “expecting a bit of all three.”

In response to the latest outlook, analysts see some miners might diversify their business into emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts consider this shift a strategic move to mitigate the risks of the volatile crypto market while leveraging their computational power beyond crypto mining.
However, a January 2024 study by CoinShares suggests that miners with substantial Bitcoin reserves and robust capitalization are better positioned in bullish markets. In contrast, those with limited cash reserves and high operational costs per Bitcoin face heightened risks.

Riot’s strong performance in Q1 has yet to affect the company’s stock price positively. The stock price has decreased by 11.77% over the past five days.

Bitcoin dumps 'bull market excess' as daily ETF outflows pass $500M

Bitcoin (BTC) did not see a “massive futures margin call” as BTC price action plumbed two-month lows, analysis says.In a thread on X (formerly Twitter) on May 2, Checkmate, the lead on-chain analyst at blockchain data firm Glassnode, revealed a key change in the Bitcoin bull market.Analysis: Derivatives not "dominant" in BTC price sell-offBitcoin may have shocked some with its move to $56,500 on May 1, but in broader terms, this bull market pullback appears cathartic for market health.As Checkmate shows, a gradual “de-leveraging” across Bitcoin futures has been ongoing since Bitcoin’s latest all-time highs in mid-March. This, he argues, is putting an end to “bull market excess.”“For those of you around in the 2021 Bitcoin bull market, you will remember the massive derivatives led deleveraging events which killed it,” part of one post stated.“Are we seeing a derivatives led flush out today? I don’t think so.”An accompanying chart compared the comedown from Bitcoin’s trip to $58,000 during Q1 2021.BTC/USD chart with funding rates data. Source: Checkmate/XCheckmate referenced continued flat funding rates across derivatives as a clear distinguishing factor between the market now and three years ago.“Funding rates have cooled off gradually, not violently, which is very healthy to see. It suggests we didn't see a massive futures margin call yesterday,” he wrote.With that, attention turned to other sources for the latest BTC price cascade downward — one which at the time of writing had failed to recover much beyond the lows.“Futures markets also saw two statistically significant deleveraging events prior to this sell-off,” the thread noted alongside a chart of the 7-day change in Bitcoin futures open interest levels. “We did hit two overheated points on the rally into the $73k ATH, but it cooled off quickly. Again, doesn't feel like derivatives were the dominant factor in this Bitcoin sell-off.”Bitcoin futures open interest 7-day change chart.

                        The TOKEN2049 conference in Dubai saw numerous builders, traders, investors, and curious TradFi folks in attendance.What’s more, many renowned and wealthy locals were there, eager to learn about and invest in crypto.Cryptonews was there for the second day as well, talking to industry insiders about decentralized AI, DePIN, RWAs, and incoming regulations.The attendees discussed the crypto market branching off into two streams, as well as tokenizing trade, uniting Layer 2s, resolving network congestion, and much more. There were also plenty of impressive shows happening all around the event. Like this fire show for example:An impressive performance during TOKEN2049. Source: CryptonewsDuring the second day of TOKEN2049, Cryptonews Podcast host Matt Zahab talked to:
Alizee Carli, Director of Ecosystem, Casper Association
Jesper Johansen, Founder and CEO, Northstake
Scott Lawin, Co-founder CEO, Candy Digital
Yuri Yurchenko, Chief Product Officer, Neon EVM
John Lilic, Executive Director, Telos Foundation
Sam MacPherson, Co-founder, CEO Phoenix Labs
Karel Kubat, Founder, Union
Alex Goh, Founder and Chairman, EMC Foundation
Thomas Messerer, CEO, Silencio Network
Veronica Wong, Co-founder and CEO, SafePal.
You can find each interview on the links above to watch, and you can read what these industry insiders exclusively told Matt below.Casper-IBM Governance Tool MVP Coming Soon
Alizee Carli, Director of Ecosystem at Casper Association, the team behind the Casper blockchain, remarked that all interactions will AI will have to be fully auditable by 2025 to comply with the incoming EU regulations.Blockchain is an excellent solution for that.Therefore, Casper Labs and IBM are working together on a governance tool, and the MVP will be launched in the third quarter of this year.Meanwhile, the Association’s ” big focus ” is real-world asset tokenization (RWAs).They want to expand tokenization, particularly with cash, cash equivalents, and other financial products.The team has spent the last 18 months bringing RWA tokenization protocols on Casper, including a native stablecoin launching in May.VIDEOCrypto Market Cap ‘Splitting in Two’
Speaking of RWAs, some are also turning to tokenizing staking.This is a way to tokenize validator node infrastructure, said Jesper Johansen, CEO of regulated custodial staking provider Northstake, which pioneered this method.This means that it can be traded in the secondary market.A key point here is that this is not a derivative, which is especially relevant from a regulatory perspective, Johansen said.This is a way for the company to increase capital efficiency in regulated funds such as ETFs.He said that, in connection with that, the crypto market cap is splitting into two currents now: the permisionless, decentralized crypto on the one hand and the regulated crypto on the other.Northstake has recently launched a pilot with 3iQ, CoinFund, and CoinDesk Indice, while the mainnet is expected later this year.Tokenizing Trade at TOKEN2049
Commenting on the DeFi developments and expectations, Sam MacPherson, CEO of research and development shop Phoenix Labs, noted that one of the biggest recent events has been the launch of Ethena.Furthermore, Maker is “LPing into Ethena at a large scale.”This has resulted in a tokenized cash-and-carry trade, which is a significant new development in the RWA space.VIDEOBanking Crypto
Veronica Wong, Co-Founder of SafePal, a non-custodial wallet serving more than 12 million users, said that the company is in the process of making new partnerships, as well as focusing more on the Asia-Pacific market.SafePal recently launched a completely compliant, smooth, crypto-friendly on- and off-ramp in cooperation with Swiss bank Fiat24.This allows users to open a Swiss bank account within 10 minutes and top up using crypto or fiat, paired with a Visa card to allow spending and transfer.This has solved “a lot of pain points” for users, Wong said.‘No’ to Network Congestions
According to Yuri Yurchenko, Chief Product Officer at Neon EVM, the only EVM on Solana, applications can benefit from this team’s product in various ways.A major one is parallel execution, solving the issue of congestion for applications.The users benefit the same way, Yurchenko said. No matter what they do, be it trading on DEXes or interacting with games, they will not be disturbed by network congestion.VIDEOEntering Web3 Through Games, NFTs, and Digital Engagement at TOKEN2049
Scott Lawin, CEO of Web3 fan engagement platform Candy Digital, told us that the team is entering the gaming space and will launch a mobile game globally this summer.The big focus there is not just on NFTs as collectibles or speculative assets but on their utility and ability to be used in different ways.Just recently, the team announced the partnership with the game-developing giant Kakao Games.Furthermore, Candy uses ticketing and NFTs to onboard people to Web3. The company’s aim has been to make this process easy.Additionally, through sports partnerships, Candy has enabled fans to get rewarded for these digital engagements. This brings people into Web3 and builds a loyalty program at the same time, Lawim said.Moving from Frankenstein ZK
John Lilic, Executive Director at Telos Foundation, said that Telos initiated the development of a hardware-accelerated zkEVM Layer 2 (L2) network in collaboration with Ponos Technology.“A lot of the ZK stuff right now is kind of slow. It’s a little bit of a patchwork of Frankenstein components. [There are many] compromises because it’s very, very hard to make this stuff work.”And because ZK is so difficult to have working efficiently, it’s key to think about both hardware and software sides from the start – it’s a more “holistic approach.”Telos is focused on the hardware part because this “can help inform the way you build your software.”That way, the hardware can accelerate the software.VIDEOUniting the Layers
Karel Kubat, the founder of the modular interoperability layer Union, argued that we are entering an era of thousands of L2s.These need to be connected, he said, but in a decentralized and trustless manner so that they can hyperscale.This is what Union does.Also, they’ve announced a partnership with Polygon, joining hands to keep UX coherent by unifying and aggregating all of these different layers together.Decentralized AI at TOKEN2049
Alex Goh, the founder of the EMC Foundation, said that this team’s goal is to integrate AI with Web3 technology.Among other things, the team is working on decentralized AI, RWA, and GPU-based DePin (decentralized physical infrastructure network).One of the foundation’s visions is that everyone should be able to participate in building AI—it shouldn’t be run by a single entity.“We’re envisioning an open-source, large model [that] can be run in a decentralized fashion followed by a set of GPUs” that are distributed and run by GPU-as-a-service provider, “and they all come together to power the application of decentralized AI.”VIDEODePIN Excels at Creating Value
Thomas Messerer, CEO of Silencio Network, is envisioning a future where a billion people will be using their product in a way they’re using weather apps, for example.The reason the team chose the DePIN route to accomplish their goal is because it “excels at creating value.”Compared to Web2 counterparts, said Messerer, Silencio is providing more value and growing “20x faster.”Additionally, the DePIN model creates communities that accompany this vision, enabling the team to crowdsource data – “mapping out a size of Paris on a daily basis.”Notably, the app has about a 75% retention rate on a monthly basis.

Bitcoin halving sees Bitfarms’ BTC mining earnings plummet

The impact of the fourth Bitcoin halving has led Bitfarms to report its lowest monthly earnings in over two years.The mining firm earned 269 Bitcoin (BTC) in mining rewards and transaction fees in April 2024. The company is undergoing a $240 million upgrade for its Bitcoin mining equipment in an effort to remain profitable amid permanently reduced rewards.Bitfarms monthly BTC earnings in 2022 and 2023. Source: BitfarmsOnce the upgrade — which involves the acquisition of 88,000 highly efficient Bitcoin miners — is completed, Bitfarms will triple its current hash rate capacity to 21 exahashes per second (EH/s). Bitfarms’ April production update shows that the company improved its corporate energy efficiency by 9% to 31 watts per terahash (w/TH).In addition to its 269 BTC monthly earnings (roughly $15.5 million), Bitfarms expects a $23.7 million value-added tax (VAT) refund from Canada. Sharing an update on its fleet upgrade, Bitfarms chief mining officer Ben Gagnon said:“In April, we fully upgraded two farms in Québec (Canada) with Bitmain T21 miners, improving energy efficiency by 51% at those farms and 9% on a company-wide basis.”The Bitcoin halving resulted in a 5.9% increase in network difficulty compared to March, further impacting the earnings of all miners. For Bitfarms, ongoing turbine maintenance in Argentina further temporarily lowered its monthly mining capacity.Related: Arkansas bills reining in crypto miners head for governor approvalThe April earnings of 269 BTC for Bitfarms were 6% lower than the previous month and 29% lower year-over-year.Considering that Bitfarms earned 9 BTC per day, its daily earnings amounted to roughly $551,700, based on a BTC price of $61,300 on April 30, 2024.In the first three months of 2024, Bitfarms earned 357 BTC, 300 BTC and 286 BTC, respectively. Additionally, Bitfarms’ treasury increased its Bitcoin holdings from 806 BTC to 830 BTC in April. Check out Cointelegraph’s beginner’s guide to learn more about Bitcoin mining.Magazine: Memecoins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Bitcoin post-halving price consolidation could last 2 months - Bitfinex

According to analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, Bitcoin could experience up to two months of price consolidation following the halving.The latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha market report notes that Bitcoin (BTC) could continue to be the price action benchmark for the crypto market in May and the leading indicator for the entire cryptocurrency market cap.According to the report, the macroeconomic environment is more resilient than in previous years and the likelihood of rate cuts remains low in the short term. Furthermore, the analysts said that general consumers and businesses are “better prepared and informed” about the state of the underlying economy when compared to previous crypto market cycles:"Consequently, we believe we could see a 1-2 month consolidation in Bitcoin prices, trading in a range with swings of $10,000 on either side.”The report adds that any positive impact on Bitcoin’s price following the halving, which has reduced the supply of new BTC to the market, will be seen in later months.“At this point, the economy is also expected to be performing better, having achieved a soft landing and avoiding a recession, providing further impetus to crypto assets,” the analysts wrote.Related: The reasons Bitcoin price is down 11% since the halvingVarious cryptocurrency traders are offering similar views on Bitcoin’s recent consolidation from its all-time highs over a month ago. Michaël van de Poppe, founder of trading firm MNTrading, suggests that Bitcoin’s dominance may have peaked as traders begin to shift liquidity to altcoins. Crypto trader Matthew Hyland echoed this, highlighting that Bitcoin market dominance is losing major support.The Bitfinex Alpha report also dived into technical details of Bitcoin’s dropping market dominance. It notes that Bitcoin halvings historically see attention shift toward altcoins which rally and gain market share. Bitcoin’s dominance chart over the past month. Source: TradingView“This shift occurs as Bitcoin’s reduced supply growth rate is seen as a long-term bullish development, which increases investor risk appetite, leading investors to seek potentially higher returns from alternative cryptocurrencies,” the report states.Related: Bitcoin 4% dip may ‘panic’ short-term holders as price falls below average costEther’s (ETH) recent market performance has seen it outperform Bitcoin in gains for two consecutive weeks, a metric which last occurred in February 2023. Bitfinex analysts add that a 7.5% increase in the ETH/BTC metric marks ETH’s strongest weekly gain against Bitcoin since the start of the year.The report also highlights Ether’s long-term role as a proxy for the altcoin market, making it a historical first mover before other altcoins catch up in terms of market trends. Checkmate, the lead on-chain analyst at blockchain data firm Glassnode, also commented on Bitcoin’s recent consolidation. He explained that a gradual “de-leveraging” across Bitcoin futures has been ongoing since Bitcoin’s latest all-time highs in mid-March.Magazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto

Ethereum dips, but demand rises: What's driving investors to ETH? - AMBCrypto



ETH saw the biggest 2-day stretch of network expansion since October 2022.
The addresses holding between 0 and 0.1 units of ETH increased significantly.

Ethereum [ETH] continued to fall freely, sinking below $3,000 in the last 24 hours following a 3% drop, data from CoinMarketCap showed. The second-largest cryptocurrency was trading at $2,914 at press time, reflecting a 13.34% discount over the month.
The negative price action, however, did not appear to limit demand for the asset.
Unfazed users continue to snap ETH
According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Ethereum saw a sharp increase in new users joining the network. About 266.6k new wallets were created on the 28th of April and 29th, the biggest 2-day stretch of network expansion since October 2022.
Source: Santiment
Network expansion is one of the primary measures for determining if a cryptocurrency is gaining or losing traction. The onboarding of new users indicated confidence in ETH’s long-term potential, ignoring short-term blips.
Retail users enter ETH market
On further scrutiny, it came to light that retail users were jumping on the bandwagon. The addresses holding between 0 and 0.1 units of ETH increased significantly while the prices plunged, as per AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data.
Source: Santiment
Interestingly, the cohorts holding more than 1 ETH were selling off, as evident in the drop in their ETH reserves.
Source: Santiment
The aforementioned findings suggested that retail interest was strong for ETH and healthy inflows from this segment could contribute to a relief rally in the days ahead.

Is staking the driving force?
Many of these retail customers buying ETH might be lured by the yields offered by ETH staking services.
The total ETH staked soared to 44.24 million as of this writing, forming 36% of ETH’s total circulating supply, AMBCrypto noted using Glassnode data.
At the same time, the supply of ETH on exchanges continued to shrink, falling to 12.79 million as of this writing, about 10% of total ETH coins in circulation.

Aave Labs Unveils Plans to Upgrade its Protocol to Version 4


							

Aave Labs has unveiled plans to upgrade its protocol from V3 to V4.



The Aave V4 roadmap is part of a wider “Aave 2030 grant” proposal.



The timeline for the Aave V4 development is scheduled to run from Q2 2024 until mid-2025.




Aave Labs, the blockchain firm behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave, has unveiled plans to upgrade its protocol. The proposed upgrade would lead to the launch of Aave V4, with a new architecture that would introduce novel capabilities to the protocol.



According to the firm’s announcement, Aave V4 would enhance modularity, reduce governance overhead, optimize capital efficiency, and integrate innovations such as the Aave-native stablecoin GHO more seamlessly. 



Although the Aave V4 roadmap is in an advanced research stage, the blockchain firm proposes to develop it as part of a wider “Aave 2030 grant” proposal. Aave is adopting a transparent model of development involving the project’s community throughout the feedback and testing phases.



Meanwhile, Aave Labs has scheduled a timeline for the Aave V4 development to run from Q2 2024 until mid-2025 when it fully releases the protocol. According to Aave Labs, it will act as the technical contributor, while the Aave DAO will deploy all code bases made available by Aave Labs and other contributors.









In a recent post on X, the blockchain firm classified Aave V4 as a significant advancement in DeFi. According to the post, the upgrade will establish new frontiers, including capital efficiency, risk management, and scalability. The Aave V4 development is coming about two years after launching the current iteration, Aave V3, on several networks. The current version went live on the Ethereum mainnet in early 2023.



Aave Labs considers its project the largest DeFi protocol, excluding (re)staking. It noted that the protocol has experienced considerable growth in both user base and total value locked (TVL) since it launched in 2022. As of Aave Labs’ announcement, Aave had an average market size of $17 billion and was available on over twelve networks.

Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs not enough to absorb US ETF selling pressure

The inflows from the recently launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong are not enough to cover the outflows from the 11 United States-based spot Bitcoin ETFs.So far, the Hong Kong ETFs saw $217 million worth of net inflows this week, according to a May 2 X post by James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares.The inflows are less than the $298 million worth of net outflows generated by the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs this week, according to Dune.Flows by exchange country. Source: James ButterfillInstitutional inflows from ETFs were a significant part of the current Bitcoin rally to new all-time highs. By Feb. 15, Bitcoin ETFs accounted for about 75% of new investment in the world’s largest cryptocurrency as it surpassed the $50,000 mark, according to CryptoQuant research.Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund accounted for the majority of May 1 outflows, selling over $191 million worth of Bitcoin. Grayscale’s ETF accounted for the second-largest daily outflows of $167.4 million worth of BTC on May 1, according to Farside data.Bitcoin ETF flow table. Source: FarsideThe first batch of Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ether-based ETFs launched for trading on April 30, creating excitement among crypto holders. However, trading activity has been disappointing. The Hong Kong-based ETFs only amassed $12.4 million in trading volume during the first day, which pales compared to the first-day trading volume of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, valued at $4.6 billion.However, this is a high figure considering the size of the Hong Kong market, equivalent to $1.6 billion worth of trading volume in the United States, according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas’ April 30 X post:“You have to understand [that Hong Kong] is 1/168th the size of the U.S.”While the inflows were relatively small, the debut of the Hong Kong ETFs could set a significant precedent for other jurisdictions, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of DFG, who told Cointelegraph:“These ETFs open up Asian markets to crypto exposure, which can likely push prices up in the long term as more countries likely follow the footsteps of Hong Kong as well."Related: Bitcoin down 20%+ from all-time highs — Is BTC price headed to $50K?Could Bitcoin revisit the $50,000 mark after the Hong Kong ETF debut?The debut of the first Hong Kong ETFs proved to be a “sell-the-news” type event for Bitcoin holders, as BTC fell below the $60,000 psychological mark on May 1, a day after the debut of the new ETFs.The last time Bitcoin traded below $60,000 was at the end of February, according to CoinMarketCap.BTC/USDT, 1-day chart.

He told Cointelegraph:“While price predictions are not appropriate based on these, the STH-RP is a crucial support level for BTC to hold and on losing it, or the average ETF buyer cost basis, there is a high likelihood that there is a cascade down to low $50,000s.”Related: Tether nets record $4.5B profit in Q1 2024 — majority from Bitcoin and gold

Opportunity? DOGE set for imminent bull run


As the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency sector resume their trading in the green, Dogecoin (DOGE) is no exception, and its recent price correction might have just been in preparation for an upcoming massively bullish rally, according to the market’s renowned expert.
Indeed, professional crypto trader Ali Martinez has suggested that the previous price correction of Dogecoin was just “part of its usual behavior before massive bull runs,” as per the analysis and chart pattern observations he shared in a X thread on May 2.
Specifically, the analyst highlighted that DOGE’s breaking out of a descending triangle pattern in 2017 preceded a 40% retracement before the popular doge meme crypto asset continued to kickstart an earth-shattering 982% bull run in the months that followed.

Then, in 2021, DOGE performed a similar price action again, this time around retracing by a more significant 56% before proceeding to make a face-melting advance of 12,197%, which saw it skyrocket from a mere $0.0002 to the area around a whopping $0.0245.

Recently, DOGE has repeated the price action of breaking out of a descending triangle once again and is “currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next DOGE bull run,” as Martinez stressed.

Meanwhile, the eighth-largest asset in the crypto market is presently trading at the price of $0.12833, which suggests an increase of 3.58% on the day, as it moves to reverse the loss of 14.28% from its weekly chart and the 30.74% dip accumulated on its monthly chart, according to the most recent data obtained on May 2.

All things considered, Dogecoin could, indeed, be on its way to a massive bull run that could even overshadow the previous two occasions when it performed similar price action. However, things in this sector can sometimes make surprising twists, so doing one’s own research is critical before investing.

Bitcoin (BTC) 'Call Writing' Back in Vogue as Cash And Carry Strategy Loses Shine

Bitcoin fell as low as $56,600 Wednesday, diving out of a four-week consolidation between $60,000 and $70,000 due to several factors, including dwindling demand for spot exchange-traded funds and a resurgent dollar index.

Bitcoin Price Drops Reflecting Fed's Financial Policy Impact


							

Bitcoin’s price drop indicates its role as a leading indicator of market risk sentiment and liquidity dynamics.



The Federal Reserve’s tightening stance heightens Bitcoin’s volatility, stirring concerns about market stability. 



Bitcoin’s value mirrors macroeconomic factors; potential relief may arrive if inflation eases and the Fed embraces a more accommodative approach.




Bitcoin’s recent price decline has drawn attention, with its volatility potentially signaling broader shifts in global market risk appetite. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, over the past two days, the cryptocurrency has dropped about 4%, following a significant 16% decline in April, marking its worst monthly performance since November 2022, when FTX, the digital-asset empire of Sam Bankman-Fried, faced a collapse.



Currently trading around $57,505.60, Bitcoin is at a two-month low and has dropped by 4.01% in the past 24 hours. Investors often analyze Bitcoin’s price movements for insights into changing liquidity dynamics that can impact other assets. The recent slide coincided with the Federal Reserve’s indication of keeping interest rates higher for longer, which tightened financial conditions by boosting Treasury yields and the dollar.



Charlie Morris, Chief Investment Officer at ByteTree Asset Management, referred to Bitcoin as a “favorite canary,” suggesting it serves as an early warning signal for financial market troubles, but also noting that it typically rebounds eventually. Morris highlighted the recent strength of the US dollar as a potential indicator of forthcoming market tightness.



Bitcoin’s record high of nearly $74,000 in mid-March was driven by a surge in inflows into debut US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from major institutions like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments. However, the demand for these products waned, and this week’s launch of spot-Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong failed to provide a boost. Discounts to net asset value for some US portfolios have widened to record levels, underscoring the challenges posed by Bitcoin’s volatility.










Historical data compiled by Bloomberg shows that Bitcoin has posted four April declines over the past decade, with three of them preceding May losses averaging 18%. Despite these trends, if inflation pressures ease and markets anticipate a more accommodative Fed stance, cryptocurrencies and other speculative investments could experience some relief.



As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a possible rate reduction this year, he also acknowledged persistent inflation concerns. This suggests that the market will closely monitor inflation, employment, and economic data in the coming months for any unexpected developments that could impact potential rate cuts.

Why BlackRock Invested $47 Million in This RWA Tokenization Firm


BlackRock has spearheaded a $47 million investment round for Securitize, a firm focused on tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). 
Announced on May 1, this strategic infusion of capital marks a crucial step in the evolution of digital asset securities.
How Securitize Plans to Use $47 Million Funding
Securitize is set to use this funding to propel product development, expand internationally, and enhance partnerships across the financial industry. Investors in this round include Hamilton Lane, ParaFi Capital, and Tradeweb Markets, alongside other key players such as Aptos Labs, Circle, and Paxos.
Consequently, Joseph Chalom, BlackRock’s Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships, will join the Securitize Board of Directors. 

“In our view, the transformative potential of blockchain technology to reshape the future of finance in general – and tokenization in particular – is promising,” Carlos Domingo, the co-founder of Securitize said.

In March, BlackRock partnered with Securitize to launch its first tokenized fund on Ethereum, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). This fund offers a stable $1 value per token and distributes dividends directly to investors’ wallets as new tokens monthly. 
Investing primarily in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, the fund aims to provide yield while maintaining liquidity on the blockchain.


“The focus here is on institutional use of RWAs, and it makes perfect sense for a firm like Blackrock, who already transacts in the RWAs, to find a “large enough” actor they could trust to tokenize those assets and step into the sector. Also interesting to see the mix of investors who joined them in the round. They represent a really strong signal that Tokenizing RWAs is not only becoming mainstream, it’s where the big, smart, industry, and trendy money are all going,” D.J. Bodden, Operations Director at Storm Partners, told BeInCrypto.

BeInCrypto reported that BUIDL has become the world’s largest treasury fund tokenized on a blockchain as of May 1. It surpassed Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund in market capitalization. 
Since its launch six weeks prior, BUIDL has swiftly attracted market attention, with its market capitalization skyrocketing from $274 million to $375 million in April, an impressive 36.5% increase.
This surge aligns with a wider trend towards debt-based, high-yield investments. As of April 26, the total value locked in tokenized real-world assets reached a record $8 billion, marking a nearly 60% rise since February. These statistics exclude fiat-backed stablecoins and cover various assets, including commodities, securities, and real estate tokenization protocols.

Europe's Second Largest Bank Announced That It Is Investing in Bitcoin! - Bitcoin Sistemi


The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been declining since April. BTC, which started May with a decline, continues to decline due to many factors.
While the effect of successive outflows in spot Bitcoin ETFs undoubtedly played a major role in this decline, BNP Paribas, the second largest bank in Europe, reported that it was exposed to the spot BTC ETF in its last 13F filing.


Accordingly, BNP Paribas stated that it has invested in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).
According to the notification made yesterday, BNP Paribas announced that it invested $41,684 in the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF by purchasing 1,030 units.





Although the investment in the Bitcoin ETF was not large, it was considered a big step in the bank's adoption of BTC.
Analysts also stated that this move of the bank coincides with the post of Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Because Eric Balchunas said that many investment advisors, banks and other institutional investors have invested in BTC ETFs, but they have not yet reported and disclosed these investments.


Balchunas also stated that he expects more than 500 investment advisors to disclose their Bitcoin ETF holdings by May 15, the deadline for 13F filings.

Bitcoin Could Undergo a ‘Little Bit Bigger of a Drop’ if Indicator That’s Acted as Support Flips: Benjamin Cowen - The Daily Hodl


								Widely followed analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that Bitcoin (BTC) could fall further after the flagship crypto asset hit a low last recorded in February.
Cowen tells his 801,000 YouTube subscribers in a new video that Bitcoin could experience more downward pressure if the price falls below the 100-day simple moving average (SMA).










“In the short term the thing to keep an eye on with Bitcoin is going to be your 100-day moving average because that is where we are right now. We just swept these lows [at $60,000]. So that’s what I would keep an eye on.
The 100-day SMA has been somewhat of a support here a couple of times… so you know if the bulls are going to try to hold, I imagine they’re going to try to make it stand here…
If they don’t hold it then your next area that you’re going to look at is going to be your bull market support band. And that’s all the way down at around $55,500 to $56,200. So that would be a little bit bigger of a drop.”
Source: Benjamin Cowen/ YouTube
Bitcoin is trading at $57,943 at time of writing, down by around 22% from the all-time high reached on March 14th.
On whether Bitcoin is likely to reach an all-time high earlier than in previous cycles (left-translated peak) or will similarly witness an all-time high to previous cycles (normal peak), Cowen says,
“There’s a lot of sort of academic discussions between left-translated peak or normal peak…
what if this just ends up being sort of a mid-cycle top that’s just occurring a little bit later because rate cuts are a little bit later, we cool off for a while and we just pick back up in the post-halving year? Definitely an option.
If that doesn’t happen and we just pick up now then I would start to believe more so in the left-translated peak idea.”

CZ’s Trial Outcome Shows Cooperation Pays Off


							

Changpeng Zhao’s admission of guilt has paid off in his trial.



A report states that Zhao’s cooperation during the trial led to reduced sentencing.



CZ faces a four month jail term, while prosecutors wanted a three-year term.




The trial of Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ in the digital asset space, brought out the fact that cooperation plays a big role in the results. It is important to note that the crypto entrepreneur was sentenced to 4 months in prison. 



As per a report from CoinDesk, United States District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle noted that the billionaire’s contributions to charities were coupled with his willingness to accept responsibility while downplaying the fact that he had anything to do with the crimes being committed at Binance. 



The sentencing is more than CZ’s lawyers asked for while being significantly less than the one suggested by the US prosecutors. Prosecutors sought a 3-year jail term, while CZ’s lawyers wanted a mere house arrest. 









Zhao gets to keep his vast stake in Binance and also maintain his vast wealth. Better Markets co-founder Dennis Kelleher stated that the short sentencing proves that “crime pays,” while DOJ attorney Kevin Mosley agreed:




“Breaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.”




Notably, dozens of letters were written in support of Zhao, describing him as a family man. The former Binance executive has led a mostly private life and has a college-age son, who sat beside his mother and nephew during the sentencing.Additionally, CZ emphasized his guilt multiple times during the course of the trial and his inability to correct the wrongdoings at Binance. On the other hand, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, never offered “a word of remorse for commission of terrible crimes,” said the judge overseeing SBF’s case.

$BTC: Crypto Influencer Calls Michael Saylor’s “MicroStrategy Orange” Bitcoin Protocol “Idiotic” | Cryptoglobe


                                
On May 1, MicroStrategy announced the launch of a new decentralized identity platform, termed MicroStrategy Orange. This innovation was revealed by Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy during their “Bitcoin For Corporations” conference.



The newly introduced platform leverages the Bitcoin network’s Ordinal-based inscriptions to manage digital identities, which promises a new layer of functionality and security in the digital space. Unlike traditional systems, MicroStrategy Orange operates directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, bypassing the need for sidechains, and is capable of handling up to 10,000 decentralized identifiers (DIDs) in a single transaction.



MicroStrategy Orange stands out by being completely open-source and offering robust features tailored for the modern digital landscape. It aims to provide “trustless, tamper-proof, and enduring decentralized identities,” as stated in an early draft document of the solution available on GitHub.



The decentralized identity (DID) system allows users a level of pseudonymity akin to how real-world identities are distinct from Bitcoin addresses and transactions. This system will enable users to create and manage their digital identities independently, without relying on external validation or traditional identity verification processes.



An innovative application of this technology is “Orange For Outlook,” a tool developed by MicroStrategy to integrate digital signatures into emails, enhancing communication security and authenticity. The process begins when a user accepts an invitation email signed by MicroStrategy’s DID, leading to the generation of a unique DID and associated cryptographic keys for the individual.



Following this setup, the user’s DID and public key are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling them to extend invitations to others to establish their digital identities.



Looking forward, MicroStrategy plans to expand the utility of MicroStrategy Orange to other platforms, including various messaging applications, social media networks, and sectors like e-commerce, enterprise, and fintech.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Not everyone was impressed, though, by MicroStrategy Orange. For example, here is what crypto influencer Udi Wertheimer had to say about it:







Udi Wertheimer is recognized in the cryptocurrency community for his insightful and often contrarian perspectives on Bitcoin and blockchain technologies. A developer and a Bitcoin aficionado, Wertheimer is known for his sharp critiques and analyses of crypto trends and projects, gaining a robust following on social media platforms where he shares his views.



With a background in software development and a deep interest in the principles of Bitcoin, Udi stands as a credible figure among both proponents and critics of cryptocurrency. He actively engages in discussions on the scalability, security, and future trajectories of cryptocurrencies, often challenging mainstream views on new blockchain initiatives.



Ordinals, a recent innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem, have been a particular focus of Udi’s commentary. This technology, made possible by the Taproot upgrade, allows arbitrary data to be inscribed onto individual satoshis—the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Ordinals have introduced the possibility of creating Bitcoin-native non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by associating unique data with specific satoshis, thereby expanding Bitcoin’s utility beyond mere digital cash.



This has stirred debates within the Bitcoin community about the implications of such uses on the blockchain’s transaction sizes and overall focus. Despite this, Udi has voiced strong support for the experimentation with Ordinals, defending developers and users against accusations of harming the Bitcoin network.



He argues that such innovations align with the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin and foster a unique on-chain culture, which he sees as vital against the backdrop of Bitcoin’s evolving narrative. On 2 March, Udi expressed an extremely bullish view on Ordinals, predicting a significant rise in interest and suggesting they could become prime targets for phishing attacks due to their potential value. He also noted the prospect of high returns on investment in well-established Ordinals, emphasizing the transformative impact they could have on the market.

US Prosecutors are Digging into the Financial Transactions at Block: Report


							

US prosecutors are looking into financial transactions at Block.



Block allegedly processed transactions involving countries under US sanctions.



The company also allegedly failed to gather sufficient information from its users.




Prosecutors in the United States are looking into the financial transactions at Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s Block, the parent firm of Cash App and Square. 



As per a NBC report, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter, the prosecutors are looking into the internal practices at Block and discussing with a former employee the alleged widespread and compliance issues at Cash App and Square.









The former employee at Dorsey’s company provided documents to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, which show that Cash App and Square customers were not asked to share sufficient information to assess their risks. 



The documents also reveal that Square successfully processed thousands of transactions that involved nations subjected to economic sanctions by the United States. Further, the documents also show that the firm processed transactions for certain terrorist groups. 



The former employee said that “from the ground up, everything in the compliance section was flawed,” while adding:




“It is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program.”




The document spanning over 100 pages shows many transactions, in even dollar amounts, being processed in countries under US sanctions like Cuba, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawyer, Edward Siedle, said: 




“It’s my understanding from the documents that compliance lapses were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years.”




The former employee also noted that most of the transactions, including credit cards, US dollars, or Bitcoin (BTC), were never reported to the authorities as required. When Block was alerted to breaches, the company failed to correct its operating methods, the employee added.

Hundred Finance hacker moves stolen assets a year after $7M exploit

The hacker who stole $7.4 million from the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Hundred Finance has started moving the crypto assets after a year of inactivity. On May 1, the hacker moved Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) worth about $800,000 from Curve’s decentralized exchange (DEX) after providing liquidity on the platform more than one year ago. Token transactions made by the Hundred Finance hacker. Source: EtherscanAfter withdrawing the funds, the hacker converted USDT and other cryptocurrencies into ETH. This increased the exploiter’s ETH by more than $1 million. The hacker currently holds a total of $4.3 million in assets in the wallet, which includes various crypto assets like Dai (DAI), Wrapped Ether, Frax and Wrapped Bitcoin. On April 15, 2023, the DeFi protocol reported that it had suffered a security breach on the layer-2 network Optimism. According to the blockchain security firm CertiK, the attacker manipulated the exchange rate between ERC-20 tokens and hTOKENS. This allowed them to withdraw more tokens than were deposited. This is commonly known in the DeFi world as a flash loan attack. This type of attack vector usually involves borrowing large amounts of funds with some form of uncollateralized loan from a lending platform. The attacker then uses the assets to manipulate the price of crypto on DeFi platforms. In the Hundred Finance hack, large loans were taken out under the falsified exchange rate. In 2022, Hundred Finance also suffered an exploit on the Gnosis Chain. The protocol’s liquidity was drained through a reentrancy attack, resulting in a $6 million loss. Related: Pike Finance clarifies ‘USDC vulnerability’ statement on $1.6M exploitWhile flash loan attacks have wreaked havoc within the space in the past few years, April 2024 showed a significant decrease in losses from this type of hack. According to a report from CertiK, flash loan attacks only accounted for $129,000 lost in April. Its largest single incident within the month only caused $55,000 in damages. CertiK said in the report that this was the lowest amount lost to flash loan attacks since February 2022.Meanwhile, losses to crypto hacks in general also decreased in April. Security company PeckShield reported that only $60 million was lost to hacks in the month. This represents a sharp decline from February and March, which recorded $360 million and $187 million in losses, respectively.Magazine: Woman accused of $6B scam, China loophole for Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs: Asia Express

PEPE flips ARB: A Fluke or start of a new trend? - AMBCrypto



PEPE manages to flip ARB in terms of market cap as price of the memecoin surged.
Social activity around PEPE fell, sentiment remained high.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] recent price plummet led to corrections across the board for various currencies. The memecoin sector was also impacted by the same causing massive price declines.
PEPE to the moon?
However, PEPE [PEPE] was one of the memecoins that managed to see green during this period. According to new data, the third largest memecoin managed to outperform ARB in terms of market cap.
Source: CoinMarketCap
However, it wasn’t an easy journey for PEPE in the last few months. Starting from the 14th of March after testing the $0.000001082 level,  the price started to fall.
PEPE continued to show multiple lower lows and lower highs after this, indicating a bearish trend. There were no signs of reversal for quite some time, until the 23rd of April, when it tested the $0.000000793 level and broke the cycle of lower highs and lower lows.
Even though price hasn’t been able to push past this level in the last few days, some bullish sentiment and momentum may help the memecoin see green in the near future.
However, indicators weren’t on the side of PEPE at the time of writing. The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) fell in the last few days.
A declining CMF indicated that the money flowing into the token fell significantly. Moreover, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) also decreased, implying that bullish momentum around the memecoin declined materially.
These factors indicate that PEPE might move sideways for sometime before retesting the $0.000000793 level in the future. At press time, the token was trading at $0.000006847 and its price rose by 6% in the last 24 hours.
Coupled with this, the volume at which PEPE was trading at had also surged by 38% during this period.

Due to this recent surge in price, $3.09 million worth of short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours.

Even though PEPE’s price surged and bears were making losses, a large part of its price movement would be dictated by social volume.

2 May: Four Solana Memecoins That Could Rally 9,000%, Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Epic Breakout Scenario Predicted by Crypto Analyst

In a recent tweet, crypto analyst Ali predicts an epic breakout scenario for the first and largest dog-themed cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Dogecoin (DOGE). Dogecoin experienced lackluster price activity in April, closing the month down 40%. May has also kicked off with a slow start for the dog coin, with its price down 3.39% so far. The current Dogecoin price activity has piqued the interest of traders and analysts, with many eagerly watching its movements to see what happens next. According to crypto analyst Ali, Dogecoin's price fall is typical of its behavior before major bull runs. Furthermore, Dogecoin's current 47% fall could be a healthy retracement, paving the way for a potential bull run amid a breakout from a descending triangle pattern. The descending triangle pattern, characterized by lower highs and horizontal support levels, usually signals a period of consolidation followed by a breakout. Given Dogecoin's history, the breakout from this pattern could be especially noteworthy. Ali cites examples to bring home his point. In 2017, DOGE broke out of a descending triangle. Afterward, the price retraced by 40% before entering a 982% bull run. Similarly, in 2021, Dogecoin broke out of a descending triangle and then retraced by 56% before rising by a massive 12,197%. Fast forward to 2024, and Dogecoin has once again broken out of a descending triangle and is currently experiencing a 47% price correction, much like past cycles. With DOGE breaking out of a descending triangle pattern and undergoing a significant correction, the stage might be set for a potential bull run, propelling the dog coin to new highs. However, as with any prediction on the cryptocurrency market, there are no guarantees, and past performance does not guarantee future outcomes. Whether Dogecoin will soar to new highs or not remains to be seen. At the time of writing, Dogecoin was up 2.93% in the last 24 hours to $0.128, mirroring the general market rebound after a slump at the start of May.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Rebound as Interest Rates Remain Unchanged in US - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin and Ethereum have rebounded after starting yesterday morning nearly 10% lower than they were on Tuesday.At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is around $57,700 after having made a 0.5% recovery in the past 24 hours. And the Ethereum price, after climbing 2.3% in the past day, is now trading for just below $3,000, according to CoinGecko data.But the damage has still been done. Per CoinGlass, the past 24 hours saw another $193 million worth of crypto futures contracts liquidated, adding to the $300 million worth of liquidations seen earlier this week.Economist and trader Alex Krüger explained that this current cycle feels so different for traders because it's largely been driven by interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which only just started trading in January this year."There has been barely any new retail coming into crypto," he wrote on Twitter. "It's been mostly ETF buyers and previous cycle participants redeploying and going out the risk curve."Analysts mostly attributed crashing crypto prices to fear in the market over certainty among investors that the Federal Open Markets Committee—which sets monetary policy and controls U.S. federal interest rates—would not lower rates. Then the Fed did exactly what the majority of investors thought it'd do by keeping interest rates unchanged, and crypto assets traded sideways.During a press conference yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% has been difficult, but added that he thought it was “unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.”“I’d say it’s unlikely,” he said, but warned that it was “likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.”But even President Joe Biden has been optimistic that the Fed will still lower rates this year. "I do stand by my prediction that before the year is out, there'll be a rate cut," he said during a press conference in Japan last month. "This may delay it a month or so, I'm not sure of that."He was referring to the hotter-than-expected March inflation report that had just been released at the time.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ethereum zkrollup: zkSync announces crypto partnership with Alchemy

Yesterday, zkSync, a well-known zkrollup developer on the Ethereum blockchain, announced a partnership with the crypto developer platform Alchemy.
This news brings new features to the crypto ecosystem, expanding the connections of the layer-2 with the rest of the web3 world.
Meanwhile, a former zkSync engineer has decided to launch his own project Sophone, a hyperchain focused on the entertainment sector, inaugurating the sale of a series of validator nodes.
Let’s see all the details below.

Ethereum’s zkRollup solution lands on the web3 development platform Alchemy: progress for the zkSync crypto ecosystem
Yesterday, Matter Labs, the company behind the developments of the Ethereum zkSync zkrollup layer-2, announced integration with the Alchemy development platform.
Now the high-throughput second-layer blockchain, which represents the first rollup compatible with EVM guaranteed by zero-knowledge proofs, can be more easily leveraged by the developer community, relying on a convenient and secure tool like Alchemy.

Specifically, on Alchemy developers can access advanced APIs, custom RPCs, Supernode, Alchemy Signer for embedded accounts, and much more, all within a single dashboard.
By doing so, industry professionals are encouraged to build new blockchain applications, being able to rely on a suite of tools to scale and distribute such products efficiently across the web.
One of the unlocked features closest to the non-developer world is definitely that of custom RPC, which allows you to use zkSync zkrollup through an endpoint different from the one offered by MetaMask, often overcrowded with requests.
By creating a private API key (and going to the command line), users can use Ethereum’s scalable secondary network by sending transactions through a secondary endpoint.
Alternatively, you can go through Chainlist for the same purpose.

Soon on Alchemy new features will be unlocked at home zkSync like now the Sepolia Faucet, a developer education program a “collab merch” dedicated to chain operators.
Just one step away from the launch of the ZKS crypto and the supposed airdrop that will be dedicated to chain users, zkSync opens the doors to a new era of development for its ecosystem.
Based on zkSync with Alchemy, developers will be able to rely on a reliable, scalable, and accurate web3 infrastructure, ensuring a seamless development experience.
Former zkSync developer creates his own hyperchain Sophon: public sale of nodes announced
Another crypto news from the zkSync ecosystem, concerns the departure of the developer “0xsebastiena” from the Ethereum zkrollup team, in order to launch his own personal project.
This is Sophon, an entertainment platform that presents itself as a modular rollup that leverages zkSync’s Hyperchain technology and the ZK stack as the operating framework.
Basically, it acts as a layer-2 rollup that operates in validium mode, meaning it does not store transaction data on the main Ethereum network (thus it is cost-effective to use), designed to be customized for any high-performance application.
Its main fields of application are gaming, NFT ticketing , artificial intelligence for consumer and other entertainment sectors 
0xsebastiena presented the project to its audience on April 15, announcing in parallel two partnerships with Beam Network and Aethir Cloud.
The project has recently raised $10 million in VC funding through a round led by Paper Ventures and Maven11.

Just 15 days after the introduction of Sophon, a high hand grenade was dropped, starting the public sale of infrastructure nodes.
Anyone can decide to purchase a node, or better a token ERC-721 that gives the right to run the node itself (or delegate it) on Sophon.
The choice of public sale was made because the founder of the project has a great interest in the crypto world and can afford this option in order to decentralize their network as much as possible.
During this phase, you will be able to purchase a node at the price set by the reference tier: when the allocation of nodes for that specific tier ends, we move on to the next slot with a higher price, of course: first come, first served.
The node operators will obviously receive the commissions from the Sopshon network as well as an incentive directly in the next governance token $SOPH (20% of the total supply) that will be issued in the first 36 months after the mainnet launch.
More than 18,500 ETH have already been collected in this public fundraiser.

Attention if you are new to this field and want to expose yourself to the purchase of nodes. 
Assess the situation carefully and make the necessary considerations in light of the expenses you will have to incur to keep the node operational and the economic incentives you will receive.
A particular user has pointed out how this sale of nodes represents only and exclusively a method that allows the project team to make money.

Peter Schiff Discloses Downside Target For Bitcoin, Downtrend Imminent? | Bitcoinist.com


								Peter Schiff, a popular critic of Bitcoin and staunch advocate for Gold, has delved into the ongoing debate surrounding BTC’s valuation, predicting a potential downside pressure in the near future and setting his target at the $54,000 price level.
Bitcoin Continues To Face Downside Pressure
Earlier today, Schiff identified a negative pattern on the Bitcoin chart, indicating that the price of the cryptocurrency is likely to decline. He claims that the most recent examination of Bitcoin’s short-term chart demonstrates a shift in the attitudes of the market.
Schiff’s observation was made amid a background of elevated volatility and erratic sentiment, as Bitcoin has been moving in a downward direction over the last several days. The recent disclosure by the economist about the short-term downside objective of Bitcoin has garnered significant interest from the cryptocurrency community.

According to him, the pivotal $60,000, which was observed to be a support level on this shorter-term BTC chart, has turned into a resistance level. As a result, Schiff suggests a negative change in trend due to a short-term head-and-shoulders pattern appearing on the Bitcoin chart. 
With the neckline just below $57,000, Schiff highlighted that the head lingers around $60,000, while the shoulder is situated around $58,500. Thus, he has placed his downside target for Bitcoin at the $54,000 level in the short term.

Schiff also voiced concerns about the lack of discussion about the largest cryptocurrency asset from the American business news channel CNBC, following a decrease in Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the past few days.
Over the past two days, the BTC Spot ETFs have fallen by more than 10%, closing below their market high by about 23%, but yet neither the products nor BTC were talked about by the news channel in the timeframe. Meanwhile, should the Spot BTC ETFs have increased by 10%, the digital asset would have been covered all day.
Peter Schiff has consistently attacked BTC over time. Earlier this month, the economist declared that buyers of BTC Spot ETFs will soon begin to pull out as the market’s volatility overwhelms them.
Given that the coin’s long-term bear market is starting to gather up steam once more, Schiff claims all of the new investors in the funds will be riding along with the wave, prompting his confidence that these investors will bail out soon.
BTC In The Bear Market, Party Is Over
As the market continues to fluctuate, the gold advocate addressed the current state of BTC, noting that the digital asset is in a bear market, despite all the excitement surrounding the spot ETFs.

“Turn out the lights HODLers, the party is over,” he said, claiming that one BTC is currently worth less than 25 ounces, up by 33% in comparison to gold, and down by 23% in the US dollars.

This is what a Trump capital gains tax could look like


President Biden recently made a stir with his latest budget proposal, which included several provisions that alarmed investors. The first and arguably most important for anyone involved with the stock market is the proposed new and increased capital gains tax.
Under the plan, the rate would reach its highest since the tax was established in 1913 at a maximum of 44.6%.
The proposal immediately proved controversial, given how it compares to the original maximum of 7% and the 1921 Revenue Act maximum of 12.5%. It is also substantially higher than the rate set during former President Trump’s term when it was reformed not to exceed 20%.


With this in mind, and particularly considering that Trump will in all likelihood be Biden’s opponent in the upcoming elections, Finbold decided to take a look at what the capital gains tax for stocks and cryptocurrencies might look like should the administration change. 
Likely President Trump’s capital gains tax
At the time of publication, there appears to be little room for speculation on what a Trump second-term capital gains policy could look like, given that the proposal has already been published.
Unsurprisingly, given the standard Republican approach, the Trump campaign plans to lower the maximum capital gains tax rate to 15%. This would follow his previous term, which saw the rate set at a maximum of 20%.
Still, it is noteworthy that such a decrease might face resistance. 
The fairly unintuitive fact – at least given the standard rhetoric – that U.S. public debt tended to increase more under Republican administrations could, when paired with the frightening pace at which the burden is already increasing, could make such a decrease impractical to implement.
On the other hand, the rising debt might not prove a hurdle for all parts of the tax plan depending on how willing a potential Trump administration would be to further cut social, infrastructure, and other public spending and refrain from boosting the defense budget – or, failing that, to ramp up the pace of debt-taking.
Still, while it isn’t certain just how the capital, dividend, and other taxes might look like under a second Trump presidency, it is likely the other controversial aspect of Biden’s proposal – the unrealized gains tax – would not see the light of day, especially since the campaign leveled hefty criticism against the current administration over the budget.

Recent trading activities suggest that XRP might be gearing up for a reversal on the market. The asset recently exhibited a significant bounce, pushing its price close to the $0.57 mark. This rebound was backed by a substantial increase in trading volume, hinting at growing interest from buyers and potentially setting the stage for a bullish market rally.Currently, XRP's price movement shows it outpacing other digital assets, indicating its strong position on the market. This progression is critical as it reflects a strength the asset possesses while the rest of the market clearly struggles. However, for XRP to maintain its upward trajectory and confirm a bullish trend, it must first overcome the resistance level at $0.52.XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the chart further, XRP's price action finds robust support at around $0.50, a level from which it has managed to rebound. It suggests that buyers are stepping in at lower price points, despite the fact that it was not expected at all.On the upside, the resistance levels to watch are $0.52, followed by $0.57. If XRP can breach the $0.52 level, it could attempt to challenge the higher resistance, and a break above this could pave the way toward testing the $0.60 threshold.For the future, maintaining above the $0.52 mark is crucial. A consistent hold above this resistance could confirm a shift to bullish conditions, likely attracting more buying pressure. However, if XRP fails to sustain this breakout, it might move between the known support and resistance levels until a clearer trend emerges.

Crypto expert Plan B sets Bitcoin price for 2025


Bitcoin (BTC) began May with a significant sell-off after losing crucial support at $60,000 and falling as low as $56,000 leaving many market participants anticipating further declines.
This plunge comes as the crypto market remains on the edge, with uncertainty lingering about the potential onset of the historical post-halving rally.
In light of these developments, crypto analyst Plan B shared insights into Bitcoin’s price outlook for the remainder of the month in a YouTube video posted on May 1.


Firstly, the expert delved into the Bitcoin stock-to-flow model, highlighting that Bitcoin closed slightly above $60,000 the previous month. While this marked a $10,000 drop from March, Bitcoin still maintained a 36% year-to-date increase.
Plan B emphasized the historical accuracy of the stock-to-flow model in predicting Bitcoin’s price. He pointed out that May 2024 marks the final month before the next halving event. Historically, each halving has coincided with a gray stock-to-flow model price, underscoring the predictive power of this model.

Bitcoin price targets
Regarding specific price points, the expert pointed out that while the current average Bitcoin price hovers around $34,000, it closely aligns with the ballpark figure of $55,000 predicted by the original 2019 model.

“The average price is something that we can calculate at the moment. It’s $34,000, and that’s a little below the $55,000 that the 2019 original stock-to-flow model predicted, but it’s in the ballpark. It’s the same order of magnitude, and don’t forget in 2019, the Bitcoin price was below $4,000. The average Bitcoin price was above the stock-to-flow model price in the cycle before the last cycle, the 2016-2020 cycle,” he said. 

Despite some fluctuations, Plan B updated the model’s parameters, maintaining an average target price of around $500,000 between 2024 and 2028. He highlighted the importance of the halving event in driving up the model value, anticipating a gradual increase in Bitcoin’s price over the coming months.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2024, the expert expressed confidence in Bitcoin reaching $100,000, driven by the need for mining revenue to recover following the halving event. He based this prediction on historical trends, noting that mining revenue typically recovers within four to eight months post-halving.
The trading expert also expects the market peak to occur in 2025, with Bitcoin’s price potentially surpassing $200,000.
Technical indicators’ prediction
Plan B also analyzed technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the 200-week moving average (MA). He noted that the RSI has normalized to around 66 after reaching a high of 77. This normalization suggests that Bitcoin’s price is stabilizing within the context of previous market cycles.
He mentioned that the 200-week moving average has increased slightly to $34,000. The analyst described this value as a conservative floor for Bitcoin’s price during bull markets, indicating that Bitcoin prices typically rise well above this level during such periods.
Notably, Bitcoin’s current losses came after the halving event, while interest in exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows was exhausted. This has left Bitcoin investors focusing on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy amid stubborn inflationary figures. At the moment, the Fed has left interest rates unchanged.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $57,779, having registered weekly losses of almost 10%.

As things stand, Bitcoin must now maintain its price above the $55,000 mark, as a drop below this level could validate sustained bearish sentiment.

Trading: Record outflows for Bitcoin Spot ETFs

On Wednesday, trading on US ETFs on spot Bitcoin recorded an exceptional day, marking the largest daily net outflows since their creation. 
The aggregate outflow reached the astonishing figure of 563.7 million dollars, a significant change in investor sentiment. 
According to SosoValue data, this event has marked a significant moment in the financial markets, especially in the cryptocurrency sector.

Trading analysis: The outflow of ETFs on Bitcoin spot in detail
The most significant outflow occurred in the Fidelity FBTC, which saw a withdrawal of $191 million from the fund.
This figure not only represents the largest withdrawal of the day, but also exceeds the previous record net outflow of 167.3 million dollars recorded by the GBTC of Grayscale.
The movement in these funds reflects changes in investor strategies and reactions to market conditions, which can be rapid and substantial in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.
Even Grayscale’s GBTC was not far behind, with net outflows of $167.3 million. This amount is noteworthy as it indicates a continuing trend where large sums are being moved away from what has been one of the most popular Bitcoin investment vehicles.
The ARKB of Ark Invest also saw a significant reduction, with $98.1 million leaving the fund, marking it as the third largest outflow of the day.
An interesting development has been noticed in the IBIT of BlackRock, which recorded its first daily net outflow since the beginning, totaling 36.9 million dollars. Similarly, the BITB of Bitwise reported outflows totaling 29 million dollars.
These figures underline a broader pattern of declining interest or strategic reallocations by investors within the bitcoin spot ETF market.
In contrast to these outflows, the Hashdex DEFI ETF has stood out by maintaining a neutral position with zero net inflows and outflows, highlighting its stability or different investor perceptions on that particular day.
The meaning of trend changes
These changes are significant not only for their size, but for what they mean regarding the general market sentiment towards bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments through ETFs.
The total cumulative net flow for the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs tracked stood at $11.2 billion at Wednesday’s close, indicating strong initial interest since their respective launch. 
Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, an investment consulting company, commented on the situation through a post on X (previously Twitter), stating: “So, the iShares Bitcoin ETF had its first day of outflows ($37 million). That’s how ETFs work. Inflows don’t increase in a straight line.”
This drop in investment inflows comes after a significant enthusiasm around spot bitcoin ETFs that seems to have started to decrease. 
April marked a change with total monthly net outflows of 343.5 million dollars, interrupting a series of three months of inflows. Among these, the GBTC was particularly affected with 2.5 billion dollars leaving the ETF during the month, driving the outflows.
The declining interest could be attributed to several factors, including regulatory concerns, market volatility, and perhaps a reevaluation of the role of bitcoin in diversified investment portfolios. 
The dynamics of investments in cryptocurrencies are influenced by various global economic factors, technological advancements, and changes in regulatory landscapes, all capable of leading to rapid changes in investor behavior.
Furthermore, significant outflows may also reflect a broader trend towards risk aversion among investors, possibly due to wider economic uncertainties or specific developments within the cryptocurrency market. 
Since ETFs offer a relatively simple way to invest in bitcoin without having to deal with the complexities of direct ownership of cryptocurrencies (such as wallets and keys), movements within these funds can serve as a barometer for the overall investor sentiment towards bitcoin.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the outflows records from ETFs on spot bitcoin in the United States highlight a potentially critical moment for cryptocurrency investments. 
As the landscape continues to evolve, both experienced investors and novices will closely observe these developments to assess the future trajectory of bitcoin and its place in investment strategies. 
Whether this change is a temporary realignment or a sign of a deeper shift in investor confidence remains to be seen. The next few months will be crucial in shaping the narrative and investment models in the cryptocurrency market.

These Are All the New Features Coming to Aave V4


Aave Protocol is preparing for a significant upgrade with its upcoming V4 release, scheduled for mid-2025. 
This new version builds on the foundation laid by V3, aiming to transform the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector with new features and improved user experience.
How Aave V4 Enhances Lending Protocol
Aave V4 introduces a new architectural blueprint to minimize governance overhead and enhance modularity. This change promises to optimize capital efficiency and integrate the Aave-native stablecoin, GHO, more seamlessly than ever before. 
Moreover, V4 will incorporate risk management tools and a more efficient liquidation engine to bolster security and user confidence.

“Given the competitive DeFi landscape, we believe the key to staying ahead is continued innovation, building, and shipping excellent solutions that address the ongoing requirements of the Aave community. The suggested ideas aim to position Aave at the forefront of DeFi in 2030 and beyond,” Aave Labs wrote.

The highlight of V4 is the introduction of a Unified Liquidity Layer. This feature evolves from the Portals concept in V3, offering a more abstract and independent framework for liquidity management. It will allow Aave to adjust supply and draw caps, interest rates, and incentives without the cumbersome need to migrate liquidity for new borrow modules.
Another significant advancement is the implementation of fuzzy-controlled interest rates. This approach automates interest adjustments based on real-time market conditions. The integration with Chainlink ensures the most accurate and efficient on-chain interest rate models.

Aave V4 also plans to introduce Liquidity Premiums. This feature will enable differentiated borrowing costs based on the risk profile of the collateral, fine-tuning the economic incentives for using riskier assets.
For user convenience, V4 will debut Smart Accounts. These accounts address the operational complexity of managing multiple wallets by allowing users to handle various borrowing positions from a single wallet interface.

Regarding risk management, V4 will adopt a dynamic risk configuration system. This system allows for asset-specific configurations that can evolve without impacting existing borrowers, significantly reducing governance friction.
Read more: How To Use Aave?
The development timeline for Aave V4 spans from initial research in Q2 2024 to a complete rollout by mid-2025. This phased approach includes extensive community engagement, rigorous testing, and multiple audits to meet security and reliability standards.

News from MicroStrategy: Orange, a platform based on Bitcoin, is coming soon

Yesterday, the founder and President of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, announced the news of a new platform based on Bitcoin, called Orange.

MicroStrategy has been dedicating itself not only to investments in BTC for some time now, but also to the development of software based on the Bitcoin protocol. 

Bitcoin news: the MicroStrategy Orange protocol
MicroStrategy Orange is a new protocol developed by MicroStrategy and based on the Bitcoin protocol.
Indeed, Bitcoin before being a financial asset (BTC) is a decentralized and open source P2P computer protocol, which can therefore be used by anyone as a basis for developing protocols based on it. 
Furthermore, the name itself, Orange, is a clear reference to the color orange, which is commonly associated with Bitcoin.
MicroStrategy Orange is a decentralized identity (ID) platform built on the Bitcoin network. Its presentation yesterday took place during the MicroStrategy World event: Bitcoin for Corporations 2024, so it is mainly aimed at large companies. 
The company’s executive vice president, Cezary Raczko, presented Orange as a business platform developed by MicroStrategy for creating applications based on decentralized identities on the Bitcoin blockchain.
This is an IT platform composed of three fundamental parts, at the center of which there is a cloud-hosted service that allows issuing identifiers to its users and organization.
Thanks to this innovation, pre-packaged applications that work on the same MicroStrategy Orange platform and address specific challenges related to digital identity can be distributed.
The idea seems to be to be able to incorporate the ability to create a digital identity within Bitcoin wallets, to identify people in a certain and unique way. It could be used, for example, to ensure that the sender of a text message or an email is actually who they claim to be. 
MicroStrategy wants to become the world’s first Bitcoin development company. 
Why Bitcoin?
The reason why the Bitcoin protocol was chosen as the basis on which to develop this platform is the robust security features and immutability of its blockchain. 
MicroStrategy started investing in BTC in 2020, and now it owns more than 214,000 BTC.
Facing a total investment of over 7.5 billion dollars, now there is a capital in Bitcoin worth over 12 billion dollars, with an unrealized gain of over 60%. 
Since the company, which is listed on the stock exchange with the ticker MSTR, has a market capitalization of just under 17.5 billion dollars, the bulk of its value comes from the BTC it owns. 
It is therefore not a coincidence that in recent years she has also started working on the Bitcoin protocol. 
After all, even though it was founded in 1989, twenty years before the launch of the Bitcoin blockchain, it is an innovative company that operates in the field of business intelligence, but also in mobile software and cloud-based services. 
So if on one hand it has chosen to invest in BTC at a financial level, now it is also working to invest in Bitcoin at an economic and productive level, with the development of new software based on the decentralized Bitcoin protocol. 
However, it is worth noting that yesterday the price of its shares on the stock market did not move significantly after Orange’s announcement. 
The usefulness of Orange
Yesterday Raczko stated that integrating digital identity based on Bitcoin with a broader ecosystem of verifiable credentials opens up a large number of very interesting use cases.
He mentioned, for example, the verification of academic qualifications, or the certification of participation in courses, and even medical records. 
The fact is that the Bitcoin blockchain is anonymous, or at least pseudo-anonymous, even though it is public, but the Bitcoin protocol is based on public digital signatures verifiable by anyone. 
The difference for this type of use is precisely the fact that the correctness of the signatures can be publicly verified with absolute certainty on the Bitcoin blockchain, despite it being anonymous. 
So associating a digital identity to those signatures makes it possible to use a public and verifiable system with certainty by everyone to associate a specific identity to a specific transaction, or to a document, so that anyone can personally verify without any doubt. 
Furthermore, the identity will not be published on the blockchain, which will remain anonymous, but thanks to platforms like Orange it can be verified by those who use it. 
Many companies could benefit from a system that allows to have absolute certainty not only of digital signatures, but also of the identity to which they are associated, without having to rely on third-party custodians who could always, at least in theory, be unreliable.

30% Drop in Crypto Trading Volume and NFT Sales in April


In April, the crypto and the non-fungible token (NFT) market witnessed significant declines, signaling a cooling period for digital asset transactions. 
As trading activities dwindled, key players and Crypto platforms faced marked declines in transaction metrics. This shift indicates a recalibration of crypto market dynamics, reflecting investor caution and a reevaluation of asset values.
Crypto Trading Volume and NFT Sales Drop
Data from centralized exchanges (CEXs) revealed a substantial decrease in spot trading volumes. These have plummeted by 35.7% from March’s $2.49 trillion to just $1.6 trillion. 
Binance, the largest player in the field, accounted for 43.7% of this volume, translating to approximately $699.25 billion.

Parallel to this, the NFT sector also experienced a downturn. NFT sales dipped to $1.15 billion in April, marking a 31.26% decline from the previous month. 
The drop was not limited to sales alone. Indeed, the number of active NFT buyers and sellers also decreased substantially. Buyer participation fell by over half, down 51.88%, and seller activity reduced by 45.72%, indicating a shrinking market interest.
The downturn affected several blockchains where NFTs are commonly traded. Ethereum and Solana, for instance, saw their NFT sales decrease dramatically.
Ethereum’s NFT transactions halved, sinking by 56.8%, while Solana recorded a 39.4% fall in sales. This trend was consistent across various blockchains. However, only a few exceptions, like Immutable X and Avalanche, surprisingly registered increases in NFT transactions.


“The downturn in NFT sales and participation across blockchain platforms could stifle innovation in the space, as the market shifts from speculative to pragmatic value. Creators and platforms need to prioritize real-world use cases, such as certificates of ownership, digital identities, and gaming assets with meaningful in-game utility, ensuring transfer fees are a fraction of the asset price,” Karim Chaib, CEO of Dopamine, told BeInCrypto.

Specific Bitcoin-based NFT collections bucked the downward spiral despite the overall negative trend. In April, The Bitcoin Puppets and the Bitcoin-based WZRDs collection saw their values skyrocket by 2,064.97% and 25,796%, respectively. 

“Bitcoin-based NFTs appear to be more resilient than Ethereum and Solana-based NFTs due to their relative novelty on the Bitcoin network, attracting curiosity and interest from the crypto community. The scarcity of historical data and the novelty of Bitcoin Ordinals make them appealing, coinciding with narratives around the Bitcoin halving, which often stirs bullish sentiment,” Chaib concluded.


This suggests that while the broader market is in decline, niche collections can still capture significant interest and command high valuations.

What Might Happen in Bitcoin in the Future? Analysts Shared Their Predictions for the Summer Months! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to industry analysts, Bitcoin futures investors are preparing for a slowdown in market activity during the summer months.
Analysts Say Bitcoin Options Expect to Slow Over Summer

“Summers are typically periods of low volatility and investors start taking positions based on their biases,” said Bitfinex Futures Manager Jag Kooner.

Kooner stated that Bitcoin's volatility has decreased significantly since mid-April.


Data from the Data Dashboard also supports this, showing that the volatility of Bitcoin options for one-week, one-month and multi-month maturities dropped from 77% to below 60%.
Ethereum options volatility has also decreased to a similar extent as Bitcoin since mid-April.






Bartosz Lipiński, CEO of Cube.Exchange, interprets Ethereum's decline as a sign that investors are waiting for price fluctuations to calm down while waiting for Ethereum's regulatory status in the US to become clear.


“Typically, when there is uncertainty, investors become risk-averse, move into cash and sit on the sidelines, and I wouldn't be surprised if a similar situation is true for Ethereum,” Lipiński said in a statement.
Lipiński added that due to uncertainty about Ethereum's status in the US, whether it is considered a security or not, many investors will either stay on the sidelines or seek opportunities elsewhere until the situation becomes clearer.


However, Lipiński warned that in the summer months, when transaction volumes are low, volatility may increase due to liquidity gaps in the market.
“The summer months can be a relatively quiet period, as stock markets often are, but one only has to look back to 2017, the DeFi summer, and the last major bull run to see the effects of low liquidity on relatively bullish crypto markets,” he added.

First Mover Americas: BTC Stabilizes Around $58K Following Yesterday's Rout

Bitcoin stabilized around the $58,000 mark after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday. Chair Powell said the economy is too strong to cut rates while ruling out increases despite disappointing inflation figures. Having lost the $60,000 support level late on Tuesday, BTC fell as low as $56,500 yesterday, with U.S. spot ETFs seeing outflows of $563.7 million, the highest daily figure since the funds listed in January. At the time of writing bitcoin was priced at $58,282, up 1.4% over 24 hours. The digital asset market at large is up around 4%, according to CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), as altcoins such as SOL and AVAX led a recovery from Wednesday's rout.

BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has its first day of outflows


As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade in the red, United States spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to the crypto have posted record net outflows.
Significantly, BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust recorded its first-ever single-day outflow on May 1, as Bitcoin lost support around the $60,000 mark, dropping to as low as $56,000.
US Bitcoin ETFs saw a total of $563.7 million exiting the market, according to data from Farside shared on May 2. Notably, BlackRock, the largest investment firm globally, saw its streak of positive inflows cut short and recorded its first day of outflows totaling $36.9 million.

Elsewhere, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust saw the largest outflow at $167.4 million, while Fidelity and Ark ETFs experienced withdrawals of $191.1 million and $98.1 million, respectively.
Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETF
Despite the BlackRock ETF recording losses, the interest of institutional investors in the product remains strong. A notable example is BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe, which recently invested in the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF.
At the same time, as reported by Finbold, BNY Mellon, the largest custodian bank globally, also invested in ETFs from BlackRock and Grayscale.
While ETF outflows are contributing to Bitcoin prices’ decline, some market participants maintain a positive outlook. For instance, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reassured that Bitcoin ETFs are still functioning well.

“Should add — these ETFs are operating smoothly across the board. Inflows and outflows are part of the norm in the life of an ETF,” he said. 

Bitcoin price remains under pressure
As the ETFs continue to record outflows, the market remains uncertain, with attention focused on the Federal Reserve monetary policy. Indeed, as things stand, the momentum from ETFs that saw Bitcoin rally to a new record above $73,000 has faded while investors await the gains from the halving event to play out.
In the meantime, there is speculation that Bitcoin could drop to almost the $50,000 mark. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $58,191, having gained almost 1% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, BTC is down about 9%.

Second Wind for Memecoins? Platform Reports Increased Activity


							

Platform simplifies memecoin creation, sparking renewed interest.



Memecoin popularity dipped in April but appears to be recovering.



Increased deployments and rising index signal potential memecoin resurgence.




After a period of waning popularity in April, the memecoin sector appears to be experiencing a resurgence. This potential revival is fueled by a recent surge in activity on Pump.fun, a platform that streamlines the creation and deployment of memecoins.



Pump.fun removes the technical barriers often associated with launching a cryptocurrency. Users can design their memecoin with a name, ticker symbol, and image for a minimal fee, all without needing advanced technical knowledge or pre-existing liquidity. 



The platform even incorporates safeguards against rug pulls, a notorious issue in the memecoin space. Every token launched on Pump.fun automatically implements a bonding curve for trading, where users directly influence the price through buying and selling. 



Once a token reaches a specific market cap, a portion of the liquidity is deposited into a decentralized exchange and permanently locked, preventing developers from manipulating the token’s value.



Source: TheBlock



This user-friendly approach has been a recipe for success for Pump.fun. The platform surpassed a staggering $5 million in revenue within just two months of launch. Their daily earnings peaked in early April, coinciding with the apex of memecoin popularity. While revenue softened later in the month as memecoin interest cooled, Pump.fun maintained a steady daily income exceeding $120,000.









However, recent developments hint at a potential second wind for memecoins. The renewed activity on Pump.fun suggests a rise in memecoin deployments, indicating continued interest in the sector.

Additionally, the GMCI MEME index which is a benchmark that tracks the performance of memecoins, displayed a positive shift. After dipping in mid-April, the index climbed back above 300 last week, signaling a potential rebound in memecoin valuations.

These Two Meme Coins Will Hit A '$10B Valuation By Summer,' Crypto Trader Predicts - Benzinga

Vapor, a widely followed crypto trader, expressed bullish views on established meme coins, forecasting a shift in market sentiment away from venture capitalist-backed tokens.What Happened: Vapor criticized the token distribution methods of recent projects like EigenLayer, suggesting that such ventures are exploiting end users. He also pointed out a growing weariness in the market towards such schemes, which he believes have become more efficient at benefiting founders and investors since 2021, at the expense of the end user.He further expressed his intention to increase his holdings in Dogwifhat WIF/USD and Pepe PEPE/USD, two well-known meme coins. He states, "I believe both WIF and PEPE will be north of $10 billion by summer and be the top performers among large caps."Also Read: Pepe Up 42% On The Week: ‘Don’t Buy Dogs, Cats…Buy Real Memes’ Says Crypto TraderWhy It Matters: Vapor’s tweet reflects a broader sentiment within the crypto community, where many are growing frustrated with the perceived exploitation by venture capitalists and project founders. He predicts a "memecoin supercycle," where established meme coins will become a "black hole" attracting both mass retail and crypto natives.If his prediction materializes, it could signal a significant shift in the crypto market, with meme coins gaining more legitimacy and market share. However, as with all market predictions, only time will tell if Vapor’s forecast comes to fruition.IntoTheBlock data highlights an expansion of 9.9% in Pepe’s total active addresses to 3,250 while hodlers balance has also surged by 2.6% to $233.96 million.

Bitcoin (BTC) Volatility Is Falling and This Will Continue as It Matures: Fidelity

As is the case with all emerging asset classes with a small market cap, the cryptocurrency is more likely to experience higher volatility due to new capital flows, the note said. “However, as the asset class matures and its total market cap grows, the inflow of capital is expected to have a smaller impact because it will be flowing into a larger capital base.”

Staking, Demand, Locked Tokens, Slow Mining: Ethereum Turns Deflationary | Cryptopolitan

Ethereum (ETH) may face a shortage of physical coins as its network has turned deflationary. Even at a supply of 120M, Ethereum demand is higher than supply. More coins are needed for staking and various security deposits, leaving less ETH to trade or move freely. Ethereum Usage Increases Token BurningEthereum is essentially the backbone of the current DeFi sector. Despite scalability issues, coins on the original blockchain are still needed and are even more valuable. One of the main drivers of ETH scarcity are the daily token burns, which accelerate with more transactions. During the peak NFT and DeFi market, Ethereum introduced the Ethereum burn program in late 2021. After the EIP-1559 upgrade, Ethereum introduced a new fee and block production schedule, where miners receive a base rate and all excess fees are burned. End users still may need to pay a relatively high fee for moving their ETH, but block producers will not be able to receive the excess funds. The fee burn program took off like wildfire, and so far the Ethereum network has burned coins worth about $12B based on market estimation. Liquid Staking Platforms Control Large Part of ETH SupplyETH owners have always desired to make use of their tokens, and liquid staking is a tool that aids in achieving that. Holders can now pledge their 32 ETH to secure the network while using the same liquidity in other ecosystems. The Lido liquid staking platform now draws in more than 28% of the ETH supply. More than 44M ETH are locked for securing the network. Lido and EigenLayer enable users to create value in new layers by utilizing tokens as collateral. A smart contract transparently locks the actual tokens, prohibiting their movement or sale on the market. Ethereum reports more than 122M in circulating supply, though there is some conflicting information. According to the burn tracker, the supply has diminished to 115M. For now, the network is experiencing slow deflation, solving the problem with the still un-capped supply. Ethereum Abandons Idea to Freeze ProductionThe older roadmap for Ethereum was to stall production at around 87M ETH. Initially, miners would be discouraged by making it too difficult to produce new tokens, leading to a mining ice age. But miners declined, stating fees were not enough to motivate them. With a mix of mining and staking, the Ethereum Foundation plans to continue producing blocks indefinitely. Token burns are achieving the supply drop, though not reaching the intended target of having less than 100M tokens. But staking and collaterals also turn ETH into a store of value. Over time, people may hold ETH for its value and only rarely use it for direct on-chain actions. Currently, multiple L2 networks offer scaled transactions that do not require Ethereum gas, but are still secured through the Ethereum network. The deflationary trend may also reverse, if fee burning and usage slows down. But during the bull market, increased Ethereum usage contributed to accelerating deflation and may have boosted the ETH market price. As of May 2024, Ethereum remains deflationary with 1.2M transactions per day and their related fee burns. Ethereum Still Not Easily ReplacedEthereum remains a highly secure network, even after phasing out the mining component. The high requirement of staking means it is too expensive to mount an attack. Despite the high fees and the creation of multiple L1 networks, Ethereum is still the go-to network for many projects and NFT collections. Migrations are also difficult and time-consuming. For now, projects discover workarounds such as L2 solutions, wrapped assets, synthetic tokens and off-chain computation. But some tokens are looking for multi-chain solutions and may transfer their activities to new blockchains.Ethereum is still highly usable for decentralized trading, as most of the prominent DEX have an Ethereum version.Will ETH Reach Extreme ValuationsThe recovery of ETH close to $4,000 during the current bull cycle was partly due to the fee burns and locked tokens. But long-term ETH price predictions still exist, as investors await the bull market to return in 2024 or 2025. For Ethereum, the price target of $10,000 has been talked about for years. So far, ETH has traded at four-digit prices, but only went close to $5,000 briefly. After the latest price correction, ETH dipped to $2,910.61, after briefly recovering above $3,300.

New research suggests Bitcoin mining centralized around Bitmain


For years, rumors have circulated that Bitcoin’s largest mining machine manufacturer has secretly centralized a majority of Bitcoin’s hash power. The theory is down to more than a simple observation of the logo stamped on most mining cases.
No, skeptics think that Bitmain’s pool itself — not just its machines — secretly creates the vast majority of blocks that are added to Bitcoin’s ledger.
A sleuth found a clue in Antpool’s block template: A manually prioritized transaction immediately after the 6.25 BTC block reward or ‘coinbase’ transaction. This new research by pseudonymous Bitcoin developer 0xb10c seemingly confirms long-rumored practices by Antpool hiding its massive operation under the names of ostensibly independent pools.
In short, it warns that despite tens of thousands of decentralized nodes, Bitcoin might actually be quite centralized from a mining perspective.
One template and custodian for supposedly independent pools
Specifically, 0xb10c detected that BTC.com Pool, Binance Pool, Poolin, EMCD, and Rawpool show signs of using Antpool’s method for prioritizing the post-coinbase transaction.
Antpool might also use a sixth pool, Braiins, but 0xb10c was still analyzing its merkle branches as of the research publication time. Nearly identical merkle branches might indicate that these five or six pools often use the exact same template as Antpool for selecting transactions to include in a block.
In other words, all of these pools often use Bitmain’s machines, often assemble transactions according to Bitmain’s block template, often prioritize the same manually-configured post-coinbase transaction as Bitmain, and often send coinbase and transaction fees to the same custodian as Bitmain.
It certainly makes Bitcoin look a little centralized.

Has Bitmain secretly centralized Bitcoin’s proof-of-work?
Founded in 2013, Bitmain is one of the oldest continuously operated Bitcoin companies. It’s also gigantic and six years ago sought to IPO for over a billion dollars.
Every miner knows that Bitmain machines generate nearly all hash power on the Bitcoin network. What’s not common knowledge is the size of Bitmain’s coinbase- and fee-sharing pool, AntPool.
According to its publicly-reported hash rate, Antpool by Bitmain claims to generate just one-quarter of Bitcoin’s hash rate. However, 0xb10c suspects it might secretly control a majority.
Because Bitcoin’s mining rewards arrive randomly to the single miner who guesses the Bitcoin difficulty threshold’s lottery-like winning number every 10 minutes, miners pool together to share work and average out these random 3.125 BTC payouts.
Prior to the halving, coinbase rewards were 6.25 BTC. On April 20, 2024, that number halved to 3.125.
Today, just three mining pools control the majority of Bitcoin’s hash rate. However, new research is suggesting that Bitmain’s Antpool has been disguising its work and submitting its winning blocks under the name of third-party pools.
That Bitmain has a near-monopoly on Bitcoin’s physical machinery is common knowledge. By far the most prevalent mining rigs performing proof-of-work hashing around the globe are Bitmain machines. 
Despite its famously poor customer service and product quality variability, its proprietary ASIC technologies have made its rigs unstoppably ubiquitous.
Antpool claims to generate just a quarter of Bitcoin’s hash rate.
Read more: Here’s why decentralized finance is actually very centralized
Corroborating research on Bitmain’s Antpool dominance
Mononaut found more evidence that seems to support 0xb10c’s theory that Antpool might secretly use third-party pools to cloak Bitmain’s dominance. 
Mononaut traced coinbase rewards from mining pools AntPool, F2Pool, Binance Pool, Braiins, BTCcom, SECPOOL, Poolin, ULTIMUSPOOL and 1THash, and Luxor. He found suspicious levels of cooperation from these supposedly competitive entities in allocating coinbase rewards to a shared — possibly Antpool-controlled — custodian.
0xb10c couldn’t confirm that SECPOOL and SigmaPool entirely cloned AntPool’s template, although they seemed to share a similar template. In all, it seems unlikely that up to nine major bitcoin mining pools use a shared custodian for coinbase rewards unless a single entity is behind all of their operations.
Antpool had little to say about the suspicious activities or research reports by 0xb10c and Mononaut. Its most recent English-language tweet only referenced ‘making every hash count.’
Marty Bent, Matt Odell, and Matt Corallo discussed the allegations during a lengthy podcast. Corallo agreed with 0xb10c and Mononaut: “There’s one pool that has near 50% of hash power.”
In summary, if Antpool doesn’t control more than half of Bitcoin’s hashrate through collusion with or control over other mining pools, it seems to be getting pretty close. Bitcoin developer 0xb10c as well as Mononaut found evidence suggesting that Antpool and its alleged associates might control a majority of Bitcoin’s average hashrate.

Second-Largest European Bank BNP Paribas Bought BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Shares: SEC Filing - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsMultinational bank BNP Paribas purchased shares in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a form 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).According to the firm's 13F report filed May 1, BNP Paribas purchased 1,030 IBIT shares in the first quarter of 2024 at $40.47 a share, for a total of $41,684.10—less than the value of a single Bitcoin, at current prices.The second-largest bank in Europe by assets, BNP Paribas has allocated a comparitively miniscule portion of its investment portfolio to IBIT. Nevertheless, it marks one of the first verified occasions on which a major financial institution has purchased shares of a spot Bitcoin ETF—at least partially validating the thesis that institutional investors would be drawn to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.Institutional investment managers with at least $100 million worth of assets at their discretion are required to submit quarterly 13F reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Banks and fund managers have up to 45 days after a quarter ends to submit their reports. That includes foreign banks, like BNP Paribas, if they transact in the U.S., like buying ETFs from American issuers.A Goldman Sachs report published immediately after the U.S. SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in January cautioned that, "Time to market and demand across institutional investors may not be immediate."That argument was backed up by Matt Hougan, CIO of crypto index fund manager Bitwise, who pointed out that, “The truth is, most professional investors still cannot buy bitcoin ETFs,” adding that, “That will change through a series of 100+ individual due diligence processes over the next two years.”Since their launch in January, Bitcoin ETFs have drawn in $11.2 billion in net inflows, per data from Farside Investors, despite over $17.4 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).In recent days, Bitcoin ETFs have seen consistent outflows, with over $563 million in net outflows yesterday alone. The cash outs have come as the U.S. Federal Reserve elected to keep interest rates unchanged, causing investors to shy away from risk assets like stocks and crypto.BNP Paribas' decision to invest in Bitcoin ETFs represents something of an about-face.In September 2022, Sandro Pierri, head of fund management group BNP Paribas Asset Management, said that, "We are not involved in cryptocurrencies and we don't want to be involved," adding that the firm had "not heard significant interest" in crypto from its client base.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Friend​.tech v2 airdrop could introduce nontransferable token

Decentralized social media platform Friend.tech is preparing for its version two launch and airdrop on May 3, but a leaked smart contract suggests it may have controversial features, including a non-transferable token.The nontransferable tokens may be introduced with the airdrop, according to pseudonymous decentralized finance researcher CBBOFE, who claims in a May 2 X post to have potentially found the smart contracts.“Ticker is $POINT, not transferable unless to some whitelisted addresses. $POINT will be tradable on BunnySwap (FT native DEX).”A nontransferable token means that airdrop recipients won’t be able to sell or exchange the coins, except for certain whitelisted protocol addresses. Restaking protocol EigenLayer has also decided to issue a nontransferable token for its EIGEN airdrop, which was one of the main reasons behind the recent outrage surrounding EigenLayer.Friend.tech made the token nontransferable to make users pay the 1.5% fee, according to Kasper Vandeloock, a quantitative crypto trader and adviser at the X10 exchange. He told Cointelegraph:“If you can’t transfer it, you are forced to sell it through them, which has the 1.5% fee. […] Which is kind of ironic, they bring this strong ‘we are anti-VC’ vibe to the table while being a profit factory for Paradigm.”The new potential token, POINTS, will function as a utility token that allows for the creation of social clubs on the platform, which may cost a 1.5% platform fee, according to CBBFOE:“New smart-contract called Clubs. Anyone can create multiple clubs and a bonding curve among several options. 1.5% platform fee and 1.5% staking contract. Club keys are bought with $POINT.”The new tokens will also be offered as rewards for users staking their Ether (ETH) and POINTS tokens in the Friend.tech smart contract.The announcement caused concerns among crypto enthusiasts. Pseudonymous crypto trader MK commented:“I hate Eigen so much for starting this non-transferrable meta.”Related: EigenLayer sees over 12,000 queued withdrawals — How far will TVL fall?Non-transferable tokens could reduce initial airdrop selling pressureWhile nontransferable tokens have been causing significant community outrage, they could benefit the long-term price action of the cryptocurrency, as tokens tend to see drastic declines following airdrops.At the end of April, the Omni Network’s OMNI token fell 55% in less than 18 hours following it airdrop, losing over half of its market capitalization.Wormhole’s W token is another example, falling nearly 25% in value only a couple of hours after an airdrop on April 3. The token is down over 47% since the airdrop, according to CoinMarketCap.W/USDT, all-time chart. Source: CoinMarketCapCrypto airdrops are often riddled with professional airdrop hunters (or squatters) that farm the same airdrop with multiple cryptocurrency wallets with no intention of using the protocol in the long term and market selling the rewards after claiming.In March 2023, it was revealed that airdrop hunters consolidated $3.3 million worth of tokens from Arbitrum’s ARB airdrop from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets they had controlled.Related: LayerZero cross-chain interoperability protocol completes first airdrop snapshot

In a recent development that has stirred the XRP community, over $21 million worth of XRP has been transferred to popular crypto exchange Binance.The two transactions, which were flagged by the crypto tracking service Whale Alert, have sparked speculation regarding the intentions behind the sizable movement of funds.According to Whale Alert's tweets, the first transaction involved the transfer of 21.37 million XRP, equivalent to approximately $10.9 million at the time of the transfer, from an unknown wallet to Binance. Shortly after, another significant transfer was reported, with 21.34 million XRP, valued at around $10.9 million, moved to Binance from an undisclosed source. The timing of these transactions is particularly noteworthy, as they coincide with a period of significant volatility and uncertainty on the crypto market. XRP, in particular, has faced immense pressure in recent weeks, exacerbated by the broader downturn on the crypto market following a series of regulatory concerns and market corrections. It appears that these transactions may signal a sell-off by large XRP holders, commonly referred to as whales, who are offloading their holdings amid the bearish sentiment pervading the market. The recent crypto market crash has prompted investors to reassess their positions, with many opting to liquidate their assets to mitigate potential losses.XRP price shows resilienceDespite the prevailing bearishness, XRP has exhibited a degree of resilience in today's trading session. At the time of reporting, XRP is trading at $0.514, marking a 4.82% increase over the past 24 hours. While this uptick may not fully offset the losses incurred in recent weeks, it nonetheless suggests a degree of investor confidence in the digital asset amid challenging market conditions.In the end, the movements of large-scale investors such as whales remain closely scrutinized for potential insights into market sentiment and future price trajectories. Market participants will be closely monitoring developments to gauge the trajectory of XRP and other digital assets in the days ahead.

These figures underscore the company’s robust financial health and ability to generate significant cash flows, further solidifying its position as a leader in providing advanced analytics, technology solutions, and clinical research services to the life sciences industry.



Analysts had projected an EPS of $2.48, whereas the company reported an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.54, slightly outperforming the expectations. However, the revenue of $3.74 billion comfortably exceeded the anticipated $3.7 billion, indicating a stronger-than-expected top-line growth. This performance is particularly commendable given the challenging global economic environment and underscores IQVIA’s operational resilience and the effectiveness of its business strategy.





IQVIA Expects Full Year Revenue to be Between $15.32 to $15.57 Billion



IQVIA has reaffirmed its full-year 2024 guidance, reflecting confidence in its business outlook despite the ongoing global uncertainties. The company expects full-year revenue to be in the range of $15.325 billion to $15.575 billion on a reported basis, considering the $75 million impact of the strengthening US dollar. This guidance suggests a growth rate of 2.3 to 3.9 percent, with a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 100 basis points.



Furthermore, IQVIA anticipates its full-year Adjusted EBITDA to be between $3,700 million and $3,800 million, representing a growth of 3.7 to 6.5 percent. The Adjusted Diluted EPS guidance is set at $10.95 to $11.25, indicating a year-over-year increase of 7.4 to 10.3 percent.

'Rough day to be a Bitcoin ETF:' What's going on with BlackRock? - AMBCrypto



Fidelity eclipsed Grayscale in BTC ETF outflows on the 1st of May. 
BlackRock’s IBIT saw its first outflow as BTC struggled to reclaim $60K. 

Bitcoin’s [BTC] rough Q2 seems far from over. According to Soso Value data, US BTC ETFs recorded more outflows on the 1st of May, worth $563.7 million.
Surprisingly, Grayscale’s GBTC dominated outflows previously, but didn’t lead the outflows as Fidelity’s FBTC took center stage.

BlackRock’s first outflow as Fidelity loses 2% of its BTC ETF assets
Out of the total outflows of $563.7 million, Fidelity’s FBTC led the outflows with $191.1 million, Farside data showed. 
Grayscale’s GBTC recorded the second-largest daily outflow on 1 May, worth $167.4 million. 
Bloomberg ETF analysts noted that Fidelity’s massive daily outflows were “huge” and almost worth 2% of its ETF assets, 
“Damn.. while it is like 2% of the ETF’s assets, but a) it’s big for Fidelity and b) all of them getting hit today looks like.”
Additionally, BlackRock’s IBIT, after hitting pause and going zero inflows for five days, saw its first outflow worth $36.9 million yesterday. 
Reacting to IBIT’s first outflow, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted, 
“Ruff day to be a #bitcoin ETF.”
The Fed rate decision didn’t help much with the sentiment either. BTC remained firmly below $60K after the Fed kept the interest rate unchanged. 
According to financial commentator Peter Schiff, BTC could drop to $54K after losing the $60K support. Schiff said,
“Notice on this shorter-term #Bitcoin chart that $60K, which was support, has become resistance.”

Bitcoin Spot ETFs Experience Record $564M Outflows, Expert Attributes It To 'Combination' Of Forces - ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF Common Shares of Beneficial Interests (BATS:ARKB), iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund Common Shares of Beneficial Interest (BATS:FBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD spot ETFs recorded substantial net outflows on Wednesday, marking a significant realignment in investor sentiment.What Happened: According to data from SoSoValue, the total net outflow from these ETFs reached a record high of $564 million in a single day. Among the impacted, Grayscale‘s GBTC saw an outflow of $167 million, BlackRock‘s IBIT registered its first net outflow of $36.93 million, and Fidelity‘s FBTC experienced the most considerable withdrawal of $191 million. Ark’s ARKB saw a net outflow of $98.11 million.Amid these substantial outflows, Robert Quartly-Janeiro, Chief Strategy Officer at Bitrue, sheds light on the underpinnings of these market movements. He explains that the outflows are driven by a blend of prolonged high interest rates, geopolitical impacts and the recent peak market highs prompting investors to realize gains. “It's a combination of ‘higher for longer' interest rates, people realizing gains, geopolitical forces that impact equities, bonds and digital assets alike,” Quartly-Janeiro noted. Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Runes Could Transform Our Understanding Of Bitcoin, Experts Tell BenzingaHe emphasized that this represents not an existential crisis but a market dip where profit is being taken and the utility of investments is being scrutinized.When asked about the impact of these outflows on future market sentiment and investor confidence in cryptocurrency ETFs, Quartly-Janeiro pointed out the decline in investor confidence as reflected by the falling market cap. “Many bought and then sold the news ahead of the halving but it's important to remember that BTC is still at over $57,000 from the mid-teens it was at in January 2023,” he elaborated. The Chief Strategy Officer also highlighted the importance of identifying whether retail or institutional investors are driving the sell-off, as it would dictate the underlying reasons and strategies for future investment decisions.What’s Next: As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and respond to various economic and geopolitical stimuli, the significance of understanding these dynamics becomes crucial. This topic and more will be further explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry experts, including Quartly-Janeiro, will discuss the implications of regulatory and economic factors on the future landscape of digital assets.Read Next: Why Bitcoin Might Drop Another 20%: 10x ResearchImage: Shutterstock

Shiba Inu Fees On Fire: What's Behind The 500% Surge?


								The cryptocurrency market continues its wild ride in 2024, with established giants like Bitcoin facing headwinds while seemingly outlandish projects like Shiba Inu experience unexpected growth spurts.

Bitcoin Struggles To Find Footing
Bitcoin, the undisputed king of crypto, has seen its price plummet in recent weeks. After flirting with record highs above $70,000 earlier this year, the leading cryptocurrency dipped below $58,000 on Wednesday, May 1st. This price drop comes amidst a broader market correction and growing concerns about rising inflation and potential interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
Shiba Inu Soars Despite Market Gloom
While Bitcoin licks its wounds, the meme-coin phenomenon Shiba Inu is experiencing a surprising resurgence. Transaction fees on Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution, skyrocketed by a staggering 500% over the past 24 hours.
This surge coincides with a 200% increase in active accounts on the network, suggesting a significant uptick in user engagement.
Source: Shibariumscan
Experts are divided on the reasons behind Shiba Inu’s recent rally. Some attribute it to the inherent volatility of meme coins, where social media hype can trigger rapid price fluctuations.
Others believe the burning mechanism built into Shibarium, where a portion of transaction fees are converted into SHIB tokens and sent to a dead wallet, is creating a perception of a decreasing supply, potentially driving up the price.

What Does This Mean For The Future?
The contrasting fortunes of Bitcoin and Shiba Inu highlight the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin, with its established track record, is seen as a relatively safe haven by some, its vulnerability to broader economic forces remains evident.
On the other hand, Shiba Inu, despite its lack of intrinsic value, demonstrates the power of community and social media buzz in influencing prices.

The question remains: is Shiba Inu’s recent surge a temporary blip or a sign of a more sustained revival? The answer likely lies in the network’s ability to evolve beyond its meme-coin origins and offer real-world utility.
If Shibarium can attract developers and build a robust ecosystem of applications, it might carve out a niche in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. However, if it remains reliant solely on social media hype, its future could be as fleeting as the many dog-themed meme coins that have come and gone before it.
A Cautionary Lesson
The contrasting journeys of Bitcoin and Shiba Inu offer valuable lessons for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. While Bitcoin serves as a reminder of the inherent risks associated with the volatile crypto market, Shiba Inu’s rise highlights the potential for disruptive innovation and community-driven growth.

Ultimately, the future of both projects will depend on their ability to adapt, innovate, and navigate the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.

WestRock Company (WRK) Reports Mixed Fiscal Q2 with $0.39 EPS - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



WestRock Company (NYSE: WRK), a leading provider of sustainable paper and packaging solutions, reported its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2024, results, showcasing a mix of achievements and challenges in a competitive market landscape. Despite a decrease in net sales from $5.28 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $4.73 billion in the current quarter, the company managed to post a net income of $15.5 million, a significant improvement from a net loss of $2.01 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. This recovery was attributed to the company’s aggressive cost savings initiatives, which have already exceeded its target range for fiscal 2024.



CEO David B. Sewell praised the team’s focus and execution, emphasizing the company’s better positioning in the market through efficiency improvements and innovative, sustainable packaging solutions. With over $160 million in cost savings and expectations to significantly exceed the fiscal 2024 target of $300 to $400 million, WestRock appears well on its way to capturing market share and driving long-term earnings growth. However, the decline in net sales was primarily driven by lower selling price/mix, affected by published price declines and softer volumes across its segments.



WestRock Beats EPS Expectations in Fiscal Q2, Revenue Miss



WestRock’s results present a nuanced picture when compared to expectations. Analysts had projected earnings per share (EPS) of $0.24 and revenue of $4.75 billion for the quarter. Actual EPS stood at $0.06, with adjusted EPS at $0.39, reflecting the impact of restructuring and other costs. Although the company fell short of revenue expectations by a slight margin, reporting $4.73 billion, the significant reduction in net loss compared to the previous year highlights effective cost management and operational adjustments. The decrease in net sales year-over-year was noted across all segments, with the Corrugated Packaging, Global Paper, and Consumer Packaging segments experiencing declines due to lower selling price/mix and volumes.





WestRock Refrains from Providing Specific Guidance



Looking ahead, WestRock has refrained from providing specific financial guidance for the upcoming periods, citing the ongoing preparations for its proposed business combination with Smurfit Kappa Group plc. This strategic move aims to create a global leader in sustainable packaging, with the transaction expected to close in early July 2024. The company’s decision not to issue guidance is to avoid potential delays in the transaction timeline due to regulatory submissions that might include financial forecasts. This approach underscores WestRock’s focus on the strategic merger, which is anticipated to enhance its competitive positioning and operational scale.

Jack Dorsey’s Block In Controversy Due To Regulatory Norm...


                                Dorsey's Block Involved in Illicit Crypto Transactions                                The United States investigators are currently examining Jack Dorsey’s Fintech Firm Block due to illegal Crypto transactions. Whistleblower states that Dorsey’s Block proceeded with many transactions linked to terrorist groups. What's the NewsFederal prosecutors in the United States are looking into Block, Inc., a company co-founded by Jack Dorsey. The investigation against the company is ongoing due to concerns about compliance violations within its payment platforms Square and Cash App. This investigation started after the Former Block employee from the Southern District of New York provided documents to investigators, informing that Square and Cash App platforms allowed thousands of transactions from users in countries facing U.S. economic sanctions. They even processed crypto transactions for strange illicit groups. These transactions through credit cards, fiat, and Bitcoin totaled around $57,805 on 2nd May. These transactions were allegedly not reported to the government as required.Dorsey’s Block Investigation and Shreds of Evidence  The Former Block employee of the company provided the documents claiming that Block didn't fix these compliance issues even after being alerted about them. This indicates serious problems in how the company handles regulations. Another unnamed source familiar with Block's internal operations supported these claims. Edward Siedle, a former SEC lawyer representing the anonymous sources, said that the top executives and the board at Block were aware of these compliance problems.However, an Attorney from Block’s side defended the company, saying they have a strong and flexible compliance program to deal with new challenges and changes in regulations, especially regarding sanctions.US Authorities Investigative Action on Other Crypto CompaniesThis investigation into Block, Inc. is happening at a time when U.S. authorities are cracking down on cryptocurrency companies. Recently, a case came across of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao where the founder of Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, was sentenced to a four-month imprisonment. Because Binance didn't maintain a proper Anti-Money Laundering program. Similarly, the founders of Samourai Wallet, a Bitcoin wallet service provider were arrested on suspicion of money laundering, although they denied the charges and were released on bail.In another development, Gary Gensler chief of SEC believed that ETH is an unregistered security. Consensys, a company working on Ethereum blockchain technology, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They accused the SEC of trying to control the future of cryptocurrency by targeting Ether, the cryptocurrency associated with Ethereum, as a security. This could have significant consequences for the entire cryptocurrency industry.ConclusionThese legal actions against cryptocurrency companies highlight the increasing attention and scrutiny from regulators. According to Coin Gabbar, authorities are focusing more on ensuring that these companies follow rules related to preventing money laundering and complying with securities laws. These developments highlight the challenges facing companies operating in the cryptocurrency space as they navigate complex regulatory landscapes and seek to maintain compliance while innovating in a rapidly evolving industry.Also Read: Dorsey’s Block Ventures Into Full Bitcoin Mining System

AI predicts Ethereum price for May 31, 2024


As the larger part of the cryptocurrency market begins to recover from the recent bearish hiccup, Ethereum (ETH) is no exception, but artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms currently do not see this recovery as a bullish sign for the crypto asset in the next several weeks.
Indeed, the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization is slowly pushing back up toward retaking the $3,000 level it had lost earlier this week after nearly two months of trading above it, following the most active day on its network for at least one year, according to the most recent charts.
Ethereum price prediction May 2024
However, despite such positive signs for Ethereum, the advanced AI algorithms do not see its price troubles ending by the end of this month, projecting it to drop to $2,534.25 by May 31, 2024, as per the latest data offered by the crypto monitoring and forecasting platform PricePredictions on May 2.

In other words, the algorithms predict that Ethereum will decline by 15.33% from its present situation, taking into account technical analysis (TA) indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and others.
Ethereum price analysis
At the moment, Ethereum is changing hands at the price of $2,993.07, which suggests an increase of 3.57% in the last 24 hours, having lost 3.80% across the previous seven days and accumulating a dip of 10.78% over the past month, as per the latest data.

Meanwhile, renowned crypto trading expert Ali Martinez has observed positive signals for Ethereum, highlighting that April 29 was the most successful day for the growth of its network in over a year, having recorded 139,560 new ETH addresses, as he explained in an X post on May 2.
Ethereum network activity. Source: Ali Martinez
As Martinez earlier pointed out, Ethereum is facing a strong resistance level at $3,200, which has emerged as a significant barrier due to, in part, the substantial holdings of approximately 2.34 million addresses collectively owning 5.14 million ETH purchased at this average price.

That said, a pseudonymous crypto influencer with a large following on social media, Mister Crypto, expects Ethereum to hit the price target of at least $10,000 at some point in the next run while also envisioning other crypto assets, like Bitcoin (BTC) at $100,000 and Solana (SOL) at $1,000.

In conclusion, Ethereum could, indeed, proceed to drop toward the low price target predicted by the AI algorithms, although some crypto analysts might disagree, highlighting the importance of doing one’s own research before investing a significant amount of money in any asset.

Shiba Inu is currently priced at $0.000021, with a 24-hour trading volume that increased by 50% to $833 million. SHIB’s market cap stands at approximately $12.3 billion.

After a remarkable 560% rise in the last 90 days, PEPE has seen a 22% decrease over the past week, with an additional 16% drop in the last 24 hours.




PEPE’s current trading price is $0.000006, and its trading volume over the last day rose by 28% to $980 million. 



Despite recent declines, PEPE remains the third-largest meme cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of $2.58 billion.

Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Analysts Predict Upside Following 20% Decline | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is experiencing a massive downturn. However, popular crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe has predicted that the cryptocurrency may be at the end of its correction, foreseeing potential upsides following a price bottom. 
Analyst Suggests Bitcoin Bottom Closing In
In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Wednesday, May 1, Poppe declared that Bitcoin was at the end of its correction phase, suggesting that the cryptocurrency’s anticipated bottom was finally closing in. 

The crypto analyst disclosed that BTC was down by 20% from its all-time highs in March 2024, predicting further declines possibly driven by market volatility and investor sentiment. As of writing, the price of the cryptocurrency is trading at $57,719, reflecting a weekly decline of 9.53%, according to CoinMarketCap.
Poppe further confirmed on May 2 that Bitcoin had largely completed its downward trend. He anticipates another 5% to 10% dip, clarifying that it may take some time before the cryptocurrency recovers and gets back to its previous bullish momentum.  
Sharing a price chart depicting Bitcoin/Tether (USDT) price movements from October 2023 to September 2024, Poppe highlighted special green zones between $56,000 and $58,000 to monitor. He explained that these levels could serve as crucial support zones for a potential upside if Bitcoin’s price correction persists. 
Despite the pessimistic outlook, the potential for a price rebound could emerge if BTC hits its bottom, as historically declines to lower levels have often preceded upsides.
Sharing a similar sentiment, crypto analyst, Ali Martinez has revealed that Bitcoin’s TD Sequential indicator on a 4-hour price chart was displaying a buy signal. He predicts that a rebound lasting between one to four candlesticks is expected for Bitcoin. 
Altcoins Set To Take Over As BTC Plummets
In his post, Poppe revealed that during Bitcoin’s period of consolidation, altcoins could see increased activity, potentially taking over the market until BTC breaks all-time high. The crypto analyst highlighted a recurring pattern, suggesting that Bitcoin tends to undergo a price correction before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with the price settling into a neutral position once the FOMC session concludes. 

Poppe has stated that following the FOMC meeting, he expects BTC to consolidate and go sideways while altcoins heavily outperform as rotation kicks in. He has also suggested that the present market condition characterized by BTC’s decline makes it a favorable time for investors to buy altcoins.
“Bitcoin reaching sub $57,000 pre-FOMC as tonights’ FOMC is one of the biggest ones of the year. I expect us to bottom anywhere soon. Altcoins have bottomed already, and I think that’s where you’ll find the ROI,” Poppe stated.

Biden vs Bitcoin: What all is at stake as U.S. election 2024 nears - AMBCrypto



SEC’s crypto involvement raises questions about partisan regulation in upcoming elections.
Darius Dale expects Biden-aligned policies in budget deficit financing.

Apart from the Bitcoin [BTC] halving, the US 2024 election stands as one of the most anticipated events of this year. 
Despite remarkable progress within the crypto industry under President Joe Biden’s administration, regulatory challenges persist. 
Notably, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) increased involvement in the crypto sphere prompts speculation: Will the widening partisan gap in crypto regulation influence the approach taken in the 2024 elections?
Senator Lummis criticizes DOJ’s Bitcoin stance
Amidst these looming concerns, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis recently criticized the Department of Justice (DOJ) for its interpretation of regulations concerning non-custodial software wallets.  
Voicing her apprehension on the same, Senator Lummis took to X (Formerly Twitter) and noted, 
“I am deeply concerned by the Biden administration criminalizing core tenants of the Bitcoin network and decentralized finance.’ 
She added, 
Source: Senator Cynthia Lummis/Twitter
The dispute emerged when the DOJ charged developers linked to Bitcoin mixers like Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash. These activities were deemed unauthorized money transmission by the DOJ.
Senator Lummis’s comment highlights the contradictory DOJ’s approach against past Treasury guidance, potentially criminalizing core aspects of Bitcoin and DeFi operations. 
Insights from Darius Dale
Separately in an interview with Anthony Pompliano, Darius Dale, CEO of 42Macro, discussed the impact of various developments on the crypto market and elections. 
Shedding light on the potential influence of President Biden’s administration on Treasury policy, particularly regarding how the budget deficit is financed. Dale said, 
“The Treasury knows the budget deficit is going to be, but how they choose to finance the budget deficit is sort of a discretionary.” 
This underlines the positive relationship between Secretary Janet Yellen and Joe Biden, and an expectation for policies that align with the administration’s objectives. 
Stock market trends
Historical data indicates that the stock market tends to exhibit strong performance in the period leading up to the presidential elections. In 2024, this trend is notably exceeding historical averages.
Source: Investing.com
Needless to say, Dale emphasized the importance of understanding the interplay between sticky inflation and Treasury policy responses and claimed, 
“We know we’re kind of very much in that debate process, but the early indications of that debate process are certainly moving in a hawkish direction.”

Analyst Forecasts Bullish Breakout for Shiba Inu Amidst Big Moves


							

A massive movement of 2 trillion SHIB tokens from Robinhood to an undisclosed wallet raises eyebrows, sparking speculation.



Analyst predicts a breakout for SHIB, targeting $0.000072323, advising buy orders around $0.000018343 to capitalize.



Inadvertent burns of 2 billion SHIB tokens reduce circulating supply, potentially boosting demand and price pressure.




Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracker, identified a big movement of Shiba Inu (SHIB) meme currencies on the famous investment site Robinhood. Nearly two trillion SHIB tokens were moved to an unidentified wallet, raising questions in the crypto world.







Over the past eight hours, a mysterious wallet identified as -4D935 has acquired two massive chunks, each containing 875 billion SHIB tokens, totaling 1.75 trillion SHIB. This transaction, valued at $39.2 billion, has sparked speculation about the intentions behind the transfer.



Meanwhile, cryptocurrency expert Ali Charts has seen a bullish pattern building on the daily trading chart of SHIB. Ali predicts a potential breakout for SHIB, targeting the $0.000072323 level. To capitalize on this anticipated surge, Ali suggests placing buy orders around the $0.000018343 price mark.







Despite the positive outlook, the Shiba Inu community suffered a setback in April when over two billion SHIB tokens were unintentionally burnt. According to Shibburn explorer, a total of 1,695,717,536 SHIB tokens were deemed unspendable owing to mistakes in transactions. These tokens, worth millions, were irretrievably lost, serving as a warning to investors to double-check wallet addresses before transferring funds.









The inadvertent burns significantly reduced the circulating supply of SHIB tokens, potentially impacting its market dynamics. As a result, the shortage caused by these burns may lead to greater demand and rising price pressure for SHIB in the future.



According to the latest reports, the price of Shiba Inu has been revealed to be $0.000022 while the stated hourly trade volume is $822,779,927. SHIB has climbed 4.00% over the last 24 hours to confirm increased investor appeal towards the meme currency. The performance is also reflected in the live market capitalization whose high value is over $12 billion and the total number of coins circulating of more than 589 trillion SHIB.

Web3 Publishing Platform Mirror Sells to Paragraph, Pivots to Social App 'Kiosk'

Paragraph founder Colin Armstrong says that his product differed from Mirror, at least initially, in that it tried to appeal more to a Web2 audience. Armstrong, who has written for tech publications in addition to working as an engineer at Google and Coinbase, says he also focused his product more on referral programs and other features to help authors widen their distribution. Mirror, meanwhile, managed to develop a stronger brand and design language, said Armstrong.

XLM vs ADA: Similarities and Differences



                    

Both Stellar and Cardano are crypto protocols with a long history in the ecosystem. They have evolved throughout the years and adapted to the changes and demands of the market. Let’s take a look at their similarities and differences, to find out which of them is a better investment. Then, you can decide if it’s the right time to purchase the tokens or if it’s best to do an HNT to IOTA swap at the moment.



XLM vs ADA: Similarities



XLM is the ticker of Lumens, the token of the Stellar blockchain. ADA, on the other hand, is the token of the Cardano blockchain. They share plenty of similarities. However, their approaches to various topics on crypto development are different. It’s important to take a deep dive into these factors before deciding which is the winner in the XLM vs ADA battle.




Smart Contracts



Smart contracts are the backbone of modern blockchains. Even protocols that weren’t created with this feature in mind have changed their software to include them, for the benefits they bring regarding the development of DApps. That’s the case with Stellar. In the beginning, it was intended to be a platform for cross-border payments, connecting banks and traditional payment systems. Although that feature still exists, Stellar now introduced smart contracts, allowing users to build DApps on top of it. Cardano, on the other hand, had this feature in mind for a while but didn’t deploy it until 2021.



Decentralization



Blockchain technology is intended to be decentralized and transparent, and protocols built using this architecture should follow suit. Stellar achieves decentralization by allowing anyone to create a node and participate in the consensus protocol. However, some critics argue the core development team still makes most decisions.



Cardano also encourages users to run network nodes and participate in protocol governance. Block consensus is reached using a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm, where anyone can participate.




Interoperability



The Stellar blockchain allows users to tokenize fiat currencies and assets, as well as transfer them. Moreover, it is designed to interconnect with other payment systems and banks. Anyone can use the protocol to build their own payment system using smart contracts, and these DApps would be compatible with one another.



Cardano focuses on interoperability with centralized banks as well. However, it also supports integrations with other blockchains, like Ethereum. This means that DApps developed on Cardano can be migrated to Ethereum and vice versa.



XLM vs ADA: Differences



Despite the similarities, Stellar and Cardano have differences both in their intended use and their technical infrastructure.



Use Cases



Stellar, as we mentioned, is mainly focused on providing a means for money transfers. You can get tokenized dollars and euros, but also Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. It has developed integrations with large apps, like MoneyGram, to bring the benefits of crypto to its users.




Cardano, as an Ethereum competitor, is focused on providing users with tools to build DApps and foster the creation of an internal ecosystem, with the ability to perform any function needed, growing based on the needs of its users.



Consensus Mechanism



Unlike most blockchains, XLM cannot be mined or staked. All XLM tokens were created at the time of launch and distributed evenly in the following five years. No network participant receives token rewards now, neither by staking nor mining. Still, users are encouraged to run servers and contribute with the validation of transactions.



Cardano uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm called Ouroboros. Stakers must participate in staking pools, and block validation is assigned randomly among pools. The reward is then distributed between the stakers.



Development Approach



A defining feature of Cardano is its reliance on peer-reviewed papers. All the technical documents of the blockchain are peer-reviewed and approved independently. While this improves Cardano’s security and performance, it has caused it to stay behind in innovation, even if it started developing the features before other competitors.



Stellar, on the other hand, is not as tightly connected to the scientific fields. Developments come from the core development team and other collaborators and are promptly deployed on the main network.



XLM vs ADA: Which Is a Better Investment?



As we’ve seen, both cryptos are solid and successful. They’re both among the most valuable by market capitalization, although Cardano ranks higher. The decision on which is a better investment depends on what you need it for. However, the Cardano blockchain is probably a better financial investment, judging by its current value and the activity of its deve

In this article, we will consider whether it is worth investing in TRON in 2024 and review its value forecast for the coming years.



                    

Tron is one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the market. It is currently ranked #12 by market value and top 30 by daily trading volume. It’s focused on the development of DApps using smart contracts, like many other projects in the ecosystem.



However, there are specific features that distinguish it from some of its competitors. If you’re thinking of investing in Tron, let’s take a deep dive into its features and market predictions. Then, you can either purchase some tokens or swap them. Using exchanges, you can trade XEM to TRX or any other pair using the tokens you already own.




TRON Overview



The Tron project is similar to Ethereum, Solana, and other DApp-focused blockchains. In fact, it was initially launched as a token on the Ethereum blockchain, in 2017. It was successful from the beginning and, one year later, it migrated to its own blockchain. You can also compare SOL vs TRX to find out what are the differences and similarities between these blockchains.



Tron supports the creation of smart contracts, which can be used to develop any kind of DApps, such as exchanges, marketplaces, or video games. In 2019, Tron’s CEO, Justin Sun, acquired BitTorrent and launched the BTT token shortly after.



TRX Blockchain & Consensus Mechanism



The Tron blockchain architecture is quite similar to others like Ethereum. However, it is differentiated by the use of the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm. New blocks are created every three seconds and validated by stakers known as Super Representatives (SR). Super Representatives are stakers who are voted by other network members. A new group of SRs is chosen every six hours. The mining reward is distributed between super representatives and the stakers who voted for them.




TRX DApps & Smart Contracts



Tron features smart contracts, like its competitors, to foster the creation of DApps on the blockchain. The building environment is called the TRON Virtual Machine (TVM), and it is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that applications built on Ethereum can be compatible with the Tron blockchain. Ethereum is the largest smart contract-focused blockchain, so it makes sense to start with it. But in the future, the Tron team plans to make other blockchains compatible as well.



TRON Price Prediction



The TRX token has had a great market run since its inception. It launched around September 2017 and, by January 5th, it had increased by over 11,000%, when it reached its all-time high. The price quickly fell, but this initial push, along with the appropriate technical and marketing decisions, has kept the price afloat and thriving. Despite the usual surges followed by sudden drops, the price has sustained an upward trend, and it is expected to follow in the coming years.



TRX Price Forecast for 2024



TRX’s price is currently around $0.119, and market analysts predict that it will be around $0.1624 and $0.23 throughout 2024, a growth ranging between 40% and 90%. This claim isn’t unsustained because, since May 2023, the price of TRX has been climbing steadily, increasing 85% in the last 12 months. This trend isn’t unlikely to drop soon, because both the community and the developers are active on the network.



TRX Price Forecast for 2025-2030



According to market experts, the subsequent years will also follow a similar pattern, with yearly gains of around 40% and 50%.




YearAverage price2025$0.25072026$0.36312027$0.51402028$0.63042029$0.83002030$1.1750



Is TRX Worth Investing In?



Tron is definitely one of the most valuable projects in the crypto ecosystem, and the TRX token is a highly profitable investment. While the safest advice is to do your own research and only invest what you are willing to lose, we can say that TRX is one of the tokens that can be considered a good idea to invest in and expect great returns.

The Interest Rate Statement of the US Federal Reserve (FED) Did Not Affect Bitcoin ETFs Positively! The Biggest Release Ever Happened! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Investors were surprisingly quick to dump U.S.-based spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday, even as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell dismissed the possibility of a rate hike.
US Bitcoin ETFs Record $563 Million Outflow Despite FED Chairman Powell Rejecting Interest Rate Hike
The 11 ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $563.7 million, marking the largest outflow since the funds began trading on January 11.


According to data from Farside Investors and CoinGlass, approximately $1.2 billion has been withdrawn from ETFs since April 24, continuing a five-day losing streak.
Fidelity's FBTC led the outflows on Wednesday with $191.1 million in withdrawals.





This development could be cause for concern for bulls, as FBTC and BlackRock's IBIT steadily attracted funds in the first quarter, offsetting regular large outflows from the relatively costly Grayscale ETF (GBTC).

GBTC had the second biggest exit on Wednesday with $167.4 million, followed by ARKB with $98.1 million and IBIT with $36.9 million.


These outflows came despite Powell's clearly dovish approach, which typically favors risk assets including Bitcoin. As expected, the FED kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5%.
While Powell reassured that the economy is solid enough not to require a rate cut, he also eased fears of new interest rate hikes or liquidity tightening caused by recent disappointing inflation numbers.

$10 trillion investment giant outlines tomorrow’s Bitcoin bulls


In the first year of the ‘crypto winter,’ pension funds – specifically Canadian pension funds – found themselves making headlines in various crypto outlets as they ended their cryptocurrency forays either before they began in earnest or after suffering major losses as companies like Celsius collapsed.
Things have quieted down since for large institutional investors – at least with regard to the crypto markets – albeit with some exceptions, such as Vanguard’s acquisition of a large stake in Bitcoin (BTC) miners.
This year, however, brought a massive change to the dynamic as in January, after years of waiting, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 9 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), seemingly opening the floodgates for crypto-wary investors to gain exposure using familiar vehicles.


BlackRock foresees massive institutional investors trading BTC ETFs
According to BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, the investment giant now expects BTC ETFs to see the coming of massive new and returning investors – Pension Funds, Sovereign Wealth Funds, and Endowments.
As of May 2024, BlackRock is reportedly playing the role of an educator for such institutional investors in hopes of attracting them to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and is seeing a general resurgence in interest from such entities.
At the time of publication, BlackRock operates tha second-largest Bitcoin ETF – the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) – which boasts approximately $17 billion in assets under management (AUM).
The financial giant is also working on closer relations with sovereign wealth funds – specifically the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund – albeit, at this stage, unrelated to the world’s premier cryptocurrency and is reportedly setting up the BlackRock Riyadh Investment Management (BRIM).
Headwinds or tailwinds?
While the approval of the ETFs certainly brought benefits for institutional Bitcoin adoption, the cryptocurrency’s continued volatility could still present a major roadblock for entities such as pension funds.
Indeed, the world’s premier cryptocurrency has been experiencing significant fluctuations in recent weeks as it has been trading in a relatively wide range between just under $57,000 and slightly over $70,000 without any guarantees about its forthcoming trend – though recent technical analysis (TA) hints at an imminent rally.
Still, the risks may ultimately not turn away major investors and traders as evidenced by two significant wealth managers  – Legacy Wealth Management and United Capital Management of Kansas – recently disclosing substantial stakes in BTC ETFs.

Pi Coin Price And Estimation Before The Mainnet Launch Da...


                                Pi Coin Price Touched $47 Prior to Mainnet Launch Date                                The mainnet of Pi Network is likely to be launched on June 28, 2024, but before the network mainnet goes live, there is a surge in the price of its Pi Coin. According to the information, Pi Coin is trading near its IOU price of $47 on major charting platforms. However, at present Pi Coin has no value because its mainnet has not been launched yet. In such a situation, this coin cannot be sold. The team associated with Pi Network has also announced that as soon as the network reaches 15 million KYC users, the mainnet of the network will go live.Currently, Pi Network has crossed the milestone of 10 million users KYC. Since then there has been a lot of enthusiasm in the Pi community. However, in the meantime, a race has started among the users holding large amounts of Pi Coin to find ways to sell this coin. Scammers have got the opportunity to take advantage of this hustle and bustle and they are targeting users holding Pi Coin.How to determine the value of Pi Coin before the Mainnet Launch?The most important process for the network's open mainnet to go live is to complete the KYC process for its 15 million users. Pi Coin has yet to cross the figure of about 5 million users because KYC of 10 million users has been done on the network. But still, the question arises how has the price of Pi reached $47? So, here’s the answer to the question. When the mainnet goes live, nothing like Pi Coin can be considered, that is, the mined Pi Network token has no value at present. But the Pi Network is currently testnet. Hence, there are Pi Coin IOUs traded on crypto exchanges like HTX and BitMart as traders exchange promissory notes in place of real tokens. In such a situation, the entire Pi Coin market is currently based only on speculation.Users becoming victims of scams due to Pi CoinThere is a lot of buzz on social media about Pi Coin, but its users who have become holders of this coin by mining it through the app, are now looking for ways to sell this token. Pi holders are also searching on social media to sell their tokens. Scammers are taking advantage of this activity of Pi holders and there has also been an increase in fraudulent activities by creating fake websites and fake accounts with Pi Coin holders on social media platforms. In such a situation, it is essential to be cautious while buying Pi Coin. Pi holders should take special care that this Pi Coin cannot be traded until the Pi network mainnet is launched. In such a situation, do not fall into any trap related to buying Pi Coin.Also Read: Pi Day Celebration and Emerging Pi Network Popularity

European Banking Giant BNP Paribas Buys Shares in Spot Bitcoin ETF | Cryptoglobe


                                
BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) via a spot exchange-traded fund.



According to a recent 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the bank has purchased shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), as first reported by Bitcoin Magazine.



Large institutional investors managing over $100 million in assets have to, every quarter, disclose their holdings via 13F filings and after the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., these filings have been closely watched by industry sleuths.







While previous filings for the first quarter of 2024 showcased purchases by asset managers, family offices, and several smaller banks, BNP Paribas’ involvement marks a turning point even though the bank allocated a miniscule part of its holdings to the flagship cryptocurrency, acquiring around $40,000 worth of it.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Analysts anticipate that further 13F filings leading up to the May 15th deadline could reveal a broader presence of institutional investors within the spot Bitcoin ETF landscape.



As CryptoGlobe reported, recent market volatility has put a spotlight on spot Bitcoin ETFs, with several experiencing record-high discounts to their net asset value (NAV) after Bitcoin itself saw a significant price drop. This raises questions about the unique challenges of these investment vehicles in a volatile market.



ETF analyst James Seyffart notes that while these discounts aren’t unprecedented, they do stand out given the historical range of premiums and discounts for these funds. Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, attributes the dislocations to factors like end-of-month rebalancing and Bitcoin’s price-calculation mechanisms used by ETFs, which can lead to discrepancies between market prices and these funds’ NAV.

Crucial Bitcoin On-Chain Metric Just Hinted at Strong Recovery

A critical look at on-chain metrics provides new insights suggesting a potential strong recovery on the horizon for Bitcoin, following the drop below $60,000. The "Bitcoin Fundamental Index" by Swissblock, which is a composite measure of various Bitcoin network health indicators, recently hit what appears to be an inflection point, signaling potential upward movement for Bitcoin's price.One of the key metrics to consider is the Short-Term Holder MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value), which currently stands at 0.96. This ratio essentially compares the market value (the current price at which Bitcoin is trading) to the realized value (the average price at which coins were last moved). A value below one typically indicates that short-term holders are holding coins at a loss, which can signal a potential bottom if other conditions align.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewWhen the STH-MVRV has dipped below one, it has typically been a precursor to a market recovery as it suggests that the selling pressure from short-term holders is waning and could indicate that sellers are exhausted. This exhaustion is further supported by the recent performance of the Bitcoin Fundamental Index, which shows a recovery from lower levels, suggesting increased network growth and investor confidence.Looking at the "Bitcoin Fundamental Index" chart, there have been significant spikes in the index correlating closely with increases in Bitcoin's price. The index itself measures several aspects of network health, including transaction volume, wallet activity and other undisclosed proprietary indicators that aim to gauge the overall sentiment and fundamental strength of Bitcoin.The current index value is nearing the higher end of its recent range. Historically, such patterns have indicated strong bullish sentiment building up, especially when combined with a low STH-MVRV.

Whales Dive In, But Dogecoin Price Sinks 20%: What's Going On?


                            Dogecoin (DOGE), the Shiba Inu-faced darling of the 2021 memecoin frenzy, has found itself shivering in the current crypto winter. Once a symbol of retail investor exuberance, DOGE has plummeted over 70% from its sky-high peak, leaving its future shrouded in uncertainty.

DOGE Feels The Crypto Frost
While Bitcoin, the heavyweight champion of the crypto world, grabs headlines with its recent wobble, the impact on memecoins like DOGE has been brutal. Unlike Bitcoin’s divided analyst opinions, the sentiment surrounding DOGE is decidedly bearish.
At the time of writing, the memecoin was trading at $0.132, down 5.4% up the last 24 hours but sustained a 20% loss in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.

Is DOGE A Canary In The Crypto Coal Mine?
Some analysts believe DOGE’s struggles are a canary in the coal mine for the entire crypto market. They said if even a historically high-flying memecoin like Dogecoin can’t hold onto gains, it raises serious concerns about risk appetite in the crypto space in general.

Dogecoin market cap currently at $18 billion. Chart: TradingView.com
Whales Accumulating DOGE: A Glimmer Of Hope?
However, a glimmer of hope flickers for the dethroned meme king. On-chain data suggests an increase in large wallet purchases of DOGE, hinting at potential accumulation by wealthy investors. This “contrarian” behavior could be a sign that some whales are using Coinglass or similar platforms to track Dogecoin derivatives and believe the coin is undervalued and ripe for a comeback.
Source: Coinglass
Coinglass, a popular cryptocurrency data provider, offers insights into factors that might be influencing the whales’ decisions. By analyzing metrics like open interest, funding rates, and liquidations on Coinglass, these investors might see an opportunity to buy DOGE at a discount.

In a similar development, Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracker, has reported that a DOGE whale arranged two large transactions in a single day. Some 150,000,000 Dogecoins were transferred in the first transaction, and an additional 76,316,694 DOGE were transferred in the second, for a total of almost 226 million DOGE. At the time, the meme cryptocurrency was worth around $40 million in fiat money.

Can Dogecoin Thaw The Crypto Winter?
The coming weeks will be critical for DOGE. The return of positive social media sentiment, coupled with continued accumulation by whales who might be strategically using Coinglass for market analysis, could be the spark that reignites the DOGE rally. However, if the broader market weakness persists, DOGE’s summer might be spent shivering in the doghouse.

CNBC's Mad Money host Jim Cramer recently shared his take on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks from the Fed's two-day meeting that just ended.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that raising interest rates was unlikely to be the Fed's next action. Officials would need to see compelling evidence that the policy is not tight enough to bring inflation back to its 2% target. Cramer told investors to believe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when he hinted on Wednesday that a rate hike was improbable, despite persistent inflation.Although Powell's comments temporarily calmed the markets, Cramer indicated that investors might become concerned again as job data will be announced on Friday. The numbers could provide more information about whether the economy is slowing or accelerating.Even though Powell stopped short of signaling rate cuts were likely this year or that rates were at a peak, Cramer said that the Fed chief had managed to take "the dreaded rate hike scenario off the table." Given Cramer's history of making predictions that turn out contrary, particularly in the crypto market, this raises the question of the implications of the recent developments on the macro front for cryptocurrencies. Implications for cryptocurrenciesHistorically, Bitcoin has had four April declines in the last decade, three of which foreshadowed May losses of 18% on average, according to Bloomberg data.Still, if inflation pressures ease and markets resume bets on a much looser Fed stance, cryptocurrencies and other speculative assets may see some respite.The Fed has maintained interest rates steadily in the 5.25%-5.5% range for nearly nine months, and Powell's statements did not imply that the central bank is inclined to drop rates anytime soon.It is unusual for interest rates to hold steady for more than a year. That said, the lagging impact of higher-for-longer rates remains a concern for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. This could be a tail risk that might keep bulls at bay.

Exverse Amps for Alpha with Big Token Listing and Tournament - DailyCoin


        
Exverse is setting the stage for its alpha launch.  



The web3 first-person shooter has secured major token listings and more in preparation for its launch. 



Exverse hints at further announcements, keeping excitement levels high.
Exverse, one of the most exciting web3 first-person-shooters, is only weeks away from its alpha launch. It is already moving with full force, marking key accomplishments, from bagging token listings on some of the world’s leading exchanges to hosting tournaments for players to battle for exciting prizes. Exverse Bags Major Token Listings Ahead of LaunchExverse is gearing up for its highly anticipated full alpha launch of its competitive PVP first-person shooter in mid-May, and it’s pulling out all the stops to make a grand entrance. On April 24, it made headlines by launching its native token EXVG on Bybit, a major crypto exchange with over 20 million users.Expressing their enthusiasm about the token launch, Fei Ooi Hoong, CEO of Exverse, shared, 
“We are extremely excited about our token launch and proud to work with a great partner like ByBit to make it happen,” “We worked tirelessly to develop a diverse, engaging, and intuitive first-person shooter capable of revolutionizing how the public views blockchain-based gaming. Our talented team tapped into its background in traditional gaming to develop a rich and immersive gaming experience and then strategically implemented the NFT elements and in-game economics to enhance the user experience.” Hoong continued. In addition to landing its token on Bybit, it has also secured listing on other major exchanges such as Mexc, Gate.io, and Bitpanda. Beyond that, Exverse has also been laser-focused on enhancing its game, making it an enjoyable experience for players. Exverse’s Focus on GamingLearning from trends set in 2022, where web3 games often prioritized crypto elements over gameplay, Exverse took a different approach by providing users with an immersive gaming experience. To showcase their platform, Exverse organized a thrilling tournament, allowing players to engage in high-octane battles and compete for EXVG.In anticipation of its alpha launch, Exverse treated 5,000 early waitlist members to an exclusive deathmatch-style tournament on April 15. Spanning five days, the tournament offered participants a glimpse into the adrenaline-fueled world of “Battle Planet,” where they could showcase their skills and vie for rewards in stablecoins and tokens.
With $50,000 in total up for grabs, the top 100 performers earned at least $200. Top five finishers earnings were dispersed accordingly:
1st place: $4,000



2nd place: $2,000



3rd place: $1,500



4th and 5th place: $1,000
The tournament ended with a resounding success, painting a vivid picture of Exverse’s unwavering dedication to crafting an electrifying gaming experience and the players’ excitement for playing it. Throughout the five action-packed days, adrenaline-fueled battles unfolded, witnessing over 60,000 intense matches and an astounding 1 million eliminations, of which a significant portion were headshot and grenade kills. As the hype around the game continues to rise, Exverse has also hinted at a potential launch on Epic Games, stirring up even more excitement. While details on the development remain under wraps for now, the prospect of Exverse expanding its reach to one of the biggest gaming platforms in the industry is enough to set pulses racing with anticipation.On the Flipside
Many major web3 companies like Yuga Labs shut down many of their web3 gaming projects, citing that they didn’t fit their vision. 



Despite web3 games collectively securing over $2 billion in funding in 2023, CoinGecko reported that three in four web3 games failed between 2018 and 2023. 
Why This MattersExverse’s recent accomplishments and preparations highlight its commitment to delivering an exceptional experience ahead of its alpha launch. By securing listings on major exchanges and organizing tournaments, Exverse demonstrates its dedication to creating a dynamic and immersive platform for players, positioning itself for a solid debut in the Web3 ecosystem. The FOMC’s decision to hold rates shakes the crypto market:Cardano Slips to Demand Zone After FOMC Holds Rates SteadySolana founder defends memecoins:Solana Founder Sneers at Claims of Memecoin Scaring Builders

Apple to Report Earnings After Market Close, What to Expect - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) will report its fiscal second-quarter earnings on May 2, 2024, after the market closes. Analysts expect the tech giant to post earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50, slightly lower than the $1.52 reported in the same quarter a year ago. The company is projected to generate revenues of $90.36 billion, marking a decrease from the previous year’s figures.



Apple’s Upcoming Earnings: Key Details and Expectations



As the earnings announcement approaches, investors and analysts will closely monitor key performance metrics, including iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The market sentiment surrounding Apple’s earnings is relatively low, given the company’s recent underperformance and a significant year-to-date stock price decline.





What to Look Out for in Apple’s Upcoming Earnings Results



One of the most critical focus areas will be iPhone sales, which are expected to decline compared to the same quarter last year. The Chinese market, where sales have been feeble, will be under the microscope. Another critical segment to watch is services revenue, which has been a growth area for Apple and contributes significantly to overall profits. Growth in this segment will be a crucial indicator of the company’s overall health.



Updates on Apple’s AI initiatives and any new AI integrations will also be closely watched, as they could impact future growth trajectories. Additionally, forward-looking statements and guidance for upcoming quarters will be crucial for assessing future performance expectations. Potential announcements regarding stock buyback programs or dividend changes could influence investor sentiment and the stock price.



As of the time of writing, Apple’s stock price was approximately $171.94, experiencing a slight increase of 1.56% in early trading hours. However, the stock has seen a decline of about 10.57% year-to-date, underperforming relative to broader market indices like the S&P 500.



Despite recent declines, Apple’s market capitalization remains around $2.61 trillion, maintaining its position as one of the largest companies by market cap. Analyst sentiment is mixed, with some projecting modest rebounds based on low valuation levels and potential positive surprises in earnings results.







Do you think Apple will post better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q2? Let us know in the comments below.

Crypto Analyst Predicts 244% Shiba Inu Rally Based On Bull Flag


                            An analyst explained how Shiba Inu could be heading towards a massive rally based on a bull flag pattern that forms in its daily chart.
Shiba Inu Has Been Consolidating Inside A Bull Flag Recently
In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about a bull flag that has recently appeared in the daily price of Shiba Inu. The bull flag is a pattern in technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, is shaped like a flag on a pole.
The pattern forms when an uptrend is followed by a period of consolidation inside a parallel channel toward the downward direction. The starting uptrend makes up for the pole, while the channel acts as the flag.

Like other TA patterns, the consolidation channel or flag here comprises two parallel lines. The upper level connects the price tops, while the lower one joins the bottoms.
When the asset retests either of these levels, it’s probable to undergo a reversal, with the upper line of the channel acting as a point of resistance and the lower one as support.
A break above the resistance line is considered a bullish signal for the price. The uptrend resulting from such a break may be the same length as the flag’s pole.
On the other hand, a drop below the flag (that is, a breakdown of support) invalidates the formation and may even suggest the takeover of bearish momentum for the asset.
Similar to the bull flag, there is also the bear flag in TA, which works much in the same way, except that it occurs during a downtrend (with the flag signifying consolidation towards the upside following a downward pole).
Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that shows the bull flag pattern Shiba Inu has potentially been forming on its daily price recently:

The formation that the memecoin's price has been displaying during the last few weeks | Source: @ali_charts on X
From the graph, it’s clear that the Shiba Inu 1-day price has been consolidating inside what appears to be a bull flag pattern channel in the past few weeks.
“I’m placing buy orders around $0.000018343, aiming for a bullish breakout that sends $SHIB to $0.000072323,” says the analyst. The former level is about where SHIB should meet the flag’s support next if it continues in its current trajectory, while the latter target is based on the height of the pole.

A run to the bullish target of $0.000072323 would imply a rally of more than 244% from the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, while from the lower support of $0.000018343, any such surge would correspond to a growth of over 294%.
It remains to be seen whether Shiba Inu will show a break above this bull flag pattern and, if it does, whether the price will benefit from bullish effects.
SHIB Price
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.00002110, down more than 18% over the past week.

Ripple vs. SEC: May 6 Reply Brief Could Seal Fate of XRP Institutional Sales


							

SEC’s reply brief in the Ripple opposition is due by Next Monday, May 6.



The reply brief concerns the $2 billion penalty the SEC proposed in March against Ripple.



Market pundits speculate that the SEC will likely persist in pursuing punitive disgorgement.




The XRP community anticipates that the U.S. SEC will submit a reply brief by May 6 in response to Ripple’s opposition to the regulator’s request for approximately $2 billion in penalties from Ripple.



For context, in the July 2023 victory judgment, the court also ruled that Ripple violated federal securities laws by selling XRP to institutions. Accordingly, the SEC has requested a civil penalty of $876.3 million, an additional $876.3 million in disgorgement, and prejudgment interest totaling $198.15 million, bringing the total proposed fines against Ripple to $1.95 billion. 



Furthermore, when the SEC filed its opening brief on March 22, advocating for an almost $2 billion penalty, it also accused Ripple of persisting in XRP sales to institutional investors post-complaint. As a result, the SEC urged the court to prohibit XRP sales to institutional investors.



However, in its opposition brief last week, Ripple presented compelling legal arguments opposing the SEC’s claims. Ripple contended that the XRP sales conducted after the complaint were to accredited investors and were facilitated through ODL transactions. These sales are exempt from U.S. securities laws, as they were carried out by Ripple’s Singapore branch, which is regulated by Singapore’s central bank. 









Additionally, Ripple’s president, Monica Long, testified that even these ODL transactions resumed after the July 2023 judgment because Ripple had ceased XRP sales since the SEC filed the charges.



Now, the SEC is expected to file its comment on Ripple’s opposition by Monday, May 6. Market pundits speculate that the SEC will likely persist in its pursuit of punitive disgorgement and injunction, restricting Ripple from engaging in further XRP institutional sales. Besides, on Monday, April 29, the SEC filed its opposition to Ripple’s motion to strike the SEC’s new expert materials. These filings are projected to be the final submission before Judge Analisa Torres decides on the penalty for selling XRP to institutional investors.

The Fidelity report on Bitcoin volatility

According to the recent report by Fidelity, Bitcoin is showing a reduction in volatility as it progresses as a mature digital asset. 
Fidelity has noticed that cryptocurrency volatility has dropped to historic lows on an annual basis. Furthermore, it has stated that in the last two years Bitcoin has been less volatile than Netflix.
Let’s see below all the details. 

Fidelity: Bitcoin volatility will continue to decrease
As anticipated, Bitcoin (BTC) has long been considered an extremely volatile asset, but its volatility is decreasing. 
This trend is expected to continue as the cryptocurrency evolves, according to a report published on Wednesday by Fidelity Digital Assets.
The analyst Zack Wainwright explained that new assets tend to go through a period of price discovery and stabilization. Even gold, after the United States abandoned the gold standard in the 1970s, showed high volatility.
Over the course of fifteen years, Bitcoin has already begun to show signs of maturity, with volatility at its historical lows on an annual basis. Wainwright commented: 
“We see a clear trend towards a reduction in volatility for Bitcoin over time and we predict that it will continue as the cryptocurrency further stabilizes.”
According to Fidelity, Bitcoin is currently less volatile than 33 of the companies in the S&P 500, and has been less volatile than 92 of these companies up until October 2023, when using 90-day realized volatility data. 
Bitcoin: less volatile than Netflix, but still sensitive to capital movements
In the last two years, Bitcoin has shown less volatility compared to Netflix (NFLX) and, when compared to the so-called “magnificent seven”, a group of high-performing stocks, the volatility of Bitcoin does not appear anomalous.
However, Fidelity has emphasized that, as is the case for all emerging asset classes with a small market capitalization, Bitcoin could continue to experience episodes of high volatility due to new capital inflows. 
The forecast is that, with the maturation of the cryptocurrency and the increase in its market capitalization, these effects will be mitigated, as new capital will be distributed on a broader basis.
The expected approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States in January and the resulting inflows could further reduce the volatility of the cryptocurrency. 
However, Bitcoin has experienced a decrease of over 16% in the last month. The report noted that, as Bitcoin consolidates, new capital inflows will also have a smaller impact on price movements.
Fidelity and other Bitcoin ETFs record significant outflows
Fidelity’s Bitcoin spot ETF recently recorded net outflows of $22.61 million, marking the first day with net withdrawals since the fund was launched in January. 
Other US cryptocurrency funds have reported daily outflows totaling $217.58 million.
Specifically, Grayscale saw $139.37 million leave its converted ETF, while Ark Invest and 21Shares recorded withdrawals of $31.34 million. 
Valkyrie had an overall outflow of 20.16 million dollars and Bitwise lost 6 million dollars. The only fund that saw net inflows, with 1.87 million dollars, was Franklin Templeton’s EZBC. 
The 71-day positive flow of BlackRock’s IBIT fund was interrupted on Thursday, although, according to James Seyffart of Bloomberg, zero flows are a common situation.
The research by Hong Song-uk, analyst at NH Investment and Securities, found that fund inflows into Bitcoin were almost non-existent after the cryptocurrency’s halving. 
Investors in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) have maintained a rather negative view for a long period. According to Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg, the 72-day period of constant outflows is the longest in the history of global ETF funds. 
Uncertainty and high fees could be the reasons behind GBTC’s difficulties compared to its competitors.

New Major Milestone for Shiba Inu (SHIB): Details


																TL;DR

Shibarium, the layer-2 blockchain solution for Shiba Inu, continues to grow robustly, surpassing significant milestones in blocks, transactions, and wallet addresses despite SHIB’s price struggles.
Recent developments in the network include a user interface update for better wallet compatibility and an upcoming hard fork to enhance user experience and transaction efficiency.


Shibarium’s Latest Achievement
Contrary to the unsatisfactory price condition of Shiba Inu in the past few weeks, the asset’s layer-2 blockchain solution – Shibarium – keeps making waves. 
Latest data shows that the number of total blocks on the network surpassed the milestone of 4.5 million. Total transactions currently stand at around 417 million, whereas wallet addresses are inching towards 1.8 million.
Shibarium’s progress looks quite impressive considering the fact that it officially saw the light of day at the end of last summer. The feature’s main goal is to foster the development of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem by improving speed, lowering transaction fees, and enhancing scalability.




Those curious to learn more about the network can take a thorough look at our dedicated video below:

The Two Important Upgrades
As CryptoPotato reported last week, Shibarium’s team launched a new user interface (UI) update, describing it as “faster, smoother, and more accessible than ever.” It aims to enhance compatibility with popular self-custody wallets including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. 
In addition, the developers revealed that Shibarium will undergo another upgrade this week through a “hard fork.” The advancement’s ultimate goal is to improve user experience, empower the community of developers and innovators, and implement quicker block processing times.
“We are also smoothing out transaction fee variations during high traffic times, making costs more predictable and fair for everyone. This ensures our platform remains affordable and accessible,” the team added.

Scoop: Justin Sun falsely claimed diplomatic immunity in lawsuit


According to sources familiar with the Richard Hall and Lukasz Juraszek vs Rainberry Inc. lawsuit, Justin Sun was not entitled to use diplomatic immunity to avoid liability concerning his actions while running the BitTorrent buyer.
This is despite long-term claims from the Tron founder’s legal team that his ambassadorial roles handed him this loophole.
A Web3 of lies
In 2021, Grenada announced that Sun had been appointed the Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization. This is true, as evidenced by a 2024 Grenadian news article that states Sun was terminated from his UN position, along with a slew of other foreigners who had cushy diplomatic roles, in 2022.
Protos has also obtained documentation confirming Sun’s status as a diplomat for Grenada and a visa proving that he was Ambassador for Science and Emerging Technology for Grenada’s Mission to the United Nations.
However, as detailed by the Associate Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Executive Office of the Secretary-General, Shirin Yaseen, this ambassadorship only grants diplomatic immunity in Switzerland when a representative is on a mission.



Sun was indeed an ambassador… But this meant precisely zero when it came to his court case.
Read more: Justin Sun insists he never meant to sell Tron and BitTorrent to US investors
“Issues of immunity regarding diplomats/representatives is a bilateral issue between the country in question and the US,” said Yaseen. “Immunity comes into effect only when we are carrying out our official functions.”
She added, “There’s no retroactive immunity.” This suggests that, regardless of whether or not Sun briefly obtained the immunity status, it shouldn’t have, and wouldn’t have, affected the outcome of the civil court case.
The source says that Sun first claimed diplomatic immunity in March of 2022, which is only a few months before the crypto billionaire lost his Grenadian WTO and UN ambassadorships altogether. As such, it’s odd that his legal team continued to suggest that Sun had any diplomatic immunity whatsoever through May 2023.
Sun’s plans fail
It’s clear that Sun attempted, through investing in Grenada, to create a diplomatic bubble in which he was untouchable — civilly and criminally. 
But the horse Sun hitched his wagon to bolted quickly when Grenada’s ruling party lost an election and he was stripped of his titles. Additionally, the titles and immunities Sun was able to acquire were so narrow in scope that there is no possibility that they would have functioned in the way Sun hoped.
Ultimately, the arbitrator in the civil case against Sun stated that:
“It is evident that Sun’s refusal to appear at deposition, in violation of the Arbitrator’s order are willful – they are knowing and intentional. Sun’s refusal to appear involves a violation fundamental to the case; despite his prior conduct acknowledging that his deposition was appropriate he refuses to be deposed at all.“

Endgame
Sun and Rainberry have settled the civil suit brought against them by Richard Hall and Lukasz Juraszek; diplomatic immunity didn’t pay off.
The arbitrator in the civil suit struck Sun’s testimony from the record and ordered a default against him. It’s unknown exactly what settlement was reached.
Sun doesn’t take trips to Switzerland or visit San Francisco anymore — his days of appearing at the World Trade Organization and making excuses for missing lunches with Warren Buffett are behind him. Instead, the billionaire spends the majority of his time hopping between countries where he’s least likely to be extradited to the US, and marketing TRON and his cryptocurrency exchanges.

Binance ties SAFU fund to USDC: Is the fund missing out on potential gains?

The Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU ) — an emergency fund established by crypto exchange Binance to cover user assets — contained various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), True USD (TUSD) and BNB (BNB).But on April 18, 2024, Binance denominated the entire fund — 100% of SAFU assets — in Circle’s USD Coin (USDC).The timing of this decision may seem odd, with the Bitcoin bull market in full swing, driven by the recent halving and high Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) volumes. In the conversion, Binance exchanged 1.36 million BNB, 16,277 BTC and its holdings from USDT and TUSD to USDC. With 100% of SAFU now essentially pegged to the U.S. dollar through a government-regulated stablecoin, what does this mean for Binance? SAFU funds will lose value in exchange for securityIn July 2018, Binance launched the SAFU and financed it by committing a small percentage of trading fees. On Jan. 29, 2022, the SAFU funds had reached $1 billion. The fund’s dollar value has fluctuated amid crypto market conditions, waning during the bear market and reappearing above the $1 billion mark again in April 2024. While denominating the fund in stablecoins will make it less susceptible to market swings, it also means that it will miss out on potential gains and be exposed to U.S. dollar inflation, as some market observers have noted. Billionaire investor and Draper Associates founder Tim Draper told Cointelegraph that he thinks Binance’s decision to modify the fund is “short-sighted.” He believes allocating 100% of a portfolio to a stablecoin pegged to the dollar is unwise, adding that he “doesn’t see government spending decreasing.” Recent: Bitcoin L2s set to explode as Runes congest BTC network“Governments have little incentive to decrease spending when they are able to print money that people accept,” he said.Bitcoin is widely considered a safe haven asset, similar to gold. Inflation, money printing and geopolitical instability are considered ideal conditions for BTC. According to Draper, the SAFU will decline as Bitcoin rises:“The dollar continues to decline against Bitcoin, and I believe that decline will continue and accelerate over time.”For others, missing out on potential gains may just be the price Binance has to pay for a secure fund.Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at fintech and crypto exchange YouHodler, agrees with Draper that “in such a configuration, SAFU funds will lose value due to inflation, but we can consider it as a payment for safety.” Lienkha told Cointelegraph that Binance could benefit from USDC’s fully centralized stablecoin setup, as it would be “less exposed to hacker attacks, stolen USDCs are much easier to find and block than decentralized Bitcoin.”He said that the SAFU “doesn’t have any specific investment goals, as it is a kind of insurance in case of emergency.” It could be possible that Binance prioritizes security over long-term valuation, but is Binance deciding freely or following orders? Binance may have its hands tied Binance may not have made the sudden exchange of SAFU funds to USDC voluntarily.Binance declined to answer Cointelegraph’s question about the precise motivations behind its decision. However, Binance’s recent history with U.S. regulatory authorities may be an important factor in adopting USDC for the SAFU.Grant Gulovsen, a U.S. lawyer who works with crypto clients, told Cointelegraph, “Binance had agreed to monitoring by the U.S. Treasury as part of their settlement late last year, so this certainly could be related to that.”In 2023, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance for violating trading and derivatives rules. Related: Here’s why CFTC suing Binance is a bigger deal than an SEC enforcementThe results forced Binance founder Changpeng Zhao to step down and settle a fine of $4.3 billion with U.S. authorities.Another consequence of the case was an agreement with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to extensively monitor Binance operations.Binance’s plea deal with the U.S. government also included five years of oversight by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), as detailed in an X post by former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official John Reed Stark:Source: John Reed StarkThe change to USDC may be part of this new compliance agreement Binance has with U.S. authorities. Why did Binance pick USDC? The stablecoin is widely branded within the crypto community as the market’s most regulated and compliant stablecoin. According to the compliance professional and board member of Crypto Valley Association, Ekaterina Anthony: “U.S. law enforcement have the same amount of power on both Tether, Circle and Paxos. They can ask any of them to stop serving certain entities if they desire to.” However, she told Cointelegraph that “it might be a bit more difficult to go after non-U.S. residents than to go after U.S. residents — that means that the directors of Circle might be easier ‘to grab.’”Binance’s USDC move highlights importance of complianceThe crypto market has matured rapidly from being considered a Wild West market to being acknowledged by institutional investors, exemplified by the approval of U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Indeed, many crypto market observers anticipate a massive injection of capital from institutional investors in the near future as they become more comfortable with digital assets. But, institutional investors require more secure and regulated markets.This has created competition among stablecoin issuers to create products that are compliant with emerging regulatory frameworks. USDT has dominated the stablecoin sector, mainly because it established itself as a first mover. However, Tether has been shrouded by fear, uncertainty and doubt due to its opaque approach regarding the assets backing USDT.Recent: Changpeng Zhao four-month prison sentence lighter than expectedIn contrast, USDC has branded itself as a highly regulated and compliant stablecoin since its launch in 2018. This has allowed USDC to take the lead in institutional adoption over Tether. Circle has also applied as an authorized stablecoin issuer under the new European legal framework, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation.Binance has previously shifted the balance of SAFU funds to more regulated assets. In March 2023, it replaced the Binance (BUSD) in the fund with True USD (TUSD), reportedly in response to U.S. enforcement action against the former’s issuer, Paxos.Binance’s move to adopt USDC may be highly induced by the oversight of the U.S. authorities. However, the exchange may be making a safe move, following the crypto industry’s trend of exhibiting regulatory compliance to attract the new wave of institutional investors.

Lightning fast Layer 1 token Sei is crashing today. 
                        Ethereum and Solana competitor Sei’s price has shed 11% in the last week, taking some of the heaviest losses in a brutal market-wide sell-off that sank the price of market leader Bitcoin by about 8% in the same period.Sei currently changes hands at $0.5385. This represents a slight gain of over 1% in the last 24 hours but a 24% decline from its price this time last month. Sei is an EVM-integrated blockchain Layer 1, merging Ethereum’s market-leading development framework with the speed and transaction cost scalability of high-performing rivals like Solana. Investors’ risk-averse sentiment this week appears to be spurred by news that the US Federal Reserve plans to keep interest rates higher for longer to help stem rampant inflation.Bitcoin retreated 9% in two days, from a high of $64,515 on Tuesday to its current price of $58,595. At the height of the crash, yesterday afternoon, the world’s number one cryptocurrency bottomed out at $56,804.Virtually all other leading Layer 1 blockchain tokens retained value better than Sei this week. Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), and Ethereum (ETH) dropped in tandem, only shedding a little over 3% this week.Sei’s trading chart over the last three months reveals a token that closely tracked Bitcoin. The market-wide rally that began at the end of February and peaked in early March helped Sei set a new all-time high (ATH) of $1.14 on March 16. However, it has since pulled back about 53%. Source: TradingViewThe Sei price and valuaiton is currently recovering and is in line with the rest of the market. Its Relative Strength Index is 59 and climbing, indicating increasing buying momentum. It has also appreciated almost 2% in the last hour, so Sei holders are likely out of the woods now.As SEI Price Tumbles, Mega Dice Hits Jackpot!
Scaleability and interoperability are the two hottest buzzwords in crypto right now because they represent the path to greater adoption.Both Bitcoin and Ethereum lag behind speedier and cheaper rivals, although in terms of interoperability, Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM) has helped the network’s developer community set smart contract and software standards across the whole industry.Still, since Layer 1 tokens often rise in sync, investing in them can feel predictable. Crypto and Web3 have a plethora of services to offer beyond more optimized tech.GambleFi is one sector that’s getting more of a look-in nowadays. The term refers to any crypto-native online gambling platform or product.According to data by Statista, online gambling is projected to take in $100.90 billion in revenue this year. This means there has never been a better time for crypto to show the world its iGaming utility. Enter Mega Dice’s brand new $DICE token.The $DICE presale is only a fortnight old, and it has already bagged almost $700,000 in investments, according to the token’s website.Mega Dice launched last year as the world’s first licensed crypto casino accessible through the popular messaging app Telegram.Since then, 50,000 players have signed up and helped the casino become a well-established name in GambleFi. As the platform’s native token, players can use $DICE to fund games and receive winnings. Casino customers who play with $DICE will have further benefits down the line. The casino plans to integrate the token into its loyalty program, offering more generous rewards to gamers who opt to play with it. The token will also unlock access to exclusive competitions and VIP experiences.The team has also indicated there will be a buyback and burn program. This means Mega Dice will periodically buy some of the tokens and remove them from circulation to help keep them scarce and drive value.Follow Mega Dice news over on X/Twitter and Telegram.Join the presale now on the Mega Dice website.

Former PayPal President says Bitcoin ‘will be the native currency of AI’


As cryptocurrencies proliferate and become more popular in the mainstream, particularly the most famous crypto asset and the sector’s representative, Bitcoin (BTC), could evolve to become the native currency of artificial intelligence (AI), as per the former President of PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL).
Indeed, David Marcus, the ex-PayPal President and current CEO of Lightspark, the platform enabling open payments over the Lightning Network, has shared his vision of Bitcoin for the future during a speech at MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations 2024 on May 1.
Bitcoin as neutral friction remover
Notably, he highlighted the need to remove the “friction of converting non-digital money into digital money” in payments, so an accepted method would have to be “digitally native” and “maximally neutral,” specifying that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset fits the bill.



“The Europeans are not going to accept an American version of a digital asset or vice-versa. And what is the most neutral form of digitally native, internet money? It’s Bitcoin. So, if you make it super-efficient, super-fast, real-time, at the speed of AI transactions, that’s basically going to be the native currency of AI.”

Internet-native medium for value transfer
Furthermore, Marcus observed the development of AI by Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Translate service, as this “thing you can talk to and it speaks another language (…) using unassisted, unaided learning, [and which] came up with its own neutral language to basically translate one language to another using its own thing.”
In this context, the former PayPal President pointed out that Bitcoin could, similarly, act as a neutral medium for transfer of value over the internet, in much the same way as Google Translate’s AI is using its own native made-up tongue to transfer meaning between languages:

“So what is it going to be for value between AI agents? Definitely Bitcoin. Because that’s the neutral language of value on the internet.”

Meanwhile, the largest asset in the crypto market was at press time trading at the price of $58,714, which indicates a 1.89% gain in the last 24 hours, while it tries to reverse the loss of 7.56% across the previous seven days, and the 9.88% decline over the past month, as per data on May 2.

XRP Ledger Sets New Standard for Lending Giant; Here's What to Know

RippleX developers have unveiled a game-changing proposal that intends to introduce a native lending protocol, codenamed XLS-66d. The new proposal lays the groundwork for deploying a groundbreaking lending protocol directly on XRP Ledger, which is intended to revolutionize how lending takes place on the blockchain.  The proposal establishes mechanisms for fixed-term, interest-accruing loans pooled from collective funds that do not require on-chain collateral. This strategy secures the protocol using off-chain underwriting and risk management, as well as a First-Loss Capital protection plan.At its core, the protocol will allow for easy lending, with terms agreed upon directly by the borrower and the lending pool's delegated manager. Unlike traditional lending protocols in DeFi, which are smart contracts that run on a virtual machine, the XRPL's Lending Protocol will be integrated directly into the ledger's consensus layer and protocol.The lending protocol would allow liquidity providers to contribute XRP or other fungible tokens into a lending pool managed by a pool delegate, earning interest.With an eye toward future development, the protocol will be designed to be both upgradeable and adaptable, allowing for a wide range of prospective enhancements while maintaining backward compatibility. The lending portion of the specification is intended to be implemented on top of another specification, resulting in a single asset vault on XRP Ledger. This is intended to open up other use cases beyond loans in the future, like yield farming, escrow and more. By using general ledger entries rather than single-use ones, the protocol ensures that components such as pseudo-accounts and tokenized pools can be used in a variety of future applications.

2 Months of Stagnant Bitcoin Price Action: Report


Despite the excitement surrounding the recent halving in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin may be entering a period of price stabilization that could last up to two months, according to market analysts at Bitfinex. 
The report suggests that Bitcoin will continue to set the pace for the cryptocurrency market through May and remain a critical indicator of the sector’s overall market cap.
Bitcoin Price Action Will Slowdown
Bitfinex analysts emphasize that consumers and businesses are now more informed about the economic foundations influencing market trends, unlike previous cycles. 
This knowledge could lead to a one to two-month consolidation phase for Bitcoin. As a result, prices could fluctuate, potentially reaching up to $10,000 in either direction. 
The anticipated stagnation follows Bitcoin’s peak market dominance, which seems to wane as liquidity shifts towards altcoins. This shift is attributed to the halving reduction of the new BTC supply. It historically boosts investor risk appetite and diverts attention toward altcoins.

“The 57 percent level in BTC.D represents a significant technical and psychological benchmark based on historical data. Once Bitcoin dominance reaches this level, it tends to experience a sharp rejection indicating a shift in market sentiment and capital flow from Bitcoin to altcoins. Following last week’s halving, we saw BTC.D reach 57 percent and then fall sharply through it,” Bitfinex analysts wrote.

Moreover, market specialists are watching Bitcoin derivatives closely. The reduced implied volatility seen recently suggests a quieter summer ahead for Bitcoin. 

“Summers are usually low volatility periods, and traders are starting to position accordingly based on their bias,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex Head of Derivatives, said.

As the market adjusts to the halving and economic signals, investors are advised to monitor these developments closely. They must keep an eye on shifts in liquidity and market sentiment that could dictate the pace for the remainder of the year.

LayerZero Labs Sets Stage for Airdrop With Snapshot - The Defiant

LayerZero's transfer volume surpassed $6.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024.LayerZero Labs, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, has completed the first snapshot ahead of its much-anticipated airdrop.The snapshot was taken at 11:59:59 PM UTC on May 1, 2024, according to an announcement on X. LayerZero did not share what criteria will determine eligibility for its upcoming airdrop, or any specific details about the airdrop.However, the project did state note this was snapshot "#1," hinting that additional snapshots to determine eligibility may be taken in the future. “More information coming soon,” the LayerZero teased.Airdrop hunters have long speculated that LayerZero may drop a token to users in the future.Airdrops serve as a means for web3 projects to distribute governance tokens to early users. This incentivizes adoption, with many users hoping to score free tokens flocking to early-stage projects. Recipients must meet specific criteria set by the project to be eligible for the airdrop.Following Aribtrum’s high-profile airdrop in March 2023, LayerZero’s cumulative transaction volume tripled over the course of a single month, with nearly 5 million transactions executed via LayerZero in roughly 30 days.In December 2023, LayerZero finally put the rampant speculation to bed by confirming that distributing a token to users was included as part of its roadmap.“We’ll state now in no uncertain terms that there will be a LayerZero token,” LayerZero Labs tweeted on Dec. 8, 2023. “Its distribution is something we’re committed to getting right and expect it to happen within the first half of 2024.”LayerZero adoption surgesIn the first quarter of 2024, LayerZero protocol hosted more than $6.7 billion worth of cross-chain asset transfers, marking a 91% increase from the quarter before, data from Messari shows.Message traffic surged, with 29.6 million messages sent via LayerZero for a 60% quarterly increase. This period also saw a 93% rise in smart contract deployments on LayerZero, indicating growing developer adoption of the protocol.In April 2023, LayerZero raised $120 million in a Series B funding round at a valuation of $3 billion.

Bitcoin Trader Insists The Bull Market is Not Over Despite Recent Pullbacks


							

Bitcoin trader known as “Titan of Crypto” has stated that the bull market is not over.



The trader used data from the BTC/USD daily chart to show there is still momentum in the Bitcoin uptrend.



Bitcoin broke below significant support early this week, dropping below the critical $60,000 level.




A famous Bitcoin trader identified as Titan of Crypto on X has stated that the bull market is not over. In a recent post, the renowned trader used data from the BTC/USD daily chart to show there is still some momentum in the Bitcoin uptrend amid several calls for the beginning of a bear market from some crypto users.







Titan of Crypto’s post comprised a screenshot of the BTC/USD daily chart with a pair of moving average indicators superimposed on the chart. He identified the indicators as MA111 and MA350*2. 



In his analysis, the trader spotted a couple of significant areas on the chart where BTC reacted uniquely to the indicators. In the later stages of the price action, Titan of Crypto highlighted a “Real Breakout” and two “Retest Points.” In between the “Retest Points,” he noted another point where the indicator signaled a price “Rejection.”



The trader combined the price action across those points to conclude there is still substantial momentum in Bitcoin’s upside movement despite the recent pullback. He believes the bullish momentum would remain until the MA111 line crosses above the MA350*2.



Bitcoin broke below significant support early this week, dropping below the critical $60,000 level. The drop followed a prolonged sideways movement after the flagship crypto reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,794 in the middle of March. 









The latest drop marks the most significant one-sided movement since the latest Bitcoin halving on April 19. The nature of the drop injected some Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) into the Bitcoin market, with many users suspecting a fresh bear market is emerging. 



Titan of Crypto thinks otherwise and believes the pullback is a temporary price movement. The pioneer cryptocurrency traded for $57,849 at the time of writing, marking a 23.5% drop from the ATH, according to data from TradingView.

Tether nets US$4.52 bln Q1 profit from investments


Tether, the company behind the widely-used stablecoin USDT, has reported a record US$4.52 billion net profit for the first quarter of 2024, a 61% increase from the previous quarter.



The substantial earnings were primarily driven by the company’s investments in US Treasury bonds and the appreciation of its Bitcoin and gold reserves, according to the firm’s Q1 attestation.



As of March 31, 2024, Tether’s net equity has surged to US$11.37 billion.



The company’s strategic allocation of over US$90 billion in US Treasury bonds has been a significant contributor to the profit leap. 

	
	
	
	


The financial performance of Tether hints at a possible strong backing for USDT, which maintains a 1:1 value with the U.S. dollar and has a market capitalization of approximately US$110 billion, according to CoinGecko.



The company said it issued 12 billion new USDT tokens in the first quarter.



The company’s Bitcoin holdings have doubled in value, reaching US$5.4 billion, and its gold reserves have increased to US$3.7 billion. 



Tether has not completed a formal audit. Instead, it provides quarterly attestation that reports US$6.3 billion in excess reserves and US$4.7 billion in secured loans.

	
	
	

	


Tether’s financial infrastructure extends beyond stablecoins, with ventures in data, technology, and the mining and energy sectors.

Crypto Bear Sentiment Grips Investors as Fear Spikes - DailyCoin


        
Bitcoin lost key support levels on Wednesday.



Bear sentiment has flooded crypto markets.



The Fear and Greed Index drops sharply into fear territory.
This week, a wave of bad news has engulfed markets, stirring bearish crypto sentiment.

Ripple Unlocks 1 Billion XRP From Escrow - How Will This Impact Price?


                            On-chain data recently showed that Ripple carried out its monthly escrow unlock for May. As expected, this has raised concerns about how it could affect the XRP price, especially since Ripple has been accused of manipulating the token’s price. 
Ripple Unlocks 500 Million XRP Tokens
Onchain data revealed 500 million XRP tokens were unlocked from Ripple’s escrow on May 1. The crypto firm is known to unlock 1 billion tokens monthly, although it looks to have only unlocked half this time around. The magnitude of these tokens always raises concerns, considering the negative impact they could have on the altcoin’s price if dumped on the market. 
Further analysis of the on-chain data shows that Ripple sent 300 million XRP out of the unlocked tokens to an escrowed account (2Not4co2op). Meanwhile, the crypto firm sent the remaining 200 million XRP tokens to another wallet (4vt5x1o91m). Considering that the 200 million XRP tokens weren’t sent to escrow, Ripple may have plans to sell them at some point, although it has yet to do so. 
It is also worth mentioning that Ripple received another 500 million XRP tokens from an unknown wallet (ymFZmKxEsF). However, these funds were immediately sent to an escrow account. As such, the community can heave a sigh of relief since most of the XRP tokens Ripple received in the last 24 hours have been sent back to escrow. 
Talks About Ripple Dumping On The Market Resurface
Following the latest token unlock, the crypto community has reignited talks about Ripple’s alleged dumping on XRP holders. The question of whether or not Ripple’s XRP sales influence the token’s price has been a long-standing discussion, with notable figures like pro-XRP crypto YouTuber Jerry Hall even accusing Ripple of intentionally suppressing the altcoin’s price with its sales. 
On the other hand, people like Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) have clarified that the crypto firm’s XRP sales do not impact the crypto token’s price. Moreover, Ripple already discontinued programmatic sales, which means that its transactions cannot affect prices on crypto exchanges. 
Ripple also noted in its recent court filing in its ongoing legal battle against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had taken measures to ensure its institutional sales did not violate securities laws. This suggests that Ripple conducts its sales over the counter (OTC) to avoid further scrutiny from the Commission. 
At the time of writing, the token is trading at around $0.5, up over 2% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

AI predicts Gold price for May 31, 2024


Gold has found its spot in many headlines in recent weeks thanks to its near-continuous surging to record highs – including rising to finish April at its highest-ever end-of-month price at about $2,300 per ounce. 
Indeed, with the stock market and economic outlook feeling uncertain and geopolitical fears mounting, the king of safe-haven commodities has indeed been climbing rapidly, with many experts – including Bloomberg’s Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone – predicting the precious metal is likely to hit $3,000.
Many, again including McGlone, have also concluded that, with the recent disheartening inflation data and a widespread belief that a recession has been postponed rather than avoided, gold has a substantial advantage over stocks and cryptocurrencies and that it will outperform many other assets in the long run.


Short-term predictions, on the other hand, are in a shorter supply and with gold trading with significant volatility in the last few days, Finbold decided to consult artificial intelligence (AI) of OpenAI’s flagship platform – ChatGPT – on where gold might find itself at the end of May.
AI forecasts gold price at the end of May
As analysts and experts are themselves highly bullish about gold’s likely performance by the end of 2024, the AI is also positive about the precious metal’s prospects.
Still, its most likely scenario would see gold remain in its press time range, either slightly below or slightly above its press-time price of $2,292. ChatGPT also offered a substantially more bullish forecast that would – at $2,450 – send gold well on its way toward the year-end forecasted value of $3,000.
Finally, the AI also sees a slight possibility that gold’s current slump could deepen and could, in one month’s time, find itself at $2,150.

While a rally toward $2,450 in one month’s time might appear ambitious, a substantial increase should not be entirely ruled out.
Indeed, gold has been both rising and trading with some volatility recently and though there have been few news as concerning as the possibility of a full-blown war between Israel and Iran that ran high in mid-April, the situation in the Middle East remains tense, and the situation in Europe is growing tenser with President Macron’s increasingly hawkish rhetoric.

After a gold slump in the second half of April, Nicky Shiels, Head of Metals Strategy at MKS PAMP, opined that ‘no new bad news is bad news for Gold (& Silver) bulls,’ and with the potential dangers looming ahead, the precious metal may indeed see a massive surge in the coming weeks.

Ethereum tops daily NFT sales at US$7 mln, ends weakest month of 2024


Ethereum closed Wednesday’s non-fungible token (NFT) sales as the top blockchain in the market, with US$6.87 million, CrptoSlam data shows.



The platform witnessed a slight decrease in total transactions to 14,840, compared to 14,987 the previous day, yet it maintained a high level of activity with 4,229 unique buyers and 3,304 unique sellers.



Ethereum closed its worst monthly NFT performance since October 2023.



In April, Ethereum recorded US$241 million in sales, which is more than half of the US$489 million it had in March, according to CryptoSlam data.

	
	
	
	


Bitcoin was Wednesday’s second-ranked position for NFT sales. Its gap from Ethereum wasn’t large, however, as Bitcoin recorded US$6.74 million in daily sales.



Bitcoin had a better month than Ethereum in April with more than US$602 million in sales to lead the market, but down from US$625 million in March.



Bitcoin collection sales were boosted by its halving event on April 20, which coincided with the launch of Runes, a new fungible token protocol for the world’s first blockchain network.



Solana came in third on Wednesday with US$2.54 million.

	
	
	

	


Solana also failed to improve from its March performance of US$249 million, dropping to US$153.5 million in monthly sales. 



Overall, NFT sales volume in April dropped to US$1.15 billion from US$1.53 billion in March. April had the lowest NFT sales in 2024 so far but still managed to record an increase of around 56% year-over-year.

Cocoa prices have fallen nearly a third from their record highs

A pile of cocoa podsPhoto: Chris Jackson (Getty Images)After starting the year on a tear that put the fear of God in Easter baskets everywhere, cocoa prices are backing sharply off record highs. Futures for the commodity have dropped nearly a third from the place it was at just a few weeks ago. It’s trading at just under $8,000 a metric ton. That’s still nearly double where it started the year, but considerably lower than the $11,461 mark it reached on April 19.Wegovy and Ozempic: Are we ready for weight loss drugs?Many chocolate producers that use cocoa to make treats hedge their costs months in advance so they’re not exposed to the volatility of spot markets — Hershey told investors its cocoa supplies were locked up a year out — but Bloomberg reports the stuff got so expensive that even traders weren’t buying it anymore. Some who had short positions had to close them out, which contributed to the increase, and others were scared to buy new contracts that would leave them with physical deliveries too pricey end customers.On an earnings call last month, Peter Feld, CEO of Swiss chocolate processor Barry Callebaut, laid out all the reasons behind the dramatic increase:There is literally a supply reasons behind that, initially we know that the weather obviously was impacting the crop volume in Côte D’İvoire as well as in Ghana significantly in the main crop last fall, that was probably the first element.The second element that led to these price spikes were driven by large industrial players ordering very late, actually very, very late. And that whole situation then got amplified on top by hedge fund activity that actually played on top. So the thing went vertical.Periods of intense rain followed by drought in West Africa have reduced crop yields, in addition to swollen root disease that is affecting the health of cocoa trees. But the Financial Times noted that because cocoa prices were so much lower for a long time before the recent spike, farmers didn’t have the money to address the issues.

Real-world asset (RWA) protocol Untangled Finance has announced its first on-chain securitization pool on the Celo blockchain. The pool is structured under Luxembourg’s securitization laws, collateralized by a diverse set of French working capital assets from fintech Karmen, and has a debt ceiling set at $6 million.The Credit Collective, supported by Fasanara Capital as the senior lender, has shown early support for this initiative, which is part of a larger €100 million senior facility agreement with Karmen. The pool offers access to credit analytics for verified investors who pass a comprehensive know-your-customer (KYC) process, ensuring asset protection against originator bankruptcy.“Traditionally, private credit has been accessible primarily to large financial institutions due to complexities in asset vetting and liquidity issues. At Untangled, our goal is to democratize access to these investment opportunities for DeFi investors worldwide in a risk-adjusted manner, while enhancing capital access and making financing more accessible for the growth engines of economies—SMEs,” stated Manrui Tang and Quan Le, co-founders of Untangled Finance. “As stablecoins continue to gain traction, these high-quality private credit securities provide robust backing, significantly enhancing their stability and reliability as a medium of exchange.”Untangled’s platform, which tokenizes real-world collateral like invoices and SME loans, has been operational since 2020 and has access to over 140 fintech lenders. Following the initial Karmen token pool, Untangled plans to launch additional pools, including the Fasanara Diversified Fund on-chain and a senior note backed by Eastern European invoice finance assets.“The Untangled Finance team is pioneering private credit tokenization,” said Isha Varshney, Head of Ecosystem at the Celo Foundation. “By bringing fintech lending onchain with an innovative credit assessment models, Untangled showcases the potential of tokenized real-world assets to improve access to funding and risk management for entrepreneurs and businesses worldwide.”RWA protocols usually aim for decentralized ecosystems with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL), such as Ethereum and Solana, as the RWA.xyz “Private Credit” dashboard shows. Despite its modest TVL of nearly $100 million, Tang explains that Celo was chosen for multiple reasons, including a mutual focus on RWAs as a key initiative and a shared vision for their future potential.“Untangled is multichain and will soon deploy on other blockchain platforms, We chose to start our journey with Celo […] We believe that community funding from groups like the Credit Collective will encourage the continued proliferation of RWAs. Recently USDC and USDT were natively deployed on Celo, making it easy for investors to transact,” she adds.Gabriel Thierry, co-founder & CEO of Karmen, highlights that this RWA effort bridges the decentralized and traditional finance sectors, enabling Karmen to accelerate its deployment of working capital loans for French SMBs.

Solana Is In Unprecedented Prime Condition, Says Developer


								In a post on X, Vibhu Norby, the CEO of the Solana-based company Drip Haus, has painted a detailed picture of Solana’s recent journey through scalability challenges and significant user growth. His analysis sheds light on both the obstacles and the advancements within the ecosystem.
Why Solana Is In The Best State Ever
Norby begins by recounting the substantial increase in network activity that Solana experienced between December and April due to the memecoin craze. He describes this period as both “exciting and challenging,” with the network peaking at 160,000 daily active users (DAUs) and over half a million new users onboarding.
Despite the surge, Norby points out a downside to this rapid expansion: the influx of “many low-quality wallets,” which he accepts as an inevitable aspect of such growth phases in blockchain networks. The increased load led to severe network congestion starting on March 2, escalating to a point where the blockchain became “unusable for us and practically everyone else” by the end of March.
Norby describes this period as “very sobering” for all developers involved with Solana’s decentralized applications (dApps), prompting a scramble to deploy solutions that were originally slated for a later stage. “The intense growth and then pullback pushed us to build fast and rush our scaling solutions to market that were probably normally a year out,” he explains.

Despite these challenges, the CEO’s tone shifts to one of optimism as he discusses the current state of Solana. “Now we sit at the door of the next phase, all the big puzzle pieces we envisioned are around the corner,” Norby notes, indicating a turning point for the network.
He reports that all key metrics have stabilized, with the network maintaining an impressive count of approximately 100,000 DAUs. He emphasizes Solana’s continued dominance in the crypto and collectibles space, highlighting its standing as “the biggest consumer product in crypto and collectibles by a wide margin.”
One of the most significant changes Norby highlights is the improvement in product quality, which he credits for the “incredible growth” in what Drip Haus refers to as “p5 DAUs.” This measure tracks the most engaged users who utilize the product as intended. Norby reveals that this group now consists of 25,000 daily users, describing this as the kind of dedicated user base “you dream of having for a consumer app.”

Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana based Helius Labs recently also celebrated Solana’s success in terms of DAUs. He remarked, “I’m generally against DAU metrics for blockchains (especially low-fee ones) but *returning* DAUs (meaning not new addresses via sybil) is useful to look at and that seems to be the highest it’s ever been in Solana history.
Solana DAUs | Source: X @0xMert_
Norby’s enthusiasm escalated as he discussed the near future: “And I am so pumped about the next few months. I will be loud about it and keep pounding the vision. Only up.” This sentiment underscores a strong confidence in the continued growth and enhancement of the Solana ecosystem.
At press time, SOL traded at $137.5, up 10.5% in the last 24 hours.

Trader Who Called 2021 Collapse Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC May Be In for More Downside - Here’s His Target - The Daily Hodl


								A trader known for several accurate crypto market calls says that Bitcoin (BTC) may not be done correcting after suddenly dropping below $58,000.
Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 146,700 followers on the social media platform X that he is closely watching to see if Bitcoin will hold as support at a key Fibonacci retracement level.










Based on historic precedence, the analyst had accurately predicted a possible move down to around $58,000.
“I don’t really see too much drama in BTC at the moment, still in the range, still some wiggle room down to the .382 fib, the standard of previous consolidations. Perhaps much of the nervousness comes from the fact that price moves in multiple thousands now that it is so high whereas in terms of percentages it is BTC normal.”
Source: Dave the Wave/X
However, the analyst warns a break below the .382 Fibonacci level, which is around $58,000, could send Bitcoin plummeting to around $48,000.
“$58,000 is the 0.382 real retracement of the recent move as commensurate with the previous. Effectively hit now. Let’s see if it holds. If not, could be in for a larger BTC correction down to $48,000 odd.” 
Source: Dave the Wave/X
He also warns that altcoins will likely plummet if Bitcoin continues to decline.
“If BTC moves down further, most likely alts will too. I’ve some bids set.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $57,017 at time of writing, down 5.9% at time of writing.

BlackRock Anticipates Renewed Institutional Interest In Bitcoin Spot ETFs - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) - Benzinga

Despite a recent pause in inflows to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after a continuous 71-day streak, industry experts predict a resurgence led by a broader investor base. What Happened: Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock BLK, the world's leading asset management firm, suggests that the lull may soon be replaced by inflows from a variety of institutional investors.According to Mitchnick, financial giants such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and endowments are likely to begin engaging with spot ETFs in the upcoming months, Coindesk reported. “The re-initiation of the discussion around bitcoin is turning on how to allocate BTC into portfolio constructions,” Mitchnick explained during an interview. He further elaborated on the educational role BlackRock has been playing to facilitate this transition: “Many of these interested firms are having ongoing diligence and research conversations, and we're playing a role from an education perspective.”Since their approval in January, the pent-up demand for these ETFs has resulted in over $76 billion accumulated across various products. Mitchnick also highlighted that while some registered investment advisors (RIAs) are already offering BlackRock's IBIT ETF, a full-scale offering to clients of large wealth advisory firms like Morgan Stanley is anticipated soon.Social media buzz often revolves around the comparison of assets under management between different funds such as IBIT and Grayscale's GBTC. At present, IBIT holds about $17.2 billion, trailing behind GBTC's $24.3 billion. However, a significant portion of IBIT's assets is attributed to transitions from Grayscale and inflows from higher priced international products or bitcoin futures ETFs converting into spot products.Mitchnick pointed out that existing bitcoin holders prefer the ease of managing their cryptocurrency within a brokerage account, emphasizing the benefits over complexities like custody and tax reporting. “While becoming the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF would be an impressive milestone, BlackRock isn't really focused on that competition, but rather on educating its clients,” he stated.Also Read: Jack Dorsey’s Block Under Examination From Authorities Over Alleged Sanctions ViolationsWhy It Matters: BlackRock has also been preparing the groundwork for an Ethereum ETH/USD ETF, with CEO Larry Fink discussing the potential of tokenization and the representation of traditional assets on blockchains last November. Mitchnick posed a critical question regarding investor education in the complex Ethereum ecosystem and the rationale for diversifying into another crypto ETF when a spot bitcoin ETF could already be enhancing portfolio Sharpe ratios.Highlighting the broader potential, Mitchnick noted, “When we think about this space, we see the potential for digital assets to benefit our clients and capital markets, focusing on three areas: crypto assets, stablecoins and tokenization. These pillars are all interrelated, which is crucial for people to understand.”What’s Next: As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, discussions like these will be central at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry leaders will converge to share insights and strategies for navigating the expanding world of digital finance.Image: Shutterstock

                        As the market recovers by 2.5% in the past 24 hours, we run through the best crypto to buy today, covering Pepe (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF) and Optimism (OP).All three of these coins have outperformed the market as a whole, which has rebounded today after a very disappointing start to the week.Its losses stemmed in part from negativity surrounding the possibility that the Federal Reserve would hold rates as they are or even raise them, largely because inflation still remains relatively high.However, the Fed kept rates unchanged in its FOMC meeting yesterday, and it counteracted any negativity by also announcing that it would reduce the speed and severity of its recent quantitative tightening program.This came as a relief to markets, with the three cryptos featured below all benefiting more than most others.Best Crypto to Buy Today, May 2Pepe (PEPE)PEPE has rallied by an impressive 18% in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.057446 and easily cementing its position as one of the best cryptos to buy today.This price means it’s also up by 50% in a fortnight and by 520% in a year, with the meme token remaining highly popular among whales as a vehicle for profit.Source: TradingViewIn fact, data suggests that a whale has recently accumulated a large quantity of PEPE, having withdrawn more than $2 million in the token from Binance in the past 24 hours.Combined with PEPE’s bullish indicators, this would suggest that the token has more gains in store in the near term.Assuming the market as a whole continues to recover, it could reach $0.0000080 within a week, and potentially $0.000010 in a month or so.dogwifhat (WIF)WIF has jumped by 15% today, with its move to $2.76, which also represents a 12% gain in a fortnight.That said, the popular Solana meme token remains down by 28% in a month, while it’s also down by 43% in relation to its all-time high of $4,83, set in late March.Source: TradingViewSuch declines have given WIF’s chart quite a bearish appearance, even with the gains of the past couple of days.However, we are about to see the coin’s 30-day average (orange) overtake its 200-day (blue), providing a bullish reversal that could signal a period of sustained recovery.Indeed, its RSI (purple) has just hit 70 after spending around a week near or below 50, meaning that the market had oversold it recently.It’s also encouraging that its volume has climbed today, reaching approx. $675m from barely $275 million a couple of days ago.This could suggest that the WIF price will enjoy more rallies in the coming days, potentially helping it to return to $3 in the next one or two weeks.Optimism (OP)Rounding off this list of the best crypto to buy today is Optimism, which has recovered by 4.5% in the past 24 hours.It has reached $2.72, marking a 14% gain in a week and a 23% increase in a fortnight.This makes it one of the best-performing major tokens over these periods, even if it is up by only a modest 28% in a year.Source: TradingViewOP’s indicators give the impression that the altcoin – the native token of layer-two network Optimism – has recently begun a medium-term growth cycle.Its 30-day average climbed over its 200-day yesterday and is continuing to rise strongly, indicating plenty of momentum and buying pressure.Likewise, its relative strength index is hovering the 60 level and looks like it could rise some more in the next few days, meaning that OP’s price will rise with it.Other positive features include the fact that the coin’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are both moving up in parallel, implying that it will trade within a steadily rising band.And more fundamentally, Optimism remains one of the biggest layer-two Ethereum networks in the sector, with close to $1 billion in total value locked in.OP’s price should therefore see more joy in the coming days and weeks, potentially returning to $3 quite soon.Diversification Alternatives – Crypto Presales
The coins, above all, hold the potential for further gains in the shorter term, yet because they have already risen strongly recently, buyers need to be aware of the possibility of corrections.However, there are many newer tokens in the market that still have the potential to rally big in the near future, with presale coins, in particular, being one promising source of gains.Such coins are native to new projects that are opening their launch to investment from whale and retail investors, who can equally buy a token early before it becomes big.As with any other investment, investing in presales comes with risks, with some projects potentially failing to gain enough traction or adoption to become a success.Yet recent history has shown that some of the biggest sales can be highly lucrative for early investors.This is especially the case if a given project becomes successful and grows, something that can put initial investors in line to post big returns.To help investors identify the tokens that have the best chance of succeeding, analysts at Cryptonews have scoured the market for the best new presales.Best Presale to Buy in 2024

                        The Solana price has gained 10% in valuation today, with the SOL price moving to $137.28 as the cryptocurrency market as a whole posts a 2% increase in 24 hours.This move comes after a bad start to the week for the entire market, with SOL still down by 5% in the last seven days and by 23% in a month.However, the coin still sits on a 525% appreciation in the past year, and with it retaining plenty of medium- and long-term momentum, today’s recovery could easily continue over the next few days.Solana Price Prediction as SOL Gains 10% Overnight — Is It Time to Load Up?
Looking at Solana’s technicals, it’s initially hard to decide whether it’s going to come back down again or will see further rises in the near term.On the one hand, SOL’s relative strength index (purple) has touched 70 – an overbought position – and looks as though it has begun declining.Source: TradingViewOn the other hand, the coin’s 30-day average (orange) still hasn’t climbed over its 200-day (blue) yet, meaning that the token still has time for more gains before it becomes decidedly overbought.One thing that’s particularly positive about SOL’s chart today is that its trading volume has risen to $5 billion, up from only $2 billion a couple of days ago.In other words, there’s clearly a lot of demand to buy Solana at the discount offered by the recent downturn, with the alt still remaining the second-most popular alt among digital funds (behind Ethereum).The past 24 hours have also seen some very significant transfers, with one unknown wallet sending nearly $200 million in SOL to another unknown wallet in the past couple of hours. SOL’s fate in the near term depends on the wider market, which appears to have bottomed out after this week’s big fall but could still have a few more wobbles before returning to sustained growth.Part of the reason for market pessimism is that the Federal Reserve doesn’t look like it will cut rates anytime soon, having kept them where they were yesterday.Yet the expectation remains that rates will be cut later in the year, at which point the market will see more obvious joy.This will help the Solana price, which could hit $150 in a few weeks and $200 by the end of the summer.New Altcoins for New Rallies
Traders may not be overjoyed about having to wait several months for a big SOL rally, yet numerous newer tokens do have the potential to beat the market over a shorter time span.This includes several presale tokens, which can often rally big when listing, as a result of generating momentum during their sales.One of the newest and most interesting of these is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme coin that has just launched its token offering.Despite opening its sale only yesterday, it has already raised more than $100,000.Source: sealana.ioThis is a strong sign that investors are already taking a shine to Sealana, which is aiming to become the latest Solana meme token to storm the charts.It has adopted the ever-lovable seal as its meme mascot, with the Sealana character styled as a somewhat oafish trader who happens to make some big profits trading.Traders can purchase some as part of its sale by going to the official Sealana website, where they can send SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6cSEAL is available at an exchange rate of 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which works out to around $0.0199 at current prices.Buyers will receive the tokens they purchased via the coin’s airdrop, which will happen when the sale ends.And from there, Sealana will list on exchanges, where it could follow in the footsteps of DogWifHat and potentially moon.Buy SEAL Today

Justin Sun Applauds SHIB, Names Traits of Successful Coins - DailyCoin


        
Crypto billionaire Justin Sun weighs in on memecoins at Token 2049.



Mr. Sun sends a shoutout to Shiba Inu, piquing SHIB Army’s interest.



Shiba Inu whips up 8.8% gains on Thursday as BTC reclaimed $58K.
Cryptocurrency billionaire Justin Sun praised Shiba Inu (SHIB), as well as other competing memecurrencies, in a May 1 message on X.“Meme coins may seem unconventional, but they highlight the power of community in crypto,” reads Sun’s tweet, while a video snippet dives deeper into his stance. The interview was filmed at Token 2049, where Sun explained to a curious audience that whether a project is memecoin-based or not, it requires long-term dedication to succeed.What Makes SHIB so Successful?Alongside naming Dogecoin (DOGE) one of the “top crypto brands,” the TRON blockchain founder and owner of HTX asserted that every crypto project needs to cover a couple of cornerstones to achieve long-term success. 
Sun portrayed Shiba Inu (SHIB) as a cryptocurrency with one of the most vibrant communities. Community participation and social engagement played a pivotal part in SHIB’s growth over the first years of its inception on the blockchain.Sun stressed the importance of a fair token launch, which opens the door for major crypto exchanges to list the cryptocurrency and further bolster interest among retail investors.Half a year after its launch, Vitalik Buterin donated over 50 trillion SHIB tokens to India’s Crypto Relief fund, which was established to help people in need during the global pandemic. The altruistic deed warmed the hearts of dog lovers and crypto aficionados, now encompassing 3.8 million followers on X.Where Is Shiba Inu Heading Next?SHIB remains in the 12th position by global market capitalization, distanced from DOGE by $5.5 billion. Lately, Shiba Inu succumbed to the trials and tribulations of the ongoing crypto meltdown, most evident in Bitcoin’s (BTC) plunge to $56K last weekend. That symbolizes a 21.6% backtrack for the leading digital asset from its latest all-time peak at $73K, claimed just two months ago.
Sporting a high price correlation with BTC, SHIB also slipped by 11.8% over the past 30 days, recording a weekly low at $0.00002076, according to CoinGecko. Moreover, this concludes an 8.8% deficit in weekly terms for SHIB, similar to BTC.However, Shiba Inu’s support cluster from $0.000022 to $0.000023 assists in keeping it on track. At this level, 43.17T SHIB tokens are held in over 50,000 crypto wallet addresses. As of press time, Shiba Inu is exchanging hands at $0.00002287 with an 8.8% upswing over the past 24 hours.On the Flipside
The heated discussion about the alleged dangers of memecoins leading the crypto market started in March,when several blockchain enthusiasts sounded the alarm on “meme coins scaring away serious builders.”
Why This MattersMarch 2024 went down in the history books as the most successful period for the meme currency department, resulting in $56 billion at its bull cycle peak.Discover DailyCoin’s trending crypto news:Altcoin Season: Tips and Tactics for Market ResearchPolygon (MATIC) Plunges in BTC-Led Flush: Can It Hold Support?

With about 10 million SOL in TVL, Jito is the largest protocol on Solana, followed by Marinade and Kamino, which have TVLs of $1.35 billion and $1.026 billion, respectively. Decentralized exchange Raydium is fourth with $612.77 million in TVL, ahead of Marginfi, which has $420.22 million.The performance has also propelled Jito to sit among the top-five cohort leading the overall liquid staking market across all blockchains, with the protocol now accounting for 3% of the $45.5 billion value locked in liquid staking protocols.Lido still dominates the overall liquid staking market with a TVL of $27.6 billion, ahead of Rocket Pool, Binance, and Mantle at $3.6 billion, $2.6 billion, and $1.4 billion, respectively.

U.Today presents to you the top three stories over the past day; don't miss this piece!500% spike in Shiba Inu token transaction fees shocks ShibariumYesterday, May 1, transaction fees on Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 solution, saw a significant increase. According to data by Shibariumscan, gas commissions paid in BONE surged from 12 BONE to 61.47 BONE, demonstrating 500% growth. The increase in fees on Shibarium can be explained by a number of factors, with the primary one being heightened network activity. Due to the recent rise in popularity of Shiba Inu tokens amid market instability and heightened investor interest, the demand for transactions on the Shibarium network has surged. The confirmation of this online activity spike is an extraordinary increase in active accounts, which jumped up by 211%, from 1,724 to 3,650 over the same 24-hour period.Bitcoin (BTC) at end of correction, top analyst suggestsDespite April being Bitcoin's worst month since October 2023 due to a substantial price plunge, Michael van de Poppe, renowned market analyst, believes that the flagship crypto is at the end of its correction. In his recent X post, van de Poppe wrote that BTC has plummeted by 20% from its recent highs, and there may be more downsides for the coin in the future. Even though a potential recovery is anticipated for Bitcoin from this point, the analyst stated that in the event of a further drop, one should closely watch the green zones between $56,000 and $58,000. Concluding his post, van de Poppe projected that altcoins will likely rebound before Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $59,156, up 3.27% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.Robinhood makes important announcement for Uniswap usersRobinhood, a popular online brokerage, has recently taken to X platform to announce that the Robinhood Connect feature has become available on Uniswap wallet.

Bitcoin Déjà Vu: Analyst Identifies Trends Reflecting 2016 Cycle


                            Cryptocurrency analyst Rekt Capital has come up with an intriguing narrative pointing to several trends in the current price action of Bitcoin that are similar to the price trends seen in the 2016 bull cycle, even as market sentiments continue to dwindle. 
Bitcoin Trends Reiterating 2016 Pattern
According to Rekt Capital, more than a month after the initial analysis, Bitcoin keeps demonstrating how much it closely resembles the cycle of 2016. Similar to 2016, Bitcoin has experienced further declines over the past three weeks following the Halving below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range also known as the Post-Halving Danger Zone
The post read:
Over a month later Bitcoin continues to prove how it is more similar to the 2016 cycle. Just like in 2016, Bitcoin in this cycle is seeing additional downside below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range in the three-week window after the Halving (i.e. Post-Halving “Danger Zone”).
Given that Rekt Capital already addressed the concept of the Post-Halving Danger Zone, the analyst is not shocked by this current price decrease. During the 2016 cycle, about 21 days after the Halving event, BTC saw a lengthy decline of 11% before transitioning toward an upward direction.

It is worth noting that Rekt Capital noted that if downside volatility around the Re-Accumulation Range Low is going to happen in this cycle, 2016 history indicates it may happen during the 15 days following the Halving. Since the recent event was concluded about 12 days ago, the expert’s prediction could be realized in the upcoming days. 
Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters ‘Danger Zone’ Post-Halving, Analyst Warns Of Potential Downside
While the Post-Halving “Danger Zone” ends in 15 days, 2016 data suggests that there may be some negative volatility in the interim, possibly reaching the $60600 Range Low.
Drawing attention to previous patterns, Rekt Capital highlighted a similar pattern between the 2016 and 2024 pre-Halving re-accumulation range. After a breakout from the re-accumulation range this year, BTC witnessed a Pre-Halving rally, as was observed in 2016.
Pre-Halving Retrace Movement
Just like in 2016, once the pre-Halving rally peaked, Bitcoin started its Pre-Halving retrace. Specifically, this occurred roughly 28 days prior to the Halving event in both 2016 and 2024.

A negative wick on the weekly candle indicates a significant reaction in the first week of the pre-Halving Retrace in 2016. However, this reaction was fleeting and came before an extended price decline.
This cycle likewise saw a strong early reaction from Bitcoin via a downward wick, but there are indications that this reaction might not have lasted long. Thus, to avoid a fate similar to that of 2016, Rekt Capital believes that BTC will need to maintain highs around $60,000 and beyond.

Helium Mobile Introduces New $20 Group Plans Offering Unlimited Data - The Defiant

Helium's group plans offer unlimited talk, text, and data.Helium Mobile, a wireless telecommunications provider powered by Helium Network, has launched group plans offering unlimited services for $20 per user in a bid to expand its share of the U.S. mobile carrier market.Announced on May 2, Helium Mobile said that their group plans offer unlimited calls, text, and data per line. Groups can comprise up to eight people.According to a 2023 report by online billing aggregator, Dexo, the average American family spends about $1,300 yearly on mobile services.

Base Unveils Second Onchain Summer Hackathon - The Defiant

Base will offer up to $2 million in rewards and incentives to builders during the campaign.Base, the third-largest Layer 2 network by TVL, has announced a second season of its Onchain Summer hackathon.Announced on May 2, Onchain Summer II will commence on June 3 and run for one month, offering up to $2 million worth of ETH as incentives to developers in the form of prizes and grants. The campaign will then “showcase daily experiences” to promote on-chain adoption throughout July and August.“Onchain Summer is an annual effort that brings us closer to the next chapter — where on-chain is the next online,” said Jesse Pollak, the creator of Base and head of protocols at Coinbase. “We’re calling on creators and builders everywhere to shape the next era of the internet and help bring the next billion users on-chain by showing what’s possible.”Buildathon finalists will receive a share of 200 ETH in rewards. Base will also offer small retroactive builder grants to developers that present initial prototypes and ideas, and gas creditors of 0.25 ETH to participating developers.Pollak emphasized that featured projects will have the opportunity to reach a broad audience of web3 users. Pollak will present additional information about Onchain Summer II at the ongoing Farcon hackathon in California.Base rises to contentionOnchain Summer II aims to build on last year’s event, which hosted participation from more than 268,000 wallets over 23 days and helped to propel adoption for the then-newly launched Layer 2 network. The campaign featured 75 NFT collections spanning art, gaming, and advocacy, driving more than 700,000 token mints.Base now ranks as the third-largest Layer 2 network with a total value locked (TVL) of $5.18 billion, equating to a market dominance of 13.75%, according to L2beat.The network’s growth was recently propelled by a surge in memecoin trading, with its TVL up nearly 350% from $1.16 billion at the start of March.Base also ranks as the top Layer 2 network by daily throughput, processing an average of 27.2 transactions per second over the past 24 hours.Coinbase Smart WalletBase teased that Coinbase’s upcoming Smart Wallet is expected to launch on mainnet in time for Onchain Summer II.Coinbase’s Smart Wallet leverages account abstraction to offer a simplified user experience that removes many of the frictions associated with traditional web3 wallets. The wallet went live on Base’s Sepolia testnet for developers in February. Pollak said the mainnet deployment will take place this quarter.“Smart wallet allows users to create a new wallet instantly for any on-chain app using just a passkey – no app downloads, extensions, or seed phrases required,” Pollak added.

Crypto for Advisors: Digital Asset Custody’s Future

One of the most flexible options out there, MPC is not limited to a specific network by a smart contract, but it does require trust in potentially opaque partners. MPC is closer to the base layer of crypto, the private key entropy, and all the participants in an MPC wallet participate together to recreate the private key, instead of having multiple private keys send their own valid signatures. There’s Qredo and Lit protocols for those who are more technically savvy, which are fully decentralized solutions, but for advisors that want a little more white glove treatment and are willing to work with trusted third parties, Anchorage just released their enterprise solution, Porto, and my own company Hedgehog just released an MPC account management product with a focus on fund administration, sub-advisory, and turnkey asset management programs.

Shiba Inu team member Lucie recently delved into the discussion of burns, citing Shiba Inu's founder Ryoshi's burning of keys to the Shiba Inu supply.Lucie was responding to a comment on X by a community member who asked about Shiba Inu's lead, Shytoshi Kusama, and when burns were coming. In response to this, Lucie explained the reasoning behind Shiba Inu founder Ryoshi's decision to burn the keys to the Shiba Inu supply. Lucie explained that Ryoshi's burning of keys to the Shiba Inu supply "means that for anything to be burned, it must first be purchased." This implies that whatever would be destroyed must first be acquired. "In order to conduct burns, users need to generate income to facilitate the process," the SHIB team member further explained. Lucie also addressed calls that SHIB developers do something about burns, saying that Shiba Inu's lead, Shytoshi Kusama, and the other developers are not the key to burns. This is because they do not hold tokens to burn. Lucie highlighted that the SHIB community is the driving force behind burns, such as burning tokens or transactions. This explains why the focus is on drawing additional projects to Shibarium and encouraging users to bridge. Lucie claims this is how more SHIB will be burned. Shiba Inu layer 2 Shibarium to undergo hard forkThe impending hard fork of the Shibarium network marks a watershed moment in the evolution of Shiba Inu's blockchain ecosystem.The Shibarium hard fork includes significant updates to two key components of the Shiba Inu blockchain ecosystem: Bor and Heimdall. These fixes are intended to improve network efficiency, optimize consensus mechanisms and introduce additional scalability-supporting functions.The hard fork events are planned as follows: Shibarium Bor Hard Fork: May 2, 2:30 a.m. EST (block height: 4504576). The Shibarium Heimdall Hard Fork is slated for May 3 at 12:30 a.m. EST (block height: 3941864). This hard fork implements milestones to reach deterministic finality on the Shibarium network, which improves transaction confirmation reliability.

Peloton (PTON) Faces Disappointing Earnings, CEO Departure, and Debt Challenges - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ: PTON), the once-thriving exercise equipment company, continues to grapple with declining sales, leadership changes, and mounting debt. The company’s fiscal third-quarter results fell short of expectations, with revenue of $718 million slightly below the anticipated $723 million and a loss per share of 45 cents, surpassing the forecasted 37 cents loss. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue decline.



Leadership Overhaul and Strategic Transition



In a significant leadership shift, Barry McCarthy stepped down from his role as CEO after serving for two years, succeeding founder John Foley.As part of a broader strategic overhaul, the board has appointed Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo as interim co-CEOs while initiating a search for a permanent replacement. McCarthy will continue to serve as a strategic advisor until the end of the year, ensuring some continuity during the transition period.





Mounting Debt and Financial Restructuring



Peloton’s financial woes are further compounded by its accumulation of over $1 billion in debt and difficulties aligning spending with revenue.



In response to these challenges, the company has implemented cost-reduction measures, including layoffs and restructuring plans to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million by the end of fiscal 2025.



Additionally, Peloton is actively pursuing a refinancing strategy, working with major financial institutions like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to extend maturities and reduce leverage at a reasonable cost. The primary goals of this refinancing effort are to lower debt levels, extend the maturity of existing debts, improve financial stability, and potentially reduce the cost of capital.



Peloton Stock Plunges After Weak Fiscal Q3 Earnings



Peloton’s stock price currently stands at $2.78, reflecting a 13.66% decline from its last close.



The company’s year-to-date return of -52.15% significantly underperforms the S&P 500’s +5.75% return over the same period. Peloton’s stock has experienced a 67% decline over the past year and a staggering 97.14% drop over the last three years.



The market initially reacted positively to the news of the CEO’s departure and restructuring plans, with the stock surging more than 12% in premarket trading. However, following the company’s conference call, the stock opened over 6% lower, indicating ongoing investor concerns and uncertainty surrounding Peloton’s prospects.







Do you think a case can be made for Peloton’s recovery? Let us know in the comments below.

Nigerian court postpones money laundering trial of Binance and execs

The trial of Tigran Gambaryan, a Binance executive detained in Nigeria since February, has reportedly been postponed until May 17 after another delay in court.According to a May 2 Reuters report, lawyers representing Binance said they had not received documents necessary to move forward with a money laundering case involving the firm, Gambaryan, and regional manager Nadeem Anjarwalla. The trial was expected to begin on May 2, but a judge reportedly adjourned proceedings until May 17 to allow the legal team to review the documents.The trial is separate from tax evasion charges brought against Binance, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. All parties have pleaded not guilty in the money laundering case. A bail hearing for Gambaryan is scheduled for May 17. Anjarwalla and Gambaryan traveled to Nigeria in February to address claims that Binance manipulated the country’s fiat currency, the naira. Authorities detained and charged both men with tax evasion and money laundering, but Anjarwalla reportedly escaped custody and fled to Kenya, where he holds nationality in addition to the United Kingdom. Interpol reported on April 30 that extradition proceedings for Anjarwalla were moving forward.Related: Changpeng Zhao gets 4 months, Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years — Why?Many have criticized the Nigerian government’s charges as lacking merit. Authorities in the country detained both executives as Binance announced that it intended to cease all naira transactions, calling into question the timing of the arrests. Binance said Gambaryan had “no decision-making power” at the crypto firm.In a separate criminal case in the United States, a judge sentenced former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to four months in prison on April 30 following his guilty plea for failing to maintain an Anti-Money Laundering program. Zhao is expected to report to a facility in Oregon or Washington at a date to be determined.Magazine: Lazarus Group’s favorite exploit revealed — Crypto hacks analysis

What are Parachains? Polkadot's Secret Weapon Explained - Decrypt

With an ever-growing number of blockchain projects, achieving interoperability and scalability between blockchains is increasingly important.Polkadot’s solution to this challenge is ‘parachains,’ a technical approach to allowing distinct blockchains to scale and work together effectively and safely, leveraging the Polkadot network’s guarantees of security, isolation, and communication.What are parachains?Unlike most other blockchains such as Ethereum, Polkadot isn’t built to have much inherent functionality. Instead, Polkadot acts as a ‘Relay Chain’ on top of which multiple parallel layer-1 blockchains, known as parachains, can be hosted side-by-side.These different blockchains can be built for specific use cases, and then come together to form an ‘internet of blockchains’. These different blockchains can all natively use Polkadot’s token DOT, as a common currency.By design, the Relay Chain does not support things like smart contracts, dapps, or even the ability to transfer assets. Instead, it works to find a consensus between different parachains performing the more outwardly facing use cases.This basic layer, which is called a ‘Layer-0 blockchain’, uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, much like Ethereum following its Merge in 2022.This consensus mechanism uses Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE). This is derived from Ouroboros, a protocol created by computer scientist Aggelos Kiayias, which is shared by Cardano.The web of parachains built around Polkadot are able to send not just tokens, but also data between one another. This means developers building around Polkadot can build services that take advantage of multiple distinct parachains, rather than one sole chain.You could compare this to how countries in the European Union (EU) maintain separate economies but can trade goods, services, and workers freely.Each separate parachain is free to set its own parameters, including transaction fees, block times, governance mechanism, and mining rewards.The vast majority of current parachains, as well as the Polkadot Relay Chain, use a development framework known as Substrate, provided by British technology firm Parity Technologies.However, although they are synergistic, they can be mutually exclusive—you don’t need to use Substrate to develop and maintain a parachain.Blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, Tezos and Cardano run numerous smart contracts on one blockchain. As a result, their blockchains compete for the same limited computing resources within the network.Having multiple independent blockchains with their own computing resources can help reduce issues surrounding congestion, execution times and hard-to-predict running costs.There is currently a limit of around 100 parachains on Polkadot network, although in September 2023, Parity Technologies said that there is a roadmap to expand support to up to 1,000 parchains.Sidechains and parachains: what’s the difference?Parachains bear some outward similarities to ‘sidechains’: separate, related blockchains which are built on top of blockchains such as Ethereum—but they are markedly different.Sidechains also look to improve scalability and interoperability for blockchains. Examples of sidechains include the Polygon Network as well as the BNB Smart Chain (BSC).But sidechains each have their own consensus mechanism and token, whereas parachains on Polkadot share the same consensus mechanism, the Relay Chain.What is the Kusama network?A key underlying component of Polkadot’s network of parachains is the Kusama Network. This network acts as a sort of pre-production environment for Polkadot, or a sandbox that allows parachain developers to try out new ideas. It’s been described as a "canary network."Kusama still shares most of Polkadot’s major design features, but projects on Kusama have much less strict governance. This allows new projects to work out any technical flaws, as to build momentum and a loyal user base.Kusama is a functioning, independent, ‘real’ blockchain, rather than a ‘testnet’.A testnet is a blockchain that uses the same underlying framework as the parent blockchain but no real funds are used, and they don’t use the same coins as the main database.How are people using parachains?Developers are currently building parachains for a wide variety of different use cases. Some examples include:
⭐ Astar: One of the most popular parachains in terms of adoption, Astar incorporates Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) WebAssembly which allows developers to make dapps for applications such as DeFi, NFTs and DAOs.
📱 Nodle: This parachain aims to bridge Web3 and the physical world by turning smartphones into edge nodes that interact with sensors and devices in the physical world, using basic iOS and Android apps.
🌙 Moonbeam: A smart contract platform built using the Substrate blockchain framework, which allows developers to build decentralized apps (dapps) using smart contracts, which can integrate with networks such as Ethereum.
How do you start a parachain?To earn a place on the Polkadot network, projects need to competitively bid against each other via auctions. These auctions govern which projects get to connect to the Relay Chain and when.The number of successful places is intentionally kept scarce by the Web3 Foundation, as a means of increasing competition within the ecosystem.Once a project gains one of these invaluable leases, they last around 96 weeks. On the Kusama sister network, these leases last a maximum of 48 weeks.These auctions primarily work using ‘crowdloans’. Here, community members support their favorite projects by temporarily locking their tokens down in support of their favored projects.These are then kept in separate modules within the Relay Chain which is not in the project’s control. This helps to prevent ‘rugpulls’ by developers with bad intentions. If the bids are unsuccessful, the coins are automatically returned to their owners.What is the future of parachains?Though not available at the time of writing, the Polkadot Relay Chain is set for a major update, which will make significant changes to how the Relay Chain functions.The upcoming Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) upgrade would allow Polkadot’s Relay Chain to run more generic “services” including smart contracts; the Relay Chain will continue to support existing Substrate-based parachains.The Web3 Foundation is currently offering roughly $10 million of prize funds to developers implementing JAM. The prize pool looks to reward those working in different programming languages.As of April 2024, the JAM update is still subject to stakeholder approval, pending a vote by holders of Polkadot’s DOT token. The Polkadot community can currently vote on Referendum 682 to approve the upgrade. The graypaper which fully explains the technical changes to how the Relay Chain will work can be viewed here.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin mining firm Stronghold considers potential sale - Crypto Briefing




Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. (NASDAQ: SDIG), a vertically integrated Bitcoin mining firm, has announced the initiation of a formal strategic review process to explore alternatives for “maximizing shareholder value,” including the potential sale of all or part of the company.In its first-quarter 2024 earnings release, Stronghold reported revenues of $27.5 million, a 27% increase sequentially and a 59% increase year-over-year. The company also reported a GAAP Net Income of $5.8 million and a non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $8.7 million for the quarter. GAAP refers to “generally accepted accounting principles,” a set of accounting rules, standards, and guidelines that publicly traded companies in the US adhere to.The recently concluded earnings call from Stronghold mentioned that the firm has executed an agreement with Voltus, Inc. to assist in capturing demand response opportunities, which could further enhance economics when importing power from the grid.Notably, Stronghold has retained Cohen and Company Capital Markets as its financial advisor and Vinson & Elkins LLP as its legal advisor to support the company’s management team and board during the strategic review process.Stronghold, which operates two facilities that burn coal refuse to generate electricity for its mining operations, has a current market capitalization of nearly $40 million. The company’s shares, which were trading at around $11.25 in late 2023, have recently been trading at approximately $3.Despite these financial results, Stronghold’s board and management team have decided to explore strategic alternatives, citing a “valuation dislocation” when comparing the company’s market value to those of public Bitcoin mining peers, merchant power companies, and data center and power generation assets.“We believe that our 130 MW of existing Bitcoin mining capacity could potentially be expanded to over 400 MW for either Bitcoin mining or advanced computing, such as that which is used for artificial intelligence and machine learning,” said Greg Beard, chairman and CEO of Stronghold.The decision to explore strategic alternatives comes in the wake of the recent Bitcoin halving event, which has raised concerns about the profitability of mining operations. However, Stronghold’s press release did not explicitly attribute the decision to halving-related pricing, despite Beard’s statements that the mining company needs to adapt to the effects of Bitcoin halving on output efficiency.The company emphasized that there is no definitive timetable set for the completion of the review, and there can be no assurance that any proposal will be made or accepted, or that any transaction will be consummated.

Famous trader Peter Brandt has once again sparked a heated debate in the crypto community with his latest Bitcoin price prediction. In a recent social media post, Brandt asserted that if Bitcoin manages to maintain its current price levels and continues its upward trajectory, it could follow a classic pattern indicative of a bull market continuation.Brandt's analysis, accompanied by a chart depicting his vision, suggests that despite recent fluctuations, Bitcoin could be poised for a significant rally toward the $74,000 mark, revisiting its previous all-time high. This optimistic outlook, however, has not been universally embraced. "I'll welcome your money"Some skeptics have questioned Brandt's credibility, meaning his previous predictions suggested both a correction to $40,000 per BTC and the possibility that Bitcoin had already reached its peak. Nonetheless, Brandt remains resolute in his belief that the cryptocurrency is in the midst of a bull market, emphasizing the importance of adaptability in successful trading. Responding to criticism, Brandt rebuffed detractors, asserting his decades-long experience in trading and the necessity for flexibility in navigating volatile markets. In a direct challenge to one skeptic, Brandt confidently declared his readiness to capitalize on their doubts, suggesting they risked losing their capital in the process.Whether Bitcoin will indeed follow Brandt's projected trajectory remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the legendary trader has once again sparked debate and captured the attention of investors.

AI Tupac vs. AI Drake



A little over a year ago, a fake AI song featuring Drake and the Weeknd racked up 20 million views in two days before Universal memory-holed the track for copyright violation. The shoe was on the other foot this week, however, when lawyers for the estate of Tupac Shakur threatened Drake with a lawsuit over his “TaylorMade” diss track against Kendrick Lamar, which used AI-faked vocals to “feature” Tupac. Drake has since pulled the track down from his X profile, although it’s not hard to find if you look.



Deep fake nudes criminalized



Apps like Nudeify simplify the process of creating deep fake nudes. (Nudeify)



The governments of Australia and the United Kingdom have both announced plans to criminalize the creation of deep fake pornography without the consent of the people portrayed. AI Eye reported in December that a range of apps, including Reface, DeepNude and Nudeify, make the creation of deepfakes easy for anyone with a smartphone. Deep fake nude creation websites have been receiving tens of millions of hits each month, according to Graphika.







Baltimore police have arrested the former athletic director of Pikesville High School, Dazhon Darien, over allegations he used AI voice cloning software to create a fake racism storm (“fakeism”) in retaliation against the school’s principal, who forced his resignation over the alleged theft of school funds.Darien sent audio of the principal supposedly making racist comments about black and Jewish students to another teacher, who passed it on to students, the media and the NAACP. The principal was forced to step down amid the outcry, however forensic analysis showed the audio was fake and detectives arrested Darien at the airport as he was about to fly to Houston with a gun.







Everyone — in the media at least — seems to hate Meta’s new AI integration in the Instagram search bar, mostly because it’s too eager to chat, and it’s not very good at search. The bot has also been joining Facebook conversations unprompted and talking nonsense after a question is asked in a group, and no one responds within an hour.

An AI Catholic Priest was defrocked after just two days for endorsing incest. The California-based Catholic Answers introduced the Father Justin chatbot last week to answer educational questions about the Catholic faith.



But after it started advising people they could baptize their children with Gatorade, and it blessed the “joyous occasion” of a brother and sister getting married, Catholic Answers was forced to apologize and demote the chatbot to plain old Justin. “Prevalent among users’ comments is criticism of the representation of the AI character as a priest,” CA said. “We won’t say he’s been laicized because he never was a real priest!”



It’s just “Justin” now. (Catholic Answers)



Rabbit R1 reviews



As soon as wildly popular tech reviewer Marques Brownlee said the Rabbit R1 “has a lot in common with Humane AI Pin” you knew the device was doomed — Brownlee absolutely slated Humane’s device two weeks ago. The Rabbit R1 is a much-hyped handheld AI device that you interact with primarily through voice, with it operating apps on your behalf. Brownlee criticized the device for being barely finished and “borderline non-functional”, with terrible battery life, and said it wasn’t very good at answering questions.



TechRadar called the R1 a “beautiful mess” and noted the market couldn’t support “a product that is so far from being ready for the mass consumer.” CNET’s reviewer said there were moments “when everything just clicked, and I understood the hype,” but they were vastly outweighed by the negatives. The main issue with the dedicated AI devices so far is they are more limited than smartphones, which already perform the same functions more effectively.






Fake live streams to hit on women



New apps called Parallel Live and Famefy use AI-generated audience interaction to fake big social media audiences for live streams – with pickup artists reportedly using the apps as social proof to impress women. In one video, influencer ItsPolaKid shows a woman in a bar that he’s “live streaming” to 20,000 people, she asks him if he’s rich, and they wind up leaving together. “The audience is AI generated, which can hear you and respond, which is hilarious. She couldn’t get enough,” the influencer said.The rule of thumb on social media is that whenever an influencer mentions a product, it’s probably an ad. Parallel Live creator Ethan Keiser has also released a bunch of promotional videos with millions of views, pushing a similar line that social proof from fake audiences can get models to fall all over you and invitations to the VIP sections of clubs. 404 Media’s Jason Koebler reported the apps use speech-to-text AI recognition, which meant fake AI viewers “responded” to things “I said out loud and referenced things I said aloud while testing the apps.”

“No-AI” guarantee for books



British author Richard Haywood is a self-publishing superstar, with his Undead series of post-apocalyptic novels selling more than 4 million copies. He’s now fighting zombie “authors” by adding a NO-AI label and warranty to all his books, with a “legally binding guarantee” that each novel was written without the aid of ChatGPT or other AI assistance. Haywood estimates that around 100,000 fake books churned out by AI have been published in the past year or so and believes an AI-free guarantee is the only way to protect authors and consumers.



AI reduces heart disease deaths by one-third



An AI trained on almost half a million ECG tests and survival data was used in Taiwan to identify the top 5% of most at-risk heart patients. A study in Nature reported that the AI reduced overall heart issue deaths among patients by 31%, and among high risk patients by 90%.



AIs are as stupid as we are



With large language models converging around the baseline for humans on a bunch of tests, Meta’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCunn, argues human intelligence could be the ceiling for LLMs due to the training data.




“As long as AI systems are trained to reproduce human-generated data (e.g. text) and have no search/planning/reasoning capability, performance will saturate below or around human level.”




AbacusAI CEO Bindu Reddy agrees that “models have hit a wall” despite progressively more computing and data being added. “So in some sense, it’s actually not possible to get past some level with just plain language models,” she said, although she added that “No one knows what ‘superhuman reasoning’ looks like. Even if LLMs manifested these superhuman abilities, we wouldn’t be able to recognize them.”

Safety board doesn’t believe in open source



The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has enlisted the heads of centralized AI companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia, for its new AI Safety and Security Board. But the board has been criticized for not including a representative of Meta, which has an open-source AI model strategy, or indeed anyone else working on open-source AI. Maybe it’s already been deemed unsafe.

Peter Schiff Mocks Bitcoin's Dip Below $60K: "Party's Over" - DailyCoin


        
The ongoing Bitcoin price dip has triggered criticism from the anti-crypto community.



Peter Schiff is once again reveling in the token giant’s underperformance.



Bitcoin is currently experiencing its second-longest cycle pullback.
The past weeks in the crypto market have been turbulent for Bitcoin (BTC), characterized by heightened uncertainty and significant price fluctuations. This volatility recently reached a climax when the token experienced a sharp price decline, breaching its longstanding support level of $60,000.This latest downturn has once again underscored the inherent volatility of Bitcoin, drawing scrutiny from the anti-BTC crowd.Peter Schiff on BTC Dip: “Turn out the lights, HODLers”In a tweet on Wednesday, May 1, gold advocate and Bitcoin hater Peter Schiff slammed BTC’s present bearish momentum, asserting its inability to hold support at $60,000. 
Echoing his previous predictions that BTC would struggle to sustain the support level, Schiff ridiculed the token’s underperformance despite the recent spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launch, emphasizing its 23% decline in value and a more substantial 33% fall against gold.Schiff analyzed Bitcoin’s price movements, noting that while $60,000 previously constituted a support level for Bitcoin, it has become a resistance level. He further identified a short-term head-and-shoulders pattern forming in BTC’s price, suggesting a potential further decline in price with a downside objective of $54,000.While his comments build on his long-standing skepticism and repeated criticisms of the token, they align with the current negative sentiment surrounding the token.BTC Pullback Nears Deepest YetPer market analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s ongoing retracement marks the deepest decline yet, officially recorded at 23.6%. This surpasses the deepest retracement observed in early 2023, constituting only a 22.9% decline.
The ongoing pullback has lasted 48 days, the second-longest in this cycle. If it proceeds, the retrace could potentially surpass the previous record for the longest pullback, which lasted 63 days.However, Rekt Capital offered a silver lining. According to its analysis, the more Bitcoin consolidates anywhere between current price levels and $70,000 post-halving, the more likely it is for the overall market cycle to slow down and align with the historically recurring pattern observed after Bitcoin’s halving events. Rekt added that this pattern typically leads to a peak in the bull market, which could see the ongoing cycle peak around mid-September to October 2025.On the FlipsideWhy This MattersPeter Schiff’s critique of Bitcoin’s dip reflects the criticisms the crypto market still faces, ingrained in the question of its position as a store of value. However, the crypto market is no stranger to price crashes, and while negative, BTC’s current performance is not enough to override its potential.Here’s how the bearish sentiment is rippling through the industry:Crypto Bear Sentiment Grips Investors as Fear Spikes The downward market trend has also impacted the recently launched ETFs in Hong Kong:Analysts Evaluate Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs’ Disappointing Debut

The Open Network (TON) secures fresh funding from Pantera Capital - Crypto Briefing




Pantera Capital, managing over $5 billion in assets, has recently made an undisclosed investment in The Open Network (TON), a prominent layer 1 blockchain. Pantera’s move demonstrates its strong belief in TON’s potential to drive widespread crypto adoption, leveraging Telegram’s 900 million users and over 1 trillion monthly views.“We believe the TON network is still in its early stages and we are excited to see the adoption of the ecosystem and its new features by Telegram users,” Pantera Capital told The Block.Originally developed by Telegram’s team and rebranded following legal hurdles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, TON has since made considerable advancements.The network has become a bustling web3 ecosystem, sharing revenue with channel owners, and facilitating advertising payments in TON. Also, speculations suggest that TON, Haskey Group, and Oyster Labs have joined forces to launch the ‘Universal Basic Smartphone.’Besides, the TON blockchain has also gained traction recently. Last month, Tether integrated Tether USD (USDT) and Tether Gold (XAUT) onto TON blockchain. This integration expands Tether’s reach to 15 blockchains and unlocks new possibilities for over 900 million Telegram users worldwide. As a result, users can now leverage USDT and XAUT for peer-to-peer payments directly on the TON blockchain and within decentralized applications built on its infrastructure.Pavel Durov, the co-founder and CEO of Telegram, also announced the company’s plans to tokenize its stickers and emojis, transforming them into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the TON blockchain.Durov highlighted TON’s scalability as a key factor in this decision. According to him, TON’s ability to handle millions, even hundreds of millions, of transactions, making it a perfect fit for Telegram’s target scale.Pantera Capital’s latest investment comes as the company is finalizing KYC procedures for a Solana token purchase. The firm is also in talks to raise an additional $1 billion for “Pantera Fund V.” This new fund targets early-stage startups, tokens, and other digital assets.

Dirty To Digital: Coal Miner Strikes $7 Million Bitcoin Gold With Excess Power


								Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP), a publicly traded coal mining company, has successfully ventured into Bitcoin mining. The pilot project, which began in 2020, has generated significant revenue for ARLP by capitalizing on underutilized electricity at its River View mine.

Bitcoin Mining Success And Adaptability
ARLP’s strategic foray into crypto mining has proven fruitful, with the company generating 425 BTC worth $30 million. CFO Cary Marshall, during an earnings call, highlighted the company’s ability to adapt and generate revenue from existing resources. ARLP’s focus has been solely on mining with their existing equipment, rather than actively buying Bitcoin.
The success of the pilot project is undeniable, as ARLP effectively harnesses its excess power to mine the leading cryptocurrency. However, questions surrounding long-term profitability and environmental impact have cast a shadow over this innovative venture.
Challenges And Market Fluctuations
While ARLP’s Bitcoin holdings are currently valued at $30 million, operational costs significantly reduce that figure to $7.3 million. The recent halving event, which saw a reduction in block rewards for miners, has added further complexity to the project’s profitability.
In response to reduced profitability, miners have been observed transferring their Bitcoin to exchanges, potentially signaling a selling spree. This trend helps miners cover operational costs but also creates a market imbalance that could impact the crypto asset’s overall price.

BTCUSD trading at $58,728 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com
Finding Balance For A Sustainable Future
Emerging technology and established industries come together in an intriguing way at ARLP’s exploration into Bitcoin mining. But a number of things will determine if this paradigm is sustainable in the long run. Sustained profitability will depend critically on the direction of BTC price and ARLP’s capacity to maximize efficiency.
Moreover, the environmental impact of coal-powered Bitcoin mining cannot be overlooked. ARLP recognizes the importance of addressing these concerns to secure a sustainable future for its Bitcoin mining endeavors. Balancing profitability with environmental considerations will be essential for the company’s success and reputation in an increasingly environmentally conscious world.
A Valuable Case Study
ARLP’s pioneering experience in Bitcoin mining serves as a valuable case study for traditional companies venturing into the digital asset space. It sheds light on the potential rewards and challenges faced by these companies as they navigate a complex and evolving landscape.
As the industry continues to evolve, ARLP’s success demonstrates the potential for traditional industries to adapt and thrive in emerging sectors. It also highlights the need for careful consideration of market fluctuations, operational costs, and environmental sustainability in order to achieve long-term success.

Alliance Resource Partners’ entry into crypto mining has generated substantial revenue, showcasing the company’s adaptability and innovative spirit. However, the long-term profitability of their venture depends on various factors, including Bitcoin’s price trajectory and the optimization of operational efficiency.
Addressing environmental concerns associated with coal-powered Bitcoin mining will be crucial for ARLP to ensure a sustainable future.

EMURGO on Revolutionizing the Precious Metals Industry through Tokenization | Cryptoglobe


                                
EMURGO is a global blockchain technology company. It acts as the official commercial and venture arm of the Cardano project, which is a decentralized blockchain platform that runs the ADA cryptocurrency. EMURGO aims to foster the development of the Cardano ecosystem by investing in startups and companies that are building on the Cardano platform. The company provides solutions and services to businesses and governments in industries ranging from finance and healthcare to education and retail, helping integrate blockchain technology into their operations.



The precious metals industry involves a complex network of stakeholders, including mines, ports, refineries, and exchanges. As EMURGO points out, the intricacies of this network make precious metals an ideal candidate for asset tokenization, which could bring about significant advancements in transparency, liquidity, and stakeholder accountability.



In a blog post published earlier today, EMURGO describes precious metals as rare, naturally occurring commodities that have served as a cornerstone of economic value due to their durability, beauty, and rarity. Historically used in both industrial applications and as investment assets, these metals are pivotal in various sectors.



Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), as EMURGO explains, are digital representations of physical assets on a blockchain, with all relevant transactions and information recorded for verification. This digital shift could provide clearer accountability and improve the efficiency of how these assets are managed and transacted.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

According to EMURGO, tokenizing precious metals can offer several benefits:



Affordability: By fragmenting a tokenized asset into smaller portions, more individuals can invest in precious metals without the need for large upfront costs.Security: Blockchain technology allows for transparent transaction tracking, potentially reducing human accounting errors and enhancing investment security.Anti-counterfeit Measures: Tokenization can help verify the authenticity of precious metals, addressing issues of counterfeiting and illegal mining practices.Reduced Transaction Costs: With fewer intermediaries involved, the transaction costs associated with trading precious metals could decrease, making it more efficient.Global Market Access: EMURGO notes that tokenization could connect stakeholders worldwide, simplifying logistics and trading processes.



EMURGO says NMKR allows the Cardano blockchain to be used to issue NFTs for various assets, including physical diamonds through its partnership with Tiamonds and e-books with Book.io, promoting true ownership and resale capabilities.



EMURGO says that 2.2 million NFTs have been issued with the help of NMKR, and transaction volumes exceed $65 million across more than 30,000 projects.

Poloniex delists own WBTC product following depeg


Following Protos reporting about Wrapped Bitcoin on Tron (WBTC) depegging on Poloniex, the Justin Sun-owned firm behind the product appears to have removed this asset from trading. 
The previously available WBTC/BTC pair looks to have been removed entirely, and the WBTC/USDT pair currently states, “Currently trading for WBTC/USDT is disabled. The price may not reflect current market.”
It’s not clear if it’s currently possible to redeem WBTC for BTC through Poloniex.
Additionally, Poloniex has yet to complete the promised proof-of-reserves process and still hasn’t disclosed where it stores the bitcoin supposedly reserving this product.

Read more: Poloniex WBTC depegs threatening Justin Sun’s empire
WBTC, managed by Justin Sun-owned Poloniex, currently makes up over half the bitcoin on Sun-connected exchange HTX. Additionally, there’s approximately $5.36 billion worth of the product on Sun-launched JustLend.
This opaque financial instrument connects a number of Sun-affiliated entities and projects in a way that raises concerns about the management of both the instrument and the entities.
Protos has reached out to Poloniex to determine where the reserves for this product are held, if it is still possible to redeem, and why this asset was delisted for trading. At press, Poloniex had not responded.

What Is the Price of Solana (SOL) up Today? | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of smart contract platform Solana ($SOL) defied the recent crypto market slump with an impressive price surge today, climbing over 10% in the last 24 hours to hit $138.2 at the time of writing.



This upswing can be attributed to a combination of positive developments within the Solana ecosystem and a shift in the broader economic landscape. The continued popularity of Solana-based memecoins, which have boosted activity on the platform, has been influence the rise of Solana’s decentralized finance sector, with data also showing Solana investment products have been seeing significant inflows amid the market downturn.



SOLUSD price chart via CryptoCompare



The total value locked on decentralized finance protocols within the Solana network has risen to $3.78 billion, from little over $200 million at the beginning of last year and from around $1.3 billion at the beginning of this year.



Solana’s price action has also played a role in the recent upswing as the cryptocurrency has recently found support at a key level in recent months, indicating strong buying pressure. This technical resilience, bolstered by the 200-day exponential moving average, has instilled confidence in investors and created a potential springboard for further gains.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Adding to the positive sentiment, a new cross-chain bridge service connecting Bitcoin and Solana was recently announced and is scheduled for release later this year has fueled excitement. Developed by Zeus Network, the cross-chain bridge allow users to convert their Bitcoin into zBTC tokens, usable within the Solana ecosystem.



Solana’s gains today also coincide with a broader crypto market recovery following a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve after the central bank opted to maintain interest rates at their current levels due to concerns surrounding slowing economic growth.



This decision, coupled with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s statement that further rate hikes are unlikely in the near future, has boosted investor risk appetite. As yields on traditional investments like government bonds dipped, investors sought higher returns in assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially contributing to Solana’s upswing.

Powell Rally Vanishes, Qualcomm Heightens Apple Concern, Mother Of All Reports Ahead - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - Benzinga

To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.Key Events AheadPlease click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).Note the following:
	The chart shows the steep rally that started on Powell’s press conference.
	Yesterday, we wrote:

If political Powell shows up, expect a rip roaring rally.

	Three groups of investors were buying.
	
		Investors driven by macro bought on the belief that Powell gave an all clear signal for buying stocks.
		Investors who follow traditional technical analysis aggressively bought because a technical buy signal triggered.
		The momo crowd was buying because dovish Powell showed up.
	
	
	The chart shows that at the peak of the rally when buying was very aggressive, The Arora Report took a contrary view and wrote in the Afternoon Capsule:

In The Arora Report analysis, there may be a re-think of the stock market rally as Powell was not able to support his dovishness with data or compelling argument.

	The chart shows that The Arora Report call has proven prescient as all of the stock market rally was given back.
	Two key events are ahead:
	
		Apple Inc AAPL earnings
		Jobs report, also known as the mother of all reports
	
	
	The momo crowd’s pattern is to buy ahead of key events. The reason is that the momo crowd buys on hopium and does not take risk into account. Today is no different. The momo crowd is aggressively buying ahead of Apple earnings and the mother of all reports. In contrast, smart money knows that key events present risk.  To reduce risk, smart money tends to trim ahead of key events.
	Apple will report earnings after the market close.  Here are the key points:
	
		Analysts expect about a 5% drop in Apple revenues.
		If analysts are right, this will be the fifth of the last six quarters with a drop in Apple revenues.
		We have been sharing with you the problems Apple is facing in China.
		Qualcomm Inc QCOM owns patents on key technologies that power today’s smartphones, including iPhones. As full disclosure, QCOM is in The Arora Report's ZYX Buy Model Portfolio.  QCOM long from $47.13.  Apple is a key Qualcomm customer.  QCOM data shows that it generated great revenues in China.  The implication here is that other companies such as Huawei are taking significant market share from Apple as Chinese switch away from iPhones.  
		As full disclosure, AAPL is in The Arora Report's ZYX Buy Model Portfolio.  AAPL is long from $4.68.  
		Apple earnings are very important.  Risks to Apple are also very important.  Institutions are selling AAPL stock.  It is important to become knowledgeable about Apple.  
	
	
	The jobs report will be released at 8:30am ET tomorrow.
	Initial jobless claims came at 208K vs. 213K consensus. This indicates that the employment picture remains strong.
	Q1 Productivity-Prel came at 0.3% vs. 0.8% consensus.   This indicates that AI has not become as pervasive in the workplace as some prior data indicated.
	Q1 unit labor costs-Prel came at 4.7% vs. 2.5% consensus.  This indicates that taming inflation is a challenge.
Magnificent Seven Money FlowsIn the early trade, money flows are positive in AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc META, Microsoft Corp MSFT, NVIDIA Corp NVDA, and Tesla Inc TSLA.In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Alphabet Inc Class C GOOG.In the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ.Momo Crowd And Smart Money In StocksThe momo crowd is aggressively buying stocks in the early trade.  Smart money is inactive in the early trade.GoldAs we are ready to publish this post, all of a sudden, significant selling is coming in gold.The momo crowd is buying gold in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings.The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust GLD. The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust SLV. OilAs we are ready to publish this post, all of a sudden, significant selling is coming in oil.The momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade.  Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see oil ratings.The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF USO.BitcoinBitcoin BTC/USD is seeing buying on dovish Powell.Protection Band And What To Do NowIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.  Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

Bitcoin ETFs Shed $563 Million as BlackRock's IBIT Marks First Daily Loss - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsSpot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States marked their worst day on record Wednesday, notching more than half a billion dollars in net outflows for the first time since their January debut.As Bitcoin’s price fell to its lowest point in two months Wednesday, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $563 million in net outflows, according to data from CoinGlass—far exceeding a previous record of $326 million in daily net outflows seen in mid-March.The outsized bleed from Bitcoin funds came as the Federal Reserve affirmed that its fight against inflation is likely far from over. The U.S. central bank kept interest rates fixed at their highest levels in over 23 years following its May policy meeting.At the same time, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said tighter monetary policy that could weigh on risk assets like stocks and crypto was “unlikely” to be next. Following his remarks, Bitcoin climbed to $58,500, yet it remains down 8% over the past week.As the selloff materialized Wednesday, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF saw outflows for the first time. Amassing $15.4 billion uninterrupted since its Wall Street launch, the iShare Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw outflows of $37 million, according to Farside Investors.At the same time, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has seen over $17 billion in cumulative outflows since January, didn’t hemorrhage the most cash Wednesday. Instead, holders of Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF led the selloff, which saw $191 million leave the fund as GBTC witnessed outflows of $167 million.Outflows from GBTC—which was converted to a spot ETF in January after a decade on the market—have been tied to the bankruptcy estates of several crypto firms parting with shares. Grayscale’s management fee of 1.5% for GBTC also stands out as other products charge investors around 0.25%—offering cheaper alternatives.Spot Bitcoin ETFs have the potential to “amplify market downturns,” analysts from crypto analytics firm Kaiko wrote in a report released alongside Moody’s Wednesday. “If there is an event that triggers large outflows, ETF issuers will need to liquidate their holdings, which could weaken values in crypto markets,” it stated.In mid-March, spot Bitcoin ETFs had $63 billion in assets under management (AUM). But amid Bitcoin’s recent slide, the market value of their Bitcoin holdings (plus a tiny amount of cash) has fallen 19% to $51.4 billionWith net outflows on Wednesday representing 1% of spot Bitcoin ETFs’ AUM, the outflows appeared “totally normal for [a] risk asset ETF during [a] selloff,” Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said on Twitter. If Bitcoin’s “correction worsens,” however, he said the ETFs’ AUM could drop 10%—and he “wouldn’t be surprised.”Though spot Bitcoin ETFs saw more than half a billion dollars in net outflows Wednesday, the price of Bitcoin is still up 33% year-to-date, partially due to the supply and demand dynamics ushered in by the products.“The flywheel works both to the upside and downside,” pseudonymous crypto trader WhalePanda said on Twitter of spot Bitcoin ETFs, adding the outflows aren’t “a surprise since panic is everywhere.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ethereum and Solana Meme Coin Prices Surge Amid Modest Bitcoin Gains - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin has been struggling lately, though its modest gains Thursday are surely a welcome sign of life for traders. But Bitcoin's slight rise is being overshadowed by a crypto category that is on fire today: meme coins.Pepe (PEPE) is the biggest winner, shooting up by over 22% in the past day per data from CoinGecko. The Ethereum-based token hasn't seen much price action over the past week, though, but still is up by over 8% in the past 30 days.Over the past day, the Solana-based Bonk (BONK) has boomed by over 18%; it's now priced at $0.00002479, CoinGecko shows. Meanwhile Dogwifhat (WIF) and FLOKI have both made notable gains—they're up 14% and 12%, respectively, making them two of the other biggest gainers over a 24-hour period.And long-standing meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and the Ethereum-based Shiba Inu (SHIB) have each posted 24-hour gains around 9%, adding to Thursday's meme coin frenzy.The boom in meme coins and tokens comes at a time when the broader crypto market has taken a plunge. This week, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies took a nosedive after investors cashed out of the popular spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and U.S. inflation proved sticker than expected.Bitcoin is now trading for $59,000 after plunging by nearly 8% over seven days. It's now well below its March all-time high of nearly $74,000 per coin.The meme coin and token market is risky: New cryptocurrencies disappear almost as quickly as they spring into existence, either making traders huge gains or crushing losses.Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz's CTO Eddy Lazzarin last week described the sphere as a "risky casino" that is "damaging" for the world of crypto.A lot of it was started a joke. Dogecoin, the biggest meme coin in existence with a market cap of $18.8 billion, was created to poke fun at the serious world of Bitcoin, according to its developers.It's now the ninth biggest digital asset by market cap. And it has countless followers piling up billions in collective market value.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Creator of rabbit AI assistant has hidden NFT past


Founders of rabbit r1, a supposed competitor to the smartphone, are also behind the launch of a failed NFT project that they’re reportedly hiding from the web. 
The $200 rabbit r1 was created by CEO Jesse Lyu and billed as the ‘future of human-machine interface.’ However, its sleek design and funky scrolling weren’t enough to woo techies and the device was roundly criticized on release. 
Now rabbit r1’s negative reception has brought attention to Lyu’s prior work on a failed NFT project called Gama. Lyu was CEO of Gama’s parent company, Cyber Manufacture Co., before it rebranded to rabbit Inc. in October 2023. 

VIDEO
Promotional material shared on Gama’s YouTube channel. 
Gama claimed to be a ‘premium’ space-themed 3D platformer that incorporated NFTs and was pitched in 2022 as the metaverse of the future. However, barely two years later, the Gama.io domain no longer works and the site can only be viewed via the Wayback Machine internet archive.
One post on X from AI advocate Andy Parackal claims that the Gama team has been deleting every YouTube video involving rabbit’s CEO. Fortunately, Parackal says he recorded one of Lyu’s interviews before it was wiped. 
He said, “We got the entire video; these guys are total grifters. I’ve been saying from day one that these guys are sketchy… They are trying to delete everything involved with Gama NFTs.” 

Indeed the Gama YouTube channel does contain videos relating to the Gama project, but nothing including Lyu. 
Aaron Li, who claims to have built the technical systems behind Gama, told Parackal he wasn’t told to delete anything and that Parackal “may be overreacting.”
Rabbit Inc. CEO’s NFT history adds to growing complaints 
The rabbit r1 relies on AI to perform various tasks its creators hoped would eliminate the need to scroll back and forth between multiple apps. But it’s been met with growing criticism.
Tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee said in a review that the rabbit r1’s AI “hallucinates” and “confidently answers questions wrong.” He calls its battery life “brutally bad,” describes its scroll function as “super slow,” and complains about its restrictive touch screen.

The Verge also reported that rabbit r1’s operating system isn’t as unique from apps as rabbit Inc. makes out. Indeed, someone is reportedly running rabbit’s launcher as an Android app on a Google Pixel 6A. 
In response, rabbit told The Verge, “rabbit r1 is not an Android app… rabbit OS and LAM run on the cloud with very bespoke AOSP and lower level firmware modifications, therefore a local bootleg APK without the proper OS and Cloud endpoints won’t be able to access our service. rabbit OS is customized for r1 and we do not support third-party clients.”
A full response can be found on its X account. 
Protos has emailed rabbit Inc. for more information about Jesse Lyu’s NFT project and the reported deletion of videos and will update this piece if we hear back.

US banking JPMorgan has maintained a cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, according to its latest report that was published on Apr. 23. According to JPMorgan, the cryptocurrency market is currently suffering from the lack of bullish catalysts after ETF inflows dried up. At the same time, the bank's analysts cited elevated positioning, underwhelming venture capital (VC) funding, and the current production costs as the main bearish catalysts contributing to the ongoing selling pressure. Last month, JPMorgan predicted that the Bitcoin halving was priced in, pouring cold water on some bullish predictions. Back in February, it said that the price of the largest cryptocurrency could crash to as low as $42,000 after the halving event. The bank also predicted that the production cost of a single coin could roughly double. Around that time, Bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz also warned that the Bitcoin market was getting frothy. The price of Bitcoin surged to its current all-time high of $73,737 in March and went on to log eight consecutive green monthly candles. However, it experienced a dramatic correction in April and then kept plunging in May due to disastrous ETF outflows and macroeconomic concerns. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at $59,110.Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently doubled down on his long-standing criticism of Bitcoin, calling the largest cryptocurrency "a fraud" and a "Ponzi scheme." He also predicted that the flagship cryptocurrency would not go anywhere as a currency. At the same time, he still sees some value in blockchain technology.

Important Binance Announcement Concerning Numerous Altcoin Traders: Details


																TL;DR

Binance recently expanded its Loan service to include new assets such as Holo (HOT) and Manta Network (MANTA), requiring users to update their app versions to place orders.
The prices of these newly added tokens increased following the announcement, possibly driven by the broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market.


The Latest Update
The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange launched another upgrade on its platform to offer additional services and respond to reigning market trends. Most recently, it added Holo (HOT), Jito (JTO), Manta Network (MANTA), MANTRA (OM), NFPrompt (NFP), and Portal (PORTAL) as new loanable assets on Binance Loans (Flexible Rates).
The company advised clients who wish to place orders via the application to upgrade it to iOS v2.78.0 or Android v2.78.0 (or later). “Older app versions no longer support the placement of new Binance Loans (Flexible Rate) orders,” it warned. 
The prices of most of the assets included in the exchange’s latest update have headed north shortly after the announcement. JTO is up 13% on a 24-hour scale, MANTA has surged by 7%, while NFP has witnessed a 5% spike. 
The additional support from Binance might be one reason the aforementioned coins entered a bullish mode. Another factor could be the evident revival of the entire cryptocurrency market today (May 2). Many of the leading digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA), are well in the green after suffering substantial losses in the previous days.




The Previous Amendments
The exchange introduced multiple updates on its platform in the last several weeks. It added 18 new loanable assets, such as the popular meme coins Pepe (PEPE) and dogwifhat (WIF), to Binance Loan at the beginning of April. Shortly after, it launched the ARB/USDC and NEO/USDC perpetual contracts with up to 50x leverage, while FIL/USDC enables up to 75x leverage.
Earlier this week, the company included the XRP/JPY, SHIB/JPY, ADA/JPY, and SOL/JPY trading pairs on Binance Spot. 
The options focus on the Japanese yen, giving locals the chance to dive deeper in the cryptocurrency industry. “Users will enjoy zero maker and taker fees on JPY trading pairs until further notice,” the firm clarified.
Prior to that, Binance simplified crypto trading for Mexicans, too, by launching a direct pair between USDT and MXN.

XRP Receives Crucial Adoption Boost With New RippleX Feature


RippleX, the development arm of Ripple, has introduced a significant enhancement to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) aimed at enhancing adoption and usability. Senior Software Engineer at RippleX Mayukha Vadari revealed the release of a new specification, XLS-68d, designed to simplify transaction processes.The focal point of this development is the introduction of sponsored transaction fees and reserves. This feature enables platforms to handle transaction fees and account reserves on behalf of their users, thereby streamlining the user experience and reducing barriers to entry for new participants.The proposal acknowledges the growing complexity of blockchain technology and aims to address it by allowing users to delegate transaction management while retaining control over their accounts. Users can authorize platforms to execute transactions and cover associated fees and reserves by including sponsor signatures in their transactions. Similar functionalities exist on other blockchain networks and are often referred to as "sponsored transactions" or "meta-transactions." This aligns with industry trends and provides users with familiar mechanisms for managing transactions.The introduction of this feature is expected to have a positive impact on the XRPL ecosystem by facilitating easier onboarding processes and reducing financial barriers for users and projects. By enabling platforms to cover transaction costs, XRP becomes more accessible to a wider range of users and industries, potentially driving increased adoption.Overall, the introduction of sponsored transaction fees and reserves represents a significant step forward in enhancing the adoption and usability of XRP, positioning it as a more user-friendly and accessible digital asset.

Crypto confiscate: Carabinieri and Young Platform in collaboration

For the first time, the cryptocurrencies seized from a criminal organization, then brought to justice, have been converted into fiat currencies thanks to the collaboration between the main Italian exchange Young Platform and the Carabinieri.
Let’s see below all the details. 

The partnership between the Carabinieri and the Italian crypto exchange Young Platform against financial crime
As anticipated, the first successful conversion of confiscated cryptocurrencies to fiat currency has been completed.
This pioneering initiative highlights a remarkable step forward in the collaboration between the cryptocurrency sector and public institutions. It also represents a key moment in the fight against illicit activities.
The Carabinieri Anti-Counterfeiting Monetary Command, the Department of Justice, and the Single Justice Fund (FUG) have worked with Young Platform. That is the main Italian cryptocurrency exchange to carry out this unique operation.
The process, completed in January 2023, is the result of a thorough investigation and legal coordination involving Eurojust and the support of Europol. 
The operation led to the arrest of 31 individuals, eight of whom are in pre-trial detention, on the order of the Preliminary Investigations Judge of the Naples Court. The charge is criminal association aimed at counterfeiting currency trafficking.
This operation is part of a broader investigation, started in July 2018, aimed at dismantling a criminal organization rooted in Naples and active internationally with branches in several European and non-European countries.
The investigations, conducted with the help of sophisticated computer technologies, have revealed the methods of distribution of counterfeit currency by a seller active on marketplaces since 2012. 
He used anonymous methods to handle cryptocurrency payments. After the arrests, large amounts of cryptocurrency were seized, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XRM).
The criminal network used the dark web and messaging platforms like Telegram to sell counterfeit banknotes in exchange for cryptocurrencies. The confiscated cryptocurrencies have been transferred to wallets managed by the Carabinieri Anti-counterfeiting Monetary Command. 
A new model of public-private collaboration
Subsequently, Young Platform was appointed as an auxiliary of the judicial police to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currency and transfer them to the Single Justice Fund (FUG). 
This public-private collaboration, involving law enforcement, judicial authorities, and a cryptocurrency exchange, is unprecedented in Italy. 
Young Platform aspires to be a model for other exchanges and companies in the sector, demonstrating how it is possible to collaborate proactively with authorities, even in a context of strict regulatory control.
The uniqueness of this operation lies not only in its positive outcome and pioneering nature, but also in demonstrating the effectiveness of collaboration between law enforcement and new financial technologies. 
Despite cryptocurrencies are often perceived as tools for illicit activities, their intrinsic transparency can prove to be an ally in the fight against crime. 
The blockchain, as we know, records every transaction permanently. Allowing authorities to track financial flows with an unprecedented level of detail.
The operation led to the arrest in flagrante of 31 people and the dismantling of an underground printing press in Arzano, in the province of Naples. Another 50 suspects have been referred to the Judicial Authority for crimes related to currency trafficking. 
48 searches were carried out abroad and 19 in Italy, highlighting the breadth and complexity of the operation.
Some statements regarding collaboration
Lorenzo Palombi, legal consultant for Young Platform and of counsel at GDP Lex Studio in Rome, stated:
“This operation underlines the positive role that financial technologies can have in society, creating an important precedent for future collaborations between the cryptocurrency sector and judicial authorities. Furthermore, it provides an operational model that can be used for similar initiatives in the future.”
Not by chance, this operational structure will be essential to standardize practices and ensure a coordinated and effective approach in the fight against financial crime.
The Cryptocurrencies Section of the Carabinieri Anti-Counterfeiting Monetary Command, which conducted this operation, demonstrates its ability to respond to the challenges posed by the digital evolution of financial markets. 
With specific tasks such as the analysis and contrast of the production and distribution of counterfeit currency, the Command plays a crucial role in the national and international security system, collaborating with community institutions and foreign police forces.
The goal is to establish a judicial practice that brings together public and private entities to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.
This approach aims to create an operational model that integrates financial and technological skills with law enforcement intelligence strategies.
Andrea Ferrero, CEO and co-founder of Young Platform, concludes:
“This collaboration between Young Platform and the Carabinieri Command demonstrates how new technologies can be an integral part of the fight against crime.”
Although cryptocurrencies can be used for illicit purposes, their potential to bring benefits to society is significant. 
Ferrero mentioned “The Chainalysis 2024 Crypto Crime Report”, in which the percentage of illicit volumes associated with cryptocurrencies in 2023 was 0.34%, showing a steady decline since 2019.

Two Bitcoin Metrics Flashing Bullish Signals for BTC, According to Bitfinex Analysts - The Daily Hodl


								Analysts with the crypto exchange Bitfinex say two key metrics are suddenly flashing bullish for Bitcoin (BTC).
In a new blog post, Bitfinex analysts say that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio shows the price of the top-performing crypto asset is likely going up.










MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization, which is the value of all BTC at the price they were bought at and is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued. The analysts say the MVRV ratio suggests Bitcoin is now undervalued after falling since the start of April.
The second indicator the analysts say is signaling bullishness is Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) weighted funding rate, having turned positive after recent multiple negative dips.
Says the analysts.
“Currently, two important Bitcoin on-chain metrics signal a potentially advantageous buying opportunity. The Market Value to Realized Value measure, alongside the Open Interest weighted funding rate, hint at a potential entry point for investors… 
Several on-chain metrics, including the MVRV measure and the OI weighted funding rate, are currently indicating a potentially attractive entry point for Bitcoin investors.” 
Funding rates represent traders’ sentiment in the perpetual swaps market, and the amount is proportional to the number of contracts. Positive funding rates indicate that long position traders are dominant and are willing to pay funding to short traders.
Negative funding rates indicate that short position traders are dominant and are willing to pay long traders.
Bitcoin is trading for $59,207 at time of writing, up nearly 4% in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum Adds Over 260K Wallets in 2 Days: Will ETH Rally? - DailyCoin


        
Ethereum has recently witnessed its most significant two-day network growth in nearly two years.



The network growth comes despite recent price struggles.



Macroeconomic conditions and an ongoing SEC investigation continue to weigh on the asset’s price.
Despite recent ETH price struggles, things are not looking all bad for the Ethereum network. Recent data suggests that at the start of the week, the network saw its highest influx of new accounts in nearly two years.Could this network growth be the catalyst ETH needs?Ethereum Network Gains Over 260K New WalletsLike most crypto assets, ETH experienced a steep decline this week amid jitters over the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, which was announced on Wednesday, May 1. Despite this market uncertainty, Santiment Feed data has revealed that thousands were still jumping into the Ethereum ecosystem at a record rate.
On Wednesday, Santiment Feed disclosed that over 260,000 new Ethereum wallets were created between April 28 and April 29, the highest two-day network growth since October 8 and October 9, 2022. While the reason for the recent network growth spike is unclear, over the weekend, the Ethereum community saw some excitement as the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) stirred hopes of spot Ethereum ETF approvals by listing Franklin Templeton’s planned offering on its website.Regardless of the catalyst, the network growth metric has sparked optimism amongst some Ethereum users. This optimism comes as network growth is typically bullish for underlying crypto assets. Still, uncertainties remain.Overarching ConcernsSignificant growth in the number of addresses in a network is typically viewed as a sign of strong network fundamentals, highlighting a potential for increased capital inflows. 
However, the impact of this network growth is not always immediately reflected in price, particularly when investors have overarching concerns. At present, these concerns for Ethereum include continued high interest rates in the U.S. and the SEC’s unclear position on the asset’s classification.At the time of writing, ETH continues to trade below the psychologically important $3,000 price level at $2,991, per CoinMarketCap data.On the Flipside 
Despite recent price struggles, Ethereum is still up over 30% year-to-date (YTD) from an opening price of around $2,282.
Why This MattersEthereum is the second largest crypto asset in terms of market capitalization. While the recent network growth may not translate to immediate price gains, it suggests continued interest in the ecosystem.Read this for more on ETH:SEC to OK Leveraged ETH ETFs… While Probing Security Status?See how Polygon (MATIC) is reacting to the recent market downturn:Polygon (MATIC) Plunges in BTC-Led Flush: Can It Hold Support?

Bitcoin Institutionals Behind $57,000 Crash? Data Says So


								Data shows the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has been negative for a while now, a sign that institutional selling has been occurring behind the scenes.
Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Turned Quite Negative Recently
As pointed out by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has been negative for seven straight days.
The “Coinbase Premium Gap” is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the BTC prices listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is greater than on Binance right now. Such a trend implies the buying pressure is higher (or alternatively, the selling pressure is lower) on the former than the latter.

On the other hand, the indicator being red suggests the presence of higher selling pressure on the Coinbase platform, which has pushed the price of the asset lower on it.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past year:

The price of the asset appears to have been quite negative in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has been negative for the past week or so, implying that the selling pressure on Coinbase has been higher than on Binance.
Recently, the indicator has assumed some especially sharp negative values, which have coincided with the recent crash that the cryptocurrency has observed. This could suggest that selling on the platform may be behind the crash.
This has actually been the pattern observed in 2024 so far, as the asset’s price has seemed to be sensitive to changes in the metric. When the rally was ongoing earlier, the indicator had been at highly positive levels, but this buying seems to have ended now.
Coinbase is popularly known to be used by the American institutional entities, while Binance has a more global userbase. As such, the indicator’s value reflects how the behavior of the US-based institutional traders differs from that of the global investors.
Since the Bitcoin price has been reacting to movements in the Coinbase Premium Gap this year, it would appear that these whales have been driving the price action.

The latest red values of the indicator would imply that these investors have been participating in a selloff recently. As long as this streak of negative levels continues, it’s possible that Bitcoin will continue to observe bearish price action.
A flip towards the positive, on the other hand, would suggest at least sideways movement around the current levels, if not outright a switch towards bullish momentum. It now remains to be seen what moves the Coinbase users will make in the coming days.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $58,600, down over 7% in the last seven days.

Pantera invests in TON with high expectations for Telegram’s future

Pantera Capital has invested an undisclosed amount in The Open Network (TON). It is the crypto-focused venture capital firm’s “latest” investment in TON and motivated by its connection to the Telegram messaging service, the company said.Telegram’s decision in April to incorporate TON gives TON “potential to become one of the largest crypto networks,” Pantera said in a long and enthusiastic blog post on its website. Telegram, with its 900 million monthly users and 36.7 million monthly downloads, “is well positioned to bring crypto to the world because of its shared Web3 ethos.” In a laundry list of TON’s virtues, Pantera said the architecture of the TON blockchain provides performance and scalability that compares favorably with leading blockchains, and its wallet offers high utility with a simple interface. A comparison of scalability among major blockchains. Source: Pantera CapitalPantera also praised the mini-apps TON enables on Telegram:“Earlier this year, we observed how memecoin trading tools like BonkBot generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue through Telegram’s user interface. TON-based applications, such as StormTrade, now enable users to trade perpetuals, cryptocurrencies, stocks, and equities using the same interface.” Furthermore, Telegram is offering new opportunities for monetization, such as ad revenue sharing and tradable customized usernames, virtual phone numbers and emojis.Related: Tether issued on TON blockchain at a ‘great start,’ says CEO — Now at $60MThe Telegram-TON linkup was a notable achievement, Pantera noted. TON was originally designed to integrate with Telegram, but its initial attempt was foiled by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Telegram was able to reunite TON after the network was relaunched by independent developers, making it the only major messaging platform to incorporate Web3.

Coinbase Ranked As Top Spot Crypto Exchange in CCData's Latest Exchange Benchmark | Cryptoglobe


                                
CCData, a leading provider of digital asset market data and analysis, has recently released the latest edition (April 2024) of its highly anticipated Exchange Benchmark report. This comprehensive study, which has become an industry standard for evaluating the risk associated with cryptocurrency exchanges, offers valuable insights into the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.



The Exchange Benchmark, first launched in 2019, has undergone significant expansions and enhancements to its methodology, now encompassing over 100 exchanges across 8 key categories, including Security, Legal/Regulation, KYC/Transaction Risk, Team/Exchange, Data Provision, Asset Quality/Diversity, Market Quality, and Transparency. The report covers both centralized exchanges (spot and derivatives) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), with the latter being assessed based on a separate set of metrics tailored to their unique characteristics (Security, Community, Transparency, Governance, Market Quality, User Experience, and Incentives).



One of the key highlights from the April 2024 report is the continued dominance of Coinbase, which has maintained its top ranking for the second consecutive Exchange Benchmark. Coinbase’s strong performance can be attributed to its high scores in the Legal/Regulation and Security sections, which have been revamped to ensure the highest level of risk mitigation and accountability.



Out of the 98 spot exchanges evaluated, 17 achieved Top-Tier status (BB+ or higher), with Coinbase and Bitstamp being the only exchanges to score above 80 points. Kraken and Bybit also impressed, obtaining AA rankings with scores above 75. The report cites improved Market Quality, new VASP licenses, and the increased adoption of off-exchange settlement offerings as major drivers behind these top-tier scores.



In the derivatives space, 10 out of 27 exchanges reached Top-Tier status, with OKX and Bybit leading the pack with AA grades and scores of 82.5 and 81.2, respectively. Both exchanges scored full marks in the Derivatives Market Quality category, alongside Binance, which was thresholded due to a major negative event resulting from their recent CFTC settlement.



The April 2024 report also highlighted a significant increase in due diligence questionnaire submissions, with nearly 50% of Top-Tier exchanges across spot and derivatives markets providing completed DDQs. This trend reflects a growing commitment to transparency among leading exchanges and a desire to align with the increasingly robust Exchange Benchmark methodology.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

According to data from VASPnet, 68 out of 103 exchanges hold a VASP License, while 26 are registered as a Money Service Business. Notably, over 95% of Top-Tier exchanges are regulated, compared to only 60% of Lower-Tier exchanges.



The report also sheds light on the rising popularity of Off-Exchange Settlement solutions, which help mitigate counterparty risk by allowing assets to be mirrored on exchanges and traded natively while user funds are held in cold storage with regulated custodians. A total of 18 exchanges now offer access to this service, with 9 of them achieving Top-Tier status.



Despite the tougher criteria introduced in the latest benchmark, the overall performance of exchanges has improved, with the dominant grade remaining a B in the last two iterations. However, the number of AA-grade exchanges has declined by 43% since the last benchmark, reflecting the superior performance of leading exchanges.



Top-Tier centralized exchanges experienced a remarkable 775% surge in monthly volume, from ~$250bn in Oct-23 to ~$2.17tn in Apr-24, significantly outpacing the 313% increase seen among Lower-Tier exchanges. This trend highlights the market’s growing demand for robust risk mitigation and optimal market liquidity.



The report also underscores the importance of assessing counterparty risk factors, given the consistent uptrend in centralized exchange volumes, which grew by 345% since the last Benchmark, reaching an all-time high monthly volume of over $3tn by the end of March.



In terms of market quality, the report found that AA and A ranked exchanges account for 78% of the Daily Average Volumes across ranked exchanges during the collection period, while Top-Tier exchanges make up over 85% overall. This finding suggests that traders and investors prioritize volume and liquidity, especially when coupled with high regulatory compliance, robust infrastructure, and optimal market quality.



Finally, the report delves into the critical factors of spread and top-of-book liquidity, identifying Binance and OKX as the best-performing exchanges in terms of maintaining tight spreads and deep liquidity across key trading pairs.

Mom Sexualizes Herself on Livestream for Son’s Meme Coin-Then Ghosts - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA kid and his mom begged viewers on their livestream to invest in their meme coin LIVEMOM while she bounced her boobs on camera.Then things got weird.The Kick stream, titled “live with mom,” launched early this morning and lasted just under an hour of the pair urging viewers to hit market cap milestones. If and when the market cap grew, the boy would do something degrading, like eating dog food, or his mom would sexualize herself, like doing 15 squats in front of the camera. And the ploy worked—at least, for a while.After the pair abruptly ended the livestream and deleted the associated social media accounts, the price of the token crashed, with early LIVEMOM buyers claiming the duo had rugged. Yet, somehow, the price of the token is now going up, as degen traders gravitate toward the LIVEMOM “lore.”“Do you wanna see him pour milk over these 36DDs?” the woman in the video, who claimed to be the boy’s mother, said to the livestream, bouncing her breasts at the camera. “[My son] actually suckled on these. Now he’s going to get to pour milk on them.” Incestuous degeneracy apparently goes viral quickly. The stream peaked at around 1,500 viewers within minutes. In turn, the token began to pump as eggs were cracked on the kid’s head, and the family begged viewers to pump the coin.Messages like “One nipple at 300K, deal?” flooded the chat. “Dudes 13 and pimping out his mom,” another said while others begged, “TAKE IT OFF PLS.”According to a viewer of the livestream, a pseudonymous trader who goes by “Doonhamer,” the token’s price directly correlated with what the mom was doing. If she went off screen, the token would drop. If she shook her boobs, the token would pump.“We were baffled, dude, we couldn’t believe it. This prepubescent, but also could have been of age, kid with his mom enticing viewers to buy a coin with his mom shaking the assets, the marketing,” pseudonymous viewer Shamrock told Decrypt. “I was laughing my ass off, until he rugged.”To be clear, we don’t know if the pair in the video are really mother and son, only that they portrayed themselves this way. It’s also possible that the male in the video is of age, though appears to be quite young. It’s also unclear if the pair cashed out and caused the price of the token to crash, but deleting social media accounts and ghosting your “investors” are the hallmarks of a cryptocurrency rug pull—a type of scam that is all too common in the space.When the token touched the $300,000 market cap milestone—which would have resulted in the mom doing 15 squats—the kid said that his phone ran out of battery. Viewers of the stream didn’t buy it. “Oh my phone died, damn damn damn,” the kid said, according to livestream viewers who spoke with Decrypt, suggesting his phone was the webcam, “We’ll run it back tomorrow.”At this same time, the token crashed from $310,000 market cap down to $129,000 in less than five minutes. Half an hour later, the stream came back on with a new token LIVEMOM2. Egg had been washed out of the kid's hair and the mom had changed her top. But this 15 minute stream didn’t see as much success, instantly falling to zero after reaching a $100,000 market cap.Since then, the project’s Kick and Twitter account have both been taken down. The duo has gone dark, yet to be heard from again.Since the initial crash, early buyers of the LIVEMOM token have reclaimed the project, in a sort of “community takeover,” by embracing the livestream as lore. At the time of writing, investors have pumped the token up to a $835,000 market cap with nearly 200 people in a Telegram voice chat discussing the chaos.DisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Altseason Alert: Bitcoin Dominance Crumbles, Altcoins Primed - DailyCoin


        
Crypto markets are caught in an accumulation period at present.



This week saw markets sell-off, with Bitcoin sinking to a new local price bottom.



A strong bounce in altcoins adds to calls of an incoming altseason.
Bitcoin tumbled to a nine-week low this week following the Fed’s decision to leave rates unchanged. Although the leading cryptocurrency has since made a muted recovery, growing 1.4% over the last 24 hours, altcoins have largely outperformed. A handful of the top 100 tokens, including PEPE, Wormhole, and Arweave, posted double-digit gains.Amidst this backdrop, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) plummeted on Wednesday, which, coupled with altcoin overperformance, points to a potential altseason in the making.Bitcoin Dominance Tops OutBTC.D took a significant dip on Wednesday, falling from 54.87% to 53.91%, marking a four-week low while adding to calls of an incoming altseason.   BTC.D daily chart per Trading ViewBitcoin’s crypto market dominance has been trending lower since recording a year-to-date high of 57% on April 13. This trend has caught the attention of YouTuber Scott Melker, who believed this may have been the local top for Bitcoin Dominance.
Trader “Mikybull 🐂 Crypto” noted that Wednesday’s dip in BTC.D broke below a rising wedge pattern, and combined with bearish divergence on the Relative Strength Index, led him to conclude the move is the start of a downtrend that will culminate in an “explosive altseason.”However, while altcoins appear to be outperforming Bitcoin, that in itself is not a confirmation of altseason.Altseason On?There is no definitive agreed-upon definition of altseason. Still, these periods are typically characterized by outsized gains in altcoins relative to both Bitcoin and fiat currencies like the US dollar. Altseasons represent a shift in investor sentiment, as the dynamic involves capital flows out of Bitcoin into altcoin projects, reflecting a heightened appetite for risk among crypto investors.
A willingness to embrace higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities underscores the optimism and bullish sentiment that typically pervades the market during an altseason.Wednesday’s sell-off in crypto markets was met with a strong bounce in altcoins, as denoted by the long bottom wick on the daily May 1 candle of the total crypto market cap, excluding the BTC chart. This indicated that investors were quick to accumulate altcoins at discounted prices.Total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin per Trading ViewHowever, bears rejected a break above $1 trillion on Wednesday and again on Thursday, suggesting that altseason is not yet here. On the Flipside
There are countless incidents of Bitcoin Dominance waning, yet no altseason arrives.



Altcoins benefit from outsized percentage gains (and losses) due to having smaller market caps.

Bitcoin Market In Distribution: Are We Nearing A Bottom? - Benzinga

Since Bitcoin’s BTC/USD March all-time high of $73,000, the market has transitioned into a phase of widespread net distribution, with investors cashing in on profits.What Happened: In their latest report, Glassnode analyzes the nuances of investor behavior to identify potential turning points.Euphoria Phase with a Cool-OffWhile the Net Unrealized Profit & Loss (NUPL) metric confirms the ongoing Euphoria phase of the bull market, it has cooled down significantly since the correction began. This indicates a shift in sentiment compared to the rapid price appreciation seen earlier.Short-Term Holders Driving the MarketAnalyzing the breakdown of sell-side pressure reveals that short-term holders (those who recently acquired Bitcoin) are currently the most active sellers. Understanding their cost basis and spending patterns can offer insights into potential market bottoms.Identifying Potential Local BottomsGlassnode’s research introduces a framework for identifying potential local bottoms based on the behavior of short-term holders. Here are the key takeaways:
1w-1m Cost Basis: This metric tracks the average cost of Bitcoin for investors who bought within the last 1-4 weeks. It acts as a sensitive indicator of their selling pressure.



MVRV Ratio: This ratio measures the spot price against the 1w-1m cost basis, indicating how much below their average price recent buyers are willing to sell. During corrections, it typically falls within the 0.9-1 range.



Realized Loss: This metric measures the total USD value of Bitcoin sold at a loss by the 1w-1m holder cohort. Spikes in realized loss often coincide with market bottoms, as panicked selling intensifies. 
Also Read: BlackRock Anticipates Renewed Institutional Interest In Bitcoin Spot ETFsCurrent Market Conditions and Potential Bottom FormationAt the time of writing, the 1w-1m cost basis sits at $66.7k, while the MVRV ratio falls within the typical correction range. Additionally, realized loss for this group has surpassed the 90-day standard deviation threshold, indicating significant selling pressure.These factors suggest that the market might be hammering out a local bottom formation around the $60k-$66.7k range. However, a sustained break below the MVRV threshold could trigger further selling and establish a new equilibrium.This analysis by Glassnode provides valuable insights into the current state of the Bitcoin market. While distribution is the dominant trend, short-term holder behavior offers clues for identifying potential turning points and navigating market corrections.Looking Ahead: Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets EventEvents like Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 19 provide crucial platforms for industry leaders and analysts to discuss these evolving market dynamics and collaborate on navigating the complexities of the digital asset ecosystem.Read Next: Jack Dorsey’s Block Under Examination From Authorities Over Alleged Sanctions ViolationsThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

The move for an ‘undervalued’ bitcoin miner? Perhaps selling the company. - Blockworks


Stronghold Digital Mining executives want you to know they’re not happy about the company’s stock price.
As a result, they are considering selling the bitcoin miner’s assets. Or the company outright.
Such a sale could be among the first deals after the April 19 Bitcoin halving — when per-block mining rewards were reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Various industry watchers said they expected mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity to pick up following the event. 
Read more: Bitcoin miner consolidation appears imminent as halving looms
Executives touted the company’s attributes during Stronghold’s Thursday earnings call. 
It has 130 megawatts (MW) of energized data center capacity with an installed hash rate of 4.1 exahash per second. Stronghold also owns 750 or so acres of land, as well as the transmission lines that connect its assets to the PJM grid.
Stronghold’s current capacity could expand to more than 400 MW, with a potential focus on supporting the growing segments of AI and machine learning, Stronghold Greg Beard said on the call.
“We own a portfolio of hard assets where every known available comparable valuation is significantly in excess of the public market price of Stronghold today,” Beard noted. “Recognizing this dislocation, we have initiated a process to do something about it.”
The company has hired financial and legal advisors as part of a “formal strategic review process,” the company said in a Thursday news release.
Stronghold is considering “the sale of all or part of the company,” or another transaction that involves some or all of its assets, it added in a statement.
The company’s stock price was $3.16 at 12 pm ET — down 52% year to date.
This price plummet so far this year is more than most of the mining industry’s largest public competitors. Bitcoin mining behemoths Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Hut 8 for example, have seen share prices drop between 28% and 35% so far this year. 
Core Scientific stock is down just 5%, while CleanSpark is up 44% from the start of 2024.
Read more: How the Bitcoin halving could impact ailing mining stocks
Stronghold tallied net income of $5.8 million during the first quarter, executives said Thursday. It held $8 million in combined cash and bitcoin on its balance sheet, as of April 30, including 26 BTC.
Beard said Stronghold trades at more than a 70% discount on an enterprise value to hash rate capacity basis.
“While factors such as scale and leverage could explain a modest discount, trading at a fraction of our peers’ multiple continues to be hard for us to understand,” he added.
The Stronghold CEO previously told Blockworks that selling the company, or its assets, to an interested industry peer would be “something to consider.” 
“Generally speaking, companies that are misunderstood by the public market that have actual attributes and value that can be valued by other public companies…tend to be realized in that way,” Beard said last month. 
Read more: Financial trouble for bitcoin miners: A look back, and ahead as the halving looms 
Joe Flynn, an analyst at Compass Point Research and Trading, wrote in an April 9 research note that Stronghold’s debt and limited access to capital markets put it in a tough position. 
It could potentially reduce expenses and “high overhead” as a small public company by selling its “valuable” infrastructure and access to power, he added.
The Stronghold executives said there is no timetable for when its strategic review process will be complete. 
They then abruptly ended Thursday’s earnings call.
Beard said: “Given the sensitivity of the process that we’ve undertaken, we are not going to have a Q&A session today.”

Asian markets react to Fed interest rates data - It's not good

Global markets experienced volatility during Thursday’s trading session as U.S. stocks closed with a mixed performance due to the Federal Reserve’s decision to postpone interest rate cuts. Any optimism for a string of interest rate reductions in 2024 has quickly faded as the economy and inflation show unexpected resilience.U.S. shares were poised for an upward trajectory, with the futures for the S&P 500 showing a strong surge of 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures indicating a 0.4% increase.Markets all over the world react to Fed ratesEuropean markets started the day with a mix of gains and losses, as investors braced themselves for a flurry of corporate earnings announcements. In early trading, London’s FTSE 100 rose by 0.4% to reach 8,155.28. Germany’s DAX saw a slight decrease of less than 0.1% to 17,925.06, while the CAC 40 in Paris experienced a 0.7% decline to 7,926.97.The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo experienced a slight decline of 0.1% and ended the day at 38,236.07. As per the announcement yesterday, the Committee aims to attain full employment and maintain a stable inflation rate of 2 percent in the long term. Additionally, the Fed Committee believes that the risks of achieving its employment and inflation goals have become more balanced over the past year. The economic outlook is filled with uncertainty, and the Committee is closely monitoring inflation risks. The Fed added that:In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
 FedMarkets in AsiaThe Japanese yen experienced a significant surge of up to 2% during the early hours of Asia on Thursday. This surge was fueled by speculation surrounding the possibility of Japanese authorities engaging in another round of yen-buying intervention. Additionally, the weakening of the U.S. dollar following the Federal Reserve meeting also contributed to this surge. Afterwards, the yen changed direction and nullified its earlier gains. The dollar had risen to 155.44 yen, compared to its previous rate of 154.91 yen.The Kospi in South Korea experienced a 0.3% decline, settling at 2,683.65. This drop came after the release of official data indicating a 2.9% year-on-year increase in consumer prices for April, which was a slower rate compared to March.The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong saw a 2.4% increase, reaching 18,187.56. Several markets in China were closed for the Labor Day holiday. Meanwhile, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 saw a modest 0.2% increase, reaching 7,587.00.On Wednesday, the S&P 500 experienced a 0.3% decline, closing at 5,018.39. This drop came after the Federal Reserve decided to maintain its main interest rate at its highest level since 2001, which was in line with market expectations. The index experienced a significant rally of 1.2% during the afternoon, only to relinquish all of its gains by the end of the trading session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 0.2% to reach 37,903.29, while the Nasdaq composite experienced a 0.3% decline, closing at 15,605.48.Asian crypto markets’ performanceIn recent months, inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2% objective, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointed out. This has caused stock prices to decline and dashed traders’ hopes for imminent cuts in interest rates. He also mentioned that it may take more time than initially anticipated to gain enough confidence to reduce interest rates. This action would help alleviate the strain on the economy and stabilize investment prices.The price of bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a modest rebound in the minutes following the news, although it continues to face downward pressure. It is currently down over 4% for the session, trading at $58,000.Furthermore, alongside the rate news, the FOMC revealed its decision to decrease the reduction of Treasuries held on its balance sheet, known as quantitative tightening (QT), from $60 billion per month to a more modest $25 billion per month. Assuming all other factors remain constant, the move is expected to increase risk appetite and drive up asset prices.

89% of Holders of Gary Gensler’s Praised Token in Loss, Just 8% See Profits - Coin Edition


							

Algorand holders face significant losses, with a staggering 89% underwater.



Only 8% of investors in ALGO are currently in profit at its price of $0.1818.



Gary Gensler previously praised Algorand, helping the asset reach $3.56 ATH.




As the crypto market experiences a downturn, crypto investors feel the heat, particularly those holding Algorand (ALGO), Gary Gensler’s praised project. Data from the analytics platform IntoTheBlock shows that 89% of ALGO holders are at a loss. These investors are “out of the money,” meaning the overwhelming majority of ALGO investors hold the asset below the price they first bought them. 



ALGO trades at $0.1818 at press time, with a 5% gain in the last 24 hours. At this market value, only 8% of Algorand holders are profitable. In parallel, 3% are at break even, neither bearish making profit or gains.



Source: IntoTheBlock



Remarkably, among the cryptocurrencies monitored by IntoTheBlock, ALGO stands out as having the highest percentage of holders in a loss position.



Furthermore, IntoTheBlock statistics indicated that at least 83% of these Algorand investors are long-term investors holding the asset for more than a year. Only 15% joined the ALGO market within the last year. Meanwhile, 2% of the holder spectrum accounts for those who bought ALGO within the last 30 days.



Silvio Micali, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor, founded Algorand in 2017. This blockchain project garnered praise from the now infamous U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, Gary Gensler. 









This was during Gensler’s tenure teaching at the MIT Sloan School of Management in 2018 and 2019. Specifically, during a 2019 presentation, Gensler remarked that Algorand is “a great technology that has a performance with which you could create Uber on top of it.”



This endorsement gained more significance after Gensler assumed the role of SEC Chair in 2021. However, when the SEC filed a lawsuit against the crypto trading platform Bittrex last April, it classified ALGO as a security. 



Despite initial optimism and endorsements, Algorand has struggled to keep pace with its peers in recent years. Three months after Gensler’s 2019 presentation, ALGO surged to an all-time high of $3.56. However, selling at around $0.1818, the asset reflects a staggering 94% drop in value since then.

BONK at risk? Funding rates suggest this about memecoin's price - AMBCrypto



BONK’s funding rates have been mostly negative since the 13th of April.
Its price may decline further if bearish momentum climbs.

The recent decline in Bonk’s [BONK] value has been accompanied by negative funding rates in the meme coin‘s futures market, according to data from Coinglass.
Funding rates are a mechanism used in perpetual futures contracts to ensure the contract price stays close to the spot price. 
When an asset’s futures funding rates turn negative, it suggests a strong demand for short positions. This is considered a bearish signal and a precursor to an asset’s price decline. 
According to Coinglass data, BONK’s funding rate across crypto exchanges has been predominantly negative since the 13th of April.  
Source: Coinglass
As of this writing, it was -0.0068%. This value shows that there are more traders in BONK’s futures market expecting its price to fall than traders buying the memecoin with the expectation of selling at a higher price.
A look at its futures open interest revealed a similar pattern of decline since 26th April. At press time, the memecoin’s futures open interest was $6 million, having declined by 33% in the last week.
An asset’s futures open interest refers to the total number of its futures contracts that have yet to be settled or closed. When it declines in this manner, it indicates an increase in the number of market participants exiting their positions without opening ones.
 It is also regarded as a bearish signal.
What BONK might do next?
BONK witnessed a brief price rally between the 20th and 25th of April, which caused its price to rise above support. 
By 25th April, the memecoin’s rally hit a snag as it could not break above resistance at $0.000029. After that, it trended downward to retest support. 
However, due to the spike in bearish momentum, BONK broke below support to close at $0.000018 on 1st May.
Source: BONK/USDT on TradingView
If bear power continues to climb, the meme coin may experience a further decline to exchange hands at $0.000015. Should the bulls fail to regain control at this point, BONK’s price may slide further downward, forcing the memecoin to trade at $0.000012.
However, if bullish momentum spikes, the coin may retest support and rally toward reclaiming resistance at $0.000029.

Shiba Inu Flashes Bull Flag, Why A 150% Price Jump Is Imminent | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) could soon witness a significant price rally, with crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighting a bullish pattern forming on the meme coin’s chart. Shiba Inu’s price could potentially see a 150% gain when this rally happens. 
A Bull Flag Is Forming On SHIB’s Chart
Martinez mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Shiba Inu looks to be forming a bull flag on its daily chart. A bull flag is a bullish pattern that indicates that the crypto asset will soon see further moves to the upside. In anticipation of this move, the crypto analyst further revealed that he was placing a buy order around $0.000018343, aiming for a bullish breakout that would send Shiba Inu’s price to $0.000072323. 


Source: X

Seeing that a rise to that price level represents about a 150% price gain for the meme coin, some of Martinez’s followers seemed skeptical about the prediction, with some jokingly asking the crypto analyst if his account was hacked again. Interestingly, this prediction is far from ambitious, considering that Martinez previously predicted that the meme coin could eventually rise to $0.011. 
Meanwhile, those looking to jump on Martinez’s trade idea could also adopt Crypto analyst Crypto Noan’s profit-taking strategy if Shiba Inu doesn’t get to $0.000072323 as Martinez predicts. Noan highlighted four price levels at which SHIB investors should consider taking profit as the meme coin moves to the upside. 
These price levels are $0.000028181, $0.000032816, $0.000039035, and $0.000043609. That means that all Noan’s take profit-targets will be filled on Shiba Inu’s potential rise to $0.000072323. Therefore, investors might want to consider securing some profits along the way
Shiba Inu Could Indeed Hit $0.000072323 Soon
Shiba Inu rising to $0.00072323 looks like a real possibility, considering that crypto analyst and trader Xanrox hinted that the meme coin would rise to as high as $0.00008854 by July. Xanrox also predicted that Shiba Inu will record a 300% price gain before the end of this year. Therefore, a 150% move from its current price level could easily be attained. 

Moreover, other crypto analysts like Javon Marks have predicted that SHIB could shed another zero and rise to as high as $0.0001553 in this bull run. Shiba already announced its intention to be one of the best-performing assets in this cycle, with a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 100%.    
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00002196, up over 3% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin Slump Pushes New Whales Underwater: A Rare Opportunity To Buy?


                            As Bitcoin slumps, on-chain data by Ki Young Ju, the founder of the blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, paints a stark picture: all new whales, including holders of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are now underwater. 
New Whales And Spot ETF Investors Are In Red
Taking to X, Ju said that more losses would be incoming, predicting that HODLers will find “max pain” at around $51,000. The dip is less than $10,000 from spot rates, suggesting that although there are cracks, the correction might not be deep. 

This overview is welcomed, considering the recent sell-off. Even so, predicting price bottoms in a fast-moving market influenced by multiple forces is tough.

As price action stands, Ju says believers may take the opportunity to double down on the coin. The founder adds that the current price discount presents an opportunity for savvy investors to outperform traditional finance whales, including institutions with BTC exposure via spot ETFs in the United States.

Bitcoin is under immense liquidation pressure at the time of this writing. Though bulls soaked up the sell-off earlier today, the coin remains within a bearish breakout. Prices are trading below the support zone of between $60,000 and $61,000 and below April 2024.
Inflow To Spot Bitcoin ETFs Decline As Sentiment Deteriorate
This formation suggests that though bulls are optimistic, the path of least resistance remains southwards for now. BTC dropped after posting impressive returns from October 2023 to March 2024, when prices peaked. Some analysts think the current cool-off is inevitable following sharp gains in the last six months.
The fact that whales are underwater was unexpected, considering the state of affairs in the last week of April. Then, the inflow from new whales nearly doubled the cumulative holdings of older whales. Analysts said this influx of fresh capital pointed to growing institutional interest. 
However, looking at the current price action, new whales are now in the red territory, and their excitement seems to wane. 

According to Lookonchain data, inflow into the eight-spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock, has stalled. On May 1, all issuers, including Grayscale via GBTC, decreased by 1,950 BTC. Of note is that BlackRock’s IBIT has not seen inflows for five straight days.

Still, confidence abounds. Inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs are highly influenced by sentiment, which rests on how prices perform. If BTC shakes off the current weakness and tears higher in the expected post-Halving rally, spot ETF issuers will begin receiving new inflows.

XRP to Replace the Dollar? Crypto Pundit Predicts Major Role for Ripple's XRP Ledger in Japan ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Cryptocurrency commentator Jack Straw has ignited a debate with his assertion that XRP could potentially replace the US dollar in Japan. This bold statement comes as Ripple, in collaboration with HashKey DX, makes strides in introducing XRP Ledger-based solutions to the Japanese market.



The partnership aims to offer supply chain finance solutions powered by the XRPL blockchain, with the backing of Japanese financial giant SBI Group. If Jack Straw’s prediction holds, this move could significantly impact Japan’s financial landscape and potentially revolutionize cross-border trade.







Ripple’s Strategic Move into the Japanese Market



Ripple’s partnership with HashKey DX marks a strategic move to tap into Japan’s supply chain finance market, which is experiencing rapid growth. A recent research report suggests that blockchain’s role in supply chain finance is set to surge from $360 million to $13.4 billion by 2030.



With the introduction of HashKey DX’s supply chain finance product, which is already successful in China with over $7 billion in trade volume, Ripple aims to replicate this success in Japan. This initiative aligns with Ripple’s broader goal of promoting the adoption of the XRP Ledger and strengthening its position in the global financial ecosystem.



Jack Straw’s assertion that XRP could replace the US dollar in Japan hinges on several key factors. He argues that Japan has already begun adopting XRPL-based solutions, citing SBI Group’s introduction of an XRP-based cross-border payment service last September.

&nbsp



According to Straw, this move signals Japan’s willingness to explore alternatives to traditional banking systems. He further speculates that XRP could be a liquidity source to replace the dollar in Japan’s currency exchange operations, potentially reducing its reliance on the SWIFT network.



Implications for Japan’s Economy and Global Trade



If XRP were to replace the US dollar in Japan’s currency exchange, it could have significant implications for the country’s economy and global trade relationships.



Jack Straw believes this shift would accelerate Japan’s de-dollarization process, leading to the country selling off its dollar reserves in favor of other assets like gold. Additionally, introducing an XRP stablecoin could facilitate the digital movement of funds, further reducing Japan’s dependence on traditional banking systems.



While speculative, Jack Straw’s prediction raises intriguing possibilities for the future of Japan’s economic landscape. If Ripple’s initiatives gain traction in the Japanese market, we could witness a significant shift in how the country conducts its monetary operations.



Michael Saylor Urges Japan to Adopt Bitcoin



Amid the Japanese Yen’s plunge to its lowest value against the USD in 34 years, social media is buzzing with a growing discussion about Bitcoin as a more stable alternative to fiat currency.



This discussion has gained traction, with prominent Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor highlighting Bitcoin’s potential to offer a ray of hope to Japan in the face of its currency challenges.

Bitcoin Transactions Plummet Following Absurd Runes and Halving Surge - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe price of Bitcoin may have taken a hit as of late—but at least you can again make payments using the coin with relative ease. Transaction fees for Bitcoin are now back to the lows it stood at last month. The average cost for a transaction is $4.50 as of this writing, according to BitInfoCharts.Following the quadrennial halving event last month, the cost to send Bitcoin hit a record high of $128 per transaction as the network became clogged with activity following the concurrent launch of Runes, a new standard for creating tokens on the blockchain.The flurry of activity on Bitcoin’s network often made the transaction fee more expensive than the amount of money being sent, Decrypt found.Bitcoin transaction fees go up when more people use the network because they are part of the way transactions are prioritized. Everyone wants their payment to be processed as quickly as possible, given the notorious volatility of BTC.If the network is busy, more users will pay a premium for miners to prioritize validating their transactions. When making a Bitcoin payment, you always have the option of paying lower fees, but by doing so, you risk waiting for hours as miners prioritize more lucrative transactions.Bitcoin miners are increasingly large operations—usually operating warehouses full of computers—that work to mint Bitcoin and process transactions. They are rewarded for each block they process on the network, but that reward was slashed in half in the halving.In order to remain profitable, mining operations need to become more efficient. But in the meantime, higher fees certainly helped.Bitcoin touched a new all-time high of $73,737 last month but stands at $59,248 as of writing, a drop of nearly 20%, according to CoinGecko.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

BlackRock expects spot Bitcoin trading by sovereign funds and pensions |

Bitcoin’s current standing near $60,000 marks a 50% jump since January, a spike largely fueled by the U.S.’s green light on its first spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock, a key player in these ETFs, has caught the attention of big-money investors like sovereign wealth funds, which are getting ready to enter the trading scene in the months ahead.Market Dynamics and Investor InterestBlackRock’s Robert Mitchnick, Head of Bitcoin and Crypto Strategies, recently shared that a diverse group of financial institutions is keen on Bitcoin. This includes pensions, endowments, insurers, other asset managers, and family offices.The company is seeing these firms engage in thorough research and ongoing discussions about Bitcoin. They are contributing by educating them on the crypto industry, Mitchnick told Coindesk. This surge in interest marks a resurgence in Bitcoin discussions, suggesting a strategic shift in how these institutions view portfolio construction with Bitcoin in mind.Despite a temporary slowdown in money moving into spot Bitcoin ETFs after an impressive 71-day run of inflows, Mitchnick believes this is just the calm before a new influx of investment from these heavyweight financial entities.According to him, the anticipation around these ETFs has been building, with over $76 billion already pouring into these products since their inception in January. While currently, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF is offered on an unsolicited basis by some RIAs, plans are on the table to expand access through major wealth advisors like Morgan Stanley.BlackRock’s ETF Performance and Industry TrendsThe race to dominate the ETF market has been a hot topic, especially between BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC. The latest data shows IBIT managing assets worth $17.2 billion, while GBTC has about $24.3 billion. A significant portion of IBIT’s funds comes from transfers from Grayscale, with additional inflows from pricier international ETFs and those converting from Bitcoin futures.The shift from futures to spot products indicates a preference among investors to hold Bitcoin directly through more regulated, traditional financial systems, avoiding the complexities of custody and tax implications tied to exchanges. Despite the fierce competition, Mitchnick points out that BlackRock’s focus isn’t on outpacing Grayscale but on equipping their clients with the knowledge to navigate the crypto space effectively.Wednesday brought a stark change, with record outflows from all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs—a first since these funds were established. The downturn saw $563.7 million withdrawn in a single day, culminating in a four-week loss of about $6 billion, a 20% decrease in assets under management.Even BlackRock’s flagship IBIT wasn’t spared, witnessing its first outflows of $36.9 million. The declines in Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC were even steeper, with losses tallying $191.1 million and $167.4 million, respectively.This trend correlates directly with Bitcoin’s price movements. After peaking at an all-time high of $73,000 in March, Bitcoin has since dropped nearly 20%, settling around $59,000. This price drop and the resultant ETF outflows began around the same time, underscoring the challenges and volatility inherent in the crypto market.

Hong Kong Bankers' Guide to the Middle East - Coin Edition


							

Interest among Hong Kong bankers in Middle East opportunities grows.
Bahrain-based Investcorp Holdings recently unveiled plans to launch a $1 billion fund.
The favorable tax environment in the Middle East, with zero income tax, contrasts Hong Kong’s 16% maximum rate, 




Hong Kong bankers are increasingly eyeing opportunities in the Middle East as interest in Asia’s self-acclaimed “World City” increases. This trend is marked by notable developments like the upcoming market forum co-hosted by the Hong Kong Exchange and its Saudi Arabian counterpart. As revealed by Bloomberg, this partnership signals the emerging collaboration between the two regions. 



Moreover, Bahrain-based Investcorp Holdings recently unveiled plans to launch a $1 billion fund. This initiative targets Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, further highlighting increased cross-regional investment strategies.



Bloomberg’s insights noted that the Middle East’s favorable tax environment is a significant catalyst for growing interest as the region’s “zero” income tax starkly contrasts Hong Kong’s 16% maximum rate. 



This factor, coupled with the substantial wealth of Gulf countries, promises appealing prospects for financial professionals seeking tax-efficient opportunities. “Countries in the Middle East are so wealthy that four of the world’s top 10 sovereign wealth funds are from the Gulf—those in Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. So read their lips: They don’t need your taxes,” Bloomberg stated.



However, individuals pointed out lifestyle adjustments such as increased “housing cost” and little reliance on public transportation in the region. Although accommodations in the Middle East are more spacious, sources expressed that Hong Kong offers a more efficient public transit system and unique natural landscapes away from the city center.



Moreover, people stressed the varying alcohol regulations across Gulf cities. While Dubai and Abu Dhabi offer relatively liberal access to alcohol, cities like Riyadh have strict prohibitions. This highlights the importance of understanding cultural norms and regulations in prospective relocation destinations.



Furthermore, for individuals seeking halal dietary requirements, the Middle East offers an array of such restaurants, including “Non-Muslim Only” supermarkets. Given these, financial experts considering relocation should examine factors such as taxation, lifestyle preferences, and cultural nuances before deciding.

Hundred Finance Hacker Transfers Stolen Funds After A Year Of Inactivity

                        The Hundred Finance hacker, responsible for the $7.4 million crypto theft, resurfaced on May 1 after a year of inactivity and started moving crypto assets from Curve’s decentralized exchange.Etherscan data revealed that a year ago, the hacker withdrew ETH and USDT worth about $800,000 that had previously served as liquidity on Curve.Hundred Finance Hacker Generates $1M Profit
Following the withdrawal, the culprit converted the USDT and smaller amounts of altcoins, including PAXG and DAI, into Ethereum. These transactions increased the hacker’s Ether holdings by over $1 million.As a result, the hacker now holds a total of $6.48 million worth of crypto assets, including $4.39 million worth of Ether, $1.24 million DAI, $426,000 of Wrapped Ether, $412,000 of FRAX, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Bitcoin.Hundred Finance hacker holds $6.48M worth of crypto assets.Hundred Finance, a project on the Optimism blockchain, suffered a security breach in 2023, losing $7.4 million in assets.According to Peckshield, a popular on-chain security firm, the criminal inflated the exchange rate for hWBTC by donating 200 WBTC. With a tiny amount of hWBTC, they managed to drain Hundred Finance’s lending pools. The exploit was analyzed as a combination of flash loans, critical rounding error, and smart contract manipulation.The movement of funds from the Hundred Finance attack mirrors a recent report on a similar incident. Earlier this week, CryptoNews reported that the attacker behind the Poloniex security breach had transferred the funds after months of dormancy.The hacker stole assets worth $33M from the exchange in 2023. A few days ago, they transferred 501 BTC (approximately $32M) to three new wallet addresses to hide the assets’ origin.Crackdown on Crypto Mixer Adds Pressure on Cybercriminals
Many analysts believe it might be difficult for the Hundred Finance hacker to conceal the asset’s origin or convert it to fiat without a trace.To succeed in any of these, the perpetrator has to break the traceability chain that links the funds to the hacked wallet before cashing it out – which is a tall order, as it seems. Typically, crypto mixer services like Samourai Wallet or Tornado Cash – where his exploit originated – would have provided a convenient cover to launder the funds. However, with US regulators breathing down their necks, these services are no longer a viable option for criminals.Last week, the creators of Samourai Wallet founders were arrested and charged by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) over the alleged laundering of $100 million from an illicit market and helping criminals to launder $1.7B.This comes after Tornado Cash’s co-founders, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, were indicted for allegedly enabling more than $1 billion in money laundering through their platform.Meanwhile, global regulators are tightening the screws on crypto users who hide their transaction histories. The European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers on April 24, 2024, as part of new anti-money laundering regulations.

Elizabeth Warren's Latest Crypto Crusade: Bitcoin Mining In Iran - Decrypt

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is sounding yet another alarm about the ills of cryptocurrency; this time focused on cryptocurrency mining operations in Iran that she claims are financing Hamas and other terrorist groups around the world.In an open letter to the Biden Administration—co-signed by Sen. Angus King—Warren asked the secretaries of Defense and Treasury as well as the White House National Security Advisor about the administration’s efforts to “combat Iran’s rampant evasion of U.S. and international sanctions through cryptocurrency (crypto) mining.”“Iran legalized the crypto mining industry in 2019,” Warren and King wrote. “In the five years since Iran has raised millions of dollars through mining crypto… a steady revenue source that allows it to purchase imports, move funds domestically and internationally, and fund Hamas and other terrorist organizations.“This ongoing activity by the Iranian government threatens our national security,” the senators warn.“Mining for energy-intensive blockchains like Bitcoin can allow countries to monetize energy resources, some of which cannot be exported due to sanctions,” the letter continued, citing an April 2022 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report.Warren and King also mentioned a February 2024 Chainalysis report. “More than three percent of all inflows to Iranian crypto exchanges—and more than 29% of all Bitcoin inflows—are estimated to come from mining pools,” they wrote.Warren and King enumerated several questions for the Biden Administration to answer regarding Iran's cryptocurrency activities. How much revenue has Iranian crypto miners generated since 2021? What share is collected by the government or its affiliates? And to what extent do these funds support terrorism or military activities?The Senators also want to know what the administration has been doing to address the national security threats posed by Iran's alleged sanction-evading crypto activity.“Unless we take action, Iran will continue to use crypto to fund attacks against Israel,” the senators said.The letter to the White House is the latest salvo from Warren in her ongoing campaign to fight the use of cryptocurrency in illicit activities.In December, Warren called for the Bank Secrecy Act to be updated to address the “threat” of crypto, claiming that North Korea is using cryptocurrency to fund its nuclear weapons program. Then in April, Warren asked the U.S. Department of Justice and Homeland Security to respond to questions on how Congress can help them fight Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) funded with cryptocurrency.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

What Fetch.ai (FET) Price Needs for a 25% Bull Rally


Following the broader market cues, Fetch.ai’s (FET) price fell below the support of $2, but it is likely on the verge of bouncing back. 
This is because the altcoin is in an ideal spot for accumulation, indicating potential gains going forward.
Fetch.ai Is Undervalued
Fetch.ai’s price could observe a recovery, given the altcoin is trading above a key support level. Currently, the altcoin is noting a surge in participation. This is evident in the increase in active addresses in the last 48 hours. 
The total number of investors conducting transactions on the network rose from 1,152 to 2,152, marking a 93% increase. While this could be interpreted as FET holders attempting to sell to minimize their losses, the larger picture is bullish.

An increase in participation combined with a decrease in price is usually considered a buy signal. This divergence created by the daily active addresses and price suggests increased supply and lower demand, making it an ideal buy zone.

Furthermore, FET is highly undervalued at the moment, which makes it an attractive investment. This can be noted using the Sharpe Ratio. 
This indicator measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment, considering its volatility. It helps investors assess the return generated per unit of risk taken, providing insight into the efficiency of an investment in generating returns relative to its risk.
Given that Fetch.ai’s Sharpe ratio is bouncing back from a six-month low, it has considerable room for growth.

FET Price Prediction: Gains Ahead
Fetch.ai’s price, trading at $1.95 at the time of writing, is just under the support line formed at $1.96. This support level has been tested multiple times in the past and has not yet been broken down. Considerable gains have followed a bounce back from this support.
Thus, the likely outcome for FET is a rally towards $2.46. This resistance was tested in the last run-up from $1.96 and would mark a 25% rally for Fetch.ai price, provided it successfully breached the $2.26 barrier.

On the other hand, if Fetch.ai’s price falls through the support at $1.96, it could escape the consolidation. In doing so, the bullish thesis will be invalidated, and FET could fall to $1.71.

No, Elon Musk Is Not Testing XRP Payments


Vet, a validator on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has shut down rumors about Elon Musk's X social media network testing XRP payments. The rumor was based on the fact that a transaction with the "Musk" label was recently spotted on the network. However, as noted by Vet, there is no authorization needed from the famous entrepreneur for labeling this account. "I can label my account to be by Musk or JPM as well. No proof needed," he added. X is actually expected to launch peer-to-peer payments this year. However, it is not clear whether Musk's social network will actually support cryptocurrencies. In any case, Dogecoin appears to be the likeliest contender, so the idea of XRP being used for payments on X appears to be extremely far-fetched. A fix is coming There is an amendment that is supposed to add Decentralized Identifier (DID) functionality to the ledger. According to Vet, it will solve the impersonalization issue. cardThe amendment, which was developed in accordance with standards and guidelines for the World Wide Web, will be able to provide users with their own digital identity that will not be dependent on any centralized authority. On top of being decentralized, DIDs are also cryptographically verifiable, meaning that they are tamper-evident.  An account holder will be able to generate a DID that will be used for signing digital documents, making transactions, and logging into websites The identity of an XRPL user would be verified with the help of a DID document that could contain cryptographic public keys. Only those who control private keys can change the content of the document. Users are advised against uploading personal information in these documents.

US lawmakers urge SEC to approve Bitcoin options trading

United States lawmakers are reportedly pressing the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve options trading on Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). According to a report by Axios, Representatives Mike Flood and Wiley Nickel recently wrote a letter to the Commission’s chair, Gary Gensler, urging the SEC to stop discriminating against crypto funds."We urge you, without delay, to approve options on spot Bitcoin ETPs or to provide an explanation for the Commission’s difference in treatment between options for Bitcoin futures ETFs — which are currently trading — and options for the spot Bitcoin ETPs,” reads the bipartisan letter. Options are financial instruments that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset — in this case, Bitcoin — at a fixed price by a certain date. The instrument is commonly used for hedging against price movements, limiting potential losses and enabling investors to generate additional income through strategies. The approval, according to Flood and Nickel, is crucial for the investors that the SEC "seeks to protect."The agency has been holding off on decisions on applications from the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets submitted in January. Nasdaq filed to list and trade options on BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, while Cboe intends to offer options trading on various BTC funds. Similarly, the NYSE intends to trade options on Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Grayscale Bitcoin Trusts (GBTC) and any other trusts holding Bitcoin.Recently, the Commission initiated a new consultation round on the proposed rule change to permit options trading on Bitcoin funds.

Time to Buy SHIB? Popular Analyst Bets on a 300% Shiba Inu Price Rally


																TL;DR

Shiba Inu experienced a 5% price increase daily, with optimistic forecasts from analysts like Ali Martinez, who predicts a significant upcoming rally due to positive chart patterns.
The potential for an uptick is supported by a significant resurgence in SHIB’s burning program and ongoing enhancements to Shibarium.


Betting on a SHIB Bull Run
The cryptocurrency market flashed green today (May 2) after suffering substantial losses the previous day. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is among the best performers (at least from the top 20 club), registering a 5% price increase on a 24-hour scale.

SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko
One analyst who is optimistic that the meme coin is yet to experience a significant rally is Ali Martinez. The X user believes SHIB’s price trajectory might be forming a bull flag on the daily chart.
Ali Martinez went further, admitting to placing buy orders at current rates and expecting a 300% surge to approximately $0.000072323 in the near future.
Other analysts who recently envisioned a bright future for the meme coin include Rekt Capital and crypto content creator Jake Gagain. The former forecasted a triple-digit price increase, while the latter maintained that “fading” Shiba Inu “is a major mistake.” 




The Contributing Factors
Two essential elements that may fuel a SHIB rally in the short term are the asset’s burning program and the development of Shibarium.
As CryptoPotato reported, the burn rate spiked by 90% on May 1, whereas the destroyed tokens throughout April equaled almost 1.7 billion. The mechanism’s ultimate goal is to decrease the tremendous circulating supply of Shiba Inu, making it scarcer and possibly more valuable in time.
Shibarium has been making great strides, too. The asset’s layer-2 scaling solution underwent a major upgrade last week and is set to pass through another one this week. The advancements aim at improving user experience, implement quicker block processing times, and empower the community of developers and innovators.
Some of the primary roles of Shibarium include the reduction of transaction fees and enhancing the utility, scalability, and efficiency of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. If you are willing to learn more about the network, feel free to dive into our dedicated video below:

Analysts expect Bitcoin price recovery after Fed leaves rates unchanged

Bitcoin (BTC) price recovered on May 2 after the United States Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged and dampened investors’ hope for rate cuts in 2024. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes released on May 1, the Fed said interest rates would stay at 5.25%–5.50%, adding that it would need “greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%” before cutting rates.The Fed also revealed plans to slow the pace of its balance sheet reductions – the so-called quantitative tightening (QT) – from $60 billion per month to just $25 billion per month. “Beginning in June, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $60 billion to $25 billion.”Market analyst and X user Fejau said the FOMC press release sent mixed signals, being dovish on the balance sheet and hawkish on rate cuts.

An important metric to consider is the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (STH MVRV) ratio, which, according to data from Santiment, currently stands at -6%. This ratio essentially compares the current price at which Bitcoin is trading (the market value) to the average price at which coins were last moved (the realized value).According to the market intelligence firm, markets bounce most effectively when the MVRV ratio is in the negative range.Bitcoin MVRV ratio.

As Crypto Prices and Sentiment Fall, One Analyst Says Bitcoin’s Back Slide Is Almost Over - The Daily Hodl


								After a week of falling prices for crypto led by Bitcoin (BTC), a widely-followed analyst says the bottom is nearly in.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe warns his 715,600 followers on the social media platform X that it could still take some time for BTC to recover from falling nearly 7% in the last two weeks.










“It’s going to take a while for Bitcoin.
However, most of the downside is done. 
There might be another 5-10% correction, but from here, altcoins are going to take over until Bitcoin breaks the all-time high.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is worth $59,290 at time of writing, up 4% in the last 24 hours.
Pulling back the curtain on altcoins, Van de Poppe says this slump should be expected after the long hibernation of a bear market.
“Sentiment is on the ground, retail isn’t here and the expectations are that the markets will solely continue to fall down. 
That’s entirely expected after the longest bear market for altcoins, which has been taking place for 2.5-3 years.”
Looking specifically at the Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 altcoin Optimism (OP), the analyst remains optimistic about the token’s future.
“One of the strongest performers since the last low; OP.
It’s up more than 50% already.
Expecting to continue running in the coming period, every 20-30% dip is an opportunity to scoop some more.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
OP is worth $2.77 at time of writing, up 9% on the day.
Focusing on the leading altcoin by market cap Ethereum, the crypto analyst thinks ETH could drop to $2,500 before rallying.
“Ethereum might be dropping to the $2,500 area for the most optimal play.
Personally, I don’t think the markets are going to be having such a heavy correction. 
Most of the downside is already in.”

ETH is trading for $2,997 at time of writing, up 4% since yesterday.

Ripple Ramps Up Effort to Strike SEC's Expert Materials


San Francisco-based company Ripple has filed a new letter to bolster its motion to strike the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's expert materials. As reported by U.Today, Ripple moved to strike the expert materials from Andrea Fox, an assistant chief accountant in the regulator's Division of EnforcementIts key argument against the SEC hinged on the untimely disclosure. The defendant said that the regulator was supposed to disclose its expert witness before the final stage of the discovery. Ripple took issue with the fact that Fox was not disclosed as an expert witness. Instead, she was described as a summary witness by the SEC. In its most recent filing, Ripple says that the SEC has no good explanation as to why Fox's declaration touts her as an accountant if she is not testifying as an expert. Ripple asserts that Fox did "much more" than simply copying, pasting, and adding numbers. Furthermore, it says that the SEC's cases do not support the agency's characterization of a summary witness. "Even if Fox were a summary witness, rather an expert, the parties' agreement and the Court's scheduling order required the SEC to disclose her before the close of discovery."In April, Ripple also filed its opposition to the SEC's motion for remedies, arguing that the civil penalty should be reduced to a puny $10 million. Meanwhile, the SEC argued that Ripple had to fork out a whopping $2 billion.The SEC originally took Ripple to court all the way back in December 2020. Last July, the company scored a partial victory, with XRP gaining regulatory clarity in the US. Despite this win, the token has significantly underperformed Bitcoin.

MicroStrategy Takes on Worldcoin ID with Bitcoin Inscriptions - DailyCoin


        
MicroStrategy introduces a decentralized ID system.



Anchors digital identities on Bitcoin’s blockchain.



Challenges Worldcoin and its World. 
Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy is betting big on Bitcoin. Known for its strong Bitcoin maximalist position and large BTC holdings, MicroStrategy is now expanding into a new arena. With its digital identity protocol launch, the firm is creating its own digital identity system, potentially challenging Worldcoin’s World ID system. The goal is to centralize the Bitcoin blockchain to a new digital identity system. Why Digital Identities Are Key for BlockchainDuring the recent MicroStrategy World Conference on Thursday, May 2, Michael Saylor pointed out the need to manage digital identity on the blockchain. He also unveiled a new MicroStrategy Orange protocol, which will use Bitcoin’s inscription technology to create a digital identity system. 
Digital identity has been a contentious issue in crypto due to privacy concerns. However, crypto insides are increasingly converging around the need for such a technology to combat spam and enable decentralized governance. Moreover, the digital ID system could prevent scams. In January, Saylor warned about the staggering rise of AI deepfakes plaguing the crypto space. The scams use realistic videos, including those of himself and figures like Elon Musk, to convince people to send crypto to unaffiliated wallets. So far, Worldcoin, co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, has been the biggest player in the digital identity space. Its orb-scanning technology uses biometric data to verify that users are real humans. This enables it to give priority to real human transactions, reducing the problems with blockchain spam. Now, Saylor seeks to bring these digital IDs to Bitcoin, which is, as he often points out, the most secure and decentralized network. How MicroStrategy’s Digital Identity Will WorkUnlike Worldcoin, MicroStrategy’s new Orange Protocol will not use biometric data. Instead, it will create decentralized identities (DIDs) that can be used for verification without centralized control. The protocol will generate and embed digital identity data directly into the Bitcoin blockchain using the technology known as ordinal inscriptions. 
These inscriptions are not part of the transaction outputs but are appended in a way that does not affect the transaction’s primary purpose (transferring Bitcoin). As such, they did: the method embeds digital identity data directly into the Bitcoin blockchain using a part of the transaction known as the “witness.” Bitcoin’s Segregated Witness (SegWit) method optimizes the space and cost of transactions. By inscribing identity data into this section, the method ensures that identity information is secure and immutable, benefiting from the blockchain’s inherent resistance to tampering and revision.On the Flipside
Unlike Worldcoin, MicroStrategy’s digital ID will not directly provide proof of personhood based on biometric data. Instead, it will leverage the immutability of Bitcoin’s blockchain to create digital identity profiles.



In April, Telegram’s TON introduced its own blockchain digital ID system based on palm prints. 
Why This MattersMicroStrategy’s venture into decentralized digital identities using Bitcoin’s blockchain could offer a secure and immutable alternative to biometric-based systems like Worldcoin. This approach broadens Bitcoin’s application to include vital identity verification processes in the blockchain ecosystem. Read more about why Bitcoin needs a digital ID system: Michael Saylor Sounds the Alarm on Bitcoin Scam EpidemicRead more about Tether’s reserves and where their profits come from: Tether Reports Record Profits: Breaking Down USDT Reserves

US lawmakers warn of Iranian crypto miners threatening national security

United States Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus King penned a letter to officials warning of potential national security threats posed by cryptocurrency miners in Iran.In a May 1 letter to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the two lawmakers called on the Biden administration to provide information related to possible ties between the Iranian government and local crypto miners and how digital assets might be used to bypass U.S. sanctions. According to Senators Warren and King, Iran has used funds from crypto mining to fund terrorist organizations and the country’s April attack on Israel.“Iran’s use of crypto to evade sanctions poses a direct threat to our national security,” said the letter. “The Iranian military has used crypto to fund known terrorist groups like Hezbollah, the organization believed to be partially responsible for the January 2024 drone strike in Jordan that killed three U.S. service members [...] Unless we take action, Iran will continue to use crypto to fund attacks against Israel.”Source: The HillSenators Warren and King requested U.S. officials provide data on the revenue of crypto miners in Iran, how it is potentially used for money laundering and its response to “address threats to U.S. national security.” The two cited a report from an Iranian think tank saying the government preferred “newly-minted” Bitcoin (BTC), claiming they were “less traceable.” Reports suggested Iranian BTC miners could have produced up to $1 billion in revenue in 2021. Related: Crypto users fooled by fake Elizabeth Warren letter proposing crypto taxIran has been under various sanctions the United States and international authorities imposed since 1979. Iranian officials previously cracked down on crypto mining in the country, citing concerns about electricity use, but the government legalized the practice in 2019. Senator Warren continues to be one of the most outspoken anti-crypto voices in the U.S. government, associating the technology with illicit drug trafficking, terrorism and harmful effects on the economy. She is up for reelection in November and will likely face off against Republican candidate and crypto lawyer John Deaton for her Massachusetts Senate seat.Magazine: Lawmakers’ fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US

BNP Paribas buys BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF shares | Cryptopolitan

BNP Paribas, Europe’s second-largest bank, recently made a big move in the cryptocurrency space by purchasing shares in BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This purchase, as detailed in a 13F filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 1st, saw the bank acquire 1,030 IBIT shares at over $40 per share, totaling $42,684.Market MovesWhile this price per share seems small compared to Bitcoin’s trading price of over $58,000, it is a major investment by BNP Paribas into the cryptocurrency market, particularly into a fund that has quickly become the most successful of the newly approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. With this purchase, BNP Paribas is tapping into the success of BlackRock’s IBIT, a fund that leads with $17.24 billion in assets under management despite recent market fluctuations.This acquisition not only marks BNP Paribas as the first major financial institution to get into such a venture but also demonstrates a growing institutional interest in Bitcoin and related investment offerings. The filing reveals that the transaction was part of a broader trend where major traditional financial players begin to engage more deeply with digital assets.Challenges in the Crypto MarketHowever, the cryptocurrency market has seen a lot of volatility. Recent data from CoinGlass indicates that all 10 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows for the first time this Wednesday, marking the most substantial loss since these funds began trading in January. Over the last four weeks, these funds have seen about $6 billion wiped off their books, a reduction of around 20% in assets under management.Source: NasdaqBlackRock’s IBIT saw $36.9 million in outflows, its first such event since inception. The other major funds, Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC, reported losses of $191.1 million and $167.4 million, respectively. This downturn coincides with Bitcoin’s price correction; after a 65% rise to a peak of $73,000 in March, the price has dropped nearly 20%, now hovering around $59,000.Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, provided insights into the situation, noting that while the recent outflows might seem alarming, they align with the typical ebb and flow expected in the early stages of ETFs. He pointed out that despite the market’s downturn, many investors still hold their positions, betting long-term on the asset’s value.The underlying volatility of Bitcoin, much like the recent price corrections influenced by various economic factors—including Federal Reserve policies and the aftermath of Bitcoin halving—remains a crucial reminder to investors about the inherent risks and opportunities in cryptocurrency investments.Moreover, while the market faces these challenges, the broader acceptance and growth of Bitcoin ETFs could be hampered by regulatory delays. For example, despite filings by major exchanges like Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE Arca to the SEC for trading related ETF options, there has been little progress.Balchunas likened the situation to putting a band’s music on Spotify as opposed to selling vinyl records — more audience might be reachable, but the core product must stand strong on its own merits.

Binance Wallet announces support for Bitcoin Atomical ARC-20 assets

Crypto exchange Binance has integrated Bitcoin ARC-20 atomical assets into its native Web3 wallet through its Inscriptions Marketplace. "ARC-20 is a token standard that makes it possible to create fungible tokens that can be held and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain," Binance staff wrote on May 2. "To celebrate this new integration, we’re offering zero-fee trading on ARC-20 tokens until June 2, 2024."Invented in January, the Atomicals protocol, mirrored after Ethereum's ERC-20 standard, allows for the minting, transferring and updating of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain. "Even if an Atomical is updated or exchanges hands 10,000 times – that amounts to only about 2.5 MB of data (250 bytes x 10,000)," Atomicals developers explained. "Any client, wallet, marketplace, game, and service can rapidly verify the Atomical by processing the history according to the very simple rules."Outside of NFTs, current use for Bitcoin Atomicals includes web hosting, file storage, atomic swaps, real-world asset tokenization, decentralized social media, and many more. Aside from Atomicals, Binance Wallet's May 2 update also includes support for BEVM, a decentralized Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible Bitcoin layer-two based on Taproot that uses BTC as gas fees to execute smart contracts. The move follows the adoption of ARC-20 assets by other exchanges. In February, crypto exchange Bitget announced the support of Bitcoin Atomicals through its native self-custody wallet. Similarly, crypto exchange OKX has an entire marketplace dedicated to Bitcoin Atomical assets. Despite worries about becoming technologically obsolete with the rise of smart contract blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), Bitcoin is rapidly closing the technological gap with the advent of innovations such as Ordinals, Inscriptions, Runes, and Atomicals, all within the past year. Last quarter, Orders Exchange completed integration with the Bitcoin Runes protocol to allow the issuance of fungible tokens on the native network and constructed a Bitcoin asset bridge with MicroVisionChain that enables BRC-20 token swaps. Meanwhile, omnichain yield-generating protocol SolvBTC has accumulated a total value locked (TVL) of $700 million from its yield-bearing Bitcoin minted on Arbitrum, Merlin, and BNB Smart Chain. The protocol estimates the mechanism can generate annual returns of 5%–10% on users’ BTC deposits. Related: Kraken exchange rolls out self-custody crypto wallet, following other CEXs

Aave Labs Unveils Major Upgrades and Expansions with Aave V4 Proposal


																Aave Labs, the team behind the DeFi lending platform Aave, has proposed a slew of major upgrades and expansions two years after introducing its V3.
The suggested improvements include Aave V4, Aave Network, a Cross-Chain Liquidity Layer, non-EVM L1 deployments, and a fresh visual identity.
Aave V4
According to the latest blog post, Aave V4 will be built with a brand-new architecture featuring an efficient and modular design while aiming to minimize disruptions to third-party integrators.
The most important architectural change of the latest iteration is the proposed introduction of a Unified Liquidity Layer, which expands on the Portals concept introduced in Aave V3. This layer enables a fully agnostic, independent, and abstracted infrastructure for liquidity provisioning.
It is also proposed to manage supply/draw caps, interest rates, assets, and incentives while enabling other modules to draw liquidity from it. This would allow the Aave DAO to add or remove borrow modules without the need to migrate liquidity.




The main function of this architecture approach is to facilitate the addition or improvement of borrowing features without overhauling the entire system or the liquidation module while simultaneously addressing the issue of fragmented liquidity present in older versions of the protocol.
Aave’s proposal revealed that the liquidity layer is capable of natively supporting both supplied and natively minted assets, thereby improving integration with GHO and other collateralized protocol-native assets. Aave V4 also proposes fully automated interest rates with adjustable slopes and kink points.
Other Proposed Features
‘Smart Accounts’ is yet another feature that has been proposed for introduction in the V4 iteration in a bid to streamline the user experience by addressing a major issue with Aave V3 – eliminating the need for separate wallets to manage positions when borrowing using eMode or isolated assets. Users will be able to create multiple smart accounts within a single wallet, simplifying interactions with the protocol.
The proposal also features a dynamic configuration mechanism per asset, where users are “hooked” to the current configuration of an asset when they borrow. If a new asset configuration is needed, a new instance is created while existing users remain hooked to the previous configuration.
Meanwhile, the company mentioned that they are collaborating with Chainlink to investigate solutions for fully automating risk management. The concept involves utilizing ad-hoc, on-chain feeds to evaluate asset risk and dynamically adjust risk parameters through control theory or artificial intelligence.

MoonPay Integrates PayPal: Easy Crypto Buys Now Possible


MoonPay, a cryptocurrency payment gateway, has marked a significant milestone by announcing its integration with PayPal. 
This partnership enables US users to purchase cryptocurrencies using their PayPal accounts seamlessly. Therefore, it positions MoonPay as the first on- and off-ramp provider to offer such a service in the US.
MoonPay-Paypal Alliance
The collaboration between MoonPay and PayPal simplifies crypto purchases, especially for users already familiar with PayPal’s services. Customers can utilize their PayPal balance, direct bank withdrawals, or debit cards to fund crypto purchases directly on MoonPay’s platform. 
Ivan Soto-Wright, MoonPay’s co-founder and CEO, told BeInCrypto that the partnership reflects a significant step towards integrating traditional financial services with the field of digital currencies. It streamlines cryptocurrency trading to enhance the user experience.

“For MoonPay users transacting with PayPal, we’ve ensured the process is seamless – users can purchase with PayPal without setting up additional accounts or entering new payment information. And those with an existing PayPal account won’t need to manually input their card information when they buy crypto on MoonPay,” Soto-Wright said. 



He emphasized that this move aims to reduce the entry barriers for new users by providing a familiar transactional environment through PayPal.

“With PayPal embedded into MoonPay’s infrastructure, we can also further optimize conversion when transacting on our platform. Integrations like PayPal will have a significant impact on conversation rates. Many traditional banks do not allow users to purchase crypto on debit/credit cards, but when users pay with PayPal, using that same card, we have already seen a dramatic increase in the success rate of transactions,” Soto-Wright told BeInCrypto.

Major Development in One of the Most Popular Projects Once: Allegedly Will Distribute Airdrop - Bitcoin Sistemi


A cryptocurrency analyst known as CBB0FE on the
The analyst has reportedly discovered what appears to be version 2 of friend.tech smart contracts. However, he warned that these could be “a psychology experiment” by the friend.tech team designed to mislead or confuse observers.


The new token defined with the POINTS ticker cannot be transferred unless it is to certain whitelist addresses. Interestingly, POINTS can be traded on BunnySwap, friend.tech's native decentralized exchange (DEX).
The analyst also found a new smart contract called Clubs. This contract allows anyone to create multiple clubs and choose from a variety of options for a bonding cycle. Club keys are purchased with POINTS. The platform fee for this contract is set at 1.5%, and there is an additional 1.5% fee for the staking contract.






BunnySwap, the native DEX where POINTS can be traded, is known as a fork of Uniswap V2. It allows transactions with a 1.5% fee.
The analyst recently discovered a staking contract called BestFriend SC. A fork of MasterChef, this contract allows users to stake POINTS/ETH liquidity provider (LP) tokens to earn POINTS.


While these findings are certainly intriguing, it is important to remember that they are still speculative at this stage. The friend.tech team has not confirmed any of these details yet.

Binance Collaborates with Indian Authorities to Nab $10M Scam - DailyCoin


        
The Indian regulatory body, Binance, and two other firms recently teamed up to uncover a fraudulent scheme.



India has recently shifted its focus towards tightening regulations in the crypto industry.



Binance may have sights set on the Indian crypto market reentry.
The Indian crypto market has recently seen strengthened regulatory attention, marked by efforts to ensure compliant operations and promote investor safety. Recently, authorities cracked down on a local fraudulent scheme, E-Nugget, that lured retail investors with disguised gaming activities, ultimately defrauding them of millions of rupees.Taking enforcement a step further, the authorities have joined forces with crypto exchanges to trace and recoup the stolen funds.India Cracks Crypto Scam with BinancePer local reports on Wednesday, May 1, the Indian Enforcement Directorate has seized crypto assets worth close to ₹ 90 crore, valued at approximately $10.5 million, linked to a legal case involving the fraudulent online gaming app E-Nugget.’
The funds were reportedly uncovered in collaboration with exchanges, including Binance, ZebPay, and WazirX, following a months-long investigation into the group’s laundering technique of investing ill-gotten proceeds into digital assets.According to the Directorate, the perpetrators acquired the stolen assets by duping users before abruptly halting money withdrawals and erasing user data from their servers. They spread the assets across over 70 accounts on various exchange platforms to circumvent authorities.The report stated that authorities have arrested and are currently holding E-Nugget masterminds Aamir Khan and Romen Agarwal in judicial custody.
Binance’s reported contribution follows recent reports of its renewed focus on reentering the Indian crypto market as a complaint exchange.Binance India Comeback?On April 18, 2024, reports emerged of Binance’s possible re-entry into the Indian market, after its services were suspended in January due to a regulatory dispute with the local financial watchdog.While an official confirmation is pending, the report emphasized that the exchange faces a $2 million penalty for flouting the Indian regulatory guidelines. It is expected to adopt compliant measures upon reentry to overturn its reputation. If reinstated, Binance will comply with applicable laws within the jurisdiction, including the local Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the VDA taxation framework. Additionally, the exchange must register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Indian finance ministry.Read this article to understand India’s focus on regulations better:India’s Exchange URL Ban Meets Cool Response from Community The ongoing BTC price dip has prompted criticisms from industry nay-sayers; read more:Peter Schiff Mocks Bitcoin’s Dip Below $60K: “Party’s Over”

Asset Management Company BlackRock Announced That There Will Be Fund Flows to Bitcoin ETFs from Different Sectors! - Bitcoin Sistemi


BlackRock, the world's largest asset management company, is witnessing growing interest from a different type of investor in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
BlackRock Expects Increased Interest in Bitcoin ETFs from Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds
BlackRock head of digital assets Robert Mitchnick predicts that financial institutions such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and endowments will begin trading in spot ETFs in the coming months.



“Whether we're talking about pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, insurers, other asset managers, family offices, many of these firms that are interested are having ongoing due diligence and research discussions, and we play a role in terms of education.”

Pent-up demand for the much-anticipated ETFs has seen more than $76 billion accumulated in these products since their approval in January.
Some registered investment advisors (RIAs) already offer BlackRock's IBIT ETF. The next step is expected to be the unlimited offering of Bitcoin ETFs to clients of major wealth advisory players such as Morgan Stanley.






A significant portion of current IBIT assets come from Grayscale exchanges. Other sources could be outflows from higher-priced international products in Canada or Europe, with some coming from Bitcoin futures ETFs being converted back into spot products.

Polkadot surprises traders with latest hike - Can DOT hit $7.5 next? - AMBCrypto



Bearish sentiment around Polkadot dropped in the last few days.
Most market indicators and metrics looked bullish on DOT.

The crypto market has been tumbling in the last few days as most cryptos fell. However, Polkadot [DOT] had other plans, as its daily chart remained green. Does this mean investors should expect the token’s price to rise further in the coming days? 
Polkadot takes a different route 
The recent market drop pushed Bitcoin’s price down by 10% over the last week. Not only BTC, but Ethereum also had a similar fate, as it dropped by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours. 
However, DOT planned to move the other way around. According to CoinMarketCap, Polkadot was up by more than 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading at $6.85 with a market capitalization of over $9.8 billion, making it the 14th largest crypto. 
It was also interesting to note that while DOT’s price gained bullish momentum, the blockchain’s network activity also increased. As per AMBCrypto’s look at Artemis’ data, DOT’s daily active addresses have shot up since the 28th of April. 
Thanks to that, the blockchain’s daily transactions also increased. Things in terms of captured value also looked optimistic as both fees and revenue went up.
Source: Artemis
Will Polkadot’s bull rally last?
Since DOT had already begun a bull rally, AMBCrypto then planned to have a closer look at the token’s metrics to find out whether this trend would last longer.
 As per our analysis of Santiment’s data, DOT’s weighted sentiment improved, meaning that bearish sentiment around it decreased over the last few days. Its social volume spiked, reflecting its popularity in the crypto space. 
Source: Santiment
Apart from this, Polkadot’s derivatives metrics also looked optimistic. Its open interest increased along with its price. Whenever the metric moves up, it indicates the chances of the current price trend, which on this occasion was bullish, continuing further.
 Moreover, DOT’s funding rate was low. Generally, prices tend to move in a different direction than funding rates, hinting at a further price rise in the coming days. 
Source: Santiment
A few technical indicators also looked bullish. For example, the MACD displayed a bullish crossover. 
The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered an uptick, indicating a continued price increase. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) turned bearish as it went down slightly.

Read Polkadot’s [DOT] Price Prediction 2024-25

As per our analysis of Hyblock Capital’s data, it will be crucial for DOT to go above $6.9 in order to sustain its rally. This seemed to be the case, as liquidation would rise shapely at that level, which might result in a price correction. 
A successful breakout above that level could allow DOT to touch $7.5 in the coming weeks.

Crypto's ETF Hype Slowing Down? | Bankless


Record ETF Outflows. Amid the crypto price slump, spot BTC ETFs in America had their worst day on record, posting an all-time high $534M in outflows. Can impending institutional adoption stymie the bleeding?Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) amounted to $167M, a number that roughly aligns with declines from previous trading days. Unfortunately, that is where the similarities with historical spot BTC ETF flows stops…Not even BlackRock’s IBIT or Franklin Templeton’s EZBC – two ETFs that had yet to go negative – were spared from the drawdown, with yesterday becoming the first day on which every spot BTC ETF experienced simultaneous outflows.Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark Invest’s ARKB both experienced their largest outflow days on record and contributed a whopping $191M to the outflow total.Source: FarsideWhile depressed sentiment has been reflected in US ETF flows, action overseas is giving bulls some cause for optimism!Newly launched spot BTC and ETH ETF instruments in Hong Kong raised $292M of capital on their first day of trading, well ahead of schedule compared to Bloomberg analyst estimates for $1B of inflows within the first two years of launch.Additionally, BNP Paribas, the second-largest European bank with $570B in assets, reported ownership of $42k of BlackRock’s IBIT ETF in recently filed disclosures.Although the allocation represents only a tiny fraction of the bank's total assets, it marks the first confirmed purchase of BTC by a global systemically important bank (GSIB) and could signal that other major financial institutions are becoming comfortable with the concept of BTC adoption.
BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets Robert Mitchnick echoed similar sentiment, stating in an interview with CoinDesk that his conversations with interested firms indicate that sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and endowments may begin trading spot BTC ETF products within the coming months.Yesterday's BTC ETF outflows were certainly staggering, and while it is evident that future lulls in crypto markets will continue to trigger outflows from these products, the potential for widespread institutional adoption could propel BTC price to surpass even the most euphoric projections!Cathie Wood is targeting $3.8M BTC should institutions begin heavily investing in the coin, but nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether this anticipated demand can materialize.

Time To Buy The Bitcoin Dip? Analyst Upbeat As Federal Reserve Turns Dovish


								As Bitcoin drops, liquidating leveraged long bets along the way, one analyst, in a post on X, thinks this might be a prime opportunity to accumulate, citing historical patterns of pullbacks followed by impressive recoveries. 
Time To Load The Bitcoin Dip?
The analyst shared a chart indicating that Bitcoin is within historical retracement ranges. Whenever this happens, prices tend to bounce back sharply, tearing higher, much to the relief of holders.

Solid data back this assessment. The analyst said that since Bitcoin bottomed at $15,500 in 2022, there have been four distinct pullbacks, all within the -20% to -23% range. For the savvy, the trader continued, each of these downturns presented an opportunity to accumulate at a discount. 
Related Reading: Shiba Inu Fees On Fire: What’s Behind The 500% Surge?
Therefore, if history aligns with this preview, Bitcoin may be available at a discount at spot rates. At spot rates, the coin is down by around 23% from all-time highs of $73,800 in mid-March.
Bitcoin price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView
No one knows how prices will print out in the sessions ahead. However, looking at the candlestick arrangement, BTC has resistance at the $60,000 to $61,000 zone. A clean breakout above this zone might cement the analyst’s preview, setting in motion the start of another leg out that may take out $74,000 in the coming weeks.
Shrinking Spot ETF Inflows, United States Federal Reserve Turns Dovish
Though optimism reigns, the possibility of BTC crashing below the $52,000 and $50,000 support levels cannot be discounted. This outlook, though bearish, is also backed by data. 
For instance, on May 1, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) redeemed $563.7 million worth of BTC. In the past, when the coin was flying from February to mid-March, inflows were hundreds of billions. 
Excitement was palpable even with Grayscale liquidating GBTC, decreasing BTC. Now that there is a marked spike in outflows, it suggests that sellers are in control and spot ETF holders panicking and looking to exit. 

Despite the negative sentiment and predictions of Bitcoin melting to $52,000, another analyst remains positive. Citing the United States Federal Reserve reducing Quantitative Tightening (QT) runoff from $65 billion to $45 billion, the analyst continued that Bitcoin prices might benefit from the “dovish” environment. 
Of note is that the central bank said it is unlikely to hike interest rates. Instead, they look to slash rates when supportive data is showing that inflation is falling towards the 2% benchmark level. Currently, inflation remains high but lower than the 2021 averages.

Ripple's XRP Is Dead Money, Says Analyst Josh Olszewicz


Cryptocurrency analyst Josh Olszewicz recently expressed skepticism about Ripple’s XRP’s profitable trading asset viability. 
Highlighting the cryptocurrency’s lackluster performance, Olszewicz remarked on its stagnant price since 2018, labeling it “dead money.”
XRP’s Profit Potential Questioned
Despite a potential breakout attempt, XRP’s movement on March 11 was rejected. The digital currency tried to rally and break past the $0.66 resistance but failed to sustain higher levels due to intense selling pressure. This downturn led the price to dip below $0.42, setting the stage for a possible retest of the support level at $0.32.
According to Olszewicz, this trading environment for XRP remains fraught with challenges.

“XRP is at the same price it was since 2018… it’s dead right; it’s dead money… It just doesn’t make any sense to me why anybody would trade it unless they have a reallly good reason,” Olszewicz said. 


His analysis highlights a bearish trend on the weekly charts and inconsistency in daily movements, further complicating the trading of XRP.

If XRP’s price does manage to hold at $0.42 and subsequently breaks the Ichimoku Cloud at $0.87, it could indicate a weakening bearish grip. However, such a scenario appears less likely given the current market dynamics. 
Olszewicz’s perspective suggests that XRP’s price will likely hover within a narrow range without significant catalysts, making it a less attractive option for traders seeking substantial returns.

Tether and Chainalysis roll out USDT monitoring solution to counter illicit transactions - Crypto Briefing




Tether has announced a collaboration with blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to develop a customizable solution for monitoring secondary market activity.The monitoring solution developed by Chainalysis will enable Tether to systematically monitor transactions and gain enhanced understanding and oversight of the USDT market. It will also serve as a proactive source of on-chain intelligence for Tether compliance professionals and investigators, helping them identify wallets that may pose risks or may be associated with illicit and/or sanctioned addresses.Key components of the solution include Sanctions Monitoring, which provides a detailed list of addresses and transactions involving sanctioned entities, and Categorization, which enables a thorough breakdown of USDT holders by type, including exchanges and darknet markets.The system also offers Largest Wallet Analysis, providing an in-depth examination of significant USDT holders and their activities, and an Illicit Transfers Detector, which is integral to identifying transactions potentially associated with illicit categories like terrorist financing.“Cryptocurrency is transparent, and harnessing that transparency to partner with law enforcement and freeze criminal funds is the best way to deter its use for terrorism, scams, and other illicit activity,” shares Jonathan Levin, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Chainalysis.The move comes amid mounting pressure on stablecoins and digital assets, with global regulators eyeing these for their potential role in circumventing international sanctions and facilitating illicit finance.As the most popular stablecoin with over $110 billion in circulation, USDT has faced increasing scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Tether claims that the partnership will enable it to “enhance compliance measures.” The stablecoin, which is pegged to the US dollar and backed primarily by US Treasury bonds, is managed by Wall Street trading house Cantor Fitzgerald.“Tether remains steadfast in its dedication to upholding the highest standards of integrity, and this collaboration reinforces our proactive approach to safeguarding our ecosystem against illicit activities,” shares Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino.A recent report from Reuters suggests that Venezuela’s state-run oil company has been using USDT to bypass US sanctions, while a United Nations report from January highlighted the stablecoin’s alleged role in underground banking and money laundering in East Asia and Southeast Asia. Notably, Tether has worked with 124 law enforcement agencies across 43 global jurisdictions to address concerns on the stablecoin’s use in illicit activities.

New Development in Terra (LUNA) Lawsuit in which SEC Demands $5 Billion - Bitcoin Sistemi


In Terra (LUNA) v. SEC, attorneys representing Terraform Labs are fighting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after the agency sought billions of dollars in fines. The firm's legal team argues that the token sales occurred “almost entirely outside the United States,” according to a brief filed Wednesday.
The SEC disputed this claim, arguing that Terraform Labs “targeted US investors” and therefore should pay a hefty $5.3 billion penalty, mostly in damages. However, Terraform's lawyers disputed this, stating, “…the SEC has presented no evidence that Defendants' limited activities in the United States directly caused any losses, losses in the United States far below the billions of dollars requested by the SEC.” said.



The SEC had previously charged Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon over the algorithmic stablecoin Terra USD (UST) in February 2023. This accusation followed the dramatic collapse of the IHR a year ago. Last month, a jury found both Terraform Labs and Kwon guilty of misleading investors and held them liable for civil fraud.
Algorithmic stablecoins like UST use market incentives through algorithms to maintain a stable price. Terra was linked to Luna, a governance token used to stabilize prices. However, the IHR collapsed in May 2022, resulting in a loss of more than $50 billion. The ongoing legal battle between Terraform Labs and the SEC continues as the future of the company and its cryptocurrencies remains uncertain.

She and cosigner Representative French Hill alleged that Tether was “knowingly facilitating violations of applicable sanctions laws.”Source: TetherA report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime on organized crime in East and Southeast Asia released in January was heavily critical of the role crypto played in financing crime in the region and pointed to USDT in particular. Tether responded by saying the organization ignores the traceability of USDT.Tether has also been criticized for its lack of financial transparency.

Coinbase earnings show a bullish start to the year - Blockworks


Coinbase’s earnings seem to show that crypto is ready for a bull market, if it’s not in one currently. 
The company impressed Wall Street with its earnings on Thursday, posting beats across the board.
Coinbase also reported that Base was continuing to see adoption. 
“We are seeing early product market fit with Base, our layer-2 solution, where developer activity has surged and Base has processed over 2x more transactions than Ethereum in the last 30 days,” Coinbase said in its earnings letter. 
Stablecoin revenue also jumped 15% quarter over quarter to $197 million. 
“The primary driver was higher USDC market capitalization, which is the total amount of USDC in circulation. The USDC market capitalization growth rate was the highest among all USD stablecoins in Q1,” the company added. 
Read more about the company’s earnings results in the article below:

Analysts were expecting the crypto exchange to come in on top, but the stock slipped in after-hours trading after notching gains throughout the day Thursday.
The stock hit a low of roughly $200 earlier this week, nearly $30 off of its current price. Bitcoin also notched a weekly low on Wednesday — falling to $56,000 before rebounding to $59,000. It’s down 8.5% in the past seven days.

While it’s important not to downplay Coinbase’s quarter, it is a snippet of time in the past. The weakness seen in the crypto market just this week won’t be reflected in the company’s earnings until next quarter. 
Over the past month, COIN is in the red — down roughly 8% — though it’s still posted impressive gains over the last year, up over 360%. 
Coinbase isn’t the only company showing off its strength as we enter the next phase of the crypto cycle. 
Earlier this week, Tether released its attestation. The stablecoin issuer announced that it smashed previous records, tallying a net profit of $4.5 billion in the first quarter. It previously notched an all-time high of $.28 billion in net profit.

Training AI on Your NFTs | Bankless


Last August, I introduced Metaversal readers to TITLES, an NFT remixing platform with an in-built attribution and payment splits system. After its initial app + protocol combo release, the TITLES team stepped back and realized that the issues of attribution and creative ownership were particularly significant in the emerging AI arts scene. Recognizing this, they’ve since adapted their existing tools to better support AI creatives. Their first major step forward here is a functionality they unveiled today, the ability for artists to train their own custom AI models on NFTs they’ve made before.The idea? Become a leading creator suite and minting hub for artist-trained AI models. I was fortunate enough to be treated to a preview of this new resource as TITLES founder Sören John was familiar with my collection of AI sketches, Stable Peasters, and invited me to test creating a custom model so anyone could make and mint their own Stable Ps. So I did! And I have to say, the process was buttery smooth and took only ~20 minutes. Here’s how the flow works in case you're interesting in trying it out for yourself: 2. In the “New Model” tab, select which of your NFT collections you want to train on—e.g. here I selected Stable Peasters3. Select 5 to 20 NFTs to train your model on and finalize your model’s basic info—the more visually harmonious your selected inputs are, the smoother your model’s outputs will be, so curate thoughtfully4. It will take up to 20 minutes for your model to finish training; you can track its progress in the “Your Models” tab5. When your model is ready, press the “Imagine” button to be taken to the prompting page, where you or anyone else can now create and mint new AI-powered remixes of your underlying collection—then share your model’s link to let others try it out!If you don’t have any NFT collections you’ve created of your own yet, but still want to play around with making AI remixes, try firing off some test prompts with my SPRY01 model, a.k.a. Stable Peasters Readily Yours V1, as seen above.You can input as many prompts as you want without minting anything, but if you do come across an output you love, feel free to save the image or use the TITLES interface to mint the piece as an NFT on Base—just fill out the description and mint details as you please and press “Publish” to finish. What’s cool is that every time outputs are minted like this on TITLES, the original model creator (e.g. me, in the case of SPRY01) earns a small cut of ETH from the mint. This approach allows AI creatives to earn and directly benefit from attribution while still openly sharing their work with everyone else.Looking ahead, keep an eye on TITLES as they enhance and expand upon this custom AI tool in new directions, e.g. allowing more than 20 NFT inputs and so forth. In the coming months, the team also notably plans to release a new AI-powered NFT publishing protocol that will offer artists innovative ways to engage with and profit from their models’ outputs. More on that later!In the meantime, follow TITLES on Twitter or Warpcast to stay current with the project, and if you do make your own AI model or publish any of your own Stable Ps, don’t hesitate to hit me up—I’d love to see what you come up with and would love to mint one of your editions as a keepsake!

Binance Nigeria Case Delayed Again as Procedural Errors Pile Up - DailyCoin


        
A Nigerian court has adjourned the money laundering case against Binance.



The latest delay in the case comes amid continued procedural errors from authorities.



The adjourned date now bears significance for many aspects of the Binance Nigeria debacle.
Delays continue to hound Nigeria’s legal effort against Binance and two of its executives.The trial of Binance and its executives Tigran Gambaryan, the firm’s head of Financial Crime Compliance, and Nadeem Anjarwalla, the firm’s regional manager for Africa, of U.S. and British-Kenyan descent, respectively, on a $35.4 million money laundering charge was supposed to kick off in Nigeria’s Federal High Court Abuja on Thursday, May 2. However, as in many instances in the case so far, procedural errors have caused delays.Binance Money Laundering Case AdjournedOn Thursday, Federal High Court Judge Justice Emeka Nwite adjourned the trial of Binance and its executives on money laundering charges brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nigeria’s anti-graft agency, to May 17.
Per a local news report, the adjournment came as Binance lawyer Tonye Krukrubo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), told the court that contrary to the EFCC’s claims, he had not been served with the necessary documents to prepare for the case.Krukrubo was subsequently served with the reportedly 300 pages-long document in court after a bailiff explained that efforts to serve Binance through Tigran Gambaryan, who is being held in Nigeria’s infamous Kuje prison, had failed as he was inexplicably refused from seeing him.On April 4, Justice Nwite was forced to delay the arraignment of Gambaryan on these same money laundering charges and tax evasion charges from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Nigeria’s tax authority, for similar reasons. Expressing dissatisfaction with the continued lapses from the prosecution in the case, Justice Nwite cautioned against further delays on Thursday.
"It behooves on you, as prosecution, to do all within your power in the trial because I am not going to entertain any delay in this trial again," the Federal High Court judge warned.Meanwhile, following the judge’s recent decision, May 17 has become the date to watch for several aspects of the Binance Nigeria debacle.A Crucial DateBesides now serving as the date for the money laundering trial to kick off in earnest, May 17 is also the rescheduled date for the court to revisit the tax evasion charges brought by the FIRS and rule on Gambaryan’s bail application.The Binance executive was detained in Nigeria with Nadeem Anjarwalla in February 2024 after arriving at the invitation of authorities to negotiate the resolution of complaints bordering on the manipulation of the naira through the firm’s p2p platform. Despite being mid-level executives at Binance, they have been named in the money laundering and tax evasion charges against the firm.While Anjarwalla fled detention in March 2024, Gambaryan has now remained in Nigerian custody for over 60 days, nearly half of which has now been spent in a prison that also houses Islamic State terrorists.On the Flipside
On April 30, U.S. Representative Rich McCormick raised Gambaryan’s detention with the House Foreign Affairs Committee, disclosing that he is working to secure the release of the Binance executive who had also served a decade-long stint as a special agent in the Internal Revenue Service, contributing to several high profile crypto cases including the takedown of Silk Road.



Nigeria is working with Interpol to secure the extradition of Anjarwalla, who has been traced to Kenya.
Why This MattersThe frequent delays in the Binance case raise questions about Nigeria’s handling of the already controversial legal effort.Read this for more on the Binance Nigeria Debacle:Binance Exec Who Fled Nigeria Will Be “Smoked Out”: Interpol VPLearn about Ethereum’s recent record network growth:Ethereum Adds Over 260K Wallets in 2 Days: Will ETH Rally?

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) to Surge Over 7,000% in 48 Hours, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Will Bitcoin fall another 40%? 'Nothing but air,' analyst claims - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s recent price drop has led to significant market liquidations.
Poor performance of the Hong Kong and U.S. spot ETFs underline market struggles.

As Bitcoin [BTC] continued to struggle under significant market pressure, dipping below the $58,000 mark, analysts are now projecting a substantial price correction of 30-40% in the current market cycle. 
This potential drop could see the leading cryptocurrency adjust to values not seen since earlier bullish runs, sparking concerns and anticipatory strategies among investors.
Bitcoin dangles close to $55K
Bitcoin’s recent market behavior has been less than favorable, with a 10% decline over the past week, bringing its trading price precariously close to $55,000. 
According to analyst Scott Melker, Bitcoin has breached critical support levels that are now acting as resistance, potentially leading to further declines. He cautioned,
“Nothing but air until around $52,000 on the chart.” 
This suggested that Bitcoin could face a free-fall if it fails to maintain current support levels.
The technical perspective offers a bleak outlook as well. 
Melker pointed out that the Relative Strength Index (RSI), typically a reliable indicator of when an asset is oversold and likely to rebound, has not reached oversold territory. 
This deviation suggests a lack of strong buying interest and supports the thesis of further price drops. 
This condition is mirrored in the broader price trends observed on the charts, where Bitcoin exhibits a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, signaling sustained bearish momentum. 
According to Melker, the ongoing plunge is only a fraction of what is to come, noting,
“This is still ONLY A 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pull back during this bull market, like those of the past.”
Broader market implications
Beyond the immediate price action, broader market indicators reveal underlying challenges. 
Data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment showed a significant drop in Bitcoin’s daily active addresses. 
It plummeted from over 17 million in March to around 14.7 million as of the 1st of May, indicating waning user activity and interest. 
Source: Santiment
The Social Dominance echoed this sentiment, showing a 20% fall.
Source: Santiment
The downturn in Bitcoin’s value has not only dampened the aforementioned market metrics but has also triggered widespread liquidations, impacting numerous traders. 
According to Coinglass, in the last 24 hours alone, approximately 60,795 traders have been liquidated, with total liquidations amounting to $205.12 million. 
Source: Coinglass
Concurrently, as reported by AMBCrypto, the underwhelming debut of the newly listed spot ETFs in Hong Kong only exacerbated the situation. 
These ETFs managed a mere $11 million in trading volume on their first day, starkly contrasting with the much higher figures achieved by U.S.-based spot ETFs at their launch in January.
Furthermore, U.S. spot ETFs have been experiencing a significant outflow, with $161 million withdrawn on Tuesday alone, marking the fifth consecutive day of outflows, as analyzed by AMBCrypto using SoSo Value data. 

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

Additionally, the anticipation of the U.S. Federal Reserve maintaining steady interest rates in the upcoming FOMC meeting—due to higher-than-expected inflation—has led traders to withdraw from riskier investments. 
This added further pressure to an already strained market.

Is It a Good Time to Buy Ethereum (ETH)? On-Chain Data Says So


Ethereum (ETH) price witnessed a fate similar to the rest of the crypto market when the altcoin slipped below $3,000. This, however, has only further validated the bullish pattern ETH has been stuck in.
Closing in on a potential breakout in the next few trading sessions, the altcoin is exhibiting the ideal conditions for accumulation.
Ethereum Selling Slows Down
Investors need to exhibit optimism for a substantial bounce back in Ethereum’s price, as seen in parts of the recent shift in behavior.
The exchange net position change shows that ETH outflows have halted in the last 24 hours as investors refrain from profit-taking. Historically, such slowdowns succeed in a surge in price, after which selling continues.

Given the selling has taken a back seat for now, Ethereum has a shot at bouncing back to reclaim $3,000 as support.

Derived from the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which assesses investor profit or loss, Ethereum’s price could see an uptick.
Ethereum’s 30-day MVRV is sitting at -8%, which signals losses and potentially prompts accumulation. Historically, ETH recovery has occurred within the -4% to -10% MVRV range, labeled as an opportunity zone. 
If investors choose to make the most of it and stock up on ETH, the altcoin could note a stronger recovery.

ETH Price Prediction: 27% Rally
Ethereum’s price trading at $2,945 is bouncing back from the lower trend line of a descending wedge. ETH has been stuck in this pattern for the last two months. The decline below $3,000 only validated the bullish reversal pattern further. 
The likely move from here is an uptick to break through the upper trend line. This would enable ETH to note a potential 27% rally, placing the target price of Ethereum at $4,000.

On the other hand, the volatility of the investors’ optimism could threaten the potential of a rally if the broader market cues turn bearish. Failure to reclaim $3,000 could push ETH below $2,800, invalidating the bullish thesis and sending the altcoin to $2,740.

Popular Dogecoin (DOGE) Layer-2 Solution Dogechain To Shut Down Wallet Services Next Month - The Daily Hodl


								A prominent layer-2 scaling solution for the meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) is announcing that it is going to be shutting down its wallet services next month.
In a new thread on the social media platform X, Mishaboar, one of Dogecoin’s developers, tells investors to make sure they move their DOGE out of the Dogechain wallet before it shuts down on June 1st as well as keep a copy of their wallet’s private keys.










“Make sure to move your DOGE out of http://dogechain.info (only use the .info domain!) before June 1st. Keeping a copy of Dogechain’s wallets’ private keys is also important – in case you still have the addresses in use somewhere, this will allow you to recover funds you might inadvertently send or receive there in the future.”
Dogechain, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain powered by the technology of Polygon (MATIC), was created as a way to connect the Dogecoin ecosystem to the world of Web3.
Using a proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism, Dogechain allows for faster and cheaper transactions, making non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain-based video games, and decentralized finance (DeFi) services more accessible to holders of the meme coin.
Dogecoin is trading for $0.132 at time of writing, a 10.86% increase during the last 24 hours. On March 28th, DOGE was valued at $0.219.

Analyst Identifies Crucial Dogecoin Support At $0.112-$0.123, Will Price Crash Further? | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin suffered a significant crash in the bloodbath that rocked the crypto market earlier this week, notching double-digit losses in the process. This has sent its support lower, and $0.112-$0.123 is now the level to hold for the meme coin. But what if it falls below this support?
Dogecoin Must Hold Support At $0.112-$0.123
Crypto analyst YG Crypto, in an analysis, identified $0.112-$0.123 as the major support levels for Dogecoin after the price crash. In the post that was made on X (formerly Twitter), the crypto analyst explained that these levels are important due to the fact that they have prevent massive price crashes for Dogecoin in the past.

As such, the meme coin needs to maintain above this level to continue its bullish trend. As of the early hours of Thursday, the DOGE price continues to trade above the higher band of this level, suggesting that the support at $0.123 is significant.
However, YG Crypto warned that if it ends up unable to hold, it could be disastrous for the price. “If the price breaks below this support, it could signal further downward pressure,” the crypto analyst warned. Further, a breakdown below the lower band of this support would constitute another 15% crash, leading to a cumulative 50% decline in the DOGE price from its 2024 peak.


If Dogecoin is able to maintain this support, then buying here could be a unique opportunity. However, the analyst also expressed that technical indicators are not the only useful tools, as market sentiment can also play a big role in where the price could be headed next.
DOGE Price Could Break Out Higher
While the fundamentals seem to be turning bearish for Dogecoin right now, not all analysts are expecting a price decline. One of these bullish crypto analysts is Ali Martinez, who has identified a formation in the DOGE price chart that hasn’t been seem nice 2021.
Martinez explained in his analysis that the Dogecoin price had finally broken out of a descending triangle, something that has been historically bullish for the price. At the same time, the crypto analyst calmed investors’ fears, saying that the current 40% drawdown in the meme coin’s price is par for the course going by historical performance.

According to the analyst, the DOGE price had seen a similar 40% decline in 2017 before breaking out of a descending triangle. The result of this breakout was a 982% bull run that sent the price to new all-time highs. A similar trend was registered in 2021 as well, when the DOGE price fell 56% before breaking out of a descending triangle. This time around, Dogecoin went on its legendary 12,197% rally to reach a new all-time high as well.
Since the meme coin seems to be closely following this trend, the belief that it will do the same thing has become stronger. In the case of 2024, the price has seen a 40% drawdown and has now broken out of a descending triangle. If history rhymes once more, the analyst believes that DOGE can rally 4,600% to $6.


“Over the years, #Dogecoin appears to mirror its previous bull cycles! All you need is a little bit of patience,” Ali Martinez concluded.

Crypto leaders should stop flirting with CBDCs

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) offer governments the ability to exert absolute control over currency. They should be rejected by all fair-minded blockchain leaders, but that unfortunately is not the case.In June 2023, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted that most cryptocurrency innovations have come from the private sector. But it praised central banks for “catching up” through the experimentation of CBDCs and creating state-controlled instant payment systems — like Brazil’s Pix.CBDCs are an experimental form of digital money created by a country's central bank. They are generally controlled through a private network and are both centralized and programmable. This means that central banks can track, monitor and edit transactions. Such capabilities grant authorities extensive control over money flows — including the power to impose spending restrictions, set “expiration” dates on consumers’ savings, and even remotely freeze or seize money. And by 2030, CitiGroup predicts there will be $5 trillion in CBDCs circulating in the global economy.Related: Jerome Powell’s pivot heralds a boring summer for BitcoinWhile some crypto leaders have been quietly concerned about the rise of CBDCs and what they could mean for privacy, democracy and rising authoritarianism, others have openly supported them — even as they paradoxically promote the advantages of decentralized technologies. CitiGroup projections for the level of CBDC usage in 2030. Source: CitiGroupConsensys, the owner of MetaMask and Infura, is one example. It is widely recognized as a foundational force in blockchain technology. It also has an incredibly flirtatious relationship with CBDCS. In partnership with Visa, Consensys is crafting new infrastructure designed to bridge central banks with traditional financial institutions. Other cryptocurrency projects — including Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) — have likewise been active in allowing their blockchains to be used in the development of CBDCs.Ripple's native cryptocurrency, XRP, operates on a decentralized public ledger akin to Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). Yet, in 2021, Ripple introduced a CBDC platform on a separate, private ledger designed specifically for governments, central banks, and financial institutions. This setup allows these entities to exercise complete control over their newfound digital currencies.Conversely, Stellar advocates for creating CBDCs on its public blockchain, albeit with custom adjustments that allow centralized entities to enhance governance. Within its CBDC Guidebook, Stellar suggests managing monetary policy and programmability centrally but maintaining a decentralized approach to the technological infrastructure and service delivery.In a perfect world, you'd hope major blockchain players like Ripple and Stellar — with their significant banking connections — could use their influence to resist CBDCs on morality grounds, despite the tempting business prospects they present. Yet, even in an imperfect world, it would be impactful for them to openly discuss the real long-term threats of CBDCs — particularly the risks of giving governments overwhelming financial omnipotence. Of course, blockchain pioneers might be happy to see their formerly marginalized technology now discussed in high-level forums such as the IMF and Davos. Yet, while this recognition may be gratifying, it doesn’t translate into a victory for the ideals of blockchain technology. It’s quite the opposite: CBDCs compromise the core principles and benefits of blockchain — such as immutability and decentralization. Can governments be trusted with such power? Historically, the answer is “No,” even in the West. Canada served as one example in 2022 when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau activated the Emergencies Act to unconstitutionally freeze bank accounts linked to anti-lockdown protesters. United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt provided another example when, in 1933, he signed an executive order mandating that citizens hand their gold over to the federal government — or face up to $10,000 in fines and 10 years in prison.Regardless of the consumer safeguards that may be implemented within various future CBDCs, governments will certainly retain extensive control to modify, adjust, and redefine the rules governing this future form of money over time. Related: Solana illustrates the dark side of monolithic blockchainsWhen it suits them, western governments will impose financial sanctions against their own citizens for political means. It's not rocket science to understand embracing CBDCs risks emboldening and normalizing the use of these measures.Cryptocurrencies have been mocked, ridiculed and admittedly have a PR problem following the collapse of FTX and other scammers in the industry. But despite all of cryptos' challenges, its technology, applications and ethos makes the need for CBDCs redundant. We don't need CBDCs for fast, low-fee, accessible transactions for all. Crypto can already do it. With KYC (know your customer) measures, governments can already monitor, tax income and crack down on money laundering in crypto where it arises, without the need for excessive centralized control. CBDCs could be the start of a very slippery slope towards an authoritarian new norm. It's up to our greatest minds and leaders in both blockchain and beyond to wake up and stop flirting with CBDCs. Thought leaders can actively fight back by supporting decentralized alternatives. However, being more vocal in both opposing and challenging CBDCs will empower others to do the same. The current bull run will draw in millions of new investors and enthusiasts — maybe up to 1 billion by the end of 2025. Let's leverage this publicity to spread the word that CBDCs are not the only way forward.Callum Kennard is the founder of Guava Studio, an e-commerce and Web3 marketing agency based in the United Kingdom.

Terraform claims SEC offered ‘no evidence’ for $4.7B in disgorgement

With a hearing scheduled for May 22 to listen to proposed remedies in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) case against Terraform Labs (TFL) and co-founder Do Kwon, the crypto firm has argued for a substantially different judgment than that proposed by the regulator.In a supplement to Terraform’s opposition to the SEC’s motion for final judgment filed on May 1, lawyers representing the crypto firm argued the financial regulator was not entitled to $5.3 billion in disgorgement, interest and civil penalties following a jury finding TFL and Kwon liable for fraud. Terraform built on its previously asserted claims that any disgorgement would effectively have to be obtained from the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a “non-party” in the civil case.According to lawyers for Terraform, the SEC had “no evidence” that the platform’s or Kwon’s activities in the U.S. caused the losses at the center of the civil case. If the commission were to claim disgorgement and civil penalties, according to Terraform, it would give the regulatory a “territorially unlimited injunction.”Source: PACER“TFL’s offers and sales of tokens occurred almost entirely outside the U.S. [...] and the SEC has submitted no evidence that Defendants’ limited activities in the U.S. directly caused any losses, much less the billions the SEC seeks in disgorgement,” said the May 1 filing.Related: Do Kwon’s Terraform Labs files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protectionIn an April 26 filing, Terraform claimed that $1 million in civil penalties would be “far more appropriate” than the SEC’s multibillion-dollar proposal. Kwon, who is currently in Montenegro awaiting extradition to either the U.S. or South Korea, opposed the SEC’s proposed remedies to the civil case on similar grounds to Terraform:“[T]he SEC must still establish that Mr. Kwon engaged in conduct within the United States or conduct without the United States that had a ‘foreseeable substantial effect’ in the United States,” said lawyers for the Terraform co-founder. “Mr. Kwon’s role in the conduct that forms the basis of the SEC’s requested judgment was performed entirely abroad, in Korea and Singapore.”A jury found Terraform and Kwon liable for defrauding investors after a two-week trial with the SEC. All parties are scheduled to present arguments for proposed remedies before Judge Jed Rakoff on May 22. However, it was unclear at the time of publication whether Kwon would be available due to his legal situation in Montenegro.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Coinbase posts $1.2B net income in Q1, surpasses entire 2023 earnings

Crypto exchange Coinbase has reported a strong rebound in the first quarter of 2024, supported by an uptick in market performance and the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The exchange posted $1.6 billion in total revenue and $1.2 billion in net income for the first quarter, achieving $1 billion in Adjusted EBITDA — which measures a company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Veteran Analyst Speaks Out on Cardano (ADA) - Can ADA Price Bounce Back? - "Trend Reversal Seen" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ali Martinez, one of the well-known analysts in the cryptocurrency world, evaluated the popular altcoin Cardano (ADA) in his latest post.
According to the analyst, the TD Sequential indicator, which correctly predicted the top in Cardano, is currently giving a bullish sign on ADA's daily chart. Martinez said the indicator is forecasting a one- to four-day daily candle rebound that could represent the end of ADA's correction phase.


ADA price is trading at $0.45 at the time of writing this article and has increased by 2.74% in the last 24 hours. However, the price of ADA, which is the 9th largest altcoin in the world, has decreased by 22.5% in the last month. ADA's market capitalization currently stands at $16.2 billion.

In addition, touching on the Bitcoin price, the analyst claimed that the TD Sequential indicator also gave a bull sign on Bitcoin's daily chart. According to the analyst, this indicator for BTC again signaled a rebound on the one to four-day candle.





The TD Sequential indicator is known as a technical analysis tool developed by Tom DeMark. Designed to identify trend extinctions and potential price reversals in financial markets. This indicator works on the principle that prices tend to move in certain patterns before reversing or continuing in the same direction.

Coinbase reports $1.64 billion in revenue on Q1 - Crypto Briefing




Crypto exchange Coinbase reported $1.64 billion in revenue for the first quarter, surpassing the initial expectations of $1.32 billion, as reported by CNBC.The earnings per share stood at $4.40, which may not align directly with the average analyst estimate of $1.09 due to different accounting standards. Coinbase’s net income reached $1.18 billion, or $4.40 per share, marking a stark contrast to the previous year’s loss of $78.9 million, or a loss of 34 cents per share. This profit includes a $650 million mark-to-market gain on crypto assets, reflecting the company’s adoption of updated accounting standards.Consumer transaction revenue hit $935 million, more than doubling from the previous year, while total transaction revenue nearly tripled to $1.07 billion. Subscription and services revenue also contributed with $511 million for the quarter. Despite trading 4% lower in extended trading, Coinbase shares have seen a 30% increase this year, following an almost fivefold surge in 2023.The first quarter also witnessed Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of over $73,000 in March, and Ethereum undergoing a significant upgrade. The influx of institutional investors, particularly with the SEC’s approval of US spot bitcoin ETFs, has also played a role in Coinbase’s performance.By the end of the quarter, these funds had attracted over $50 billion, with many partnering with Coinbase for custody services. However, the company faces challenges, including a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and increased competition from Crypto.com.Additionally, analysts from Raymond James pointed out that four C-suite members of Coinbase sold over $383 million in shares, the most since the company’s Nasdaq listing in 2021.

5 Reasons to Stay Bullish on Crypto | Bankless


If you haven’t noticed, market sentiment has been... pretty bad lately.Bitcoin is down significantly over the past month, a number of altcoins are down much worse, leaving many across Crypto Twitter to share messages of doom and gloom. Yet, despite the current downturn, historical trends and underlying movements suggest we are far from the end of this cycle. Today, we're digging into hope. Here are five reasons not to lose faith in this cycle and look beyond the market's current turmoil.1️⃣ Drawdowns = NormalFor veterans of the cryptocurrency markets, volatility is par for the course.As Bitcoin's fourth 20% correction within the last 12 months, the current pullback proves nothing unusual historically. Surviving multiple drawdowns — ranging from mild 5-10% dips to severe 40-70% plunges — and not getting shaken out is a typical experience during a bull market. Corrections are not just common; they're expected.
2️⃣ Historic Timing At this point, the Bitcoin halving's importance is not so much in its impact on supply as what it implies for the next 12-18 months.Analysis reveals that market bottoms typically occur about 1.3 years before a halving, with peaks following roughly 1.3 years after, around 480 days.These drops can be viewed as a regular pitstop on the road to new all-time highs, aligned with the broader cyclical rhythm of Bitcoin's continued ascent.3️⃣ Institution Long-Term PlaysNow, consider the conviction investors require to lock significant capital into tokens with a multi-year horizon. Recently, a16z acquired about $90M of Optimism's OP token with a two-year vesting period, showing a strong conviction in the Superchain’s potential. Similarly, institutional funds bought $100M of locked SOL during the FTX estate's sale, with terms locking these tokens for a four-year vesting period. This second round of sales, the first seeing $1.7B worth of SOL sold earlier in March, comes at a measly 15% discount ($95-110) to current market prices (~$130) — adding to the significance of the four-year vesting period. These long-term purchases speak to a deep-set conviction of where the market will continue to trend over the coming years.
4️⃣ Fear & Greed SignalsAs a young market that turns on narratives first and foremost, emotion plays a pivotal role in crypto.By examining the Fear & Greed Index, much can be discerned about where the market is headed. On the index, 0 equals max fear, while 100 equals max greed. When the index hit 90 last month, the decline we are experiencing today started. It now sits at ~50, neutral territory that historically signals a bottom is near. On January 24, the index read 48. The following month and a half saw Bitcoin rally from $39K to $73K. A similar pattern occurred last October. The index hit 44, and BTC climbed from ~$26K to $40K by the first week of December.What did Warren Buffett say? Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful?5️⃣ Government HostilityUltimately, the war the U.S. government wages against crypto signals one thing — crypto remains a tool for securing digital rights and freedoms. At its core, Bitcoin and crypto were created to develop a system for true financial independence. With ~25% of the world unbanked and the rest operating on antiquated rails, blockchains offer a solution not only to expedite and connect the whole world’s financial systems, but also to truly own their wealth and access it from anywhere in the world. The recent crackdowns highlight this power, the old world grappling with it, and demonstrate crypto’s ability to preserve financial independence, property ownership, and other fundamental rights. As we move deeper into a fully digital age, the case for crypto enabling digital autonomy only grows more potent, extending beyond finance to also include self-custody of your data and online identity.
🙏Hope AheadDespite the current market sentiment, there remains a compelling case for optimism about the market. The resilience of Bitcoin through its continuous drawdowns, the historical rhythms around halvings, institutions going long, market sentiment indications, and the role crypto plays in preserving digital rights clearly demonstrate reasons to remain bullish. As these cycles play out, it may be wise to expect more corrections going forward but to view them as opportunities, not drawbacks.

Coinbase $1.6 Billion Quarterly Profits Boosted By Stablecoins, Rising Crypto Prices - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsAmerica’s leading crypto exchange said Thursday that sales jumped to $1.6 billion in the first quarter of this year as transaction revenue doubled over the prior three months.Coinbase’s first-quarter revenue is up big compared to $772 million over the same period year ago, the $1.6 billion bottom line exceeding analyst expectations of $1.3 billion. The San Francisco-based company also reported earnings of $4.40 per share, coming in well above Wall Street expectations of $0.90. Coinbase’s transaction revenue jumped to $1.1 billion in the first quarter from $374 million a year ago—doubling transaction revenue of $523 million in the fourth quarter of last year.Coinbase said in a letter to shareholders that its platform saw “revitalized trading activity among customers acquired prior to 2023” alongside growth in new users—including institutional traders. Coinbase turned green last year in the final quarter when it reported a profit of $273.4 million, compared with a loss of $557 million in the same quarter in 2022. A year ago, the company posted a quarterly loss of $79 million as crypto markets languished in the aftermath of FTX.The exchange said in February that it strengthened its balance sheet by reducing debt by $413 million, and its business of allowing customers to earn interest on its USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin helped the company net bigger gains. Interest in the exchange’s stablecoin services increased this year, too: Coinbase said that revenue from the crypto product increased 15% this quarter from the last to $197 million. It added in its shareholder letter that USDC has been the fastest-growing stablecoin in 2024. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a stable asset—usually dollars. Coinbase allows its customers to earn interest on such cryptocurrencies. The company refers to these as blockchain rewards. Revenue from Coinbase users staking crypto came in at $151 million, more than double compared to a year ago.The rise in the price of cryptocurrencies following the January approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also helped Coinbase make money. The price of Bitcoin has rallied this year and touched a new all-time high of $73,747 in March. It was trading for a little over $44,000 at the beginning of the year. Coinbase has partnered with most major asset managers that dropped a Bitcoin ETF, providing custody services. In effect, Coinbase said the ETFs’ approvals “unlocked a flywheel of customer engagement across [a] more robust product suite.”Coinbase’s shares rallied 8% Thursday to $230 per share, Nasdaq data shows. But the company’s stock price fell in after-hours trading to around $224 per share following the company’s earnings release.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

As MakerDAO grows, will MKR’s price finally cross $3K? - AMBCrypto



MakerDAO’s market cap and revenue grew significantly over the past year.
Price of MKR surged, despite declining network growth.

Despite the uncertainty the crypto markets have faced over the last few months, MakerDAO [MKR] has been consistently performing well.
MakerDAO expands
According to recent data, MKR’s market cap is up five times in terms of year-on-year growth, while monthly revenues are up 10 times in terms of year-on-year growth.
Source: token terminal
MakerDAO’s dominance in the DeFi sector is a significant factor contributing to this trend. Maker, currently, accounts for nearly 40% of all DeFi profits on Ethereum [ETH].
Its strength lies in its stablecoin DAI, which boasts widespread adoption, deep liquidity, extensive integrations, and a proven track record.
In fact, Maker’s financial prowess is so substantial that it generates more fees than many Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions.
Source: X
Staking season
Historically, Maker has been criticized for its conservative approach. However, its ongoing Endgame rollout aims to change this perception by transforming Maker into a more scalable ecosystem of modular protocols.
In this cycle, Maker is poised to play a crucial role in the staking, restaking, and tokenized basis trading economies by offering on-chain financing options for users.
This presents a multi-billion dollar fee opportunity, positioning Maker to capture a significant portion of DeFi profits.
Already, Maker generates substantial revenue from lending against a fraction of the stETH supply, rivaling the income generated by Lido across the entire stETH supply.
Source: Syncracy
The anticipated use cases for liquid restaking tokens and tokenized basis trading positions are expected to yield similar outcomes, further bolstering Maker’s financial position.

Realistic or not, here’s MKR’s market cap in BTC’s terms

At press time, MKR was trading at $2,706.20 and its price had grown by 4.28% in the last 24 hours. The volume at which it was trading at had surged by 20.16%.
In terms of network growth, there was a decline seen on the broader chart, indicating waning interest from new addresses.

Jack Dorseyâs Block doubles down on Bitcoin, commits 10% of product profit to monthly BTC purchases - Crypto Briefing




Block, the financial services and digital payments company co-founded by Jack Dorsey, has announced plans to purchase Bitcoin every month using 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin products. The new investment strategy shows the company’s long-term commitment to the flagship crypto, which Dorsey has frequently endorsed as a significant innovation in finance.“We believe the world needs an open protocol for money, one that’s not owned or controlled by any single entity,” Jack Dorsey said in a letter to shareholders on Thursday. “We believe Bitcoin is the best and only candidate to be that protocol, and to ultimately become the native currency of the internet.”As reported, Block’s substantial $220 million investment in Bitcoin has already appreciated by approximately 160%, amounting to $573 million at the end of Q1/2024. This growth comes amid a surge in Bitcoin prices, driven by factors such as US regulatory approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.However, the volatility of the crypto market remains a concern. Despite the risks, Block shows a willingness to adapt as necessary.“We would check back in on this approach and assess Bitcoin as a percentage of our overall liquidity, and would continue to remain nimble in how we move forward here,” Amrita Ahuja, Block’s Chief Financial Officer told Bloomberg.In the first quarter, Block’s Cash App reported a profit of $80 million from Bitcoin transactions, contributing to the company’s current holdings of 8038 BTC.The company’s financial performance has been strong, with first-quarter gross profit reaching $2.09 billion, largely fueled by the $1.26 billion generated by Cash App. Following the announcement, Block’s shares saw a 7.4% increase in late New York trading.Block operates in various sectors including financial services, digital payments, and blockchain technology. The company, formerly known as Square, offers a range of services aimed at small and medium businesses. Currently, less than 3% of Block’s resources are dedicated to Bitcoin projects.Apart from Cash App, the company is also involved in the Bitcoin mining business and self-custody wallet service. In late April, Block officially completed the development of its advanced three-nanometer Bitcoin mining chip and now focuses on building a full Bitcoin mining system.

Bitcoin Price Tumbles After Halving, Defying Expectations of a Rally



                    

The Bitcoin market has experienced a significant downturn following its fourth halving, confounding expectations of a surge similar to previous cycles. 



Since the halving event on April 20, Bitcoin’s value has plummeted by 11%. 




It was trading around $64,000 at the time of the halving, briefly climbed above $67,000 two days later, but then dropped to below $57,000 by May 1, as per CoinGecko.



Currently, the price stands at $57,362, marking a 7% decrease over the last 24 hours and a 17% decline over the month. 



This downturn has surprised market observers who anticipated a rise post-halving, in line with historical trends where significant rallies often followed such events. 




For instance, after the 2016 halving, Bitcoin surged approximately 3,000% within 17 months, achieving a then-record high of $20,000 in December 2017.



This year’s halving diverges from previous patterns due primarily to an unprecedented bull run leading up to the event, which saw Bitcoin reach new highs.



READ MORE: Yuga Labs CEO Initiates Overhaul Amid Layoffs and Restructuring



“What’s unique about this latest Bitcoin halving is the incredible bull run and price action leading up to it. 




“Even considering this recent pullback, Bitcoin has still been up 35% since the start of the year,” Mati Greenspan of Quantum Economics explained to Cointelegraph.



Greenspan also reasoned that the recent drop was predictable, given broader economic pressures and market trends, remarking, “Considering the expectation of yet another Fed pivot and what’s happening in the stock market, Bitcoin’s current price action is hardly a surprise. 



“We’ll be a lot smarter about that later today, though.” 



Predictions had been made as early as March 2024 by analysts at JPMorgan, suggesting a potential decline in Bitcoin’s price to around $42,000 post-halving.



Markus Thielen, CEO and head analyst at 10x Research, forecasts a further dip to $52,000. Thielen attributes the previous rally mainly to substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which have significantly reduced recently.



Despite the current decline, some experts, including investment researcher Lyn Alden, believe there are compelling reasons, beyond just the halving and U.S. ETFs, for Bitcoin to achieve new heights in 2024.

Solana ($SOL) ‘Sniper’ Snags $780,000 in 15 Minutes from Newly Launched Token | Cryptoglobe


                                
A cryptocurrency trader has managed to turn 500 Solana ($SOL) tokens worth around $67.000 into 5,789 SOL worth over $780,000 in just 15 minutes after managing to “snpe” a large portion of a newly launched cryptocurrency’s supply.



According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the cryptocurrency ‘sniper’ managed to acquire 665 million $QUACK tokens as they first started trading, and later sold the tokens for a significant profit of over $700,000 as its price surged, before the dump led to a downturn.







The cryptocurrency ‘sniper, as Lookonchain referred to them, is likely to be an insider in the project, as insiders have over the current cycle been taking advantage of memecoin token launches to first pump up their prices, and score massive wins in the process.



As CryptoGlobe reported, the team behind a project recently managed to turn just over $6,400 worth of cryptocurrency into over $8.28 million in a single day through the launch of such a meme-inspired cryptocurrency.



In another case, a trader  turned an initial investment of $49,000 into nearly $2 million within just five hours with a newly launched memecoin as well. While insiders have been benefitting, the wider memecoin trend has seen traders make—and lose—fortunes in relatively short amounts of time.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

One trader, for example, managed a loss of $46,000 in just three minutes after the price of the token, Milady Wif Hat ($LADYF) plunged. The incident highlights several key factors native to the cryptocurrency space, which include the volatility inherent to it that’s especially present in lesser-known and meme-inspired cryptocurrencies and the liquidity issues that these newly launched tokens can have, forcing traders to suffer significant losses due to slippage.



In another case, a memecoin saw a dramatic price rise of over 3000% over a 24-hour period, and a cryptocurrency trader managed to take advantage by betting 50 $SOL, worth around $9,000, in the cryptocurrency. Its rise has seen them make a profit of over $123,000.



In another case, a cryptocurrency trader managed to make a profit of over $3 million trading a newly launched Solana-based memecoin within just 12 minutes after betting nearly $2 million on it right after it started trading.



In yet another incident, a trader, identified on-chain by the alias “sundayfunday.sol,” turned a $72,000 investment into a staggering $30 million within just three days trading a little-known cryptocurrency.

2 May: Four New Solana Memecoins That Could Rally 9,000% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

This Is Why Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Could Drop to $0.10


Dogecoin (DOGE) price could soon incur further losses as investors remain skeptical.
Indeed, the meme coin’s investors are largely pessimistic, without increasing investments.
Dogecoin Loses Support
Dogecoin’s price falling below $0.15 accelerated the decline, bringing the doge-themed token to $0.131 at the time of writing. The meme coin is attempting to secure the support of $0.127, a level that has been tested numerous times in the past.
However, it might face some struggle as DOGE will likely drop back soon owing to investors’ waning support. 

Over $1 billion has been removed from the Futures market in the last three weeks. Indeed, Dogecoin’s Open interest (OI) dropped from $1.6 billion to $667 million in the span of 20 days. This metric represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts held by market participants at any time.

Investors’ actions fall in line with their sentiment as well. Since the beginning of April, DOGE holders have exhibited largely pessimism towards the meme coin. The crypto market conditions and the lack of bullish cues within the Dogecoin network have pulled investors towards bearish expectations.
This is visible in the weighted sentiment, which has been negative for nearly the past month.

DOGE Price Prediction: Failing the Hold
Dogecoin’s price in the short-term timeframe is stuck within a falling wedge. However, this bullish pattern was invalidated after DOGE fell through the lower trend line and received support of $0.127. While the meme coin did recover, it will potentially slip back soon.
The altcoin will likely fall to $0.116, which could create the conditions for a further decline to $0.105. This is the potential outcome on the 4-hour chart.

However, a successful retest of $0.127 could give Dogecoin’s price a shot at securing the recovery. If DOGE does so and rises to breach $0.140, it could test the resistance at $0.151, invalidating the bearish thesis and enabling further rise.

Whales Dive Back Into Solana Meme Coins with SEALANA Crypto Presale Raising $100,000 in Minutes

                        Thursday, May 2, 2024 – A presale for Sealana ($SEAL), the all-American redneck seal, launched on Solana yesterday, taking in $100,000 within minutes of launch.In a sector dominated by land-roving canines, one marine mammal is trading his way out of mom’s basement like a true 21st-century patriot pursuing the elusive American Dream.If his face is familiar, that’s because Sealana is a spin on the viral South Park character Gamer Guy, aka Fat Computer Nerd.Gamer Guy appeared in the hit cartoon’s side-splitting World of Warcraft episode and instantly became a viral meme all on his own, recognizable by his milk-bottle glasses, screen-locked stare, messy room and gravity-defying girth.He has since been used to symbolize anyone from the legions of disgruntled keyboard warriors writing sharp, acerbic opinions in internet comments sections, to a kind of Everyman – a symbol of the idler in everyone.Sealana is Gamer Guy but made in Web3. Whaled at his PC and growing by the day, Sealana is so absorbed in degen trades that he’s abandoned the trim figure of his youth for a diet of chips and tinned tuna. His obsession with finding the next big Solana meme coin keeps his flippers busy and his room looking like a bomb hit it.All anyone needs to dive into the fixed-price presale is a funded SOL wallet. For every 1 SOL, investors get 6,900 $SEAL tokens airdropped to them on the ICO’s conclusion. This puts them in pole position to exploit some potentially explosive appreciation through the presale and the potential Solana meme coin gold rush beyond.Users can pay using a widget on the website or by sending SOL from a decentralized wallet to this address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.Are Meme Coin Fans Now Settling on Solana?
Sealana’s native blockchain, Solana, is rapidly outdoing Ethereum to become the go-to blockchain to launch tomorrow’s biggest meme coins.Amidst a brutal recent sell-off that plunged the price of Bitcoin ($BTC) down 10% to about $57k, Solana coin Popcat ($POPCAT) is pumping 45% in seven days while Solama ($SOLAMA) rallied 25% overnight. Even Dogecoin-imitating chainmates like DogWifHat ($WIF) and Bonk ($BONK) are currently retaining value better than their competitors.Solana itself is also quickly recovering. In the last 24 hours, the price of SOL leapt 10%, far outpacing market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum and showing the fast rebounding capabilities of blockchain’s biggest growing ecosystem.The reasons for this are no mystery. Solana is a digital economy housing $3.637 billion in total value locked (TVL) across various apps and financial services, with over 1 million active users transacting daily and over 2,500 monthly active developers.Sealana also comes hot on the heels of another recent viral Solana meme coin ICO. Slothana ($SLOTH), the 420-friendly sloth, raised a staggering $15 million in a one-month presale that has just concluded.Speaking of popular crypto sloths, there are rumors that the Sealana team was also behind the scenes of another successful fixed-price presale, the popular Slerf ($SLERF) project, which is up 15% in the last 24 hours.Word on the grapevine is that they are having a go at another successful launch, without accidentally burning $10 million worth of tokens.Meme Coin Gold Rush After Bitcoin Halving?
This week’s fallen prices reflect a market that is briefly doing a spot of profit-taking before the effects of a Bitcoin software update known as “the halving” become clearer.The halving slashed mining rewards from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125, effectively halving the issuance of new BTC. Now, with Bitcoin setting new all-time highs this year, many analysts say the crypto market is set to become much more valuable, thanks to the depleted Bitcoin supply.VIDEOThe past three halvings have added significant value to the market well within a year of the update.And when traders begin seeing market-wide green candles again, further meme coin gold rushes will ensue. This time, Solana and its affiliated projects will be at the helm.Don’t ignore the patriot’s call to help Sealana Web3 his way out of mom’s basement.Simply bulk him up with SOL and watch him send a tsunami of $SEAL straight into your wallets!Interested?

                        MoonPay partnered with financial technology giant PayPal on May 2 to expand its crypto trading services within the United States. This collaboration allows MoonPay users to purchase and sell over 100 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, using various payment methods linked to their PayPal accounts.The company announced that MoonPay users in the U.S. can now complete fiat-to-crypto transactions through wallets, bank transfers, or debit cards using a PayPal account.Crypto Now Available To Moonpay US UsersThe integration signifies a notable development for MoonPay, as it became the first platform of its kind to incorporate PayPal. This provides a wider selection of cryptocurrencies compared to platforms that only offer Ether or the PayPal USD stablecoin.MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright highlighted the positive impact of the Moonpay Paypal integration on conversion rates.“Many traditional banks do not allow users to purchase crypto on debit/credit cards, but when users pay with PayPal, using that same card, we have already seen a dramatic increase in the success rate of transactions,” said Soto-Wright.With over 20 million verified users as of May 2024, he emphasized that the PayPal integration will initially be available through MoonPay’s direct-to-consumer products, including the MoonPay App and desktop.The integration is expected to commence with 50% of MoonPay’s customers and expand to other regions, including the United Kingdom and the European Union.Previously, PayPal users had access to a limited selection of digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, PayPal USD, and Bitcoin Cash. With the Moonpay PayPal partnership, however, users now have a broader range of options, including popular tokens like Solana (SOL), Tether (USDT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC).Additionally, MoonPay’s expansion aligns with its commitment to providing fiat-to-crypto transactions with debit and credit cards, mobile payment options like Apple and Google Pay, bank transfers, and local payment methods based on jurisdiction.The company seeks to expand this access to other regions, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union.Moonpay’s Strategic Partnerships Penetrating The Mainstream Market
MoonPay and Mastercard have also recently partnered to advance Web3 integrations, enhance marketing tools, and foster customer engagement.The collaboration sees Mastercard leveraging MoonPay’s web3 creative services — through Nightshift ( Now Otherlife), acquired last October—to modernize its marketing strategies and boost customer loyalty.MoonPay is integrating Mastercard’s solutions, such as Send, Crypto Credentials, and Click-to-Pay, into its services to ensure regulatory compliance and trustworthiness amid increasing regulatory scrutiny in the crypto market.Because of these regulatory troubles, MoonPay appointed Mike Lempres, a former executive from Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), to its board of directors last year amid increased regulatory scrutiny.Lempres, known for his extensive experience in corporate governance and regulatory affairs, brings valuable expertise to MoonPay as it explores product offerings and regulatory challenges.His previous roles at Coinbase, where he played a major role in the exchange’s IPO and growth, highlight his understanding of compliance and risk management in the crypto industry.

Economist Alex Krüger Goes ‘Max Long’ on Crypto Positions - Here Are His Altcoin Picks - The Daily Hodl


								Popular trader and economist Alex Krüger says he’s currently “max long” on the crypto market.
Krüger tells his 173,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s hedged and unhedged multiple times but he’s now max long in “very concentrated positions.”










The economist notes that he’s looking to “de-risk” soon. However, he acknowledges that Bitcoin (BTC) could drop as low as $52,000 after plunging below $59,000. BTC is trading at $57,093 at time of writing and is down more than 4.5% in the past 24 hours.
Explains Krüger,
“I’m not immune to bear raids. My bigger picture view has not changed: new ATHs later in the year (for Bitcoin). End-of-cycle views make little sense to me. A correction was to be expected.” 
The economist also notes that he has positions in the layer-1 blockchains Solana (SOL), Toncoin (TON), Aptos (APT) and Core (CORE), as well as the decentralized data storage protocol Arweave (AR) and Bittensor (TAO), a decentralized blockchain platform that focuses on machine learning and AI.
Krüger adds that APT, CORE, AR and TAO are “much higher risk” than SOL and TON.
The economist also notes that Bitcoin had a bearish response to Wednesday’s U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement.
“Very rare for price to reverse in full right after the press conference is over. And bearish, as the FOMC was dovish. And now you have trapped intraday longs. The one silver lining is BTC is trading in line with equities.”

Bitcoin: Longs erase $100M in 1 day, more to come for BTC's price? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin has dropped below the $60,000 price range.
More long positions have been liquidated in the last 48 hours.

The recent downturn in Bitcoin’s [BTC] price has left traders in long positions vulnerable. With BTC’s price declining further and crossing critical thresholds, many holders are liquidating their positions.
Bitcoin sees over $100 million in liquidations
According to data from Crypto Rank, the cryptocurrency market experienced liquidations totaling over $464 million on the 1st of May, and Bitcoin accounted for over $136 million of this outflow. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin liquidation chart on Coinglass indicated that long positions bore the brunt of the liquidations, with approximately $100.3 million being liquidated on the 1st of May. 
Conversely, short liquidations amounted to around $36.4 million.

Further analysis of the BTC flow revealed an inflow of over 32,300. These figures suggested an ongoing trend of increased BTC being sent to exchanges.
BTC in free fall

At the time of writing, BTC was trading at approximately $57,740, showing a less than 1% decline. This prolonged price decline has further entrenched a bearish trend, as indicated by its Relative Strength Index (RSI). 
The downward trajectory in price is also contributing to increased exchange inflow and liquidation of long positions.

Jack Dorsey’s Block to use 10% of Bitcoin profit to buy BTC every month

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey said his fintech firm Block, Inc. will flip 10% of its gross profit made off its Bitcoin products into buying Bitcoin (BTC) every month.“Going forward, each month we will be investing 10% of our gross profit from Bitcoin products into Bitcoin purchases,” Dorsey wrote in a May 2 shareholder letter inclusive of its better-than-expected first-quarter results.“We were one of the first public companies to put Bitcoin on our balance sheet,” he added. Block bought $220 million worth of BTC across Q4 2020 and Q1 2021.“Our investment in Bitcoin transcends technology; it is an investment in a future where economic empowerment is the norm.”Its latest earnings detailed Block held 8,038 BTC as of March 31 — worth $573 million with reported paper gains of $233 million.Block’s Bitcoin gross profit for the first quarter of 2024 through customer sales with its Cash App business was up nearly 60% year-on-year to $80.1 million. If the plan  could buy it around 1,350 BTC at its current price of $59,250.Block’s Bitcoin results, sales of Bitcoin it sells to customers, for Q1 compared to last year. Source: Block, Inc.Its Bitcoin revenue — the sale amount of Bitcoin sold to Block customers — was up 26% year-on-year to $2.73 billion in Q1 which the firm said benefitted from the rising average market price of Bitcoin over the quarter.Related: US lawmakers urge SEC to approve Bitcoin options tradingIn the shareholder letter Dorsey addressed that he’s “spending so much time on Bitcoin” as he believed “the world needs an open protocol for money.”He claimed such an open protocol could benefit Block by helping it “serve more people around the world faster.”Dorsey added, however, that “less than 3% of company resources are dedicated to Bitcoin-related projects.” The firm in December launched its Bitkey Bitcoin wallet and last week on April 23 said it was building a “full Bitcoin mining system” to help ease challenges faced by miners after the Bitcoin halving — which cut rewards by 50%.“The internet will have a native currency; it’s just a matter of time,” Dorsey wrote. “This won’t happen overnight.

EigenLayer Increases Minimum Airdrop Allocation - The Defiant

More than 280,000 users of the restaking protocol will receive an additional 100 EIGEN tokens.Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer has updated its EIGEN airdrop allocations in response to severe community backlash.All eligible users will receive an additional 100 EIGEN tokens, provided that they interacted with EigenLayer before April 29.“We heard from many users worldwide who had to pay high gas costs to participate in the protocol. We want to ensure that users, small and large, have equal access,” the Eigen Foundation said in a blog post.The project has also outlined its timeline for unlocking EIGEN tokens, connecting this milestone to its goal of achieving mainnet launch by Sept. 30, at which point the community will be able to vote on enabling transferability.Additionally, the Foundation clarified that the 12-month lockup period for the team and investors will start only after the EIGEN token becomes transferable.EigenLayer is DeFi’s third-largest protocol, with $15 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).The update also addressed an oversight where certain testnet users were not allocated tokens. This will be corrected in Phase 2 of Season 1, with more information to be shared in the near future.

The attaché stated that CBDCs, including the digital ruble and Iran’s project, the so-called crypto-rial, could “potentially mitigate the impact of sanctions.”Russia has been hit with multiple sanctions packages from the US, the EU, and allied nations since the outbreak of war in Ukraine in 2022.Iran, meanwhile, is facing fresh sanctions following a missile strike on Israel in mid-April, the UK government announced last week.Mohsen conceded that “difficulties remain” with CBDC-related payments, but said lawmakers would need to “create infrastructure and regulations for new payment methods.”He added that Iran “intends to cooperate with Russia” to “implement” new regulations, as “Tehran maintains an effective trade partnership with Moscow.”Sanctions packages are making Iran and Moscow “more interested than ever” in cooperating, claimed Maxim Chereshnev, the Chairman of Russia’s Council for the Development of Foreign Trade and International Economic Relations.Chereshnev added that a CBDC-powered “partnership” with Iran was “strategically important” to Moscow.The move could allow Moscow to “strengthen” its “influence in the Middle East and Central Asia,” he explained.Non-USD Fiat Trades Cost Russian Firms Dearly: Expert
The chairman added that the “inability to make payments in dollars and euros” has forced Russia and Iran to use their own fiat currencies in trade deals.But Chereshnev explained that this causes difficulties to arise when it comes to converting currencies.He added that there were also “discrepancies” between Iranian currency market rates and state-controlled rates.As such, Russian businesses currently lose “about 20-25%” in every trade deal they make using fiat.Chereshnev said that CBDCs would help alleviate this. He said that the “launch of settlements made using DFAs and CBDCs can “simplify trade between states” like Iran and Russia.He also said the tech advances would allow traders to “increase transparency, and boost the security of transactions.”More Russian Partners Ready for CBDC Trading?
Russian banks and other firms have begun issuing DFAs: blockchain-powered securities, commodities, and more; as they look to increase domestic investment options.Earlier this year, President Vladimir Putin signed a law that allows Russian firms to engage in cross-border DFA trade using Russian-issued tokens.The law also allows companies to trade cross-border using the digital ruble. However, experts have noted that this law does not allow Russian companies to use other countries’ DFAs or CBDCs in trade deals.Several other Russian allies have begun accelerating their own digital fiat projects. These include Belarus, which is set to make use of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network.In February, Mikhail Demidenko, the National Bank of Belarus’s Deputy Head of Research and Strategic Development, said:“The [goal] is primarily the decentralization of cross-border payments. The problem in the modern world is that all payments between countries go through the banking systems of issuers of major currencies like the dollar and euro.”Russian lawmakers have also floated the idea of doing business with China using the digital ruble and the Beijing-backed digital yuan.

Ethereum Name Service challenges Unstoppable Domains' patent - Crypto Briefing




Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has petitioned the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to challenge the validity of a patent obtained by Unstoppable Domains (UD) in 2023. ENS claims that UD’s patent utilizes technology that ENS had developed and open-sourced.In a statement on social media platform X, ENS explained that UD obtained a patent for technology that ENS Labs developed with the intent of being open-source.Both ENS and UD provide domain name and wallet services with top-level domains (TLDs) such as .crypto, .eth, and similarly branded names that form an affinity with the crypto space. ENS alleges that UD patented “ENS’s pioneering technology, directly leveraging our open-source innovations” and that ENS’ contributions were even cited in the patent.“We gave UD every opportunity to avoid this battle: UD refused to open source the patent and refused to make any irrevocable pledges not to use the patent to the detriment of the community,” ENS stated.In response to the petition, Unstoppable Domains founder Matthew Gould stated on X that the patent was reviewed by the examiner with the citations to ENS in place. Gould argued that patents are valid and that “filing patents is very common in both web3 and the domain industry.”On this note, Nick Johnson, the lead developer of ENS, asked Gould to cite the key innovation in UD’s patent that wasn’t already part of ENS.At the time of writing, Gould is yet to reply to Johnson’s query, a lack of response for which the latter posted two cricket emojis.In his initial response to ENS’ thread, Gould argues that Unstoppable Domains has several other patents pending and will continue to file patents to “protect” the company. Gould also mentions that his company had made a non-assertion pledge over a year ago and views the issue as resolved.In July 2022, Unstoppable Domains raised $65 million in a Series A round led by Pantera Capital, sending the firm’s valuation to a unicorn status at $1 billion. ENS, on the other hand, operates based on a set of decentralized smart contracts for an open and public infrastructure.

Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF launch in ‘top 20%’, STRK scam suspect busted: Asia Express


            
Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry’s most important developments.



Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFsdisappoint



Six Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs from three issuers have attracted a little over $200 million in assets under management (AUM) since their launch on April 30. This disappointed many whose expectations were set sky high due to the billions of dollars solicited by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs within one week of their debut in January. 



“We tried to warn everyone to lower expectations re HK,” commented Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. 




“That said, if you localize numbers, this was BIG: e.g., ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF took in $123m on Day One, which already ranks it 6th of 82 ETFs launched in the past 3 yrs in HK and Top 20% overall.” 




Market participants were less impressed, however. At the time of publication, Bitcoin and Ether have lost 10% of their value within the past month. Data from Arkham Intelligence indicate that for two ETFs, the Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF and Bosera HashKey Ether ETFs, the AUM figures almost entirely stem from pre-listing subscriptions while trading volume post debut remains stunted. 



The result shouldn’t have come as a surprise. 



Due to capital restrictions, the Hong Kong crypto ETFs are only accessible to the 7.5 million residents of the city and some overseas traders. Mainland Chinese residents, who number over 1.4 billion, are barred from accessing the ETFs without prior Hong Kong residency. In addition, Hong Kong residents could already access the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs prior to the approval of the local ETFs. 






That said, not everyone is bearish on the ETFs’ prospects. According to a recent survey by Hong Kong crypto exchange OSL, 77% of crypto investors in the East Asian city plan to invest in the local spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. 



“This positive investor sentiment powerfully points to the growing acceptance and importance of digital assets in the region’s economy, and Hong Kong is once again marking its place as the digital asset hub,” wrote OSL’s executive director and head of regulatory affairs Gary Tiu. 



Likewise, Balchunas said in a follow-up post that the Hong Kong crypto ETFs’ performance was “way ahead of schedule,” with an AUM of $292 million on day one. The analyst previously set an AUM target of $1 billion within two years for the Hong Kong ETFs, which is still well below the tens of billions of dollars managed by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Airdrop farmer busted by Chinese police 



Despite mostly outlawing cryptocurrencies, Chinese police have arrested an individual, known only as “Lan,” who allegedly impersonated a Starknet developer and fraudulently claimed 40,000 STRK, worth $120,000 at the time, from the Ethereum layer-two solution’s official airdrop. Authorities reported: “Recently, the Cyber Security Brigade of the Xiangyuan County Public Security Bureau received a report from a victim, claiming that the 40,000 STRK coins that he had contributed to the STRK official development program had been fraudulently claimed by others.”




“With the support of the Cyber Security Detachment of the Changzhi Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Xiangyuan Cyber Police based on relevant clues finally identified the coin theft suspect as Lan, a native of Meizhou, Guangdong Province.”

Lan, who appears to have publicly bragged about the airdrop theft on Twitter, stated that he first searched Starknet on Github, randomly “picked some co-contributors,” and finally “copy their name/efforts,” in the official Starknet airdrop claim form to receive STRK. Chinese police further stated: 




“He searched for relevant workload certificates submitted by others, impersonated other people’s identities and submitted more than 40 forms, and falsely claimed the funds. The victim’s 40,000 STRK coins were transferred to his OKX wallet, and then converted into 91,000 USDT coins (equivalent to more than 637,000 yuan) as his own.”




On Feb. 20, Starknet developers allocated approximately 700 million STRK tokens out of a total supply of 10 billion to reward Starknet developers, and users, Ethereum solo and liquid stakers, as well as projects and developers from outside the Web3 ecosystem. 



Despite prior warnings, accounts from airdrop farmers and copycat accounts were allegedly included in the official airdrop. The project has since surpassed a fully diluted market capitalization of $13 billion.

Binance shuts down Hong Kong-affiliated entity 



HKVAEX, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange allegedly tied to Binance, has ceased operations as of May 1. 



“We have ceased the registration of new users and have discontinued all trading and deposit functions for existing users,” wrote HKVAEX staff. “Should you encounter any issues or require assistance, particularly after the platform is delisted, please do not hesitate to contact our support.”



Users who do not withdraw assets after the closure will be debited “a custodian fee of USDT 20 or the equivalent in other virtual assets” with weekly snapshots starting from May 1. 



A few months earlier, HKVAEX withdrew its application for a crypto exchange license in Hong Kong. X account Wu Blockchain speculated that the withdrawal may have involved various reasons, including a request to change the audit company or provide more information. The firm did not state an official reason for the withdrawal. 



End of an era for Binance



Changpeng Zhao, the iconic co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange Binance, has been sentenced to four months in prison after pleading guilty to one charge of money laundering. 



“I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life,” the former blockchain executive wrote. “I will remain a passive investor (and holder) in crypto. Our industry has entered a new phase. Compliance is super important,” he added. 



Zhao a Chinese-born Canadian national, founded Binance in 2017 with his spouse Yi He, a Chinese television personality, after a brief stint as the CTO of crypto exchange OKCoin (now OKX). 



Under his leadership, Binance quickly becomes the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, with a market share of over 50%. The exchange pioneered features that are now prominent in the industry, such as swaps, earn, API bots, farm pools, initial offerings, NFT marketplaces, exchange self-custody wallets, and others. 



However, the exchange’s rapid growth came at the cost of failing to maintain an adequate compliance program. Last November, the exchange announced a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over money laundering charges. Zhao also stepped down as CEO as part of a plea deal. 



Binance’s new CEO, Richard Teng, has since stated that “gaps in compliance” from the early days of Binance are firmly in the past and that the crypto exchange is now “totally different.”

JPMorgan Waves Crypto Red Flag: Urges Caution As Market Teeters on Edge


								In recent evaluations by JPMorgan analysts, cryptocurrencies’ future appears to be uncertain. Despite the sector’s rapid expansion and increasing mainstream acceptance, the financial giant advises a cautious approach in the short term.
This conservative stance stems from “diminishing retail interest” and a “scarcity of positive market catalysts.”

Analyzing The Shifts: From Enthusiasm To Caution
JPMorgan’s scrutiny reveals a marked shift in market dynamics. Over recent weeks, significant selling and profit-taking activities have been observed, particularly from retail investors who seem to be retreating from crypto and equity markets.
According to JPMorgan analysts, this trend is corroborated by a notable decrease in net inflows to equity funds, turning negative for the first time since the bullish early quarter.
The analysis further points out that while spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have experienced outflows, retail enthusiasm for stocks has also fallen.
The caution advised by JPMorgan pivots around several critical observations:
• Market Exhaustion: The crypto markets are struggling with elevated positioning, Bitcoin’s high valuation compared to gold, and its production costs.
• Retail Deterioration: Retail investor interest is clearly waning, mirrored by reduced inflows into related assets.
• Institutional Hesitation: Institutional players, including commodity trading advisors and quantitative funds, are taking profits on their previously bullish positions, though at a scale lesser than anticipated.
The analysts noted:
With a lack of positive catalysts, with the retail impulse dissipating and with the three headwinds mentioned previously in our publication (elevated positioning, high bitcoin prices vs. gold and vs. the estimated bitcoin production cost, subdued crypto VC funding) still in place, we maintain a cautious stance on crypto markets over the near term.
Crypto Analyst Predictions Diverge
As JPMorgan adopts a conservative approach to cryptocurrency, other analysts provide more detailed forecasts, particularly for Bitcoin.
Michael van de Poppe, a well-regarded figure in crypto analysis, has suggested that Bitcoin might be nearing the conclusion of its corrective phase, indicating possible upward movements following the establishment of a price floor.

Conversely, Peter Schiff, a known Bitcoin skeptic and gold advocate, has entered the conversation about Bitcoin’s valuation, forecasting a potential decrease in the near term and setting his target at the $54,000 mark.

Meanwhile, despite a rough 7.8% decline over the past week, Bitcoin has shown signs of resilience. Recently, the cryptocurrency has experienced a modest recovery, increasing by 1.8% in a single day, bringing its price to $58,458.

Examining MATIC's future as Polygon records new ATH in key area - AMBCrypto



Polygon’s daily active addresses exceeded 1.4 million. 
MATIC’s price surged by more than 9% in the last 24 hours.

Polygon [MATIC] has been in the new for several weeks because of its high network activity. Things just got even better as a key metric hit an all-time high. 
In the meantime, MATIC’s price gained bullish momentum as the market condition changed.
Polygon’s network activity is rising 
Polygon has performed well in terms of network activity, as its daily active addresses have remained above the 1 million mark for multiple weeks. 
The consistency resulted in the metric touching a new all-time high on the 1st of May. 
According to a recent tweet from Today In Polygon, the blockchain’s daily active addresses touched 1.4 million. 
AMBCrypto’s look at Artemis’ data revealed that the massive rise in active addresses had a positive impact on its daily transactions, as it also surged.
Source: Artemis
Though the blockchain’s network activity was up, things were not good in terms of captured value. AMBCrypto found that while active addresses rose, its fees dropped sharply. 
Because of that, the blockchain’s revenue also declined. 
Polygon’s performance on the DeFi front was also not on par, which was evident from the drop in its TVL. 
Source: Artemis
MATIC bulls are here
MATIC bulls stepped up their game as the token’s price chart turned green. According to CoinMarketCap, MATIC was up by more than 9% in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, it was trading at $0.6944 with a market capitalization of over $6.8 billion. A possible reason behind this price pump could be a rise in buying pressure. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that MATIC’s supply on exchanges dipped.
 This happened at a time when its supply outside of exchanges increased, suggesting buying pressure on Polygon increased. 
Whales’ confidence in MATIC also seemed to have improved, as the supply held by top addresses went up slightly. 
Source: Santiment
To see whether Polygon will manage to sustain this new bull rally, AMBCrypto then planned to take a look at its daily chart.
 We found that MATIC’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick and was headed further above the neutral mark. Similar to the CMF, the Money Flow Index (MFI) also went northward. 

Read Polygon’s [MATIC] Price Prediction 2024-25

Moreover, the technical indicator MACD displayed a bullish upperhand in the market. These technical indicators clearly suggested that the chances of MATIC remaining bullish were high.
 However, nothing can be said with certainty, as the Bollinger Bands pointed out that MATIC’s price was entering a less-volatile zone.

Fantom (FTM) Price Presents Early Buy Signals


Fantom (FTM) price has been consolidating for some time now and could continue. This is because the altcoin has not seen any strong directional bias in weeks.
However, a buy signal currently appears on the on-chain metrics, which could help FTM escape consolidation.
Buy Singlas Pop Up for Fantom
Fantom‘s price trading above $0.63 is a good sign that the altcoin is safe from diving further, as supported by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). This technical analysis tool measures the relationship between two moving averages of an asset’s price. It provides insight into its momentum and potential buy or sell signals. 
During recovery moments, the indicator line (blue) crosses over the signal line (red), confirming a bullish crossover. This is the expected outcome as these lines are inching closer. Once this happens, the Fantom’s price will be eligible for an increase.

Fantom also shows a divergence in the price daily active addresses (DAA) indicator. This can be seen as a buy signal, suggesting an ideal accumulation zone.
This metric is used in cryptocurrency analysis to assess the relationship between an asset’s price and the number of active addresses transacting on its network. It indicates potential discrepancies between market valuation and network usage trends.
Whenever the price of an asset rises and participation decreases, a sell signal can be observed. Conversely, increasing participation and declining prices issue a buy signal, which is the case with FTM presently. If investors opt to make the most of this opportunity and stock up on FTM supply, it could see some recovery soon.
 Fantom Price DAA Divergence. Source: Santiment
FTM Price Prediction: Rebound

At $0.67 at the time of writing, Fantom’s price maintains its presence above the key support of $0.63. This support line has been tested numerous times this year and remained unbroken since early March.
Such is the case with the resistance block of $0.79 and $0.88 as well. This block has been tested as support and resistance and is usually difficult to breach through or below. 
Even if FTM does manage to post a rally in the next few trading sessions, it will halt the rise at $0.79, which is the lower limit of the resistance block. From there on, it is unclear whether to breach $0.80 or fail to do so.

However, if the support of $0.63 is broken, Fantom’s price could note a considerable drawdown. Falling to $0.55 and below would invalidate the bullish thesis, enabling FTM to note further losses.

3 May: Four Solana Memecoins That Could Skyrocket 9,000% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.







Market Cap: $3,000




Contract Address: Aeem6NMbRzcLCFxJWCYWatevYLEKEi1P1YkkYJv7dgUd







Market Cap: $16,000



Contract Address: 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML







Market Cap: $15,000

Market Cap: $19,000



Contract Address: AiqeRZVZgPkDVVXNTYqz7xGA7bgwuTgE1ShqCkC7C7Em



How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

SEC will classify ETH as security and reject spot Ethereum ETFs, says Michael Saylor - Crypto Briefing




Michael Saylor believes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will label Ethereum as a security this summer and consequently deny all spot Ethereum ETF applications. He also claimed that other major cryptos like Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) will likely face similar security classifications from the SEC.“Ethereum is deemed to be a crypto asset security, not a commodity. After that, you’re gonna see that Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano, everything down the stack is just crypto-asset securities unregistered,” said Saylor during today’s presentation at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference.“None of them will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF. None of them will be accepted by Wall Street. None of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” he added.In contrast, Saylor highlighted Bitcoin’s unique position as the only crypto asset with full institutional acceptance, describing it as the “one universal” institutional-grade crypto asset without any contenders.MicroStrategy’s founder is known as a vocal Bitcoin proponent; he exclusively focuses on Bitcoin investment and building Bitcoin infrastructure.Saylor’s comments come a day after MicroStrategy unveiled MicroStrategy Orange, a Bitcoin-based decentralized identity solution. Earlier this week, the company also announced its acquisition of 122 BTC last month.Mounting skepticismSaylor is not the only person who is skeptical about the near-term approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. Justin Sun, the founder of TRON Foundation, previously voiced concerns about Ethereum ETF’s regulatory hurdles. He believes the SEC will not approve spot Ethereum ETFs this month.The SEC is set to make decisions on filings by VanEck and ARK on May 23 and May 24, respectively. Recent discussions surrounding the SEC’s approval process for spot Bitcoin funds have been notably shallow compared to prior discussions preceding the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin funds, with SEC staff reportedly not engaging in detailed conversations about the proposed Ethereum ETFs.This lack of interaction heightens frustration and raises the chances of either a rejection or a postponement of decisions.A definitive classification for Ethereum could clarify how companies interact with the asset. It could also influence the SEC’s approval of products like spot ETFs and the willingness of companies to engage with Ethereum.However, not everyone shares this doubt. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on the Fox Business show “The Claman Countdown” that a spot Ethereum ETF could still be possible even if the SEC classifies ETH as a security.

Shiba Inu: ShibaSwap to operate on Ethereum, Solana: Impact on SHIB? - AMBCrypto



ShibaSwap’s 24-hour trading volume more than doubled. 
Ecosystem tokens like SHIB and BONE saw impressive spikes in the last 24 hours.

In a major feat for the Shiba Inu [SHIB] ecosystem, decentralized exchange (DEX) ShibaSwap went live on the layer-2 (L2) blockchain Shibarium, ushering in a new multichain era.
The update was provided by Shiba Inu marketing lead Lucie via an X post dated the 1st of May. With the integration, Shibaswap would operate on both the Ethereum [ETH] and Shibarium networks.
The ecosystem’s primary token SHIB was trading at $0.00002245 as of this writing, up 6.4% in the last 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap showed.
Bone ShibaSwap [BONE], ShibaSwap’s governance token, also got a 5.76% hike in the 24-hour period.
Big boost for ShibaSwap
Since its launch in July 2021, ShibaSwap has been functioning on the Ethereum blockchain as a DEX, offering services like staking, liquidity pools, and yield farming.
The platform has handled trades worth more than $17 billion as of this writing, AMBCrypto noted using DeFiLlama data. In the last 24 hours, the trading volume more than doubled to $2.55 million.
Shibarium was due for a hard fork on the 2nd of May, in a bid to make the network faster and more cost-effective.
The improved network performance could provide just the right ecosystem for ShibaSwap to grow further.
What’s in there for SHIB?
Utility projects like ShibaSwap and Shibarium were planned steps by the Shiba Inu ecosystem to rise above the meme coin status and add utility to native tokens.
The news of Shibarum’s integration not only caused SHIB to spike, but resulted in a dramatic increase in the new addresses created on the network, AMBCrypto noted using Santiment data.

The daily active addresses also spiked 11% on the 1st of May. The positive commentary around the coin also increased, as evidenced by the weighted sentiment indicator.
Like the broader market, the second-largest meme coin had a rough April, losing more than 12% throughout the month.

Bitcoin Loses Historical Level, Analyst Says "Reclaim And Bounce, Or Die"


                            An analyst has pointed out how Bitcoin recently closed below a historically important on-chain level, a failure to reclaim which could spell trouble for BTC.
Bitcoin Fell Below Short-Term Holder Cost Basis In Latest Crash
In a new post on X, Maartunn discussed BTC’s recent close below the realized price of the short-term holders and stressed its importance in reclamation.
The “realized price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that tracks the price at which the average investor on the Bitcoin network acquired their coins. In other words, it measures the average cost basis in the BTC market.

When the spot value of a cryptocurrency is below this metric, it means that the average investor in the market is carrying their coins at a loss right now. On the other hand, being above the indicator suggests that the holders as a whole are in the green currently.
In the current topic, the realized price of the entire Bitcoin market isn’t of interest but rather of only a subsection: the short-term holders (STH).
The STHs are the BTC investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. These holders represent the inconsistent side of the market, who easily show a reaction whenever a change like a crash or rally occurs in the sector.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the realized price specifically for these investors over the past year:

The price of the asset appears to have seen a cross under this metric in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
The realized price of the Bitcoin STHs is floating around $58,500. During the latest crash, Bitcoin went as low as below $57,000, meaning that the plunge has put these investors under pressure.
Historically, the average cost basis of the STHs has been significant for the cryptocurrency, as it has taken turns acting as support and resistance, depending on the market’s phase.
During bullish trends, this metric often acts as a point of support. The chart shows that when Bitcoin had declined near this level earlier in the year, it had found a rebound.
The metric acts as resistance during bear markets, keeping the price below it. These patterns may be related to how investor psychology works.

In bullish periods, the STHs might view their cost basis as a profitable buying opportunity, so they accumulate during dips in it, thus helping the price turn around. In bear markets, these investors could look at the level as a point of exit, as they may not believe the price will go up any further.
After closing below the STH realized price earlier, Bitcoin is now fighting to reclaim this historical level. It now remains to be seen if support will once again be found or if the level will truly become lost.
BTC Price
Bitcoin has climbed back above the STH realized price, trading above $59,300. This is certainly a sign in the positive direction, but it’s hard to say whether this recovery will last.

Bitcoin Analyst Is Long On King Crypto As Fed Moves To Unwind Treasury Buybacks: 'QE Is CLose' - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD analyst Michael van de Poppe takes a bullish stance on the cryptocurrency as the Federal Reserve begins unwinding Treasury buybacks, signaling a potential shift in monetary policy.What Happened: Van de Poppe took to social media platform X, to share his concerns. He pointed out that the FED’s decision to unwind Treasury buybacks and reduce QT is a response to worsening economic data, which increases the likelihood of a recession. He suggested that this could become evident in the upcoming months and advised investors to consider long-term investments in Bitcoin.He wrote, “Casually, the FED starts to unwind Treasury buybacks and is reducing QT. Why? Well, the economic data starts to become worse, which means the chances of a potential recession have increased. Likely this will pop up coming months in the data. Long #Bitcoin, QE is close.”Quantitative easing is a monetary policy used by central banks to increase liquidity in the financial system, typically by purchasing long-term government bonds from major banks. This is done to stimulate economic growth by encouraging banks to lend or invest more freely.See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Closing April With Heavy Losses, Slide Below $60K Causes Over $380M In LiquidationsWhy It Matters: Van de Poppe’s warning comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant fluctuations. On the same day, he had also projected a prolonged recovery period for Bitcoin while anticipating a surge in altcoin performance. His recent warning about a potential recession adds another layer of uncertainty to the market.Meanwhile, other analysts have been sharing their views on Bitcoin’s future. DonAlt, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, pointed out that despite bearish price action on lower time frames, the outlook remains bullish as long as Bitcoin closes above $60,000 on the weekly timeframe. Meanwhile, Peter Schiff sees Bitcoin in a bear market despite the hype surrounding spot Bitcoin ETFs. He compared Bitcoin’s performance to gold and pointed out that Bitcoin's previous support level of $60,000 now acts as resistance.On the other hand, Bitcoin is battling to reclaim some levels as Solana and meme coins lead the market rebound. This follows a period of losses earlier in the week, with Bitcoin open interest dropping to its lowest levels in two months.Van de Poppe had earlier projected a prolonged recovery period for Bitcoin while anticipating a surge in altcoin performance.Price Action: Bitcoin is presently trading at $59,009, marking a slight 0.10% decline over the last 24 hours.

Crypto Mining Restrictions: Arkansas Lawmakers Approve Bills


								Over the last couple of years, the US government has tried to tighten its grip on different sectors of the crypto industry. As a result, these efforts have received significant backlash from politicians and central figures within the crypto space.
This week, another crackdown on the crypto industry occurred after Arkansas lawmakers approved two bills to address criticism over previous regulations on mining operations.

New Crypto Mining Regulations In Arkansas
News media outlet The Associated Press (AP) reported on Wednesday that Arkansas’ House of Representatives gave final approval to two bills related to crypto mining operations in the state.
The two Senate-backed bills, SB78 and SB79, were among the few non-budget subjects on the legislative session’s agenda and were “overwhelmingly approved” by the majority Republican House. They are on their way to Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders’s desk.
Last year, Arkansas lawmakers faced backlash after approving the Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023. The approved Act 851 set an overall favorable regulatory ground for crypto miners in the state, establishing clear definitions and guidelines.
As Bitcoinist reported, the act included provisions prohibiting discrimination against digital asset miners. Moreover, it sought to protect crypto mining businesses from “discriminatory regulations” and ensure their equal treatment as data centers.
Act 851 was criticized for limiting the local government’s ability to enact measures to regulate mining businesses. Now, Arkansas’ Senate and House of Representatives intend to address the complaints of last year’s Act with the newly approved bills.
These bills tackle the backlash from local officials and residents who live near the operations, who complained about the noise impact on the community. As a result, the lawmakers added the requirement for noise-reduction techniques and a state permit to operate.
Additionally, the two bills addressed water usage restrictions for cooling techniques and removed the limitation to regulate the sound decibels generated by mining facilities. Republican Representative Rick McClure stated:

Let’s do what we can to help those who have been impacted in a negative way, and work for better solutions.

Moreover, the approved bills prohibit the ownership of crypto mining businesses by companies and individuals from several countries, including China.
Nonetheless, it continues to restrict the regulatory power of local authorities over matters like home mining from individuals or rezoning areas where crypto mining businesses are located.
Gov. Sanders To Sign The Bills Despite Concerns
According to AP, one of the Representatives who voted against the bills, democrat Andrew Collins, stated his concern about the wording of the limit and the impact it could have on foreign investment:

We’re casting a net that is both too wide and too narrow. It’s going to catch people up who are totally innocent, and it’s going to miss a lot of people who are either home-grown or are from countries not on this list.

Representative Justin Gonzalez also voted against the bills. During an interview on Wednesday, he expressed his opinion on the matter. To the representative, the bills will “allow local governments to discriminate against a business just because of what it is.”
According to Arkansas Advocate reports, Gonzales doesn’t believe the Act needed to be amended despite not having a problem with the language used to address the foreign ownership issue.
Regardless of the opposition concerns, the bills are expected to be approved by the Arkansas governor. Alexa Henning, Sanders’ spokesperson, stated in an email that both bills will be signed, further alleging adding that:

The Governor was the first in the country to kick a Chinese communist owned company out of her state and strongly supports outlawing foreign adversaries from owning crypto mines in Arkansas, while protecting rural communities and empowering them to crack down on bad actors.

TON Price Soars 9% On Pantera Capital's Investment, Capitalizing On Telegram User Potential


                            Venture capital firm Pantera Capital has invested significantly in The Open Network blockchain. The news, announced on Thursday, resulted in a 9% surge in the network’s native token, Toncoin (TON), pushing its value above the $5 mark.
Pantera Capital Bullish On TON And Telegram Integration
In a statement, Pantera Capital expressed enthusiasm about their latest investment in TON. The Layer 1 network, initially conceived by Telegram and continued by the open-source community, can potentially introduce cryptocurrency to the masses due to its extensive usage within the Telegram network. 

Telegram, used by over 900 million monthly active users, is known for personal and group communication, community building, content sharing, and more. Pantera Capital believes that by leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and user experience, combined with TON’s growing ecosystem, the network could become one of the largest in the cryptocurrency space. Pantera’s announcement further reads:
We at Pantera Capital are thrilled to announce our latest investment in TON, a Layer 1 network originally designed by Telegram and continued by the open-source community.  We believe TON has the capacity to introduce crypto to the masses because it is used extensively within the Telegram network. 
The integration of TON with Telegram aligns with the platform’s vision of providing a “seamless” and “borderless” experience for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments within its user base. 
Tether’s Integration With The Open Network
As previously reported by NewsBTC, Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin in the market, USDT, recently announced the launch of its USDT dollar-pegged token and Tether Gold (XAUT) on The Open Network. 
This integration further increases the potential for P2P payments within Telegram’s extensive user base, a prospect that Pantera Capital aims to capitalize on.

In addition to the investment in TON, Pantera Capital is actively pursuing the launch of a new fund, Pantera Fund V, to raise over $1 billion. This fund aims to provide investors with diverse investment options across the blockchain asset spectrum, encompassing startup equity, early-stage tokens, and liquid tokens.
The new fund has established a minimum investment threshold of $1 million for qualified investors, and the first close is scheduled for April 1, 2025. 
Insiders familiar with the matter have indicated that Pantera Fund V is anticipated to reach a similar size as its predecessor, which successfully amassed approximately $1.25 billion in capital two years ago.

Following the disclosure of Pantera Capital’s investment in The Open Network, the price of TON experienced a notable 9% surge on Thursday, reaching a current trading price of $5.09. This increase comes after a significant price decline, with TON dropping as low as $4.6 after reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $7.65 in mid-April.

As Bitcoin sinks below this key zone, what should you do now? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin short-term whales are underwater, which likely presented an ideal buying opportunity
Metrics resembled how they were before the previous major bull run

Bitcoin [BTC] sank below the key demand zone at $60k.
This region had held the sellers at bay but eventually gave way. Crypto technical analyst CrypNuevo highlighted that we might get a post-FOMC bounce to $61k in a post on X (formerly Twitter).
Should traders expect to see the $60k former support reclaimed? Alternatively, should they look to go short upon a retest? Here’s what market participants could watch out for before making their next move.
The current breakdown has been on a high trading volume
Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView
The key levels are $59.4k and $60.7k in the short term. A cluster of liquidity is likely present near these levels, marking them as critical areas where a bearish continuation could occur.
Such a continuation is expected because the OBV has fallen below two-week support, highlighting selling pressure dominance.

The liquidation levels showed that the cumulative liq levels delta was vastly negative. Therefore, we can expect a move upward in the short-term to collect liquidity and wipe out the imbalance.
The $60.5k and the $63.8k levels had the highest cluster of liquidation levels. Hence, a move to these levels before a reversal southward is anticipated.
Of golden and death crosses

In a CryptoQuant Insights post, user CoinLupin pointed out an interesting development.
Looking at the realized UTXO age bands, the onset of major bull runs came when the realized price of 1-3 month and 2-3 year bands saw a smoothing process.
This happened in 2020 from January to September, and prices tend to consolidate near the realized prices of these age bands.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

In the current cycle, there were not as many golden and death crosses between these two age bands.
However, the recent pullback could be followed by deeper losses as savvy market participants buy from impatient BTC sellers. This could be followed by the true bull run, the analyst pointed out.

US senators, FBI aren’t opposed to crypto privacy: Railgun contributor

United States senators and intelligence agencies may not be as opposed to privacy-focused crypto protocols as some believe, according to Railgun researcher and advocate Alan Scott Jr. Speaking to Cointelegraph at ETH Global in Sydney on May 2, Scott — a contributor and public advocate for Railgun — said based on conversations he’s had with senators and the FBI in Washington D.C., he hasn’t seen any hints of a crypto privacy crusade on Capitol Hill. There are many people in the upper echelons of government who are “generally smart, want to do right, and protect people,” he said.Railgun is a privacy-focused protocol that leverages smart contracts to ensure private transactions for decentralized finance (DeFi) users on the Ethereum network and several of its layer-2 networks including Polygon and Arbitrum. Audience at the ETH Global conference in Sydney. Source: CointelegraphHowever, Railgun is often lumped in the same boat as other crypto privacy protocols, such as Tornado Cash, which has seen the wrong end of the law in recent years. On April 17, an  X account touting itself as the official account for Railgun denied being used by North Korea and other U.S.-sanctioned entities to launder ill-gained crypto — specifically referring to an FBI statement that claimed Railgun was used to launder more than $60 million in Ether (ETH) during the 2022 Harmony bridge exploit. Railgun said its zk-proof tech and “Private Proofs of Innocence” systems prevent bad actors from utilizing its protocol. Scott said crypto users should remember the FBI is a large multifaceted organization and that the people he’d spoken to at the bureau were less concerned with privacy protocols and more concerned with bad actors looking to commit financial crimes. “Their concern is the potential problems around impeding their ability to catch bad actors.” “Which is a great thing for them to be concerned with,” Scott said, explaining earlier that other privacy technology such as Scott said that his conversations with politicians and regulators in the U.S. had been largely positive and that many of them seemed to be genuinely trying their best to understand the new developments in crypto more broadly. “Whenever we talk about crypto, or we talk about DeFi you know, they ask well-informed questions and try to understand what the tech is like, how it operates, and why people like us like it so much,” he said. On April 24, the co-founders of the crypto mixer and Bitcoin wallet Samourai Wallet were arrested on money laundering charges, with the Department of Justice (DOJ) alleging the platform handled $2 billion in unlawful transactions and facilitated $100 million in money laundering transactions. Related: DOJ’s Tornado Cash arguments show ‘obvious disdain for privacy’ — LawyerScott added that despite these actions against mixers like Samourai Wallet and the ongoing persecution of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, there didn’t seem to be a crusade against the concept of privacy in crypto more broadly. “What [Railgun} is building is the disintermediation of finance, and DeFi is really quite a beautiful and very important thing to do.”“Privacy is a keystone element of that. So while we’re advocating for it and being loud and talking about privacy as an important thing — it’s completely normal, and it's actually quite boring,” Scott said. “It's already a part of the traditional finance that exists today.”He added that if the concept and application of privacy in crypto were to become illegal, it would be extremely unfortunate. “It just means we created a really hyper-accurate surveillance machine that can be monitored in live time.”Magazine: Lazarus Group’s favorite exploit revealed — Crypto hacks analysis

Bitcoin Mimics 2016 Pattern: Analyst Suggests Price Dip May Be Temporary pen_spark | Cryptoglobe


                                
A popular cryptocurrency analyst has recently identified possible parallels between the current price movements of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) and its 2016 bull run, even after a recent price correction.



According to pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s price action has been mirroring its 2016 cycle, with further declines observed in the weeks following the halving event. This recent dip falls within a zone dubbed the “Post-Halving Danger Zone” by the analyst, aligning with a similar price trend seen in 2016.



The analysis, shared with Rekt Capital’s over 450,000 followers on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), highlights that during the 2016 cycle, Bitcoin experienced an 11% price drop roughly three weeks after the halving. Rekt Capital suggested that the current cycle might see similar downside volatility within the next few days. This window coincides with the remaining period of the “Post-Halving Danger Zone.”







The analyst also drew attention to the pre-halving price movements in both 2016 and 2024. After breaking out of a consolidation phase, Bitcoin witnessed a pre-halving rally in both cycles that was then followed by a retracement period around four weeks before the halving event.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While the initial downward movement in the 2016 retracement was short-lived, Rekt Capital emphasizes the importance of Bitcoin maintaining a price level above $60,000 to potentially avoid a similar extended decline.



Bitcoin is at the time of writing trading at $59,170 after dropping below the $57,000 mark earlier this week amid an aggressive cryptocurrency market sell-off. Notably, the recently launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded outflows amid the sell-off.



Nevertheless BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin via these funds.

                        As blue-chip cryptos stabilize following a tumble earlier this week, with Bitcoin (BTC) consolidating below $60,000, traders are turning to the on-chain markets as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin was last trading close to $59,000 as traders digest recent macro developments. Negative ETF flows are also on the radar after BlackRock’s IBIT saw its first outflows since its January launch.Meanwhile, most major altcoins are also consolidating in wake of recent sell pressure.Downbeat conditions in the blue-chip market is encouraging traders turn to the volatile, unpredictable on-chain markets.On-chain markets refer to the market for assets that were issued and trade directly on the blockchain.Dozens of new tokens are launched every single day. Most are pump-and-dump schemes or scams. But there are some gems to be uncovered, that could hand an early investor quick 10 or even 100x gains.Traders often refer to tools like DEXScreener to locate trending and pumping coins.That being said, here are some of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum, as per DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayCrypto Felon (FELON)A just-launched shitcoin called Crypto Felon (FELON) has seen a huge 72,000% pump since its launch.That’s according to DEXScreener, which puts its market cap at $2.2 million. The token also has $170,000 in locked liquidity.Somewhat surprisingly given the token is literally called Crypto Felon, it only has one smart contract issue.But traders should assume that all newly launched tokens are scams and always tread with caution.Yield (YIELD)Another just launched shitcoin called Yield (YIELD) is up over 48,000% in 24 hours.DEXScreener puts its market cap at $2.2 million, with just over $200,000 in locked liquidity.Traders should be extra careful with this shitcoin. It has five smart contract issues, including a modifiable tax and unrenounced ownership.Book of Bitcoin (BOOB)Following the success of the meme coin Book of Ethereum, a new token Book of Bitcoin (BOOB) has launched, with the added bonus of boasting a comical ticker.BOOB’s market cap was last $1.1 million, having rallied 29,000% in 24 hours as per DEXScreener.The token has $120,000 in locked liquidity and only one issue with its smart contract, a whitelist.Traders should be aware of the fact that its official X account has been suspended, never a good sign.Alternative Investment Strategy to Consider – Presales
If traders can reliably identify shitcoin gems, they can make a lot of money.But the over-looked strategy of investing in presales can potentially net even higher gains if executed correctly.Web3 projects/protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to fund development.If investors can reliably identify projects that, thanks to their strong vision, use case and competent team, end up gaining traction in the market, they can make big profits.Knowing where to start is one of the biggest barriers to entry in the daunting presale market.That’s why Cryptonews put together a list of their top picks.20 Best Crypto Presales to Invest InAlternatively, check out this video from Cryptonews’ Crypto Arjay, who goes over his top 3 meme coins.

                        Neo Price Prediction as NEO Token Slips 2.3% Despite Market Rebound – Can NEO Reach $20? / Source: TradingViewThe Neo (NEO) price is in focus as the cryptocurrency slips despite a broader market rebound, and as it tests a key medium-term uptrend.NEO was last changing hands just above $16, having traded as low as $15.35 on Wednesday.Neo is a smart contract blockchain that was launched back in 2014, before rebranding to the name Neo in 2017.As per CoinMarketCap, its market cap was last just over $1.1 billion.Despite its age, Neo has failed to catch on like other smart contract blockchains like Ethereum.Indeed, it has never been able to recover to the record high it hit near $200 in 2018.At the peak of the 2021 bull run, it only managed to briefly surpass $140.At current levels, it remains close to 90% down from these highs, and 92% down from its 2018 highs.NEO’s lack of adoption is evident when examining the trade value locked (TVL) in its smart contracts.As per DeFi Llama, its TVL was last only $63 million, giving it a paltry ranking of 62nd in crypto.A low TVL suggests the blockchain has failed to develop sufficiently useful/attractive DeFi protocols to attract investors.That a chain with such weak adoption can achieve a market cap of over $1 billion shows how irrational crypto markets can be.But Neo might not have a $1 billion market cap for long. Indeed, the Neo price appears to be on the verge of a bearish technical breakout that could see it quickly shed 40% of its value.Neo Price Prediction – Can NEO Reach $20?
NEO has been moving higher according to an uptrend since the January lows.But this uptrend looks like it’s about to break. And that could open the door to a drop all the way back to $10.The Neo (NEO) price is in focus as the cryptocurrency slips despite a broader market rebound, and as it tests a key medium-term uptrend. Source: TradingViewBroader crypto market conditions could well remain bearish in wake of Bitcoin’s recent drop under $60,000.Spot Bitcoin ETF demand has flipped net negative, with the ETF experiencing outflows for the past five days.Notably, BlackRock saw its first day of outflows on Wednesday. Outflows come as markets price out near-term rate cuts from the Fed.The Fed emphasized that its too early to be cutting rates on Wednesday. That’s due to recent upside surprises in the inflation data, and amid ongoing strong growth.Rate cuts aren’t now expected until late Q3/Q4 this year. Post-having tailwinds, a more positive macro picture and potentially post-election bullishness could then come in to lift risk appetite.But until then, cryptos like NEO could continue to perform poorly.Can NEO recover to $20? Well, in time and as sentiment improves, that shouldn’t be hard.Given the current token supply of 70.5 million, NEO’s market cap would only be $1.4 billion at this price.Irrationality could yet see NEO pump back towards its previous record peaks above $100.But traders should remember, NEO is a risky bet. Despite being around now for 10 years, it hasn’t shown any real signs of adoption.Its unlikely to become a big success story any time soon.Crypto Alternative to Consider – WienerAI (WAI)
Investors tempted to jump into a risky, speculative coin like NEO obviously have a high-risk tolerance.This appetite towards risk might be better served with a different strategy that, while also risky, has higher upside potential.The strategy in question is presale investing, which involves buying the tokens of upstart crypto projects before they gain traction.Presale investing is risky because projects can fail to deliver on their promises or achieve adoption.But if investors are able to reliably identify high-potential projects, they can bag big gains.A fun new AI meme coin called Wiener AI (WAI) has caught the attention of analysts at Cryptonews.The Sausage dog-themed meme coin offers a suite of handy AI trading capabilities and has already raised over $800,000.Interested investors need to move quickly, as when the presale reaches $1.1 million, the WAI price will rise.Currently priced at $0.000703, investors are buying WAI at a market cap of around $45 million.But investors could be looking at gains of 10x or more if WAI can become a market leader.Not only is WAI an exciting meme coin with AI capabilities, but its also a passive income gem.20% of the supply has been allocated to staking rewards. Presale investors are currently earning a massive 1091% APY.At this rate, investors can double their initial presale investment in under one month.Buy Wiener AI Here

Jack Dorsey's Block Will DCA Into Bitcoin Every Month


In the early morning of today’s Asia time, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Block Inc., revealed the company’s latest plan. Dorsey stated that it intends to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) monthly, utilizing the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) method.
This move highlights Block’s commitment to integrating Bitcoin into its financial strategy. Moreover, it also emphasizes Dorsey’s position as a prominent “Bitcoin maximalist.”
Details of Block’s Bitcoin DCA Strategy Unveiled
Dollar-cost averaging is an investment approach where the same dollar amount is invested in a particular asset at regular intervals regardless of the asset’s price fluctuations. This method helps reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase.
Hence, companies with Bitcoin holdings, like Block, can strategically navigate Bitcoin’s volatile nature using DCA. Furthermore, this approach offers the potential to achieve a lower average cost per share over time.

Read more: What Is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)?
Block provided further details on how they will implement the DCA strategy in its official statement. The company announced it will allocate 10% of its gross profits from Bitcoin-related products towards monthly purchases of Bitcoin.

“Under the DCA program, we plan to purchase Bitcoin on a monthly cadence, starting April 2024. We will execute these over a shorter time window due to lower notional trade values and improved Bitcoin liquidity compared to 2020 and 2021. To reduce slippage, we have chosen to purchase Bitcoin over a two-hour window that has historically had the greatest amount of liquidity,” the company explained.

The shift to a Bitcoin-centric portfolio isn’t new for Block. The company made headlines in October 2020 when it purchased 4,709 BTC at an average price of $10,618 per Bitcoin.
Subsequent investments in February 2021 saw the addition of 3,318 BTC at a much higher price point of $51,236 each. As of March 31, 2024, Block acknowledged owning 8,038 BTC on the company’s balance sheet.

These early investments have proven lucrative. At the same reporting period, Block claimed its initial $233 million investment in Bitcoin had ballooned to approximately $573 million, marking a 146% increase. The remeasurement gain from its $233 million Bitcoin investment contributed to its net income in the first quarter of 2024.

Block’s involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem has significantly evolved beyond acquisitions. It recently launched a “Bitcoin Conversions” feature for Square users.
This feature allows merchants to convert a portion of their sales directly into Bitcoin, enhancing the utility of Block’s services in the crypto sector. Jack Dorsey explained the rationale behind this strategic direction in a recent letter to investors.


“We believe the world needs an open protocol for money, one that is not owned or controlled by any entity … An open protocol for money helps us serve more people around the world faster,” Dorsey stated.

BTC price chart seen mirroring US spot Bitcoin ETF launch pattern

Bitcoin (BTC) recent decline has some similarities to its behavior post-United States ETF launch in January, with one trader suggesting that this could mean an upswing in the “next week or so.” Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) were launched in Hong Kong on April 30, seeing $217 million worth of net inflows since. However, the price of Bitcoin has fallen almost 7% since launch, according to CoinMarketCap data.WhereAt Social co-founder and crypto trader Quinten Francois suggested the behavior bears similarities to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, which saw the price of Bitcoin fall 14% within 12 days of launch, before rising 7% over the following seven days. If Bitcoin’s price continues to follow the same trend it could see an upswing in the “next week or so,” according to Francois in a May 1 post on X.“There is no straight line to the top. Price correction was more than needed,” added pseudonymous crypto trader StockLizard.Source: Quinten FrancoisHowever, there are some key differences between the two launches. While Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs have seen $217 million worth of net inflows since launching, U.S. ETFs experienced $794 million in outflows over the same period.The Hong Kong-based ETFs also accumulated only $12.4 million in trading volume on their first day, a major difference from the $4.6 billion first-day trading volume of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs.Hong Kong’s ETF launch also comes just after the Bitcoin halving — which often comes with a period of “sideways” price action — along with continued heightened tensions in the Middle East and the United States Federal Reserve extending its period of interest rates within the nation.However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas argued in an April 30 post on X that this is a high figure considering the size of Hong Kong is approximately “1/168th the size of the U.S.” Some traders are concerned that inflows from Hong Kong might not be sufficient to offset the large amount of recent outflows from the U.S., potentially preventing a similar breakout pattern.“Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs are not enough to absorb US ETF selling pressure,” Crypto trading team TOBTC stated in a May 2 post on X.Related: Analysts expect Bitcoin price recovery after Fed leaves rates unchangedMeanwhile, other traders believe that the recent price decline is a healthy market correction for Bitcoin’s price.“The longer theBitcoin consolidation takes the higher its price will meet the trendline,” crypto trader Titan of Crypto stated in a post on X.“Bitcoin’s most recent correction was much needed for price going forward,” added crypto commentator CryptoCon.“The thing Bitcoin critics don’t understand is that we simply don’t care if the price drops,” echoed founder of AirBtc Handre van Heerden.Magazine: Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF launch in ‘top 20%’, STRK scam suspect busted: Asia ExpressThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Trezor to end privacy-enhancing coinjoin feature as Wasabi Wallet steps back - Crypto Briefing




Crypto hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor announced today the discontinuation of the coinjoin feature in its Trezor Suite. The service, provided in partnership with zkSNACKs, the developer of the Wasabi Wallet, will cease by June. Despite the shutdown, Trezor assures users that funds within Coinjoin accounts will remain accessible.Coinjoin is a privacy tool for Bitcoin transactions, allowing users to obscure the origins and destinations of their funds. Trezor was the first hardware wallet to embrace coinjoin transactions. It integrated coinjoin feature into the Trezor Model T in April last year and extended the implementation to the Trezor Model One later in August.zkSNACKs, in a recent blog post, expressed the decision to end its coinjoin coordination service was made with a “heavy heart” and a need for “legal clarity.” The company said Wasabi Wallet will still offer robust privacy features, such as client-side filtering and Tor integration, even without coinjoin.The move follows zkSNACKs’ decision to block US citizens and residents from accessing its services, including Wasabi Wallet, due to recent regulatory pressures. This prohibition extends to related websites and services, with IP address blocking already in effect.Non-custodial crypto service providers face legal showdownPhoenix, another crypto wallet provider, recently announced it would exit the US market due to ongoing regulatory uncertainties. Users are advised to close their channels and transfer their funds before access is terminated on May 5, 2024.“Recent announcements from U.S. authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such,” Acinq, the Bitcoin company behind Phoenix explained its decision.The exodus follows the SEC’s recent crackdown on non-custodial wallet provider Samourai Wallet and growing scrutiny over MetaMask. The SEC reportedly issued a Wells Notice to Consensys, MetaMask’s parent company. This notice serves as a preliminary warning that the SEC is considering legal action.In response, Consensys filed a lawsuit against the SEC, choosing to confront the regulatory challenges head-on rather than await further SEC actions. Previously, Uniswap Labs, the team behind the decentralized exchange Uniswap, also received a Wells Notice from the securities agency.

Why AI Won’t Rescue an Unplayable Web 3.0 Game - The Daily Hodl


								
 
AI in gaming is nothing new, but recent AI advancements provide numerous new ways to enhance games and their user experience – even if gamers themselves don’t particularly love it.
Whether leveraging AI to produce realistic enemy behavior and motion matching in ‘The Last of Us‘ or more accurately depicting real player skills and tactics with hyper-realistic animation in EA Sports’s ‘FC 2024,’ new AI use cases are subtly augmenting the majority of the gaming series we love.
It could go from what some veterans call a ‘necessary evil‘ to a feature that both players and developers value.
So, it’s no surprise that AI technology would also be applied to the world of Web 3.0 gaming – also commonly referred to as ‘blockchain’ or ‘NFT gaming.’
But can it be done in a way that doesn’t try to put digital duct tape over a messy game experience?
AI can play a (supporting) role in Web 3.0 gaming
When compared to the traditional gaming sector, Web 3.0 games are still infants, and like the broader crypto industry, have experienced their fair share of volatility.
The sector gained significant prominence during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, when many people were on unpaid leave, due to its introduction of play-to-win mechanics – with popular games like ‘Axie Infinity’ uniquely blending nostalgic gameplay with ownership of in-game NFT assets.
In attempts to replicate the success of ‘Axie’ and a few others, many new Web 3.0 gaming projects began launching.
However, it soon became clear most of these projects would fall short for one reason or another.
As the crypto industry imploded during the summer of 2022, Web 3.0 gaming and NFTs lost much of the little allure they had left, causing even the most popular games in the space to suffer by association.
This led to a steady decline in users, value and venture capital, forcing three out of every four games to shutter.
Without the cover and easy money of a bull market, the industry’s structural flaws and long-term sustainability became glaringly apparent.
Fair or unfair, critiques of first-generation Web 3.0 games were harsh – they are boring, lack compelling storylines, focus too much on the in-game economy and employ ‘pay-to-win’ mechanics.
Web 3.0 gaming’s main focus should be on correcting this narrative.
As Bitcoin settles at over $60,000 while the wider crypto industry continues its comeback almost two years after its crash, many gaming projects are turning to AI to garner interest and legitimacy from crypto enthusiasts, mainstream gamers and venture capitalists.
As with regular gaming, AI should be used where necessary to enhance the overall quality of Web 3.0 games.
For example, using AI to enhance interactions with NPCs (non-player characters) can make the game more rich, authentic and dynamic – something severely lacking in the first generation of Web 3.0 games.
Furthermore, AI can be creatively leveraged to regulate in-game economies, detect bots, generate NFTs and more.
These types of use cases can benefit the entire ecosystem by showing skeptics of Web 3.0 gaming that the new generation of developers and games have different priorities.
However, this doesn’t mean Web 3.0 game developers should use AI as a marketing ploy or gimmick to gain attention, as this resembles shallow tactics used during crypto’s 2021 bull run, which saw companies making exaggerated and misleading claims constantly.
These practices only backfired to generate much mockery and led to the sector being widely delegitimized.
As the industry embraces AI, gaming studios and developers must not fall into old habits by relying on AI’s hype to attract users.
Rewriting the script
As Web 3.0 gaming tries to mend its reputation, it’s paramount that the sector recognizes and fixes the mistakes and shortcomings that led to its widespread criticism.
Even for gaming studios and titles taking the appropriate steps to address the industry’s flaws, the focus must not be on using AI.
Just as early Web 3.0 games overly focused on token launches and crypto aspects such as staking and rewards, hyping up the use of AI or using it where it’s not beneficial will leave a bad taste in gamers’ mouths.
A more mature Web 3.0 gaming environment grants a second chance to the sector – but this time it can’t be squandered by employing superficial tactics in attempts to appeal to broader demographics.
You can’t use it to cut corners.
The only way to redefine the industry and take control of its narrative is through building better games that appeal to both mainstream gamers and crypto enthusiasts.
This means prioritizing storylines before token launches, quality graphics and audio over economic mechanisms, and an advanced physics engine instead of insignificant AI integrations.
At the same time, it is important to balance factors that will lead to higher quality games with the need to nurture the more promising aspects of Web 3.0 gaming – ownership and interoperability of in-game assets, transparent gameplay, community building and user participation in development.
Luckily, it appears that the industry is taking a different approach and addressing its flawed model.
As VCs show renewed interest in Web 3.0 gaming, it seems the new approach is paying off as more games have prioritized gameplay and gaming tokens’ market cap rose by nearly 25% in March.
All this is further boosted by better infrastructure in the form of more blockchain networks for developers to build on.
While the industry appears to be headed in the right direction, it needs to be cautious regarding how it uses AI – ultimately what is going to attract more gamers to Web 3.0 is the development of fun, high-quality games that smoothly and creatively integrate the best Web 3.0 features.
Without this, it doesn’t matter how much AI a game uses – because no one will play it.

Bitcoin Transaction Investigation By DOJ Addressed By Block CEO Jack Dorsey: 'We Take Compliance Seriously' - Block (NYSE:SQ) - Benzinga

Block Inc. SQ CEO Jack Dorsey addressed a potential Department of Justice investigation during the company’s first-quarter earnings call on Thursday.What Happened: Dorsey clarified that the company had proactively investigated potential threats in 2022, leading to a thorough review of transactions possibly linked to sanctioned countries. Dorsey stated, “In 2022, our compliance engineering risk team who proactively investigate threats identified signals that lead us to conduct a thorough review of transactions potentially associated with sanctioned countries.”According to Dorsey, these transactions were voluntarily reported to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the company received a no-action letter from OFAC, indicating no further investigation or action was required at the time.Regarding the prevention of tariff financing through Bitcoin BTC/USD, Dorsey highlighted the company’s robust control environment, including the use of leading blockchain analytics firms to screen transactions in real time and maintaining some of the most restrictive limits in the industry for on-chain Bitcoin withdrawals.“As it relates to preventing tariffs financing via Bitcoin, we have a robust control environment in place to mitigate exposure from adversaries. For instance, we use industry-leading blockchain analytics firms to screen transactions in real time.
