Solana could surpass Ethereum in transaction fees

In a turn that could rewrite the current dynamics of the world of cryptocurrencies, Solana seems poised to surpass Ethereum in terms of transaction fees within the next week. 
This event, if it were to occur, would not only strengthen Solana’s positioning in the sector, but could also further solidify its label as an “Ethereum-killer”, despite the technical challenges and network interruptions it has recently faced.

Current context between Ethereum and Solana for transaction fees
Ethereum, long considered the undisputed leader in decentralized applications and decentralized finance (DeFi), is known for its high transaction fees, especially during network usage peaks. 
This has led many developers and users to seek cheaper and more efficient alternatives, a niche in which Solana has begun to stand out thanks to its promise of speed and significantly lower transaction costs.
Solana has made its way in the field of blockchain with the promise of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second, compared to a capacity of Ethereum which currently revolves around 30 transactions per second.
This performance is supported by a unique consensus model, known as Proof of History (PoH), which works in tandem with the Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism to optimize efficiency and reduce costs.
Despite these advanced technical features, Solana has faced numerous network interruptions, raising doubts about its long-term reliability and scalability. 
These technical issues have temporarily hindered its growth and have shaken the confidence of some investors and users. However, recent improvements and updates to the network aim to solve these problems, restoring confidence in the platform.
Impact of reduced transaction fees
If Solana were to surpass Ethereum in terms of transaction fees, it could attract a significantly larger number of developers and projects.
This shift would not only increase the volume of transactions on the Solana network, but could also positively influence the value of its native token, SOL.
Furthermore, a reduction in fees could further democratize access to DeFi applications, making them available to a wider audience that may currently be discouraged by high fees on Ethereum.
Surpassing Ethereum will not be an easy task for Solana, given Ethereum’s vast user base and its extremely active developer community. 
Furthermore, the upcoming update of Ethereum, known as Ethereum 2.0, aims to solve many of its current issues related to scalability and transaction costs. 
However, temporary success in terms of lower transaction fees could give Solana the necessary advantage to solidify its position as a credible alternative to Ethereum in the long term.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Solana’s potential superiority over Ethereum in terms of transaction fees represents a significant turning point. If Solana manages to maintain lower transaction costs, it could not only attract a new wave of developers and users, but also consolidate its position as a valid alternative to Ethereum. 
This evolution highlights the continuous innovation in the field of blockchain and the need for existing platforms to adapt in order to remain competitive. However, the success of Solana will depend on its ability to overcome past technical challenges and build a stable and secure network. 
In a market that rewards both innovation and technical robustness, Solana has the opportunity to redefine the cryptocurrency landscape and demonstrate its value as a potential “Ethereum-killer” in the long term.

Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) Will Explode 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token. 




ANDTATE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Andrew Tate Coin.



Currently, Andrew Tate Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. 



To buy ANDTATE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Andrew Tate Coin by entering its contract address – Cp7qyqdzXAqF7fqKXzS8LwTE7JQvh2V3vYGnDdx6j4ii – in the receiving field.




ANDTATE currently has a market cap of just under $20,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. 



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Consequence of the SEC Lawsuit: Ripple (XRP) Becomes Top-Trending Cryptocurrency


																TL;DR

XRP saw increased discussion rate, spurred by the SEC’s criticism of its upcoming stablecoin.
The asset has been quite popular in the past few years due to the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and America’s securities regulator.


The Top 10 Club
The market intelligence platform – Santiment – presented the top 10 cryptocurrencies that have been involved in the most discussions lately. The first place belongs to the popular privacy token – Monero (XMR) – due to the disclosure that the peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform LocalMonero halted operations. 
“Monero is being discussed at an abnormally high rate due to the announcement that LocalMonero is sunsetting as governments continue cracking down on XMR and other privacy focused assets,” the platform stated.
The second spot was occupied by Ripple’s XRP. The token’s popularity surged following the latest bashing manifest from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which labeled the company’s upcoming stablecoin an “unregistered crypto asset.”
The largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) followed next, while Ethena (USDe) rounded up the top 5 list.
SuperVerse (SUPER), Chia (XCH), Kaspa (KAS), IDEX (IDEX), and Celsius Network (CEL) are the other coins included in Santiment’s ranking.




XRP on the Spotlight for Another Reason
The seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been a top-trending topic for many years mainly because of the Ripple v SEC lawsuit, which is centered on its classification.
It often experiences significant volatility following important developments surrounding the case. For example, XRP’s price exploded by over 70% in a matter of hours after Ripple’s first partial court victory in 2023.
The legal spat entered its trial phase in April this year, with many industry participants expecting an impressive rally for the asset in the event of a decisive win for the firm. Those willing to dive deeper into the specifics of the lawsuit and its potential impact on XRP, feel free to take a look at our dedicated video below:

Binance denies reports of DWF Labs market manipulation

Binance has denied the latest allegations surrounding alleged market manipulation from DWF Labs.Allegations over DWF Labs’s alleged market manipulation have reemerged. An anonymous source claiming to be a former Binance insider said that Binance investigators uncovered $300 million worth of wash trading from DWF during 2023, according to a May 9 WSJ report.When asked about the market manipulation incident, Binance denied the reports. A Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph:“Binance emphatically rejects any assertion that its market surveillance program has permitted market manipulation on our platform. We have a robust market surveillance framework that identifies and takes action against market abuse. Any users that breach our terms of use are off-boarded; we do not tolerate market abuse.”According to the WSJ report, DWF Labs’ manipulated the price of the Yield Guild Game (YGG) token and at least six other cryptocurrencies last year. However, Binance said that its surveillance program would make this impossible.Binance is actively banning traders that showcase signs of market manipulation, a spokesperson told Cointelegraph:“Over the last three years, we have offboarded nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of more than $2.5 trillion for violating our terms of use.”Investigating potential market manipulation is a top priority for Binance, the world's largest exchange, which is also evidenced by independent investigations, Binance's spokesperson added:"A recent independent investigation from Inca Digital into Binance’s market surveillance practices validates the effectiveness of our approach, finding 'minimal signs of anomalous trading activities.'"Related: Public blockchain ledgers ‘not fit for purpose,’ says JPMorgan execDWF Labs, a Web3 investment and market-making firm, was first hit by market manipulation allegations last September after high-volume on-chain activity raised the eyebrows of crypto investors.Wintermute, an algorithmic trading firm and market maker, was among the first companies to accuse DWF Labs of crypto market manipulation. During a September interview at Token2049, Wintermute co-founder Yoann Turpin said that DWF Labs “are not market makers in our sense” and confuse users because they “declare what are essentially [over-the-counter] trades as investments.”Andrei Grachev, the co-founder of DWF Labs, has strongly denied the allegations.Related: Trader loses 7-figure sum due to 0L Network hard fork

“The Way Gensler Runs the SEC, Is Like He’s Invited You To Play Baseball, but No One Knows the Rules”, Says Veteran Crypto Investor | Cryptoglobe


                                
Recently, Alex Svanevik, CEO of Nansen, and veteran crypto investor Adam Cochran voiced their concerns on social media platform X regarding the current regulatory climate under U.S. SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Their analogies paint a vivid picture of what many in the crypto community perceive as arbitrary and opaque regulatory enforcement.



Alex Svanevik likened the SEC’s regulatory approach to a road with no speed signs, where Gary Gensler plays the role of a capricious traffic officer who issues speeding tickets at whim. This analogy underscores a common complaint among crypto businesses and enthusiasts: the lack of clear guidelines. Just as drivers on a road without signs would be uncertain about the speed limit, crypto companies operate in an environment where the rules seem unclear and enforcement unpredictable. Svanevik’s critique suggests a need for clearer regulatory signs to guide market participants.



Adam Cochran offered a more elaborate scenario, comparing Gensler’s management of the SEC to a disorganized baseball game where the rules are not only unclear but seemingly subject to the whims of the umpire, Gensler himself. In Cochran’s metaphor, Gensler invites players to a game, encourages them to ask about the rules, but then refuses to clarify them. This leads to arbitrary enforcement, as illustrated by Gensler punishing players unpredictably, sometimes violently with a baseball bat, for actions they believed were within the rules.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Cochran’s narrative escalates with Gensler punishing successful players and threatening them, showing favoritism to a seemingly compliant but inept team (“Prometheus”), and ultimately abandoning the game when faced with challenges. This portrayal taps into deeper industry frustrations over perceived inequities and the erratic application of regulations, which Cochran suggests could stifle innovation and fairness in the crypto sector.



Both analogies reflect a broader sentiment within the crypto community that the SEC, under Gensler’s leadership, has failed to provide the necessary regulatory clarity that is crucial for the healthy development of the cryptocurrency market. These criticisms highlight a desire for regulation that is not only clear and fair but also constructively engages with industry advancements and challenges.

The rise and fall of LocalMonero | Protos


The co-founder of LocalMonero, Alex Daneo, announced on Reddit that he will be ceasing operations after almost 7 years. Like the also-defunct LocalBitcoins service for bitcoin (BTC), LocalMonero helped facilitate peer-to-peer trading of monero (XMR), a private-by-default cryptocurrency. Daneo cited “internal and external factors” that made it difficult to sustain LocalMonero’s operations.
Most people in the crypto industry interpreted those “factors” to be recent news developments: namely the criminal indictment of Samourai Wallet’s co-founders, and a public service announcement about non-KYC crypto money transmitters from the FBI. Those events sent a clear message: “Beware of financial services that do not ask for KYC information including name, date of birth, address, and ID before allowing you to send or receive money or cryptocurrency.”
Similarly to LocalMonero, the FBI-seized Samourai Wallet was a service for privacy-conscious users to swap money with ties to their identity for anonymized crypto assets. Although LocalMonero emphasized cash fiat for XMR, whereas Samourai was mostly BTC-for-BTC mixing, the primary value proposition was similar. Both services attracted users who wanted to pay a small fee to anonymize their money.
In the wake of those dual announcements by the US Justice Department and FBI, many privacy services and coin mixers have suspended operations. 

Phoenix Wallet, a Bitcoin Lightning and privacy service, suspended key operations.
Wasabi, Samourai’s European competitor, terminated its coinjoin coordinator.
AgoraDesk, also co-founded by Alex Daneo, is winding down operations.
Kraken recently ceased delisted monero in Ireland and Belgium.

The LocalMonero team will spend the next six months winding down operations. Users will allegedly have until November 7, 2024 to withdraw their funds.

Unknown volume, unknown impact of LocalMonero shutdown
Because LocalMonero merely facilitated meetups between buyers and sellers interested in peer-to-peer trades, it is difficult to find trading volumes facilitated by LocalMonero. Most actual transactions of XMR for cash probably took place off the platform entirely.
Because of its purposeful opacity, ranking websites CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko never bothered to add LocalMonero to its leaderboard of crypto exchanges – even though it was a real, mostly fiat-for-crypto exchange.
There is some circumstantial evidence that the volume was quite low at times. Five years ago, one user mentioned on Reddit that no monero seller was available on the site at that time.
In the early days, LocalMonero seemed to have a promising future. Alex announced the addition of a Tor single onion service early in LocalMonero’s existence. It also added an I2P domain and B32 I2P domain at around the same time. Generally speaking, it received good reviews from users. One user called it “easier than Coinbase.”
Users still have time to wrap up their activities and withdraw funds. LocalMonero is pulling the plug for good on November 7, 2024.

Stablecoins on Bitcoin coming soon, says Lightning Labs CEO

Stablecoins running on Bitcoin are edging closer to reality through new functionality built by Lightning Labs using the network’s Taproot upgrade implemented in late 2021.Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, unpacked the latest development from the Bitcoin development firm at FT Live’s Crypto and Digital Assets summit in London. The firm's co-founder also gave an eloquent explainer of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network to an audience of traditional finance players.Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark on stage at FT Live: Source: Gareth JenkinsonLightning Labs’ Taproot Assets protocol is building functionality to bring stablecoins and tokenized assets to Bitcoin. According to Stark, developers have made significant headway toward this goal, culminating in the testing of transactions on Lightning:“We released an early part of the code in October and recently demoed the first-ever transaction on Lightning of an asset. The idea is to have crypto dollars and stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain.”Stark added that traditionally, these digital assets have operated on other blockchains that have suffered from high fees and other issues. She argues that Bitcoin’s network is perhaps best placed to facilitate the use of stablecoins because it “is the most secure and decentralized” blockchain.Bitcoin and stablecoins value as a store of valueStark went on to discuss the merits of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins as a store of value, especially in nations grappling with inflation issues and devaluing fiat currencies.The Lightning Labs CEO said stablecoin adoption has grown dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic, with users largely being based in emerging markets.“The stickiest users have been those looking for a stable store of value. In some cases, they’re using Bitcoin. In other cases, they’re using stablecoins, and in some cases, it’s a combination of both,” Stark explained.Related: What is the Bitcoin Lightning Network, and how does it work?The two largest stablecoin players, Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), hold more United States Treasury bonds combined than major nations like Germany and South Korea. Stark said this is an intriguing fact given that end users don’t benefit from the interest from holding stablecoins.For those in countries grappling with hyperinflation or precarious economic environments, the choice of holding a stablecoin is driven by the need for a store of value.Lightning-powered stablecoins will be superiorGiven the significant growth in value of the stablecoin market, Stark said there is a need for the infrastructure to enable the issuance of stablecoins and real world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.“That’s why we’re building this protocol, this technology right now. We’re not issuing assets, we’re building the rails. Asset issuers will use our technology to issue real-world tokenized assets,” Stark explained.Related: Coinbase integrates Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactionsThe CEO added that financial institutions could issue gold assets, stablecoins and other fiat-backed assets on Bitcoin and then transact over the Lightning Network. Perhaps most telling was the relative cost compared to other blockchains and conventional traditional finance systems which Stark highlighted:“If you look at Visa where fees in the U.S. can be upward of 3%, or even or 1% the fees, transacting with stablecoins on Lightning can be dramatically lower, a cent or less than that.”Stark added that this could competitively enable people to transact globally at far lower rates than through traditional networks.

Bitcoin Struggles with Range Lows Amid Post-Halving Market Boredom



                    

Bitcoin‘s price experienced a test of its range lows on May 8, with the cryptocurrency sector marked by a general sentiment of “boredom” following the recent halving event. 



The price of Bitcoin (BTC) sagged towards $62,000 during the Asia session, as data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed. 




This marked a retreat from a brief rebound that had seen BTC surpass $65,500 just days before, followed by a 5% retracement that entrenched it within a trading range established prior to the weekend.



The closing price for the day hovered around $62,300, positioning BTC/USD perilously close to forfeiting more of its recent gains. 



According to J. A. Maartunn, a CryptoQuant analyst, “Any daily close below $62,100 or prolonged inactivity counts as a stop-loss,” highlighting the precarious position of the market.




Michaël van de Poppe, CEO of MNTrading, voiced his frustration over the stagnant market movement since the halving in mid-April, stating, “Bitcoin slowly proceeds towards the lower boundaries of the range for a test of support,” and added, “After that, it seems likely we’ll continue the upwards grind.

“Boredom has started since the Bitcoin halving took place.”



The commentary was mirrored by fellow trader Moustache, who remained optimistic about future prospects, noting that these movements are typical precursors to a more substantial rally. 




“The last dips before $BTC starts the next leg imo,” he observed, likening the current patterns to those seen in 2017 and 2020.



“Concurrently, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector for cryptocurrencies experienced a mix of reactions. 



Following the report of significant inflows exceeding $500 million in previous days, Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded a day of net outflows on May 7, totaling $15.7 million. 



This was a stark contrast and highlighted the volatility and uncertainty prevailing in the market. 



Furthermore, Grayscale, a major player in the space, retracted plans for an Ether futures ETF product, signaling potential shifts in strategic focus or market sentiment.



These developments illustrate the complex dynamics at play in the cryptocurrency markets, where investor sentiment can quickly shift, influenced by regulatory actions, market movements, or broader economic factors.

Starknet to bring on AI agents that can carry out on-chain activity

Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Starknet will soon allow artificial intelligence (AI) agents on its blockchain that can autonomously perform on-chain activities for users, such as optimizing yield and re-allocating portfolios.Giza — a firm aiming to bring AI to blockchains — raised $3 million in a pre-seed round led by CoinFund in July 2023 and is spearheading the effort. Co-founder Renç Korzay told Cointelegraph that AI agents would be deployed on Starknet by the end of June, with other chains to follow.Korzay said the agents could take over four activities, the first being yield aggregating — finding “where the highest return is and depositing to different yield avenues.”Later releases will see the AI agents also be a “robo-advisor and figure out the best portfolio allocation for a user given their risk appetite,” said Korzay.In the beta phase, the Giza team will be auditing and approving agent strategies to ensure security. In the future, Agents will become completely permissionless through the Giza Protocol, which will provide both cryptographic and cryptoeconomic security to ensure a trust-minimized exchange between developers and users.They can also autonomously provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges or make leveraged price bets and “predict price movements,” adjusting crypto holdings “based on the strategy set by the user,” he added. The yield-optimizing AI agents will be the first to deploy, with the other types to follow, according to a May 9 press release shared with Cointelegraph.It’s billed as “low-cost and low-computation,” and it can max out returns by buying or selling assets so they stay at the same weighting in a portfolio on lending platforms that it can directly use and sign off on transactions.“As all accounts on Starknet are smart contracts — via the network’s native account abstraction features — this allows for proofs to be verified directly within the contract,” Giza explained. Three-month Starknet active users chart. March saw activity spike as it conducted a token airdrop. Source: StarkscanThe AI models are built with the Starknet programming language Cairo and “verify complex computations” using Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge and zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) created by Starknet development firm StarkWare.ZK-proofs allow for information to be shared and authenticated while maintaining user privacy.Related: Philosopher Yuval Noah Harari warns of AI’s risks in financeGiza co-founder Cem Dagdelen said in a statement the company expects agents will “become the new application layer for Web3, abstracting away smart contract risks and complexities from users.”However, the agents aren’t limited to just crypto and blockchain. According to Giza, they can also help “highly regulated sectors” cut oversight costs by using models to check “the validity of their outputs.”Ava Labs founder Emin Gün Sirer said at a recent blockchain conference he thinks AI-backed smart contract coding is five to 10 years away and, when it arrives, could “onboard billions of new [blockchain] users.”Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has cautioned developers that it’s “worth treading carefully” when adding AI to blockchains, saying AI can help humans understand what is happening on-chain, but it shouldn’t be tasked with enforcing smart contract rules.Magazine: How to control the AIs and incentivize the humans with crypto

EU seeks stakeholder opinions on adding crypto to 12T euro investment market

The European Union security watchdog, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), is seeking the opinion of experts on whether to add crypto to the 12 trillion euro ($12.8 trillion) investment product market.The ESMA asked industry experts for their views on whether Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) — an investment product market valued at 12 trillion euros — can gain exposure to different asset classes such as structured or leveraged loans, catastrophe bonds, emission allowances, commodities, crypto assets and unlisted equities.UCITS are a class of investment funds comprising products intended to protect and simplify investing transactions. UCITS are often comprised of mutual, exchange-traded or money market funds. EU regulations govern these funds; however, non-EU investors can also gain exposure. UCITS stakeholders have until Aug. 7 to submit their comments. If approved, UCITS would become one of the largest mainstream funds with crypto exposure. The request for expert opinions comes amid the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds in the United States and Hong Kong, with securities regulators worldwide appearing to warm up to crypto exposure in traditional investment vehicles. Related: The Runes protocol will ignite a new season for Bitcoin after the halvingWhile spot BTC ETFs are solely crypto-focused, UCITS investments are divided into numerous fund types, each with a particular asset allocation based on the fund’s risk profile. If approved, there won’t be an independent UCITS fund with 100% crypto allocation but multiple UCITS funds with a percentage allocation in crypto. EU regulations currently prohibit independent crypto-centered investment products. Thus, investors have to access them via exchange-traded notes.The European Union is known for its strict crypto regulatory policy. It is one of the first regions to introduce a complete crypto regulatory framework in the form of its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). One of the questions asked by the ESMA in the feedback is how adding specific cryptocurrencies to the framework would or wouldn’t be affected by MiCA.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

How is Litecoin a Winner? LTC Leads As Most Widely-Used Coin for Payments and Simple Transactions | Cryptopolitan

Litecoin (LTC) is fulfilling precisely the use case of its initial vision – to become a fast, cheep tool for payments. For that reason, LTC is once again the winner when it comes to just moving funds. The Litecoin network has relatively low fees, while also offering growing security through mining.Litecoin is also one of the most active coins on BitPay even in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC). Only two years ago, Litecoin made up 25% of payments on BitPay locations, extending its share since then.Litecoin is also traded on most major exchanges and can be used for moving funds between wallets. While Litecoin has rallied in the past, it also trades in a relatively predictable way, also serving as a predictable payment tool.Litecoin Seen as an Investment Wild CardLTC is currently consolidating around $81.50, surviving the last few corrections with relatively low downside. This time, LTC has not rallied to an outsized gain, but also avoided deep corrections.While LTC is convenient for spending, there are also signs of accumulation, while waiting for a bigger breakout. LTC was one of the earliest assets to go mainstream through the Grayscale funds. Currently, the funds are matching the market price, while growing their LTC reserves.BitPay Drives Litecoin AdoptionLitecoin is available on most wallets, but only some apps are active for web-based spending. BitPay facilitates the Litecoin turnover by offering ways to spend the coin within the Internet ecosystem. Gift cards and e-commerce gateways are some specific ways that BitPay makes the Litecoin option available.As of April 2024, over 37% of all Litecoin payments are going through the BitPay wallet. Trust Wallet and Exodus are also important due to their user-friendly features. These two wallets make up 45% of all LTC coin transfers. There is a small community of users still hanging onto the Litecoin Core wallet, and under 3% use Coinbase wallet.BitPay also grows the Litecoin network by connecting its owners with hundreds of merchants in its growing selection. BitPay aims to unite the crypto payment potential with the wider fintech ecosystem, finding viable use cases for its portfolio of assets. Recently, BitPay also partnered with MoonPay to add more fiat spending options.For that reason, BitPay mostly uses a small selection of assets, limiting itself to blue chip coins and some of the most common stablecoins.BitPay handled more than 341K crypto transactions for the past three months and more than 54K in April alone. BitPay connects those transactions to real-world goods and services, even though this number may be relatively low compared to overall network activity.The Litecoin community is a mix of long-term holders and active users. About 30% of the LTC supply is active in a 24-hour period.On an hourly basis, there are close to 10K transactions on average. LTC is also relatively scarce after miners produced the first 75M coins. There are about 9M coins left to produce, which will include a series of halvings every four years. Litecoin has already completed 11 years without network outages or significant attacks, proving its reliability.Due to this reason, Litecoin serves as a preferred choice for mid-range transactions, typically with a value of around 108 LTC. The network also carries multiple small transactions of around 1 LTC.In addition to LTC production, the miners are also supporting the Dogecoin (DOGE) blockchain, where the total DOGE produced is not limited.Litecoin Active Addresses Going StrongLitecoin active addresses respond to market trends. From the start of Q2, the Litecoin network has on average around 300K daily active wallets, with spikes in daily activity. On the most active day of 2024, more than 1.3M wallets were active, coinciding with peak market valuations.Another sign of network health is the mining activity. The average Litecoin hashrate went up around 30% in the past 12 months, surpassing one PetaHash per second.Litecoin’s network is profitable to mine at scale even at the current market price, offering miners highly liquid rewards.

                        Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has reiterated its bullish stance on Bitcoin, predicting a potential surge in price to $114,000 by August 2025.The forecast comes as the industry grapples with challenges such as inflation concerns, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and the escalating Middle East crisis.In its latest report, Pantera Capital revisited its analysis from November 2022, which examined Bitcoin’s past performance before and after its most recent halving event.
Pantera Uses Stock-to-Flow Model to Predict Bitcoin Price
Utilizing a stock-to-flow model, Pantera assessed the supply of Bitcoin in relation to the rate of new production, which is designed to decrease by 50% every four years during halving events.Historical data shows that Bitcoin’s price has experienced significant increases, sometimes up to 93-fold, in response to these events.By studying both pre-halving and post-halving rallies, Pantera Capital determined that, on average, prices tend to reach their peak approximately 2.6 years after halving events.Based on this analysis, the projected timeframe for Bitcoin’s potential surge aligns with August next year.While the stock-to-flow model is not an exact science, it has gained popularity within the crypto industry as a tool to evaluate the intrinsic value of Bitcoin.Pantera Capital’s forecast joins a chorus of other optimistic predictions for Bitcoin.Research firm Bernstein has set a target of $150,000 by mid-2025, while Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge Capital, envisions a price of $170,000 or higher next year. Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Thomas Lee has also expressed the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $150,000 in 2024 and even $500,000 over the next five years.
Bitcoin Sees Heightened Volatility
Bitcoin closed the week at approximately $64,000, representing a 1.4% increase from the previous week’s closing value of around $63,100.The week was marked by heightened volatility, with prices initially dipping significantly to around $56,500 on Wednesday before rebounding above $60,000 by Friday.While Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows for the fourth consecutive week, the period of outflows may have peaked, Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in a recent note.He added that trading volume for Bitcoin ETFs remained relatively steady during the week, with cumulative trading volume since inception reaching $246.6 billion.During the week alone, trading volume amounted to $10.9 billion, a 12.3% increase from the previous week.However, these figures still fall below the average trading volume of $3.1 billion since the inception of Bitcoin ETFs.“These figures suggest that the period of outflows may have peaked, with trading volumes showing signs of increase and outflows potentially stabilizing,” he wrote.Furthermore, following a four-month period of consistent outflows, Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF finally witnessed a positive shift. On Friday, May 3, the downward trajectory was reversed when GBTC experienced its first inflow of $63 million.As a result, the overall spot Bitcoin ETF market saw net positive inflows of $378.3 million after seven days of continuous outflows.The trend continued on Monday, May 6, as GBTC recorded its second inflow of $3.9 million, bringing the total inflows to $66.9 million.

Vitalik Buterin proposes multidimensional gas framework for Ethereum | Cryptopolitan

Ethereum‘s gas system, a core component for computing transaction costs, is set for a significant overhaul. Vitalik Buterin has put forth a bold proposal to introduce a multidimensional gas framework, aimed at addressing the current system’s limitations.The Current Gas System and Its ChallengesVitalik told us that Ethereum currently uses a unified gas system where various computational efforts—like processing, storage operations, data transmission, and cryptographic proofs—are all quantified under the single metric of “gas.”Source: Vitalik ButerinFor instance, a typical transaction might cost 47,085 gas, broken down into base costs, data inclusion, storage interactions, and execution efforts. Although this system simplifies market operations and fee calculations, it merges fundamentally different types of resources, which can be problematic.Vitalik explained that this blending leads to inefficiencies because it treats distinct network resources as if they were interchangeable. This misconception can result in the network either rejecting safe transaction blocks or accepting potentially harmful ones due to inappropriate gas limit settings. He believes that moving to a multidimensional gas model could better represent the true limits and capabilities of the network, potentially boosting throughput by not oversimplifying the resource interchangeability.Introducing Multidimensional GasThe concept of multidimensional gas isn’t entirely new, as Vitalik highlighted its active implementation with EIP-4844. This enhancement introduces “blobs” for rollup data, which significantly lowers transaction costs on layer 2 solutions. By allowing separate caps and fees for data and computation, Ethereum can handle more substantial and complex operations without compromising network integrity.Vitalik told us about the challenges of large block sizes and their impact on Ethereum’s scalability. He mentioned that before the recent reforms, even a minor reduction in data costs could dangerously increase the maximum block size, straining the network. The introduction of blobs addresses this by setting distinct limits and costs for different types of data, which has already made operations like rollups far cheaper and increased transaction volumes significantly.The Future of Ethereum’s Gas SystemLooking ahead, Vitalik believes the next big challenge will be integrating stateless clients, which require a network to process transactions without storing every piece of state data on every node. This approach would benefit greatly from a more refined gas model where different types of data and operations are priced according to their actual demands on the system.However, the real potential for a multidimensional gas system lies in its flexibility to manage different network resources independently. For example, state growth could be managed under its pricing model, distinct from transaction processing or data storage, allowing the network to adapt more dynamically to changing demands.Vitalik is optimistic about the benefits of this system but recognizes the complexities involved, especially when it comes to transaction execution and sub-calls within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Each type of transaction could potentially require its gas metrics, complicating the design and execution of smart contracts.Despite these challenges, he is convinced that the advantages—particularly in terms of scalability and efficiency—justify the effort. With careful implementation, a multidimensional gas system could make Ethereum more robust and flexible, better suited to meet the demands of its diverse user base.

Vitalik Unveils Multidimensional Gas Pricing for Ethereum: What It Means for User | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a blog post dated May 9, 2024, Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin introduced an innovative concept to address efficiency issues within Ethereum’s transaction processing system. His proposal revolves around the idea of “multidimensional gas pricing,” which aims to optimize how Ethereum manages and prices computational tasks.



Simplifying Ethereum’s Gas Mechanism



In Ethereum, “gas” refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations like transactions and smart contracts. Traditionally, Ethereum has used a single-dimensional gas system where various types of computational efforts—such as executing commands, storing data, and handling complex cryptographic proofs—are cumulatively priced under one umbrella of “gas cost.”



The Problem with Single-Dimensional Gas



Buterin points out that this single-dimensional approach has a significant drawback: it oversimplifies how different resources are consumed on the Ethereum network. For instance, storing data might have a different impact on the network compared to executing a transaction. Treating these diverse activities as equivalent in terms of resource consumption can lead to inefficiencies and potential security risks. For example, if the network underestimates the resources needed for a transaction type, it could either reject safe transactions or accept potentially harmful ones.



Introducing Multidimensional Gas Pricing







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

To tackle this, Buterin proposes a system where gas is no longer a single entity but split into multiple dimensions—each representing a specific type of resource usage. This approach, already partly implemented in Ethereum’s EIP-4844 upgrade, allows for more accurate and fair pricing of the varied demands placed on Ethereum’s infrastructure.



Practical Applications and Implications



One practical manifestation of this idea is the introduction of “blobs” for rollups (layer 2 scaling solutions that help Ethereum scale by handling transactions off the main chain). These blobs are priced separately from regular transaction gas and have their limits, making rollup transactions significantly cheaper and more efficient. The differentiation in pricing helps in managing network demands more effectively without compromising the throughput.



What This Means for Ethereum Users



For everyday users and developers, this change means that transactions could become cheaper and the network more robust against spam and attacks. Developers, in particular, might need to rethink how they design their applications to optimize for the different types of gas costs.



The Future of Ethereum’s Gas System



Looking ahead, Buterin envisions expanding this multidimensional approach to other areas of Ethereum’s operation, such as storage. This could involve setting separate limits and prices for different types of data storage, potentially increasing the overall efficiency and security of the network.

Binance fires investigator for exposing market manipulation with DWF Labs â WSJ - Crypto Briefing




Binance has reportedly fired a member of its market-surveillance team who uncovered evidence of market manipulation by DWF Labs, one of the exchange’s high-profile clients.According to a Wall Street Journal report, the dismissed employee and his colleagues had identified instances of pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading by “VIP” clients, including DWF Labs.The market-surveillance team, which was hired to identify signs of market manipulation and other illicit activities as part of Binance’s efforts to improve its compliance practices, found that “VIP” clients – those trading more than $100 million per month – were engaging in activities prohibited by Binance’s terms and conditions.DWF Labs, a prolific investor in crypto projects that emerged in early 2023, was reportedly making over $4 billion in monthly trades on the exchange.Binance has denied the claims, stating that it rejected allegations of permitting market manipulation and that the employee was dismissed after an inquiry found the accusations against the client were not “fully substantiated.”“Binance emphatically rejects any assertion that its market surveillance program has permitted market manipulation on our platform,” a spokesperson from the exchange said.DWF Labs also responded to the article, claiming that the allegations were “unfounded and distort the facts.”“It has come to our attention that a recent article contains many allegations that we believe to be unfounded and that do not accurately represent our ethical business practices,” DWF Labs said in an announcement through its Telegram channel.The investigators submitted a report alleging that DWF Labs had manipulated the prices of several tokens through $300 million worth of wash trades in 2023. However, Binance determined that there was insufficient evidence of market abuse, the WSJ report states.A specific token linked to Web3 gaming, YGG, was named alongside six other tokens. YGG is a token launched by Yield Guild Games, a Web3 firm which has key leadership from the Philippines, where Binance is currently banned.A recent statement from Binance further said that it was “unaware” of the documents, arguing that if these allegations were “very concerning” if proven to be true. The exchange’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, has been sentenced to four months in prison after the exchange was embroiled in a series of legal battles.

Lawyer Questions Claims That Ripple’s ODL Agreement Satisfies The Howey Test


							

Bill Morgan has questioned the claim that Ripple’s ODL agreement satisfies the Howey Test.



Morgan asked how and where the expectation of profit arose from the contract.



According to Morgan, the reviewed agreement did not involve a transfer of title in XRP or a sale.




Renowned crypto lawyer Bill Morgan has questioned the claim that Ripple’s ODL agreement satisfies the Howey Test. In a recent post on X, the prominent crypto personality shared his findings from the 2020 ODL contract between Ripple and an Australian ODL customer. After his review, Morgan asked how and where the expectation of profit arose from the contract.







Following his review, Morgan highlighted some of the features he discovered in the contract. He noted that the contract involved XRP transfer into the purchaser’s agreed account with Bitstamp or another account and held on bailment, which the customer will hold as a bailee. The crypto lawyer emphasized the transaction was a transfer and not a transfer of title in the XRP or a sale,  describing it as “Committed XRP.”



Morgan also noted that the transaction becomes a sale once the ODL customer withdraws XRP from the bailment account. He explained that the withdrawal is converted into a  USD purchase price at a market rate managed by an automated software system. Hence, upon withdrawal of the XRP, the ODL customer is deemed to have purchased XRP from the Ripple company at the market rate.









According to Morgan, the contract terms constrain the ODL customer from purchasing the Committed XRP for investment purposes or with an expectation of profit. The customer shall only use the Committed XRP for an ODL transaction on an exchange or through a party approved for ODL.  



Morgan further noted that breaching the agreement term, which Ripple has the right to monitor, can result in the termination of the agreement and the return to Ripple of all unpurchased XRP in the bailment account.

SEC Chair Warns ‘Many’ Crypto Assets Are Securities, Says Investors Are Not Getting Required Disclosures - The Daily Hodl


								U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler thinks American crypto investors aren’t receiving enough information about most digital assets.
The SEC recently sent out a Wells Notice to Robinhood’s crypto arm, alerting the retail trading giant that it’s planning to pursue legal action against them.










In a recent interview with CNBC, Gensler says he can’t speak on specific companies but views a significant portion of the crypto sector as non-compliant with securities laws.
“The field of crypto assets, without prejudging any one of them, many of those tokens are securities under the law of the land as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. So we follow that law, and you, the investors, are not getting the required or needed disclosures about those assets.”
Robinhood chief executive Vlad Tenev took to X earlier this week to decry the SEC’s planned action against Robinhood Crypto.
“Over the last three years, we’ve reached a state of regulatory onslaught that is harmful to American companies and consumers.
The SEC’s continued attack on crypto, coupled with recent rule proposals like the one related to predictive data analytics, mark yet another improper attempt by the administrative state to stifle innovation.”
In his new interview, Gensler also avoided answering a question about whether Ethereum (ETH) is a commodity or a security and instead spoke about the sector in broad terms.
“To me, the fundamental question is, ‘How do we ensure the American investor is protected?’ And right now, they’re not getting their required or needed disclosures, and the intermediaries in the center of this rather centralized market generally are conflicted in doing things we would never allow the New York Stock Exchange to do. The New York Stock Exchange is not allowed to trade against the investors.”

JPMorgan Analysts Optimistic About Future Approval Of Spot Ether ETFs Despite Regulatory Hurdles - Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) - Benzinga

In light of recent regulatory actions, JPMorgan analysts remain confident that the SEC's scrutiny of Robinhood HOOD Crypto will not impede the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.What Happened: This perspective comes even as the retail brokerage faces potential enforcement from the SEC for its dealings in what are alleged to be unregistered securities, The Block reported.Earlier this week, Robinhood announced that it had received a Wells notice from the SEC, which suggests impending enforcement actions related to its cryptocurrency operations. Robinhood Crypto allows trading in a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, among others. According to Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team at JPMorgan, this development reflects ongoing efforts by the SEC to assert that most cryptocurrencies, with the possible exceptions of Bitcoin and Ether, should be regulated as securities.“In our opinion, it does not look like the Wells notice should pose an obstacle to an eventual approval by the SEC of spot Ethereum ETFs, although perhaps not as soon as this month,” stated Panigirtzoglou. He further noted that similar to prior approvals for Bitcoin BTC/USD related financial products, the path for Ethereum might follow a similar trajectory, potentially involving legal challenges if initial SEC approvals are denied.Also Read: ‘Who Do I Sue?’ JPMorgan Exec Sees Public Blockchains As Inadequate For Large TransactionsRegarding the specific implications of the Wells notice on Ethereum ETH/USD, Panigirtzoglou clarified, “No, we don’t think it is implied by the Wells notice to Robinhood. Robinhood does not only facilitate trading on Bitcoin and Ethereum but also on 13 further tokens.Eventually, the status of Ethereum is likely to be determined by legislation and as we argued previously (and as it was revealed in Hinman’s papers last June) there might be an eventually ‘middle’ category for Ethereum, neither commodity nor security but something in between.”The market’s reaction to potential delays in the approval of a spot Ether ETF seems muted, as evidenced by the ongoing discount in the net asset value of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.The analysts believe that the market has tempered its expectations for immediate regulatory approvals.In a strategic shift, Grayscale withdrew its application for an ether futures ETF, which according to Panigirtzoglou, might indicate a preference to focus on converting its existing Ethereum trust into a spot ETF. This move is seen as part of a broader strategy to align with potential regulatory outcomes, with key decisions expected by May 23.What’s Next: As the digital asset sector continues to evolve, the implications of these regulatory developments will be a key topic at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This event will offer critical insights into how companies and investors can navigate the complex regulatory landscape, and what the future holds for mainstream cryptocurrency products such as Ethereum ETFs.Read Next: Bitcoin ETF Issuer VanEck Launches ‘MEMECOIN’ Index, Includes DOGE, SHIB And 4 More Meme CoinsImage: Shutterstock

Why is Celsius (CEL) Rising Post-Bankruptcy? 94% of Tokens Sent to Burn Address | Cryptopolitan

Celsius (CEL) decreased its supply by 94% at the end of April, sending 94% of outstanding tokens to a burn address. The token burn surprised the markets, rallying from $0.14 to $0.96 after the burn was finally noticed. The past week was marked by a series of CEL rallies, reaching a peak at $0.98.Celsius destroyed 94% of its supply in a single transaction as part of its bankruptcy procedure. In the past year, Celsius divested most of its assets, returning loan collaterals and shrinking its crypto lending ecosystem. Celsius took back the tokens from its whole ecosystem on October 12, 2023, and held them until the burn transaction.Why Did Celsius Burn Tokens?This is not the first token burn for Celsius. The platform started burns in October 2021, close to the peak of the bull market. The main goal was to decrease supply and make CEL more valuable. After the bankruptcy, Celsius still controlled 652.2M tokens, which it could burn. The token was not needed, since it was not tied to lending and was not used for rewards. The decision to burn was part of the bankruptcy settlement and involved only tokens that Celsius controlled directly. The burn apparently did not affect the ability to trade or use all remaining tokens.Why is CEL Rising: Irrational Trading, Risky ShortingThe rise of CEL is entirely irrational, as Celsius has not announced a renewal of the project. The most probable reason is that CEL is now turning into a meme token and new buyers are just trying to see how high it can trade. More than 78% of CEL activity is concentrated on OKX and Gate.IO, the last two exchanges to keep some of the token balance. After restructuring, only a few entities own actual CEL tokens and only those two exchanges have pairings with USDT and are capable of providing some liquidity. Even decentralized markets have completely abandoned CEL. Celsius Has No Control Over Remaining TokensWhat is more curious is that the CEL token contract itself is interacting with addresses. Transactions are coming in from OKX and Gate.IO wallets, while small batches of tokens are sent to Uniswap V3 to trade the CEL/WETH liquidity pair. Celsius has not announced a return to operations. However, in the months after the bankruptcy, CEL acquired small listings on Bilaxy exchange and other markets. Those listings are not related to Celsius, and may represent only pure risk-taking by traders.The Ethereum token contract shows the new supply is just above 40M tokens, so CEL is now treated as a brand new scarce asset. CEL is also closely watched by traders for opportunities to short, in case the price reverts to the baseline.CEL is also not rising by itself. In the past week, the practically useless token FTX (FTT) also went through another vertical rally. FTT had short-term rallies as high as $5, then went vertical in the past week before crashing again. FTT slid from a short-term peak above $2.20 to its current level of $1.52.

President Biden to veto regulated crypto custody legislation


In a recent statement from the Executive Office of the United States President Joe Biden, the President’s Administration announced that he would veto legislation enabling highly regulated financial firms to act as custodians for cryptocurrencies.
Specifically, the Administration of the incumbent US President voiced its strong opposition to the passage of House Joint Resolution (H.J. Res.) 109, adding that President Biden would veto it if he were to see it, according to the document from May 8.

Opposing arguments
Indeed, listing the reasons for the President’s opposition to this legislation, the statement said that it would interfere with the work of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and invalidate the regulations that the Administration deemed more valuable:



“[It] would disrupt the [SEC’s] work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system [and] would invalidate SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which reflects considered SEC staff views regarding the accounting obligations of certain firms that safeguard crypto-assets.”

On top of that, the Administration said that the SAB 121 was a “response to demonstrated technological, legal, and regulatory risks that have caused substantial losses to consumers,” as well as adding that such legislation if adopted, could threaten financial stability:

“By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, it could also inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto-assets, including financial stability. Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.”

Rival’s crypto-friendly stance
Meanwhile, such opposition to crypto-friendly laws has earned the current US President (more) criticism, including from his rival in the presidential race and former US President, Donald Trump, who recently mocked Biden for, as he believes, not understanding the crypto industry.
At the same time, Trump contrasted Joe Biden’s crypto views to his own, according to which he was “fine with it,” whereas the Democratic Party and the SEC was “very much against it,”  as he told his supporters at an exclusive dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

Another Country Is Introducing Strict Rules on Cryptocurrency Regulations to Prevent Money Laundering! - Bitcoin Sistemi


New measures targeting cryptocurrency service providers have been adopted in Taiwan, aiming to strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and combat illicit financial activities.
Taiwan Enforces Stricter Regulations on Cryptocurrency Services by Enforcing Anti-Money Laundering Measures
According to a recent report by ABMEDIA, failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including imprisonment for up to two years.


Under newly enacted regulations, any cryptocurrency service provider operating within Taiwan's jurisdiction must complete anti-money laundering registration.
Failure to comply with this requirement not only exposes providers to legal liability but also threatens the integrity of the financial system by potentially facilitating illegal transactions.






Additionally, people who are found to be using virtual asset accounts for money laundering purposes will be subject to strict penalties under the new regulations.
ABMEDIA's report highlights the Taiwanese government's determination to crack down on financial crimes associated with cryptocurrencies, highlighting that offenders could face prison sentences of six months to five years.


The implementation of these stringent measures underscores Taiwan's proactive approach to regulating the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry.
By implementing strong AML requirements, authorities are trying to reduce the risks posed by digital assets and ensure compliance with international standards aimed at combating financial crimes.

Bitcoin Whales Lose Interest, Is This A Precursor For A Crash To $50,000?


                            Movement and accumulation from crypto whales are two of the catalysts for Bitcoin price increases. Although major whales are still buying the dip, on-chain data indicates a general waning accumulation momentum which suggests their conviction might actually be waning. 
According to IntoTheBlock, an on-chain analytics firm, Bitcoin whale accumulation volumes have declined substantially in each buying cycle over the past month. This decline in whale accumulation could be worrying for investors, especially as the price of Bitcoin is now trying to hold above $60,000.
Whale Appetite For Bitcoin Dips According To On-Chain Data
Whales, or large investors holding over 1,000 BTC, have accumulated strongly since the beginning of the year, especially during market dips. This accumulation has largely helped to keep Bitcoin in bullish sentiment and prevented huge price declines. However, IntoTheBlock recently revealed an interesting pattern between these whale wallets in each accumulation phase. 

The largest accumulation occurred between March 5 and March 7, when these wallets acquired over 120,000 BTC. Every succeeding price dip has, however, seen less accumulation than the one before it. Particularly, Bitcoin’s recent dip to $56,000 failed to attract notable whale accumulation. This drop in buying and selling activity indicates whales may have lost some interest or appetite for accumulating more Bitcoin in the short term.

Precursor For A Crash To $50,000?
The waning conviction among Bitcoin whales has raised the question of whether Bitcoin could reverse back into a full bearish momentum. These concerns are particularly valid, considering some analysts are of the notion that Bitcoin might’ve reached its peak in this cycle. 
As IntoTheBlock noted, prices have increased shortly following every accumulation this year. While the lower whale buying activity could stall price increases in the short term, it is not a sure sign that Bitcoin is headed for a major price crash. However, if the trend continues for several more months, it could signal lower demand and a weakening bull market.

According to the “In/Out Of Money Metric”, there is still a strong resistance volume between $59,000 and $61,000. A drop below this range again would push 552,220 addresses into losses. In fact, while a drop to his level would be painful for many holders, most crypto analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,488. The crypto recently rebounded around $57,500 and is up by 7.4% in the past seven days. According to analyst Marco Johanning, $57,000 is an important support level for Bitcoin. He noted that while a break below $57,000 could lead to further declines into $52,000, the crypto market is still very bullish for Bitcoin.

Will the $2B Token Release Result in a Bear Market?


							

The next two months are expected to witness a massive $2 billion token unlock of various altcoins.



10x Research warns that the token release will result in an impending bear market.



The platform asserts that the token unlock will limit the breadth and duration of the prevailing bull market.




A prominent crypto analytics platform, 10x Research, recently warned against an impending bear market driven by the $2 billion token unlocks in the upcoming days. The platform asserted that the current bull market is likely to stay shorter and unlikely to culminate in a broad altcoin rally.







Reportedly, the crypto market is expected to witness a massive unlock of various altcoins in the next two months. For instance, tokens like Aptos (APT), Starkware (STRK), and Arbitrum (ARB) are set to unleash $97 million, $79 million, and $94 million tokens, respectively. In addition, Immutable X releases $53 million IMX tokens while Avalanche and Optimism are set to unlock $330 million AVAX and $64 million OP, respectively.



Tokens like SUI, ENA, ALT, and XAI are also poised to see large unlock events, with Sui releasing $1 billion tokens, Ethena $48 million, ALT $171 million, and XAI $135 million. Reflecting on the potential impact of the events, 10x Research stated, “Rapid succession of nearly $2 billion of token unlocks during the next ten weeks could lower the market for altcoins.”



Further, the analysts spotted “significant constraints” in the industry’s growth potential despite remarkable developments and the high trading volumes of more than $100 billion. Forecasting the potential challenges the market is poised to face, the platform stated that the prevailing bull run will have a limited “breadth and duration.”









In a K33 Research article, analyst Vetle Lunde hinted at the distribution of $11 billion Bitcoin (BTC) to the Gemini Earn program and Mt.Gox creditors. He posited, “The next months are rigged to see waves of good old crypto FUD.”

                        Rwanda is studying the feasibility of adopting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), exploring benefits, risks and practicalities of implementing a retail CBDC.The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) released a feasibility report on Wednesday, assessing possible opportunities for a CBDC in Rwanda. The central bank is adopting latest innovative technologies, and the CBDC is curated to local norms and conditions.“The feasibility study finds that there are opportunities for improvements in the payments landscape of Rwanda,” the report read. “The identified Sweet Spots are well-positioned to address these opportunities.”The bank pointed to four “sweet spots” for CBDC “based on stronger evidence and higher certainty of achievability than the other opportunities.”This includes increasing resilience against power or network outages, improving innovation and competition among other rival CBDCs, contributing to achieving a cashless economy and developing faster, cheaper and transparent international remittances.BNR also laid out challenges involved in introducing a CBDC in the Central African nation. “The risks that the study identifies with a high level of concern and few mitigation options are related to CBDC adoption by the public, financial service providers, and merchants.”
Risk of Low CBDC Adoption
Rwanda bank stressed on clearly explaining and articulating CBDC in a simple manner to Rwandans. It also noted that the risk of CBDC adoption is a “complex mater,” which has to be addressed.“CBDC should provide a frictionless user experience by combining the best of both private and public currency worlds,” it added. “Alternatively, the CBDC user experience could mimic mobile money. This requires careful balancing, since the BNR should not be seen as a competitor to EMIs.”Further, to address these issues, the central bank of Rwanda recommended a token-based CBDC model with open programmability. It also proposed an offline-capable CBDC. It would use Bluetooth or Near Field Communication (NFC) “that are not reliant on Internet connectivity.”

Is Ethereum Targeted by the SEC? Will ETFs Be Approved? JP Morgan Hopeful! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While the SEC continues to increase its pressure on the cryptocurrency industry, its latest target was the US-based cryptocurrency platform Robinhood.
At this point it was revealed that the SEC sent a Wells Notice to Robinhood in early May.


While discussing the possible effects of the SEC's Wells Notice sent to Robinhood on the cryptocurrency industry, the latest assessment came from JP Morgan.
SEC Will Have to Approve Ethereum ETFs!
The SEC's Wells Notice to Robinhood Crypto is unlikely to block final approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, JP Morgan analysts said, The Block reported.





JP Morgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said that the SEC will eventually make a decision on ETH, but that the SEC will not classify ETH as a security or commodity but in another 'intermediate' category.
Analysts also noted that it would not be a huge disappointment for the markets if the SEC rejected Ethereum ETFs in May, and the markets were not expecting approval this month anyway.



“In our view, the Wells notice does not appear to preclude the eventual approval of the spot Ethereum ETF by the SEC.
ETFs may not be approved as soon as May, however. If the SEC refuses to approve spot Ethereum ETFs, it will likely face litigation and eventually lose and be forced to approve.”

SEC Wells Notice Didn't Directly Say Ethereum Is a Security!
JP Morgan analysts said the SEC did not explicitly state, nor imply, that Ethereum was not a security in its Wells Notice to Robinhood.
At this point, analysts pointed out that Robinhood offers trading services for 13 altcoins other than Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum and said:






“We do not believe that the SEC's notice to Robinhood implied that ETH was a security.
Because Robinhood not only facilitates trading on Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also 13 other tokens.
Ultimately, we think Ethereum's status will likely be determined by legislation and the court. “We think there could ultimately be a 'middle' category for Ethereum, neither a commodity nor a security, but something in between.”

Euclid launches layer to connect liquidity across Cosmos, Solana, and EVM chains - Crypto Briefing




Euclid Protocol has announced today its shared liquidity layer that connects Cosmos, Solana, and Ethereum Virtual Machine-based ecosystems, powered by virtual pools created on Nibiru Chain. This effort is aimed at consolidating fragmented liquidity across the blockchain ecosystem.“We are excited to finally reveal the Unified Liquidity Layer, Euclid’s answer to the constantly growing challenge of fragmented liquidity,” said Georges Chouchani, founder and CEO of Euclid. “Euclid lays the groundwork for the next era of DeFi, aiming to provide users with a chain-agnostic modular experience. Its primary goals include ensuring scalability and fostering an efficient market environment.”The announcement points out the fragmented liquidity experienced by the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Despite showing nearly $136 billion in total value locked (TVL), these funds are scattered across DeFi.Euclid’s Virtual Liquidity Pool (VLP) model addresses this by virtually unifying liquidity without the need to physically move it, maintaining modularity and accessibility. The VLP allows for tracking and seamless movement of liquidity across all integrated chains.Moreover, those pools are created using Nibiru Chain as a Virtual Settlement Layer (Nibiru), creating a single source-of-truth ledger. This ledger connects all integrated blockchains, offering low slippage and fair pricing ecosystem-wide through the LiquiSync model, a framework that enables any chain or protocol to connect permissionlessly.“Euclid’s modular, accessible, and unified liquidity layer, powered by Nibiru Chain, is transforming the zero-sum nature of DeFi into a positive-sum game,” said Unique Divine, Co-Founder and CEO of Nibiru Chain. “This environment allows projects to synergize and scale together rather than just compete. Such synergy fosters collective advancements and competitive edges that could surpass those of established DeFi giants.”The reveal follows a successful $600,000 pre-seed funding round led by Kahuna Network and angel investor Tomoaki Sato, with additional support from associated angels of Lavender Five, Andromeda, and Nibiru Chain.Last month, Euclid also secured a grant and liquidity backing to prime its pools for future use. These funds are earmarked for the development of the project’s architecture, business development, audits, and marketing efforts.Euclid’s roadmap includes extending its liquidity layer to encompass both EVM and non-EVM chains, leveraging protocols like IBC, CCTP, Axelar, and its own messaging protocol. The framework will be supported by EUCL, the native governance revenue share token, allowing holders to stake, receive protocol fees, participate in governance, and utilize the protocol’s treasury.

Ex-Google exec to bring Web3 to masses as new Aptos Labs adviser

Aptos Labs — a layer-1 blockchain platform developed by former Facebook employees — continues scaling on its mission to enable billions of people to access decentralized assets.The Aptos Labs team introduced its new global advisers on May 9, including David Lawee, former Google vice president of corporate development. Lawee, founder of Alphabet’s independent growth equity fund Capital G, will use his deep Web2 consumer experience to promote blockchain to the mainstream.Lawee joins Aptos’ advisory board along with Pamela Drucker Mann, chief revenue officer at the global media firm Condè Nast Global, and Dan Boneh, professor of computer science at Stanford University.Mann will focus on strengthening the Aptos Labs’ ecosystem culture, while Boneh will provide research on cryptography and cybersecurity to advance infrastructure and security.“Aptos Labs is clearly on a mission to support expanded access to financial empowerment, digital experiences, and social connectivity on a global scale,” Lawee said. “I’m looking forward to working closely with this thoughtful, tech-forward team to bring Web3 to the masses,” he added.The news comes about a year after Lawee stepped down as head of CapitalG in March 2023 after 17 years with Alphabet, with partner Laela Sturdy becoming new head of CapitalG.CapitalG managing partner Laela Sturdy and founder David Lawee. Source: CapitalGIn his role at CapitalG, Lawee has been increasingly moving into the cryptocurrency industry in the past few years. In 2021, CapitalG partnered with Digital Currency Group (DCG), a major cryptocurrency company founded by CEO Barry Silbert.“We believe that DCG will be among crypto’s few truly industry-defining leaders,” Lawee wrote in a blog post in November 2021. He added: “We are excited to invest in them and to partner with them on their important journey to transform crypto into the major global asset class it’s destined to be.”Related: Google Cloud’s Web3 portal launch sparks debate in crypto industryLawee’s post came just about a year before the crypto industry was hit with the crypto lending crisis, leading to the collapses of firms like Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which triggered massive contagion affecting firms like DCG. The contagion fueled significant financial issues for DCG, with some of its subsidiaries like Genesis Global filing for bankruptcy in January 2023.Aptos — where Lawee will continue his Web3 adventure — was founded in 2021 by Mohammad Shaikh and Avery Ching. It operates the native token, Aptos (APT), which is the 31st largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at $3.6 billion at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko.Since its launch, Aptos has raised $350 million from investors including venture capital arms of exchanges like Coinbase and Binance as well as now-bankrupt firms like 3AC and FTX.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Dogecoin is showing signs of a bullish trend, according to recent on-chain metrics and market indicators.First, the summary gauge in the metrics snapshot points to "Mostly Bullish" sentiment on IntoTheBlock's main page, with four indicators in the neutral zone and two indicating bullish trends. This overall sentiment is supported by specific on-chain and exchange signals that reflect the underlying strength and market dynamics of Dogecoin.Net network growth: Sitting in the neutral zone with a slight increase of 0.14%, this metric indicates that the number of new addresses joining the network is stable. This stability is crucial for maintaining network health and potential growth.Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewIn the money: Another neutral signal is at 0.49%, suggesting that a significant portion of addresses are at or near profitability, which can influence holding patterns among investors.Concentration: The minimal concentration change of 0.03% reflects a decentralized spread of DOGE holdings, reducing the risk of price manipulation by large holders.Large transactions: A slight decrease of -3.91% in large transactions could suggest less immediate institutional or whale activity, aligning with more stable, organic market movements.Bid-ask volume imbalance: At 0.57% bullish, this suggests a slight dominance of buy orders over sell orders, which can be a precursor to a price increase if the trend continues.The trading chart for Dogecoin further validates these indicators. Currently, DOGE is seeing support around the $0.1444 level, with a resistance near $0.1600. The price movement within this range alongside a gentle uptick in trading volume points to sustained interest and potential for upward movement.Overall, the on-chain situation for Dogecoin is slightly tilted in favor of bulls. However, we might see a drastic change of the situation in the foreseeable future if the market sees a wave of new liquidity.

Hong Kong Businessman and Son Implicated in Cryptocurrency Investor Abduction


							

Hong Kong businessman and son surrender for investor abduction.



Cryptocurrency investor allegedly owed millions, abducted.



Police hunt for four captors involved in cryptocurrency abduction.




A Hong Kong businessman and his son were arrested in the investigation of a cryptocurrency investor’s abduction. The pair, aged 70 and 30 respectively, surrendered to police on Wednesday afternoon at Tai Po Police Station, accompanied by their lawyer.



While not directly involved in the physical abduction, the businessman and his son were arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment and assault. Authorities revealed a connection between the suspects and the abduction after discovering the getaway vehicle belonged to the family.



According to an inside source, the businessman allegedly invested a significant sum, HK$15 million (US$1.9 million), in virtual currency through the victim 18 months prior. The source further claimed the businessman faced difficulties retrieving his investment and the victim became increasingly unreachable at times.









Reportedly, the 55-year-old female investor was forcefully dragged from her car in Tai Lau Leng Village by four unidentified captors and shoved into a seven-seater vehicle. Her 43-year-old husband attempted to intervene but was sided with a stun gun. Both the victim and her husband sustained injuries during the ordeal and were treated at a nearby hospital.



As of Thursday evening, a search for the four captors remains ongoing. Police suspect they may have been hired for the abduction and there is a possibility that there might have been a lack of direct connection between the businessman and the physical act. This incident marks the second abduction in Hong Kong within a mere 32-hour window, raising concerns about a potential rise in such crimes.

Why is ThorChain Trending: The Platform Aims to Grow TVL for More Liquid DeFi | Cryptopolitan

ThorChain (RUNE) is extending its one-week rally, trading above $6.06 after a few days of gradual growth. The asset defied the overall stagnant market mood, recovering from weekly lows of $4.80. So far, RUNE has managed to regain some of the losses during the early April correction. The coin is yet to move back to the $7.50 range. However, the latest price move broke an important resistance, setting expectations for RUNE to move higher. The latest price moves may boost attention for RUNE, as the asset awaits a breakout to double-digit levels. In short-term predictions, RUNE is seen climbing toward $12. Price setbacks also show a trend to buy the dip and wait for the breakout.RUNE is a relatively new asset with an all-time high at only $20. During the current bull market, RUNE only recovered to $10, but hopes remain that the asset is undervalued and may go even above its previous record.Why ThorChain Recovering Faster than the MarketThorChain is keen on active community outreach, and has a growing presence on social media. To compare, ThorChain has grown to around 10% of Solana’s social media influence, based on CryptoCompare statistics.This exposure is enough, so that network updates get a response from social media and from markets. Recently, ThorChain updated its node software to optimise gas usage and fees. The latest upgrade extended the RUNE price rally, while other major assets continued trading sideways. The project is also self-monitoring for activities, and marked a successful week after the upgrade. ThorChain aims to maximize its usage for cross-chain swaps, liquidity pools and overall decentralization.Most of the ThorChain activity comes from Trust Wallet, which aggregates all use cases from NFT to DEX trades. ThorChain also added new users in April, although at a slightly slower pace compared to the previous months.ThorChain Offers Learn-to-Earn ProgramThorChain was in the spotlight for its newly launched learning program with incentives. Affiliated projects of ThorChain and the Maya Ecosystem will provide the rewards for an educational series on blockchain technology and Web3 use cases. Users can earn RUNE tokens and other assets like CACAO for completing tasks and missions. ThorChain aims to grow its outreach, after offering various tiers of engagement, from developer tools to node incentives. Despite the activity, ThorChain has only four large commits to its codebase in the past 12 months, leaving it behind some of the more active projects. ThorChain also relies on external services to monitor the health of its network. ThorChain aims to build a highly decentralized blockchain, while ensuring speed to grow its DeFi applications. ThorChain Returns to Decentralized LendingThorChain had a revival of DeFi in Q1, where total assets expanded above $500M. Currently, ThorChain carries more than $380M worth of assets and is trying to recover decentralized finance. ThorChain itself serves as a native DEX, and now aims to boost its liquidity for a renewed crypto lending program. Lends_so is using the infrastructure of ThorChain to offer low-cost lending and passive returns, while secured by high-value collaterals. ThorChain has positioned itself as a decentralized hub for trading major blue-chip assets. The expectation of another DeFi summer may benefit ThorChain, which is already carrying several liquidity pools based on major coins and tokens.One of the potential problems for ThorChain is the scarcity of wallets that carry the asset. RUNE runs on a native blockchain, which has around 105K addresses in 2024. Trust Wallet is one of the key resources for ThorChain to communicate with the wider decentralized ecosystem. For now, ThorChain achieves around $1B in monthly swap volumes, relying on organic growth. ThorChain interacts with a small selection of platforms and chains, the most prominent among them Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, BNBCoin and Avalanche.

Should We Expect Bitcoin to Replace Gold as Store of Value? | Coinspeaker



The difference between Bitcoin and traditional commodities is that it provides holders with both the benefits digital currencies offer and the advantages of conventional assets.

Over the years, people have often converted traditional money to gold and other types of commodities to deal with inflation. In recent years, many have turned to digital assets as stores of value because they feel more confident about investing in innovative commodities.
Stores of value are defined as asset classes that maintain their value in the long run but are more volatile than fiat money. Traditional currencies are the best solution for daily transactions and work as mediums of preserving value in the short term, but they fail to retain value in the long run. Fiat money tends to lose value fast in periods of high inflation, which can lead to monetary systems breaking down.




More investors have become interested in countering the effects of inflation and have identified assets like gold, real estate, bonds, stocks, and blockchain-based commodities as the ideal mediums for the purpose. It’s wise to choose an asset that could appreciate in value over time. Stores of value are superior to traditional currencies and go through boom-and-bust phases. It’s essential to note that market conditions influence all of them; hence, their values are interrelated.
Seasoned investors know that they must add assets immune to market fluctuations to protect their wealth. Gold has been popular in the market for maintaining its high value regardless of the world’s economic and political issues. Gold has maintained its worth over the years and has gained the reputation of functioning as a hedge against challenging times. It stood the test of time as a store of value because people have considered it a convertible, mobile, rare, and durable asset. Even if several monetary systems broke over the years, gold stood the test of time.
Investors love gold because it’s a predictable asset, consistent in price fluctuations, and has a limited supply. It also lacks a correlation to other stores of value like real estate and equities. Institutional investors and governments also recognize its value as a store of value, and some countries even adopted it as a standard monetary system. They use their gold supply to guarantee the paper money in circulation.
Let’s Further Discuss Stores of Value
You have probably heard the phrase store of value multiple times, and if you’re looking for ways to protect your finances, you might have become more interested in the idea. Different investors give different meanings to stores of value, but they usually agree that they are assets that maintain their value regardless of the fluctuations of the other assets.
Bitcoin has been growing towards the status of store of value despite going through bear markets and being subjected to price volatility. Why did this happen? Experts believe that the fact that it lives on a decentralized network infuses it with trustworthiness. While some investors argue against Bitcoin’s store of value status, most state without hesitation that its volatility should be expected, considering its speculative nature. If you want to learn more about its value trajectory you can check the Bitcoin price prediction online.
To determine if Bitcoin could be listed among stores of value, it’s wise first to explore the features such a commodity has:

The public must confide in the reliability of the asset. No asset can achieve the store of value status if the public refuses to use it. Therefore, an asset will be listed among stores of value when individuals and organizations accept it and include it in investment portfolios.
Stores of value should maintain their value over the years because investors are looking for durability, aside from trustworthiness.
All stores of value have a limited supply, being one of the characteristics that enable them to increase in value as they become scarcer. However, its supply should be extensive because if it’s too scarce, its price would be exorbitant, allowing investors to purchase it. Only a small number of people or organizations would afford to invest in a too-scarce asset, and therefore, it wouldn’t be able to work as a store of value for the public. Stores of value should be averagely easily exchangeable.
Stores of value are transferable and divisible so people can exchange their property and purchase or sell smaller portions. People want to make use of the value of their assets. Hence, it’s paramount for a store of value to be transferable and divisible.
All units of a store of value should have identical values and characteristics.

Why do Bitcoin Supporters List It among Stores of Value?
Bitcoin is the first currency based on blockchain technology; therefore, it is scarce, available worldwide, and has a decentralized nature. It’s no wonder that it has become one of the most attractive solutions for investors looking for alternatives to traditional commodities. However, considering that it’s still a cryptocurrency, it has a high volatility, making it challenging to predict its exact value.
In this context, it’s essential to have a look at the features that could position it in the series of stores of value.

It boasts durability. It’s a digital currency, protecting it from any physical wear and tear. It will exist as long as blockchain exists.
It’s a portable asset because it exists digitally, so holders can take it with them when they travel. Gold, for example, is quite expensive to transport, so investors prefer digital gold when they plan to change their location often.
Bitcoin is a divisible asset because it can be split into smaller units. Each Bitcoin can be divided into 1/100,000,000th satoshi. Also, each bitcoin can be exchanged for another, as they are identical, so the cryptocurrency is also fungible.
It’s a scarce commodity because Satoshi Nakamoto designed it to have only a 21 million coins supply.

Last Words
As mentioned earlier, many investors consider Bitcoin digital gold, so they often use it as a store of value. The difference between Bitcoin and traditional commodities is that it provides holders with both the benefits digital currencies offer and the advantages of conventional assets. Will Bitcoin become the best store of value? Only time could tell.

How Bitcoin mining can help with environmental cleanup | Cryptopolitan

Recent findings challenge the once prevalent belief that Bitcoin mining primarily harms the environment. Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, emphasized on Twitter the potential of Bitcoin mining as a transformative tool for environmental betterment, particularly in methane management. This change in narrative emerges from a comprehensive study co-authored by experts like Murray A. Rudd, Matthew Jones, Daniel Sechrest, and Daniel Batten.Bitcoin – Transforming Waste into WorthThe research demonstrates the dual benefit of Bitcoin mining: environmental cleanup and economic value creation. Particularly notable is the potential of Bitcoin mining to convert vented methane—a potent greenhouse gas—into electricity.By tapping into just 1% of the U.S. Bitcoin mining network to utilize vented methane, it could mitigate methane emissions equivalent to 9 billion miles driven by gasoline-powered vehicles. This method not only addresses critical methane emissions but also repurposes them as a valuable energy source, shifting Bitcoin mining from an ecological burden to an asset.The study delved into the specifics, revealing that a mere 1.14 megawatts (MW) of Bitcoin mining could reduce 2,187 metric tons of methane annually. This is comparable to the environmental impact of removing over 156 million miles driven by gas vehicles from our roads each year. If scaled, the implications are monumental, positioning Bitcoin mining as a significant player in global sustainability efforts.Economic and Environmental SynergyBy implementing landfill methane capture with Bitcoin mining, the strategy leverages financial incentives to foster environmental sustainability. This innovative approach not only combats methane emissions but also promotes a financially viable model for energy generation. The study underscores the viability of integrating Bitcoin mining with landfill gas to energy projects, evaluating through a Monte Carlo simulation the economic impacts of such a merger.This model is particularly important given the high costs and energy consumption associated with traditional Bitcoin mining. By utilizing methane from landfills, Bitcoin mining operations can transform a harmful waste product into a clean, profitable energy source. The study highlighted the use of modern, energy-efficient mining rigs which can enhance profitability while reducing environmental impact.The involvement of Nodal Power, a pioneering landfill Bitcoin miner, and their patented technology was pivotal. Their innovations in methane mitigation have set a new standard in the field, demonstrating the practical benefits of combining high-tech solutions with environmental conservation strategies.The study was a collaborative effort, with masive contributions from former Greenpeace activist Daniel Batten and Dr. Murray Rudd, whose expertise helped model the transformative effects of this approach. Their work suggests that this innovative integration could extend beyond landfills to other sectors like agriculture and wastewater treatment, proposing a versatile model for methane reduction.However, the path to widespread adoption of this model is filled with challenges. The volatile nature of Bitcoin prices, fluctuating electricity costs, and diverse regulations are major obstacles. The study calls for strategic navigation of these issues to maximize the benefits of this integration.Despite these challenges, the research presents a compelling case for the role of Bitcoin mining in environmental strategies. By converting a potent greenhouse gas into digital gold, Bitcoin redefines the global economic state of energy use.

                        SHIB has dropped by 1.5% today, with the Shiba Inu price landing on $0.00002242 as the crypto market suffers a 1% loss in the past 24 hours.The meme token remains up by a very modest 1.5% in a week, although it has also witnessed 10% fall in a fortnight and a 20% decline in a month.However, it’s not all bad news today, with VanEck subsidiary MarketVector launching a meme coin fund yesterday.Such a fund could potentially boost SHIB’s price over time, especially when the coin is the second-biggest component of the fund, after Dogecoin.
Shiba Inu Price Prediction as New York-based VanEck’s Subsidiary Launches Meme Coin Fund – Will SHIB Skyrocket?
It’s clear that SHIB is in the middle of a slump, yet its recent history suggests that it will enjoy a rebound quite soon.Its 30-day average (orange) fell below the 200-day (blue) a couple of days ago, and is now quite low, suggesting that the market is overselling it.Source: TradingViewLikewise, the coin’s relative strength index (purple) has remained below 50 since Monday, also suggesting that the time is ripe for an uplift.Yet it’s worth pointing out that SHIB’s support level (green) has lowered in recent days, implying that the coin is too weak to prevent further losses in the near term.However, the negative outlook may be about to change, with this week seeing the aforementioned news that MarketVector – a subsidiary of major New York-based institution VanEck – has opened its own meme token fund.As the tweet above shows, SHIB comprises 28.34% of the overall fund, ahead of PEPE but slightly behind Dogecoin.This index launch could mean that we will see higher volumes for SHIB over the coming weeks and months, helping its price to pick up.More generally, its oversold status at the moment would also point to incoming recoveries, while expected rate cuts will bring market-wide positivity in later months.And what helps SHIB more than its rivals is that it has some of the strongest fundamentals of any meme token, given its recent efforts to expand its ecosystem and utility.Most recently, developers announced that it would soon be launching a privacy-focused layer-three network, for which it raised $12 million in funding last month.As such, things still look very good for the coin, with the Shiba Inu price likely to reach $0.00004 by the end of summer.
Newer Meme Tokens Bring More PotentialWhile the new VanEck fund could help instigate a meme token season sooner or later, SHIB won’t be the only coin to benefit from increased demand.There are also a wide variety of new meme coins in the market, with some of these holding real potential.At the top of any list of promising new tokens is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain crypto that has raised over $13 million in its ongoing presale.Launching on Ethereum, DOGEVERSE will also bridge to Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base, making it crypto’s first multi-chain Doge-themed cryptocurrency.This is bullish insofar as the ability to use the coin on multiple networks will increase its use and adoption, with DOGEVERSE potentially gaining traction on numerous dApps.One other thing it has over the original Dogecoin is that it has a fixed supply of 120 million tokens, making it potentially deflationary over time.By squeezing supply, DOGEVERSE’s price is likely to rise higher than it may have otherwise, a process likely to be amplified by the ability to stake the token.VIDEOIn theory, the token’s existence on multiple chains could make for more holders than usual staking the coin, something which will magnify the coin’s chances even further.Investors can participate in its sale by visiting the official Dogeverse website, where 1 DOGEVERSE costs $0.00031.This is its final presale price, meaning that it may rise much higher once it lists on exchanges in the next few weeks.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Taiwan brings tough penalties for crypto non-compliance | Cryptopolitan

Taiwan is cracking down hard on cryptocurrency service providers who sidestep regulations. The latest legislative sweep introduces severe penalties, signaling a zero-tolerance policy against non-compliance in the crypto sector. With stringent new rules in place, Taiwan aims to fortify its financial sector against money laundering and fraud.Registration or RetributionAt the forefront of Taiwan’s regulatory overhaul is the requirement for all virtual asset service providers to complete money laundering prevention registration. Failure to comply could lead a company’s executives to face up to two years in prison.This mandate is part of a broader legislative initiative, the “New Four Laws to Combat Fraud,” which encompasses the Fraud Crime Harm Prevention Regulations, the Money Laundering Prevention Law, the Technology Investigation and Security Law, and the Communications Security and Supervision Law. Together, these laws enhance the government’s toolkit to tackle and prevent a spectrum of criminal activities, sharpening the focus on crypto transactions.The revisions specifically target loopholes previously exploited in the crypto market. A major update is the categorization of new, special money laundering crimes. For instance, using virtual asset accounts and third-party payment accounts as conduits for laundering activities now carries a potential prison sentence ranging from six months to five years. Additionally, offenders could be slapped with fines up to NT$50 million.A Tighter Leash on Currency DealersAnother critical aspect of the regulatory update is the tightened scrutiny over both domestic and foreign currency dealers. Under the revised Money Laundering Prevention Law, it’s not just the local currency dealers who are required to register for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes. Foreign currency dealers eager to operate within Taiwan must now establish branches or complete proper company registration locally. This step is seen as a move to ensure greater transparency and legal compliance in the virtual asset transactions conducted within and across Taiwan’s borders.Qiu Shuzhen, the deputy chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission, highlights the Commission’s role as a stringent overseer in this evolving sector. The focus is not only on the rigorous inspection of currency dealers’ investment and payment flows but also on fortifying their internal management and control systems. Integration of accountants into these processes aims to boost transparency and adherence to the law.To date, 25 virtual currency exchanges have stepped up, aligning with legal standards and completing compliance statements pertinent to money laundering prevention. This indicates a growing industry acknowledgment of the serious repercussions of non-compliance under Taiwan’s tightening legal framework.Through the implementation of these robust laws, Taiwan’s government shows its determination against financial crime and its commitment to secure the financial market. The expectation is that as these laws are progressively enforced, they will effectively deter money laundering and fraud, thus providing a safer, more stable market environment for legitimate virtual asset operations.

Roblox Corporation (RBLX) Stock Plunges After Firm Downgrades Guidance for Q2 and Full Year 2024 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Roblox Corporation (NYSE: RBLX) recently unveiled its financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2024. The company’s financial health appears robust, with significant year-over-year increases in net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities and record-setting free cash flow. However, the firm reduced its guidance for the upcoming quarter and full year.



Roblox’s revenue surged to $801.3 million, a 22% increase from the previous year. Bookings, a critical metric for Roblox that encompasses revenue plus changes in deferred revenue and other adjustments, rose to $923.8 million, up 19% year-over-year.



Despite these positive trends, the company reported a consolidated net loss of $271.9 million. However, it’s noteworthy that the average daily active users (DAUs) increased by 17% to 77.7 million, and hours engaged on the platform grew by 15% to 16.7 billion, indicating a strong and engaged user base.



Roblox’s Q1 Performance



Roblox’s financial performance in the first quarter of 2024 has shown growth in revenue and bookings and operational efficiency. The company’s adjusted EBITDA was reported at $(6.9) million after accounting for increases in deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue. Although negative, this figure is part of Roblox’s strategic approach to investing in growth and expansion. The net liquidity stood at $2.5 billion, showcasing the company’s solid financial position.



Roblox’s efforts to drive user engagement and monetization, such as experimenting with AI-driven discovery algorithms and reintroducing platform-wide events, have begun to yield positive results, according to CEO David Baszucki. Additionally, CFO Michael Guthrie highlighted the company’s operational efficiency improvements, including a nearly 50% reduction in capital expenditures compared to the previous year, contributing to the record operating and free cash flow.



When comparing Roblox’s first quarter performance against market expectations, the company’s results present a mixed picture. Analysts had forecasted an EPS of -$0.53 and revenue of $929.67 million for the quarter.



Roblox’s reported revenue of $801.3 million fell short of expectations, despite showing strong year-over-year growth. The net loss per share of $0.43, however, outperformed the anticipated EPS, suggesting a better-than-expected control over costs or potentially higher operational efficiency than analysts had predicted.





Roblox Lowers Guidance for Q2 and Full Year 2024



Looking ahead, Roblox has provided guidance for the second quarter and updated its full-year outlook for 2024. For the upcoming quarter, the company expects revenue to be between $855 million and $880 million and bookings to range from $870 million to $900 million. The anticipated consolidated net loss is between $(267) million and $(265) million, with adjusted EBITDA projected to be between $36 million and $38 million. For the full year, Roblox estimates revenue to be between $3,450 million and $3,525 million and bookings between $4,000 million and $4,100 million. The updated guidance also accounts for changes in the estimated average lifetime of a payer, reflecting Roblox’s adaptive strategies in response to its dynamic business environment.

                        Morse code, cryptic messages, and a redesign of NEAR Protocol’s X profile have left users concerned that they have been hacked.On May 8th, NEAR Protocol’s official X handle began to post a series of cryptic tweets and messages which left the crypto community puzzled. The unusual behavior started with a 28-second-long video containing a Morse code message.Once decoded, the message read, “Darkness is coming.”Two hours after the tweet, NEAR’s X account sent out four consecutive tweets using hard-to-read gothic fonts, commonly used by heavy metal bands.The tweets contained more concerning messages like “the sun rises in the east,” “take back your thoughts,” “darkness” and “reclaim your sovereignty.”This culminated in a complete visual redesign of NEAR’s X profile. Their banner and profile picture were changed to solid black.Additionally, NEAR’s display name and description were also changed to match the mysterious theme of the tweets, simply reading “dark.”
The Community’s Reaction to NEAR Protocol’s Activity
The posts are not on-brand compared to NEAR’s past communications. Something that has prompted the crypto community on X and blockchain investigators to suspect a possible hijack.However, a handful of the protocol’s supporters see the tweets as a sign of something bigger coming to the ecosystem. Though the post’s intended meaning is unclear, users generally agree to proceed with caution. This stems from the fear that a hack was launched with malicious intent.In January 2024, the X account of Cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko experienced a security breach and was used to run phishing scams.The company managed to regain control of its social media account following a quick intervention. Hacks like this make it increasingly important that users are vigilant and know how to protect themselves from crypto fraud and scams.
NEAR Foundation Layoffs
NEAR Foundation, the developer of NEAR Protocol, recently laid off 40% of its staff to “significantly consolidate the core Foundation team to focus on a narrower and higher-impact set of activities.”This decision led to a loss of over 35 employees across the business development, marketing, and community teams. The company commented:
“The Foundation is well-placed to continue to support the ongoing growth, development, and further decentralization of the NEAR Protocol and ecosystem.”
The layoffs followed a review that revealed inefficiencies in the foundation’s operations.Over the next few years, the foundation intends to reduce its footprint even more as the ecosystem moves closer to true decentralization. However, this decision may have come at a cost. Some of the affected departments had direct involvement in NEAR Protocols X communications, which could have contributed to the suspected hijack of the account.

Taiwan proposes tougher AML measures for crypto service providers

Taiwan has amended its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations to combat fraud and enhance Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures for virtual asset service providers. Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice has proposed amendments to the existing AML laws that could impose up to two-year jail terms for non-compliant firms and fines of up to $1.5 million. The proposed amendments will be sent to Taiwan’s national parliament for review.The law was proposed by Taiwan’s Executive yuan called the “New Four Laws to Combat Fraud.” The amendments aim to strengthen the crackdown on fraud and strictly regulate money laundering prevention measures for crypto service providers.The four critical components of the amended regulations include the fraud crime harm prevention regulations, the money laundering prevention law, the technology investigation and security law, and the communications security and supervision law. The most notable change comes from the new money laundering prevention law that targets virtual asset service providers. VASPs that violate the law will face harsher penalties for noncompliance. Three distinct modifications have been made to this law, requiring revised registration requirements and restrictions for domestic and international currency dealers. Under the newly amended laws, Virtual asset service providers risk prison time of up to two years if they offer their services without registering with the due authority. A new legal category has been introduced for money laundering offenses linked to third-party payment accounts and virtual asset accounts. Related: Taiwan will review global trends before deciding on crypto ETFsThe penalties for utilizing third-party accounts for money laundering could lead to jail terms of six months to five years and fines of up to 50 million Taiwanese dollars ($1.5 million).Taiwan’s deputy minister of justice, Huang Mou-hsin, said under the current provisions, the authorities can only penalize noncompliant cryptocurrency companies administratively, However, the new proposed law criminalizes such behavior with hefty fines and prison time. The proposed law would make foreign cryptocurrency platforms risk criminal penalties unless they establish local firms and seek AML registration.The latest proposal comes within a couple of months after the country’s securities regulator said they would propose new laws for digital assets by September of this year.

                        Thanks to a recent partnership, developers can build non-custodial, on-chain Web3 games and products as Telegram Mini Apps (TMAs).Inco, developers of a universal confidentiality layer for Ethereum and other networks, has announced its partnership with Privy, an embedded wallet provider that enables crypto app developers to onboard their users easily.Developers can now access users directly in Telegram, a mega-popular social media platform with 900 million users worldwide.Therefore, building decentralized apps (Dapps) as TMAs allows developers to “create a consumer-friendly experience and tap into the largest pool of retail users,” the press release said.These web apps run inside Telegram Messenger, meaning that users can access them in individual or group chats.More specifically, users can launch “an embedded web interface with an experience similar to other popular in-app browsers,” the team said.Launching a TMA is as simple as starting a chat conversation with an app’s Telegram handle,” it added.As an example, the team gave a poker game running fully on-chain. Players don’t have to trust the ‘dealer.’ Instead, they can check their play thanks to the encryption technology called Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).Source: Inco, PrivyNotably, Inco has already created “a number of demo apps,” it said. These include Slot Machine (@inco_slots_demo_bot) and Hangman (@IncoHangmanGameBot).Both of these games utilize FHE for on-chain confidentiality and randomness.
New Forms of Web3 Games on Telegram
Inco is a confidentiality-focused Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) powered by FHE, the team said.Developers can use it to build decentralized apps and mini-games that work with their wallet providers.The various game types include slot machines, card games, guessing games, prediction markets, and more.This enables “new forms of gameplay with confidential elements,” it added.Furthermore, while many TMAs provide their own custodial wallets, which is a security risk, “developers can now integrate Privy SDK to provision self-custodial wallets for users to securely power on-chain experiences from Telegram.”Additionally, developers are free to access Inco’s open-source repo to start building similar experiences within Telegram.Explaining this further, the team said that Telegram Mini Apps can be built using popular web development standards like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript / React.Building a Web3 product as a Telegram Mini App provides several advantages, including:

Automation with Telegram bots – automated text-based prompts for users, to facilitate in-app actions and receive notifications
Embedded monetization – TMAs offer monetization opportunities through in-app purchases, subscriptions, etc.;
Cross-platform experiences – developers can synchronize session history across web and mobile app deployments (e.g. starting an activity in a TMA and continuing on the desktop web).

Per Privy COO Max Segall, this partnership will help developers meet their users where they are – many of them being on Telegram.Inco CEO Remi Gai commented that “building decentralized apps directly within Telegram will become the next trend.” What’s more, it will boost the Web3 industry development.“Easy-to-access, share, and scalable apps represent a new wave of dapps,” Gai added.

DWF Labs Responds to $300M Wash Trading Allegations - DailyCoin


        
DWF Labs has denied grave allegations leveled against it.



The report with the allegations cited insider sources.



An exchange mentioned in the allegations has also responded.
Crypto trading and market-making firm DWF Labs has responded to numerous allegations leveled against it in a Thursday report, including that it engaged in hundreds of millions of wash trading on Binance last year.On May 9, the Wall Street Journal alleged that Binance’s surveillance team recommended the removal of DWF Labs and other hundred users from the exchange, citing multiple violations of the terms of use and “rampant market manipulation.”$300M “Wash Trading” on BinanceNotably, in late 2023, the surveillance team claimed that DWF Labs had manipulated the price of the YGG token and “at least six other cryptocurrencies” and processed over $300 million of wash trades on Binance that year.
Per the report, instead of removing DWF Labs from its platform as recommended by the surveillance team, Binance launched an investigation into the monitoring team itself and refuted its evidence and findings.The report alleged that Binance then fired the head of the surveillance team and rejected the recommendation to remove DWF Labs from its platform a week later. While the report claimed this information came from insiders at the exchange, implying it could be reliable, DWF Labs thought otherwise.DWF Labs’ ResponseIn a statement titled “The Real Origin Story,” DWF labs took a jab at the WSJ’s report, noting that its allegations were “unfounded.”
“To our valued partners: We want to clarify that many recent allegations reported in the press are unfounded and distort the facts.” DWF Labs said. “Establishments and fake media will not root the movement that Bitcoin started in 2009. We are in crypto for the very reasons why the establishments want to get rid of us.”On its part, Binance said its “strict market surveillance program” does not tolerate market abuse.Read why Binance CEO wants Nigeria to release the exchange’s compliance officer:Binance CEO Urges Nigeria to Release Tigran GambaryanStay updated on why the Binance Nigeria case was delayed:Binance Nigeria Case Delayed Again as Procedural Errors Pile Up

Wells Notice Wallop: Robinhood Bleeds 164 Million Dogecoin


                            The Shiba Inu’s reign as king of memecoins may be facing a ruff patch. Dogecoin (DOGE) prices dipped this week after news broke of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issuing a Wells Notice to Robinhood, a popular crypto exchange.
The notice, a precursor to potential enforcement action, alleges Robinhood violated multiple securities laws. This sent shockwaves through the crypto community, with many investors, particularly those holding large amounts of DOGE (often nicknamed “whales”), pulling their funds out of Robinhood.

The most significant outflow involved a whopping 164 million DOGE, worth roughly $25 million at the time, being transferred out of the exchange. This mass withdrawal by a whale investor likely contributed to the market jitters surrounding DOGE.

DOGE Price Wobbles: Short-Term Blues Or Long-Term Woof?
The price of DOGE tumbled 5.8% in the 24 hours following the Robinhood news. However, analysts caution against a knee-jerk reaction. While the legal troubles undoubtedly cast a shadow on Robinhood, the DOGE outflow, including the 164 million transfer, might not be the sole culprit behind the price dip.
Transferring cryptocurrency from an exchange to a personal wallet is often seen as a bullish move, indicating an intention to hold for the long term.
Dogecoin And Bitcoin: A Tale Of Two Blockchains
Another factor influencing DOGE’s price is its tight correlation with Bitcoin (BTC). Both currencies operate on the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which some see as outdated compared to newer, energy-efficient models.
The recent pullback in the broader crypto market, especially in Bitcoin, likely played a role in dragging DOGE down as well.

Rocky Road To $0.20? DOGE Faces Support Hurdle
DOGE enthusiasts were eyeing a price target of $0.20, but the recent drop presents a roadblock. The memecoin dipped below the crucial $0.15 support level, raising concerns about a further decline.
Analysts point to a potential support zone between $0.143 and $0.146, but a fall below that could trigger a more significant price correction.
Bullish Signs Amidst The Dip
Despite the short-term pessimism, there are glimmers of hope for DOGE. The buy orders for DOGE currently outweigh sell orders by a significant margin, suggesting continued investor interest.

Additionally, the memecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at a neutral 47, indicating there’s room for new buyers to enter the market. Furthermore, DOGE managed to maintain a weekly price increase despite the daily drop, hinting at underlying resilience.
Doge Day Delayed, But Not Doomed
The coming weeks will be crucial for Dogecoin. The outcome of Robinhood’s legal battle with the SEC and DOGE’s ability to regain lost ground will determine its short-term trajectory. However, long-term forecasts for the memecoin remain cautiously optimistic.

                        Crypto lender Ledn revealed loans statistics for the first quarter on Thursday, surpassing all previous quarters since its inception in 2018.The lender said it facilitated over $690m in loans, with a split of $584m going to institutional clients and $106m to retail investors. Notably, over $40m of the retail loans were refinanced from crypto lender Celsius following its collapse.Ledn’s Q1 loan volume more than tripled from the previous quarter. In Q4, the company processed just $125.7m in institutional loans and $14.6m in retail loans. Ledn credits this surge to the recent approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, which fueled a rally in Bitcoin’s price.“These developments allowed Ledn to process several hundred million in institutional loans to ETF market makers,” the company said.
Q1 Sets Stage for Promising Year as Crypto Lending Revives
Following Celsius’s bankruptcy, Ledn launched a refinancing program and said it garnered confidence from the crypto community. This resulted in Ledn securing $40m in refinanced loans, exceeding half of the total refinanced amount.“The first quarter of 2024 has set the tone for a promising year for Ledn, as we’ve not only doubled our loan book since November 2022 but have also solidified our leading position in the market by adapting to the increasing demand for digital asset financial products,” Ledn CEO Adam Reeds said in a statement.Ledn’s successful Q1 isn’t an isolated case. The broader crypto lending market is experiencing a resurgence. Coinbase’s Q4 2023 shareholder letter revealed a similar trend, with the exchange actively lending $399m to customers during that period.
Ledn Predicts Broader Crypto ETFs
Responding to strong client, Ledn rolled out Ethereum-backed loans in February. These ETH loans mirror the lender’s Bitcoin (BTC) loans, offering a starting loan-to-value ratio of 50% and an annual interest rate starting at 10.4% (12.4% APR).Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, Ledn’s co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, told Cryptonews that the loan processing experience on the platform is straightforward. “You do not need to learn how to interact with protocols to access a Ledn ETH-backed loan,” he said.He also predicted that crypto ETFs will soon encompass a broader array of crypto assets within a single investment vehicle.

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) to Rally 9,000%, as it Looks to Take on Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Slerf presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Slerf has market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 9,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Slerf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Solana Slerf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Slerf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Slerf by entering its contract address – D2R7sKwPNpWGtEfMJiLVe5G2ZJbExnk98PEft2dhyCrL – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLSLERF.

Bitcoin Facing These 'Compelling Mid-Term Bearish Cases,' Warns Trader - Benzinga

While maintaining a bullish stance on Bitcoin’s BTC/USD long-term prospects, crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa has shared his thoughts on some compelling mid-term bearish cases.What Happened: Sherpa points out several factors suggesting a potentially bearish scenario for Bitcoin in the mid-term.
Presence of a rounded top formation in the price action, typically associated with a more "toppy" market.



Current consolidation period length: previous run-ups did not exhibit similar price action for such an extended duration without a significant pullback.



The overall market structure in 2020 was significantly different, and the current market is trending rather than ranging.



Even if Bitcoin drops to the $40,000-$50,000 range, it could lead to a violent move that could "rekt the market" and cause altcoins to lose 50% or more of their current value.
He maintains that this would not signal the end of the current cycle and that Bitcoin could still reach six figures and experience a mania phase, possibly in Q4 2024, after a period of consolidation.Also Read: If Bitcoin Starts ‘Losing The Lows’ It Could Get ‘Ugly’ And ‘Violent,’ Traders WarnWhy It Matters: Sherpa suggests that this type of price action could lead to larger downtrends or pullbacks, even if Bitcoin remains bullish on higher time frames. While he believes that predicting price action so far is not sensible, it is a good idea to think about it and plan for it.The trader’s emphasis on the unique characteristics of each market cycle serves as a reminder that historical price action may not always be a reliable indicator of future performance.Factors such as ETF inflows, improving macro conditions, and the upcoming U.S. elections could all contribute to a "different" market dynamic this time around. At a recent NFT event, Donald Trump stated that people can donate to his campaign using crypto.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. To know how meme coins have evolved in the past few years, this could be a relevant read.

Here's Why VanEck Subsidiary's Meme Coin Index Is Important for Market

MarketVector has launched a Meme Coin Index that might make a massive difference for future rallies on the meme coin market. This index comprises popular meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, dogwifhat, Floki Inu and BONK.The significance of this index lies in its performance and broader implications for the market. With a staggering return of 137.96% so far this year, the Meme Coin Index has outperformed other indices on the MarketVector platform. This exceptional yield highlights the growing interest and speculative investment in meme coins which, despite their origins as internet jokes, have garnered substantial market capitalization and investor interest. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two of the most prominent assets in the index, have shown mixed performance in the last few weeks. Dogecoin, however, has seen a resurgence in interest, reflected in its on-chain metrics.The performance of these coins underscores the potential of meme assets to yield high returns. This could pave the way for products similar to ETFs but for cryptocurrencies, focusing specifically on meme coins. Such products would not only diversify investment options but also legitimize meme coins as more than just internet lore — they could be considered serious investment opportunities due to their performance and the offered risk-exposure.The launch of the Meme Coin Index could also signify a shift in how financial products are being tailored to the new age of investors. These are individuals who are tech-savvy, drawn to memes and looking for unconventional investment avenues with potentially high returns. As more assets similar to this index become tradable, they could offer a new kind of value proposition to investors who are willing to engage with the high-risk, high-reward nature of the market.

Ether turns inflationary for the first time since Merge

The Ether (ETH) supply has ceased to be deflationary following Ethereum’s highly anticipated Dencun upgrade that went live two months ago.Total Ether supply increased to 120.1 million on May 7, from 120 million on March 12, before the Dencun upgrade was rolled out on mainnet, according to CryptoQuant data.While this is a small increase, it marks the first period when Ether supply turned inflationary since September 2022, when the much-anticipated Merge transitioned Ethereum to its current proof-of-stake consensus model.Ethereum: Total Supply and Fees Burned. Source: CryptoQuantEther temporarily losing its deflationary status is not critical for the Ethereum network since its main benefits are more related to decentralized applications (DApps), according the founder and CEO of Cryptoquant. In a May 9 X post, Ki Young Ju wrote: “Post-Dencun upgrade, $ETH lost deflationary status with reduced fees, departing from “ultrasound money.” Ethereum’s strength lies in DApps; it’s wiser not to compare it to Bitcoin’s sound money narrative.”Ethereum Total Transactions and Fees Burned. Source: Ki Young JuEther supply first turned deflationary after the Merge on Sept. 15, 2022, when a mechanism that permanently burned transaction fees on the network was introduced resulting in a decreasing Ether supply. Over 419,713 Ether tokens were burned, or permanently removed from circulation, since the Merge, according to ultrasound.money.Source: ultrasound.moneyRelated: Dencun is a big step towards mass adoption: Metis CEOThe death of “ultra sound” money?The Dencun upgrade has ended Ether’s inflationary streak by making median transaction fees as much as four times cheaper than before, with the same level of network activity.While this is a significant step for the Ethereum network and its users, it could spell the end of Ether’s status as ultra-sound money, according to a May 8 report by CryptoQuant.“The Dencun upgrade has made ETH inflationary again, potentially killing the narrative of “Ultra sound” money as a structurally lower amount of transaction fees burned on Ethereum have had the corresponding effect of not decreasing the total supply of ETH to keep it deflationary.”Due to lower transaction fees, the amount of Ether being burned has declined to its lowest levels since the Merge, while supply growth has risen to its highest level since the upgrade.Related: VanEck subsidiary’s memecoin index up 137% year-to-date

Is DWF Labs Market Manipulation Being Covered By Binance, Or Is There An Important Secret? - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Allegations of DWF Labs market manipulation surface at Binance after the dismissal of an internal investigator.



Binance faces scrutiny over its handling of the situation following government management.




Former insiders of Binance have alleged that the recent dismissal of an internal investigator sheds light on the crypto exchange’s alleged negligence regarding evidence of DWF Labs market manipulation.





Allegations of DWF Labs Market Manipulation Rock Binance



The accusations surfaced after claims that Binance fired an employee who raised concerns about potential market manipulation activities.



Reports from the Wall Street Journal indicate that between 2022 and 2023, Binance had assembled a team of investigators to probe into market manipulation suspicions on the exchange. 



The investigation revealed that DWF Labs, a prominent investment fund and market maker specializing in Web3 projects, was allegedly manipulating the prices of YGG tokens and several other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, DWF Labs was accused of engaging in “wash trading,” with trading volumes exceeding $300 million and the sale of nearly 5 million tokens during market recoveries.




Binance co-founder He Yi responded to these allegations, asserting the exchange’s stringent monitoring of market makers and its commitment to report any irregularities to regulatory authorities. However, DWF Labs refuted these claims as baseless, while Binance maintained its confidence in the integrity of its investigation team.



Binance Faces Controversy Over Handling of Market Manipulation Allegations



In response to the investigation’s findings, Binance was urged to impose trading bans on violating users. However, Binance dismissed these claims, stating that the evidence presented by the monitoring team was insufficient to confirm DWF Labs market manipulation.



Amidst these allegations, Binance faced scrutiny over its handling of the situation, particularly regarding its dedication to ensuring a fair trading environment. 



The dismissal of the Head of the Supervisory Team further fueled speculation, with allegations of a close relationship with DWF Labs’ competitor Wintermute. Despite calls to remove DWF Labs’ trading account, Binance refused, citing concerns over the head of the monitoring team’s alleged collaboration with competitors.

Near Protocol's X Posts Raise Alarm: Is the Account Compromised?


							

Near Protocol’s cryptic X posts raise concerns of a possible account hack.



Recent staff reduction at Near Foundation suggests restructuring to focus on core activities.



Previous crypto-related account compromises fuel heightened scrutiny amid unusual Near Protocol posts.




Near Protocol’s recent cryptic X posts from its official account have sparked speculation and concern within the crypto community. The posts, which include messages like “Darkness is coming” and “reclaim your sovereignty,” have raised suspicions of a possible hack or hijack of the account. Despite this, Near Protocol has yet to provide an official confirmation.



The unusual posts began on May 8, with a 27-second Morse code video posted without context. Cointelegraph decoded the message, revealing the phrase “Darkness is coming.” This was followed by four tweets in a difficult-to-read gothic font, accompanied by a change in the account’s name and description to match the gothic theme.







While some see the X posts as a sign of impending developments within the Near ecosystem, others are concerned about the security of the protocol’s official account. This concern is not unfounded, as other crypto-related accounts, such as CoinGecko and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, have been compromised in the past.









In January, CoinGecko’s account was used in a phishing scam before being reclaimed, while the SEC’s account was briefly compromised to post a false message about the approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds. The timing of these incidents in relation to Near Protocol’s posts has led to heightened scrutiny and speculation within the crypto community.







During the same period, Near Foundation decided to reduce its staff by 40%. The foundation, known for developing the Near Protocol layer-1 protocol, stated the need to “significantly consolidate” its team in order to focus on key activities. The decision resulted in the termination of 35 employees from the marketing, business development, and community teams. NEAR Protocol’s current price stands at $7.11, with a trading volume of $401.8 million over the past 24 hours, experiencing a 0.50% decrease during this period.

Bitcoin Miners are in Trouble! Mining Difficulty Reached Bear Market Levels! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, has reached its most significant mining difficulty level in nearly 18 months, signaling a shift in the landscape of cryptocurrency mining.
Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sees Biggest Drop in 18 Months Amid Falling Hash Rate
Today's 5.7% decline marks the highest negative situation since the bear market bottoms on December 6, 2022, when Bitcoin was trading around $17,000.


According to data from Bitbo, the difficulty adjustment occurred at a block height of 842,688 and the difficulty dropped to 83.1 trillion.
Bitcoin mining difficulty serves as a relative measure of the difficulty associated with mining new blocks, adjusting automatically every 2016 blocks to maintain an average block discovery time of 10 minutes, regardless of changes in miner activity.






The latest negative adjustment follows a significant 10% drop in network hashrate since the last adjustment on April 24.
This decline, from the seven-day moving average of 639.58 EH/s to 578.74 EH/s, contributed to average block times of 10 minutes and 36 seconds before adjustment.


The drop in hash rate also caused Bitcoin's hash price to drop to an all-time low, dropping below $50 per PH/s per day ($0.05 per TH/s per day) on April 29, with Bitcoin's price falling below $63,000. It coincided with the same time.

AI has a monopoly on power and privacy. Blockchain fixes this. - Blockworks


Many Americans got their first glimpse behind the machine learning curtain when details of Amazon’s “Just Walk Out” technology went public. Instead of pure technology tallying up customers’ purchases and charging them when they left the store, the sales were manually checked by about 1,000 real people working in India.
But these workers were the human-half of what most AI really is — a collaboration between reinforcement learning and human intelligence. 
The human element tends to be ignored in discussions of AI safety, which is a little disturbing given how much of an impact AI will likely have on our job markets and ultimately our individual lives. This is where decentralization, the inherent trustlessness and security of blockchain technology can play a major role.
The Center for Safe AI identifies four broad categories of AI risk. As a start, there’s malicious use, in which users might “intentionally harness powerful AIs to cause widespread harm” by engineering “new pandemics or [using them] for propaganda, censorship and surveillance, or [releasing AIs] to autonomously pursue harmful goals.” 
A more subtle concern is the risk of an AI race, where corporations or nation states compete to quickly build more powerful systems and take unacceptable risks in the process. Unchecked cyberwarfare is a potential outcome, another is allowing systems to evolve on their own, potentially slipping out of human control; or a more prosaic, but no less disruptive outcome, could be mass unemployment from unchecked competition. 
Organizational risks with AI are similar to any other industry. AI could cause serious industrial accidents, or powerful programs could be stolen or copied by malicious actors. Finally, there’s the risk that the AIs themselves could go rogue, “optimizing flawed objectives, drifting from their original goals, becoming power-seeking, resisting shutdown or engaging in deception.” 
Regulation and good governance can contain many of these risks. Malicious use is addressed by restricting queries and access to various features, and the court system could be used to hold developers accountable. Risks of rogue AI or and organizational issues can be mitigated by common sense and fostering a safety-conscious approach to using AI. 
But these approaches don’t address some of the second-order effects of AI. Namely, centralization and the perverse incentives remaining from legacy Web2 companies. For too long, we’ve traded our private information for access to tools. You can opt out, but it’s a pain for most users.
AI is no different than any other algorithm, in that what you get out of it is the direct result of what you put in — and there are already massive amounts of resources devoted to cleaning up and preparing data to be used for AI. A good example is OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is trained on hundreds of billions of lines of text taken from books, blogs and communities like Reddit and Wikipedia, but also relies on people and smaller, more customized databases to fine-tune the output. 
Read more from our opinion section: What can blockchain do for AI? Not what you’ve heard.
This brings up a number of issues. Mark Cuban has recently pointed out that AI will eventually need to be trained on data that companies and individuals might not want to share, in order to become more commercially useful beyond coding and copywriting. And, as more jobs are impacted by AI — particularly as AI agents make custom AI applications accessible — the labor market as we know it could eventually implode. 
Creating a blockchain layer in a decentralized AI network could mitigate these problems. 
We can build AI that can track the provenance of data, maintain privacy and allow individuals and enterprises to charge for access to their specialized data if we use decentralized identities, validation staking, consensus and roll-up technologies like optimistic and zero-knowledge proofs. This could shift the balance away from large, opaque, centralized institutions and provide individuals and enterprises with an entirely new economic system.
On the technological front, you need a way to confirm the integrity of data, the ownership of data and its legitimacy (model auditing). 
Then, you would need a method of provenance, (to borrow a phrase from the art world), which means being able to see any piece of data’s audit trail in order to properly compensate whoever’s data is being used.
Privacy is also important — a user must be able to secure their data on their own electronics and be able to control access to their data, including being able to revoke that access. Doing so involves cryptography and a security protection certification system.
This is an advancement from the existing system, where valuable information is merely collected and sold to centralized AI companies. Instead, it enables broad participation in AI development. 
Individuals can engage in various roles, such as creating AI agents, supplying specialized data or offering intermediary services like data labeling. Others might contribute by managing infrastructure, operating nodes or providing validation services. This inclusive approach allows for a more diversified and collaborative AI ecosystem.
We could create a system that benefits everyone in the system, from the digital clerics a continent away to the shoppers whose cart contents provide them raw data to developers behind the scenes. Crypto can provide a safer, fairer, more human-centric collaboration between AI and the rest of us.

TikTok to automatically label AI-generated content

TikTok, the popular social media platform for creating and sharing short-form videos, said it will now start automatically labeling artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content (AIGC) when it is uploaded to the platform. On May 9, the social media giant said it is partnering with the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and will be the first media-sharing platform to implement its Content Credentials technology. TikTok has already been requiring content creators to label realistic AIGC for over a year, along with anything made with its own TikTok AI effects. However, the recent development implements auto-labeling on AI-generated content created using other platforms. It said this will be done with the Content Credentials technology which attaches metadata to content that the platform can use to instantly recognize and label AIGC.The statement said the increase in auto-labeled AIGC on TikTok will be “gradual at first” as soon as Content Credential is implemented on other platforms to metadata, it will be able to label more content. For the time being, the feature will only be available for images and videos, with the intention of bringing it to audio content in the near future.  The social media platform has also joined the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), led by Adobe. Dana Roa, the general counsel and chief trust officer at Adobe, said: “At a time when any digital content can be altered, it is essential to provide ways for the public to discern what is true.”Related: Biden’s Homeland Security team taps tech elite for AI defense boardIn addition to the AI labeling, TikTok said it will also be rolling out media literacy resources, which were developed alongside MediaWise and WITNESS. The social media platform intends to release 12 videos throughout the year highlighting universal media literacy skills and explaining how TikTok tools like AIGC labels can further contextualize content. This comes as AI continues to advance and has the capacity to create more realistic content, sparking a rise in AI-generated deepfakes. On May 8, authorities in Hong Kong discovered an unlicensed, fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange that faked connection with Elon Musk, posting AI-generated videos and images of Musk on its website and social media handles.A few days prior, Berkshire Hathaway co-founder Warren Buffett said the impact of AI concerning illicit financial activities is comparable to the advent of the atomic bomb and nuclear weaponry.This came after exposure to a deepfake of himself that was able to realistically mimic the way he dressed, moved and talked.Magazine: Pickup artists using AI, deep fake nudes outlawed, Rabbit R1 fail: AI Eye

MarketVector by VanEck: new index to track memecoins

MarketVector by VanEck has recently introduced an index dedicated to memecoins, which has seen a 195% increase on an annual basis. The index includes a variety of popular tokens such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Floki Inu, Dogewifhat, and BONK.
Let’s see below all the details. 

MarketVector by VanEck launches an index for memecoins
As anticipated, VanEck’s MarketVector has followed the trend of memecoins by introducing a new index dedicated to this popular category of tokens.
The Meme Coin Index by MarketVector, identified by the symbol MEMECOIN, tracks the six most important meme tokens, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE). Other components of the index include Dogwifhat (WIF), Floki Inu (FLOKI) and BONK.
Considering the performance of its components, the new MarketVector index has risen by over 195% on an annual basis. 
For comparison, the CoinDesk 20, which tracks the 20 largest tokens excluding stablecoins, grew by 97% in the same period, while Bitcoin (BTC) recorded an increase of 123%.
Meme coins have a total market capitalization of about 51 billion dollars, according to CoinGecko, with the MarketVector index tracking 44.67 billion dollars.
Some investment managers have recently reported that the popularity of memecoins could continue thanks to the low fees on the Solana blockchain.
Which allow users to make small bets with the potential for high earnings, unlike previous crazes limited by high fees on Ethereum.
Furthermore, a new category of meme tokens called PoliFi is emerging with the approaching election season. The market capitalization of this new category has reached 586 million dollars. 
A specific token, BODEN, has increased by 16% after former president Donald Trump mentioned it during an electoral event. At the same time, MAGA, a token inspired by Trump, has risen by 28% and TREMP has experienced a surge of 142%.
VanEck CEO: why invest in semiconductors?
According to the CEO of VanEck, Jan van Eck, investing in semiconductors could be the most effective strategy to take advantage of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. In particular, during an interview on CNBC’s ETF Edge, he stated: 
“Semiconductors have become the heart of artificial intelligence commerce.”
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) fund, which includes 25 of the top chip manufacturers in the United States, has grown by 21% this year. Although it experienced a 6% drop in May, dragged down by declines from giants like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia.
Van Eck argues that this weakness could be only temporary, as the increasing demand for AI chips offers potential long-lasting returns: 
“They have gone from being a highly cyclical business with short-lived products to an integral part of the growing commerce, with higher recurring revenues, so they can maintain high profits despite some short-term fluctuations.”
Mike Akins, co-founder of ETF Action, shares a similar point of view, highlighting that limited competition among major chip producers could support the group, as explained:  
“Until competition significantly increases, it is difficult to see this sector losing momentum.”
However, Akins warns to carefully monitor the flows of funds in semiconductors as an indicator of future performance. 
It suggests that very low flows can indicate a buying opportunity, while high flows can suggest that it is time to reduce positions.

Trump Backs US Crypto Industry, Says "I'm Good With It" - DailyCoin


        
US crypto firms are under a multi-year campaign of regulatory hostility.



Donald Trump backed the US crypto industry in a recent Q&A.



The majority of Americans do not own digital assets, making crypto a minor voting issue.
The US crypto industry has been subjected to a multi-year pummeling under the Biden administration. Major players, including Robinhood, Coinbase, and Ripple, to name a few, have been subjected to punitive enforcement actions and regulatory crackdowns, to the point that there is no denying that a campaign against digital assets exists.Some observers, including Dave Weisberger, the CEO of CoinRoute, claim this industry assault is the product of collusion between Democrats and legacy finance, who view cryptocurrency as an existential threat. However, in a glimmer of hope for crypto supporters, presidential hopeful Donald Trump recently voiced his support for the besieged sector.Trump Wants Thriving US Crypto IndustryDuring a recent gala dinner Q&A with buyers of his “Mugshot Edition” NFT collection, Trump expressed his support for the besieged US crypto industry. When asked what he would do about firms potentially leaving the US over regulatory hostility, Trump responded, “We’ll stop it because I don’t want that.” 
During the session, the former president also took the opportunity to mock Joe Biden’s understanding of digital assets while drawing a line between both parties by distinguishing Democrats as the anti-crypto party. In contrast, Trump endorsed cryptocurrencies by saying, “I’m good with it.”Nonetheless, cryptocurrency remains a bipartisan issue, with some Democrats, like Angela Alsobrooks and Jake Auchincloss, in favor of digital assets. However, several senior Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren and Brad Sherman, have been outspoken critics, alleging cryptocurrency enables criminality.Hoskinson Pans Democrats Wading into the political arena, Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson made clear that a Biden victory in November would be disastrous for the US crypto industry. He said:
“The intent of this administration is to destroy the American cryptocurrency industry. Understand that. It is unambiguously clear. They have obfuscated, lied, and repeatedly, throughout the years, hurt our industry.”Strengthening his case further, Hoskinson recounted past actions under the watch of the Democrats that have held back the industry, including restricting access to banking, regulation through enforcement, anti-clarity, and most recently, obstructing the legislative process regarding Biden vetoing the passing of H.J. Res. 109 by the House of Representatives.H.J. Res.109 proposed to repeal a Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) policy that prevented regulated firms from custodying crypto assets. Biden stated that repealing H.J. Res. 109 would disrupt the SEC’s “work to protect investors” and hamper the agency’s efforts to maintain an effective crypto framework.On the FlipsideWhy This MattersBy backing crypto ahead of the 2024 election, Trump is making a calculated play to court a passionate voter base. This strategy positions Trump as a business-friendly visionary willing to embrace new economic and technological frontiers. However, cryptocurrency remains a niche issue that most mainstream American voters don’t prioritize.Read about the MAGA memecoin’s rollercoaster price action:Donald Trump’s Wallet Erases $3M Deficit as MAGA Coin ResurgesP2P platform LocalMonero shuts down with no explanation given:LocalMonero Calls It Quits: Is Regulatory Pressure to Blame?

Former President Donald Trump-related memecoin lead market following new crypto promises

Former President Donald Trump continued his advances toward the crypto community by hosting an event for holders of the Trump Cards NFT Gala on May 8 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.During the event, Trump expressed his support for cryptocurrencies, announcing plans to accept digital asset donations for his potential re-election campaign. He also emphasized the need for a more favorable regulatory environment for the growing crypto industry.Following the statements, a Trump-inspired MAGA memecoin lacking utility surged by over 40%. This impressive gain positioned MAGA as the top performer on CryptoSlate’s list of gainers during the reporting period.Pro-cryptoVideos circulating on social media showed Trump’s critique of the Biden administration’s approach to crypto, signaling potential shifts in policy should he return to office.Trump highlighted the exodus of crypto firms from the US due to regulatory hostility, promising a friendlier environment under his leadership to bolster the industry domestically.The former president chastised Biden’s lack of crypto understanding, attributing it to his administration’s unfavorable stance. Trump said:“Biden doesn’t know, Gensler is very much against it, the Democrats are very much against it.”Notably, Trump previously held anti-crypto sentiments during his tenure, labeling Bitcoin as a scam in 2021. However, his views of the sector appear to have evolved, as evidenced by his embrace of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) bearing his semblance.Trump is banking on this newfound view to gather support for his presidential campaign, stating that:“If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you are in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.”These moves have spurred speculation on how a potential Trump presidency could benefit crypto. Financial institution Standard Chartered suggested that a second Trump term could be a boon for Bitcoin and other digital assets by offering viable alternative investment avenues.Mentioned in this article

Insurance Giant Announces Investing in Bitcoin ETFs! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC in January attracted many new institutional investors to the market, a new ETF purchase news comes every day.
At this point, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that many investment advisors, banks and other institutional investors have invested in BTC ETFs, but they have not yet reported and disclosed these investments.



While many corporate companies have recently reported their ETF exposure in line with this determination of Balchunas, the latest statement came from the insurance giant MassMutual.
Accordingly, leading insurance company MassMutual reported exposure to the Bitcoin ETF in its 13F filings.





The investment amount of MassMutual, which bought it from the Grayscale ETF, was not disclosed.




This is not the first Bitcoin investment by the famous insurance company MassMutual. Because the company purchased a large amount of Bitcoin through New York-based Digital Investments Group (NYDIG) in 2020. MassMutual, which was founded in 1851 and has approximately 5 million customers, had invested $100 million worth of BTC.

White Pepe (WHPEPE) to Skyrocket 6,800% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

White Pepe (WHPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



White Pepe (WHPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 6,800% in price in the coming days.




This is because WHPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, White Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and White Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy White Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for White Pepe by entering its contract address – 58kSp6Sn8P42EdRDgud75YcvkRLnCpMxPb7MqCRHkUeG – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WHPEPE.

                        Chiliz, the owner of the blockchain sports rewards platform Socios.com, and Azuro, a liquidity layer for onchain predictions, have partnered to grow the onchain sport prediction market.In an announcement, the firms said the collaboration will involve Chiliz Chain integrating the Azuro Protocol, and adding existing supported chains such as Polygon and Gnosis Chain.This will allow Chiliz to expand into the sports-focused prediction applications market and any existing builders using the Azuro infrastructure will be able to connect their apps to the Chiliz Chain. This in turn will allow users to place transactions with the Chiliz blockchain native token CHZ.“Integrating with Azuro marks a pivotal move for Chiliz Chain to capitalize on the rapidly expanding onchain prediction market,” said Alexandre Dreyfus, CEO of Chiliz and Socios.com, a press release. “Leveraging Azuro’s advanced infrastructure, we’re empowering developers to innovate within the sports and gaming sectors,” adds Dreyfus.In April, Azuro, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) building a protocol for blockchain-based predictions, raised $11 million with investment from SevenX Ventures and Arrington Capital. Since launching, Azuro claims it has become the fastest-growing protocol on Gnosis Chain and the number one revenue-generating protocol on Polygon. 
Azuro, Chiliz to Launch Co-Sponsored Grants Program
In the near future, Azuro and Chiliz said they will be launching a co-sponsored grants program aimed at incentivizing app developers to build on their combined infrastructure.  In return the firms will award bounties for the first apps that push further adoption of onchain prediction markets, and meet their goal for setting new transparency and fairness standards.
What is Chilliz?
Chiliz was developed with the purpose of facilitating the distribution of blockchain-based sports and entertainment services and goods. Fan tokens are a revolutionary new method for users and teams to communicate and participate on Chiliz.The Chiliz platform allows users to buy exclusive fan tokens from major league teams and popular businesses across the world.

Solana-based BODEN beats SHIB, PEPE, WIF: Election season impact? - AMBCrypto



BODEN and TRUMP pump significantly as the U.S. elections come closer.
Social volume for tokens such as WIF, PEPE and SHIB declined.

The memecoin sector was one of the most popular spaces in the crypto space, however, in the last 24 hours, a majority of the coins in the sector saw red.
Surprisingly, Solana [SOL] memecoin Jeo Boden [BODEN] was the only top 15 memecoin that did not see red in the past 24 hours. At press time, BODEN was trading at $0.3479 and its price had grown by 18%.
Also, the TRUMP memecoin was trading at $6.23 and its price had surged by 43.07% in the last 24 hours.
As the U.S. presidential elections inch closer, the popularity of tokens such as TRUMP and BODEN may rise, whereas other meme coins may be affected negatively.
However, after the elections are over, the price of these tokens could crash significantly, which could result in massive losses for holders.
Source: X
The hype around these tokens could diminish the market share of popular meme coins such as SHIB, PEPE and WIF.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the social volume around all three of these tokens had declined significantly over the past three months.
WIF and PEPE had the lowest amount of Social Volume at the time of writing, while SHIB performed marginally better.
Source: Santiment
Another factor that can impact both SHIB, PEPE and WIF immensely would be the sentiment around these tokens.
The Weighted Sentiment for SHIB and PEPE was extremely high, indicating that positive comments around these tokens had surged significantly over the last few days.
However, WIF’s Weighted Sentiment had fallen significantly in the last few days, implying that criticisms around the token had soared materially.
The popularity and the sentiment around these tokens will play a great role in dictating what the future looks like for these tokens going forward.

Cardano Founder Approves Last-Minute Change To Chang Fork


								Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Cardano blockchain, has confirmed the integration of Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) 69 into the upcoming Chang hard fork. This announcement was made via X, emphasizing the adaptation to community feedback and aligning with the demands of the Cardano Foundation (CF).
Hoskinson detailed the decision process and its implications: “I saw the requests coming in for CIP-69. I spoke with the IOI delivery team, and they spoke with the folks at Intersect. There seems to be a lot of community demand for it, and the CF also has been pushing for CIP-69 to be included in Chang.”
The Cardano founder highlighted that he doesn’t expect a major delay because of the last-minute inclusion, “I don’t think it will add a significant delay to the delivery of Chang, but it’s important to understand that out of band roadmap changes are always disruptive and introduce additional risk. This said, the dev teams are going to find a way to roll CIP-69 into Chang.”

CIP-69, primarily authored by developers within the Cardano ecosystem, aims to streamline interactions within Cardano’s Plutus smart contracts by standardizing the input arguments across various types of scripts: spending, certifying, rewarding, and minting.
The primary change proposed is the elimination of the datum argument, a piece often linked to locking validators. Instead, validators will solely require a redeemer and the script context for execution, with datums being accessible via the ScriptContext or by an extension in the TxInfo’s Spending constructor.
This proposal addresses a critical design limitation known as the “mutual dependency issue,” where two validators must know each other’s hash. This has been a substantial barrier to the development of safe and effective decentralized applications (DApps) on Cardano, as it constrains the design space and adds complexity to dApp architectures.
Cardano’s Chang Hard Fork
The Chang hard fork, anticipated to occur in Q2 this year, marks a significant milestone in the Cardano roadmap, transitioning into the “Voltaire” era of governance. This era is characterized by a move towards decentralized governance structures, allowing the community to have a greater say in the development and funding of projects within the ecosystem.

Chang is split into two primary upgrades. Chang Upgrade Number 1: Initiates the deployment of governance features, beginning with the technical bootstrapping phase as outlined in SIP 1694. This phase is crucial for setting up the foundational governance mechanisms.
Chang Upgrade Number 2 advances these mechanisms out of the bootstrapping phase and introduces full-fledged on-chain governance capabilities, such as delegated representative participation and treasury withdrawals. This enables the Cardano community not only to vote on proposals but also to fund them, enhancing the ecosystem’s sustainability and responsiveness to user needs.
Hoskinson also highlighted the need for changes in the roadmap construction process post-Chang: “Post-Chang, the entire process for constructing and ratifying a roadmap between hard forks has to be overhauled to reflect the ability to use CIP-1694’s info action to approve a candidate roadmap. There are several working groups at intersect discussing this, and I’d encourage projects and community members to join and discuss to ensure their preferences and suggestions end up in the new process.”
At press time, ADA traded at $0.452.

Stablecoin Volumes May Come from Automated Activity, but Bot Usage Still Drives DeFi Success | Cryptopolitan

Accurate on-chain data are a challenge, but they are key to estimating real activity and trading volume. Stablecoins are one key measure of activity, both to trade volumes and transactions. Decentralized swaps, liquidity mining, and lending require on-chain interactions with smart contracts. That transaction volume, however, does not reflect trading settlements. A recent study by Bloomberg and Allium Labs shows that stablecoin volumes are often not reported accurately, with about 90% of the activity being driven by automated actions or bots. TRON Blockchain Reports Peak USDT ActivityAccurate reporting can be problematic when one set of coins is used in multiple transactions, leading to double-counting. When stablecoin transactions reached Visa’s levels, it became clear that there was a need for more research. However, real persons or settlements may not be tied to the reported on-chain volumes. The most easily visible discrepancy is between unadjusted and adjusted volumes, based on Visa and Allium’s methodology. The adjusted value is about 10% of the unadjusted value, based on repeating transfers of the same funds.Stablecoins exist on several blockchains with a special focus on DeFi. TRON-based assets, including TRON-based USDT, play a significant role in the ecosystem, besides Ethereum.The TRON network has the biggest reported transaction count and value. TRON-based USDT reportedly carried $5.42 trillion in value since the start of 2023, with close to one billion transactions for that same period.On the second spot, the Binance version of USDT carried around $759.9M transactions since 2023, though with a value of just $671B. The high activity level may signify some of the transactions were either micropayments, or automated by bots.Stablecoin Volumes on the Two Biggest NetworksMost prominent L1 and L2 blockchains have launched stablecoins, especially USDT. Those versions supply decentralized pairs or serve as collaterals. But even in 2024, stablecoins are still concentrated on Ethereum and TRON, with a more noticeable growth for Solana. Most of the significant supply growth happens through printing Ethereum or TRON-based USDT. This metric can also be used to gauge market sentiment and readiness to trade. Stablecoins on other blockchains only have a fraction of the supply and a potentially limited effect on activity. Do Bots Harm DeFi Space or Help with Automation?Bot usage is a well-known fact in crypto trading. Some interactions with DEX or smart contracts are too fast for human use. Other activities have been automated to avoid unwanted market movements. Trades, NFT sniping or automated collaterals are not harming DeFi space, but instead increasing its potential. Even beginner traders can get exposed to automation by picking Telegram bot tokens. DeFi activity measures both transactions and active wallets. During some periods, transactions and trades rise without an increased number of users. This discrepancy can suggest the usage of bots. Most decentralized protocols are not immediately opposed to bot usage. The only problem for bot-driven activity is decentralized gaming, where developers aim to bring in real users, with a single wallet tied to a verified identity. But with projects that do not require KYC, multiple wallets and bots remain a viable strategy.Bot Volumes are Not Really FakeBot-driven volumes are not necessarily fake volumes. In fact, they may be tied to personal wallets and work as tools for speed-trading. Telegram bots are in competition to provide those seamless services, where users do not need to manually order transactions. Automated services like BonkBot have handled more than $5.5B in lifetime trades. Bots have also helped drive the latest meme token trend, by minimizing the time from decision to purchase. Bot trading happens on networks that offer a robust DeFi sector and low trading fees. MEV and Telegram bots work on Solana, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain.

Cardano's ADA Rallies Amid Bullish Market Projections


							

Cardano’s ADA sees renewed investor interest amid price uptick.



ADA’s trading volume surges 80%, indicating growing interest.



Analyst sees ADA’s parallel channel pattern hinting at a breakout.




Cardano’s ADA has recently faced significant scrutiny, creating a stir within the crypto community. The token has long struggled to breach critical price barriers, suffering a monthly decline of over 25%. Hence, investors have voiced concerns over its sluggish price movement on social media. 



However, in the past week, the trajectory shifted as ADA demonstrated a slight uptick of 1.04%, hovering near $0.45 on the weekly chart. As of press time, ADA stands at $0.4534, marking a 3.22% climb over the last 24 hours.







ADA/USD 24-Hour Chart (Source: CoinStats)



Remarkably, the token has eclipsed Bitcoin’s growth, notching a 4.89% gain over the same interval. This sustained momentum has solidified ADA’s stature as the 10th largest digital asset by market capitalization, reaching $16.16 billion—a 2.84% increase.



ADA’s 24-hour trading volume also saw remarkable expansion, surging over 80% to $514.99 million. These developments reflect growing investor confidence in ADA’s potential for further growth and market stability.



Crypto Analyst Projects Major ADA Rally



In an in-depth dissection presented on TradingView, the distinguished crypto analyst FieryTrading illuminated the possibility of Cardano’s ADA initiating a significant bullish trajectory. This keen insight stems from an earlier evaluation, wherein FieryTrading discerned a pattern similar to that of a parallel channel within ADA’s price fluctuations.



This parallel channel, according to FieryTrading, originated from the previous cycle’s peak and extends to the current cycle’s top. It also includes a line drawn from the last cycle’s bottom, a period marked by a significant drop in crypto prices due to the Covid lockdown. Despite identifying this channel back in 2023, FieryTrading maintains that the pattern remains valid in their current analysis.

In the earlier analysis, FieryTrading had projected that if ADA could break out of this parallel channel, its price could soar as high as $35. This bullish sentiment persists in the latest analysis, though with a slight adjustment in the projected price target. 



On Wednesday, FieryTrading noted that ADA still has the potential to reach the top of the channel, which could see its price move towards $30. However, the analyst’s chart indicates a more conservative target of $25 for ADA. Achieving this target would represent an impressive 5,600% increase from its current price level. 









Can ADA Maintain Its Bullish Trend?



From a technical analysis perspective, Cardano’s ADA shows promising potential. The MACD indicator currently trends at -0.00103, just above the signal line and near the zero level. 







ADA/USD 4-Hour Chart (Source: Tradingview)



This suggests weak buying pressure, but if the MACD line continues to rise above zero, a strong bullish breakout may occur. The green bars on the MACD histogram support this assessment, reflecting positive momentum for ADA’s price.



Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow indicator is positioned vertically close to the zero line at -0.02, signaling increased money flow into ADA. This uptick indicates a rising interest among investors. If the indicator crosses above the zero line, it could signal further price gains for ADA in the near future.

It Just Got Easier to Mine Single Bitcoin (BTC), Here's Reason

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



Recent market data shows there is a dramatic shift in the Bitcoin (BTC) network as it relates to mining difficulty. This shift has reduced the mining difficulty, with the hashrate dropping by over 5.6% to 83,148,355,189,239 (83.15 trillion). Per data from BTC.com, this Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment took place at block height 842,688, with the average hashrate coming in at 646.96 EH/s.Bitcoin network difficulty is a measure of how hard it is for miners to verify transactions and add them to a block for rewards. Network difficulty is computed every two weeks, and the metric rises with increasing computers plugging in to mine more Bitcoin. The opposite trend occurs when there are fewer entities plugged into the network.According to the data, the average network hashrate over the trailing seven-day period comes in at 572.18 EH/s, the biggest slump since at least December 2022. This drop, if sustained, means that for the same resources, miners can get additional output with amplified profitability. With the earnings report by crypto mining firms underway, thus far, the favorable mining difficulty is showcased in their enhanced revenue for the first quarter.The Bitcoin ecosystem is under an intense spotlight with the price of the underlying asset down by $61,135.59, or 2.29%, in 24 hours. The coin has been sliding since it recorded an all-time high (ATH) of $73,750.07. However, long-term traders are confident in the asset’s ability to stay resilient and potentially plot a rebound soon.At the moment, bullish sentiment hinges on the take by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who said the network can support more than 3x of its current valuation. For Bitcoin, this would imply a high of $256,000. With Morgan Stanley and Susquehanna reportedly embracing spot Bitcoin ETFs, the optics and potentials are notably well aligned.

ESMA Considers Adding Crypto to €12T Investment Market, Seeks Expert Opinion | Coinspeaker



ESMA wants feedback by August 7, 2024, about whether UCITS can include assets other than traditional stocks and bonds.

The Europe­an Union (EU) is taking a cautious step towards crypto adoption. The­ European Securities and Marke­ts Authority (ESMA), the bloc’s financial watchdog, is asking for e­xpert views on including crypto assets in the­ €12 trillion ($12.8 trillion) Undertakings for Collective Inve­stment in Transferable Se­curities (UCITS) market.
The strategic move highlights a possible­ shift in the EU’s view on cryptocurre­ncies, which has often leane­d towards tighter regulations. The EU was one­ of the first areas to suggest a full plan for crypto asse­ts, called the Markets in Crypto-Asse­ts Regulation (MiCA), which is still under development.




UCITS are­ a group of investment funds create­d to make investment transactions e­asier and more secure­. These funds, which can be structure­d as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or mone­y market funds, are regulate­d by the European Union but available to inve­stors worldwide.
ESMA is asking for feedback, with a de­adline of August 7, 2024, on whether UCITS can include­ exposure to differe­nt types of assets beyond the­ usual stocks and bonds. This list includes structured loans, leve­raged loans, catastrophe bonds, emission allowance­s, commodities, unlisted stocks, and importantly, cryptocurrencie­s.
ESMA’s Cautious Crypto Inclusion
If the European Union’s financial re­gulator approves this proposal, it will not create a standalone­ investment fund e­ntirely composed of cryptocurrencies. Inste­ad, it would pave the way for the cre­ation of multiple investment funds that include­ varying percentages of cryptocurre­ncy assets, catering to investors with diffe­rent risk prefere­nces. 
The Europe­an Union’s regulations currently limit the availability of inde­pendent, crypto-focused inve­stment products. Investors who want this kind of exposure­ have to use exchange­-traded notes (ETNs), which are de­bt-based instruments that follow the price­ of underlying assets like cryptocurre­ncies.
ESMA’s decision line­s up with the trend of regulators be­coming more open to crypto in traditional investme­nts. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the­ US and Hong Kong shows this shift. But it’s important to understand the differe­nce betwee­n these crypto-focused ETFs and the­ varied nature of UCITS funds.
MiCA’s Role in UCITS Regulation
The ESMA is e­xamining how the proposed MiCA regulation could affect including specific cryptocurre­ncies in the UCITS framework. MiCA aims to cre­ate a comprehensive­ regulatory system for crypto assets across the­ EU. It’s unclear how these two rule­s will work together and if they will make­ it easier to integrate­ crypto into the UCITS market.
The­ EU’s exploration of crypto inclusion within UCITS is a significant development. It suggests the­ EU may be more open to cryptocurre­ncies, which could lead to wider crypto adoption in Europe­an investments. Howeve­r, with MiCA still evolving and questions about how to add crypto to UCITS, the path to mainstre­am crypto integration in the EU will likely be­ gradual and cautious.

AI Favorite ARM Earnings Show Cracks Appearing In Ultra Bullish AI Story - ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) - Benzinga

To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.Cracks In Ultra Bullish AI StoryPlease click here for an enlarged chart of Arm Holdings PLC - ADR ARM.Note the following:
	This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of ARM stock is being used to illustrate the point.
	ARM has been one of the top artificial intelligence favorites of the momo crowd.
	ARM is a British semiconductor design firm that is mostly owned by Japanese company SoftBank Group Corp - ADR SFTBY. ARM is known for licensing its designs for smartphone CPUs, such as those used in Apple’s iPhones. Lately, ARM has been pivoting to artificial intelligence.
	The chart shows the gap down after the release of this quarter’s earnings. This indicates another crack in the ultra bullish short-term AI story promoted by momo gurus.
	The chart shows a gap up after last quarter earnings.
	Here are the details of ARM earnings:
	
		ARM reported Q4 (March) earnings of $0.36 vs. $0.30 consensus.
		Revenues came at $928M vs. $866M consensus.
		Revenues rose 46.6% year-over-year.
		For Q1 (June), the company projects earnings of $0.32 - $0.36 vs. $0.31 consensus.
		The company projects revenues of $875M - $925M vs. $866M consensus.
		For FY25, the company projects earnings of $1.45 - $1.65 vs. $1.54 consensus.
		The company sees revenues of $3.8B - $4.1B vs. $3.98B consensus.
		Royalty revenue was $514M up 37% year-over-year.
	
	
	The chart shows that from the peak after last quarter earnings to the recent low, ARM stock lost 47.8% of its value.
	The Arora Report was one of the first to pick up on the AI theme back in 2022 allowing readers and members of The Arora Report to buy artificial intelligence stocks near the lows before the run up started. NVIDIA Corp NVDA is a perfect example of the benefit of knowing early that a change is underway. Click here to see a chart of The Arora Report signals for NVDA.
	ARM stock is falling for two reasons.
	
		Whisper numbers had moved much higher above the consensus going into earnings.  Stocks move based on the difference between whisper numbers and the actual numbers.  Whisper numbers are the numbers that analysts privately share with their best clients.  Whisper numbers are often different from the numbers the same analysts publish.  Whisper numbers is a technique used by analysts to drum up business. This is the reason that prudent investors do not depend on free data that floats around the internet and on the media. Prudent investors know better, but unfortunately many individual investors do analysis based on the free data and then spend years trying to figure out why their analysis never works out.
	

	
		ARM beat the consensus numbers for the prior quarter and raised numbers for the current quarter over the consensus. However, it did not help because whisper numbers were so much higher.
	

	
		For FY25, ARM guidance, even though inline with the consensus numbers, is way below the whisper numbers.
	
	
	On a separate note, in The Arora Report analysis Airbnb Inc ABNB projections indicate that the consumer may be pulling back on summer travel.
	Jobless claims came at 231K vs. 213K consensus. This indicates that the job market is beginning to slow.
U.K.Bank of England (BOE) left its key interest rate unchanged at 5.25%. BOE is expected to cut rates in June.BOE Governor Andrew Bailey says that BOE may reduce interest rates faster than markets expect.   In The Arora Report analysis, BOE moves will likely encourage Powell to do what he is itching to do irrespective of the data.ChinaThe Chinese economy appears to be rebounding. Exports increased 1.5% year-over-year vs. 1.0% consensus.Magnificent Seven Money FlowsIn the early trade, money flows are neutral in Apple Inc AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc Class C GOOG, and Microsoft Corp MSFT.In the early trade, money flows are negative in Meta Platforms Inc META, Tesla Inc TSLA, and NVDA.In the early trade, money flows are negative in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ.Momo Crowd And Smart Money In StocksThe momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is selling stocks in the early trade.GoldThe momo crowd is inactive in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings.The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust GLD. The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust SLV. OilThe momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see oil ratings.The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF USO.BitcoinBitcoin BTC/USD is seeing selling.Protection Band And What To Do NowIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

Here’s Why Ethereum (ETH) Has Been Lagging Behind Bitcoin (BTC), According to Glassnode - The Daily Hodl


								Market intelligence firm Glassnode says Ethereum (ETH) has been lagging behind Bitcoin (BTC) for one key reason.
In a new analysis, Glassnode says that Ethereum has not seen the same level of increased capital from new buyers that Bitcoin has in the current market cycle, which drove the crypto king to new all-time highs (ATHs).










The analysts say that the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) was likely a main driver for the increase in short-term holders who bought BTC in the last 155 days.
“In the run-up to Bitcoin’s all-time high on March 14th, there was a noticeable increase in speculative activity. Specifically, capital accumulation has been observed among short-term holders (STHs), with the USD wealth held within coins moved within the last six months approaching $240 billion, near ATHs. However, this trend has not been mirrored for ETH, which has not yet seen price break above the 2021 ATH. 
Whilst Bitcoin’s STH-Realized Cap is nearly on par with the last bull run peak, ETH’s STH-Realized Cap has barely lifted off the lows, suggesting a markedly lackluster inflow of new capital. In many ways, this lack of new capital inflows is a reflection of the underperformance of ETH relative to BTC. This is likely in part due to the attention and access brought about by the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.”
Source: Glassnode
The Realized Cap metric records the price at which each coin moved and aims to gauge how many holders are in profit or at a loss.
Source: Glassnode
The analysts suggest ETH could see a large capital inflow if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves spot Ethereum ETF applications later this month.
 “The market is still awaiting the SEC’s decision for approval of a suite of ETH ETFs expected towards the end of May.”
Bitcoin is trading for $61,454 at time of writing, down more than 2.6% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading for $2,970 at time of writing, down more than 2.7% on the day.

Analyst Warns Ethereum's Fate Is Tied To Bitcoin: 'If ETH Goes Up From Here, It Would Only Be Due To...' - Benzinga

In a recent development, esteemed analyst Benjamin Cowen has suggested that the future of Ethereum ETH/USD may be heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s BTC/USD performance, potentially leading to further downside for the former.What Happened: According to Cowen, Ethereum could only see a rise if Bitcoin experiences a substantial surge, Daily Hodl reported on Thursday.“If ETH goes up from here, it would only be due to Bitcoin going up a lot more,” he said.Moreover, Cowen anticipates that the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair will likely maintain its downward trend in most scenarios, based on historical patterns. He pointed out, “In eight of 10 quarters, Ethereum/Bitcoin has gone down whether Bitcoin went up, down or sideways.”Cowen also cautioned that monetary policy could adversely affect Ethereum, stating, “ETH/USD is still facing some headwinds here, especially following the potential rejection of the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).”See Also: Here’s How Much $1,000 Invested In Dogecoin Would be Worth If You Invested When Elon Musk First Tweeted About DOGEWhy It Matters: Ethereum has been characterized as this cycle’s underperformer in the cryptocurrency market, with ongoing challenges impacting its valuation and adoption.

Binance: dismissal of DWF Labs investigator

Binance has proceeded to fire the investigator who had discovered market manipulation by the client DWF Labs. 
The former employee and his colleagues in Binance’s market surveillance team had been tasked with identifying signs of illicit activity. The team had prepared a report highlighting the manipulation of various tokens by DWF Labs, a client of Binance.
Let’s see below all the details. 

The dismissal by Binance of the investigator who had discovered irregularities at the client DWF Labs
As anticipated, according to what was reported by the Wall Street Journal, Binance fired an employee who had discovered evidence of market manipulation by DWF Labs.
This is an investment company in cryptocurrencies and one of the exchange’s clients. The news is based on interviews with former and current Binance employees, documents, emails, and other industry participants.
The former employee and his Binance market surveillance team were hired to identify signs of market manipulation and other illicit activities, as part of the exchange’s efforts to ensure compliance with regulations. 
The team discovered that some “VIP” customers, those who trade more than 100 million dollars per month, were involved in pump-and-dump and wash trading schemes, violating Binance’s terms of use.
DWF Labs, which was processing over 4 billion dollars in monthly transactions, became a significant investor in cryptocurrency projects in early 2023, when it participated in several funding rounds in a generally stable market. 
Unlike the traditional venture capital model, DWF Labs, founded by high-frequency cryptocurrency traders, would purchase millions of dollars worth of tokens at a discount, earning profits when their price increased.
Accusations of wash trading: Binance and DWF Labs respond to investigations
Binance investigators have presented a report claiming that DWF Labs had manipulated the price of several tokens with $300 million in wash trading in 2023. 
However, Binance stated that there was not enough evidence of market abuse, according to the WSJ. One week after the report was filed, the head of the team was fired.
Binance told the WSJ that the accusations against DWF Labs were not “fully proven” and rejected the idea of tolerating market manipulation. 
Subsequently, DWF Labs responded on X (previously Twitter), stating that the accusations were “unfounded and distort the facts.”
Binance has also released a response, without mentioning the employee’s dismissal. “We do not tolerate market abuse,” reads a post on X. 
“In the last three years, we have removed nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume exceeding 2.5 trillion dollars for violations of our terms of use.”
Binance adds USDC to the Dual Investment platform
Binance has recently introduced USDC into its Dual Investment platform, offering users a wider range of investment opportunities. 
Thanks to this new addition, users can now use “Buy Low” and “Sell High” type products with a variety of USDC pairs, allowing them to earn rewards on the most popular cryptocurrencies.
The Binance Dual Investment allows users to set the price and settlement date to buy or sell cryptocurrencies in the future, without fees. 
This option offers flexibility and potential earnings to those who wish to invest in cryptocurrencies at a lower price or earn higher returns on their holdings.
Users who want to accumulate rewards on their cryptocurrencies or sell at higher prices in the future can take advantage of the “Sell High” option, which supports currencies like BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, and many others.
For those looking to invest in stablecoins or buy cryptocurrencies at lower prices, the “Buy Low” option is based on USDC.
It is important to keep in mind that Dual Investment may suspend new registrations at any time and that the APR (annual percentage rate) may vary depending on market conditions. 
Binance recommends users to use the Dual Investment Beginner mode, which provides a detailed guide to the subscription process and a glossary of important terms.
Overall, the integration of USDC into Binance’s Dual Investment platform expands investment options, offering users greater opportunities to earn rewards on the most popular cryptocurrencies.

Solana Slerf to Rally 9,000%, as it Looks to Take on Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin



                    

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Slerf presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Slerf has market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 9,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Slerf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Solana Slerf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Slerf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Slerf by entering its contract address – D2R7sKwPNpWGtEfMJiLVe5G2ZJbExnk98PEft2dhyCrL – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLSLERF.

How UK's Staking and Stablecoin Rules Could Shape Its Future - DailyCoin


        
The UK has prepared to unveil new crypto regulations targeting staking and stablecoins.



This move aims to solidify the UK’s status as a crypto hub, but political uncertainties are challenging it.



The regulations’ success hinges on balancing investor protection and fostering a thriving crypto sector.
The United Kingdom is inching closer to a significant milestone for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The government, led by the Conservative Party, is on the verge of passing new regulations focused on staking and stablecoins, aiming to solidify the UK’s position as a global hub for digital assets.UK Considers Rules for StakingThis push for regulation comes amid increasing crypto adoption worldwide. Staking, a process where users lock up their holdings to participate in network validation and earn rewards, has become a popular way to generate passive income within the crypto ecosystem. 
On the other hand, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar, offering price stability absent in most traditional cryptocurrencies. Economic Secretary Bim Afolami, a key figure spearheading the legislative effort, recently emphasized the urgency of these regulations at the Financial Times Crypto and Digital Asset Summit. “What I’m very confident we’ll be able to achieve is the secondary legislation around staking and stablecoins. Those two things are absolute priorities in the coming weeks and months,” Afolami stated.The Conservative Party’s crypto ambitions, however, face potential roadblocks. Recent local election losses to the Labour Party highlight a shifting political landscape that could impact the legislative process. The looming general election adds another layer of uncertainty.UK Crypto Regulations: Good or Bad for Investors?Despite these challenges, the government remains committed to its crypto agenda. They believe these regulations will enhance market stability and provide a clear and structured framework for the UK’s crypto sector. Establishing a transparent and well-regulated environment could, in turn, attract more businesses and bolster investor confidence.The UK’s staking and stablecoin regulations have the potential to significantly shape its future as a hub for cryptocurrency activity, with both potential benefits and drawbacks to consider:Potential Benefits
Increased Investor Confidence: Clear and well-defined regulations can create a more secure and stable environment for cryptocurrency activities. This can attract more investors, both domestic and international, who might be hesitant to enter a largely unregulated market.



Market Stability: Regulations can help mitigate risks associated with fraud and manipulation in the crypto market. This can lead to greater stability in cryptocurrency prices, making them more attractive for mainstream adoption.



Innovation and Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector in the UK can attract new businesses and foster innovation in blockchain technology. This could lead to job creation and economic growth, solidifying the UK’s position as a global financial center.
Potential Drawbacks
Stifling Innovation: Overly restrictive regulations could stifle innovation in the crypto sector. This could hinder the development of new technologies and applications, putting the UK at a disadvantage compared to countries with more lenient regulations.



Reduced Competitiveness: Stringent regulations could make the UK a less attractive destination for crypto businesses than countries with more relaxed regulatory frameworks. This could lead to missed opportunities for economic growth.



Political Uncertainty: The upcoming general election in the UK injects uncertainty into the legislative process. A change in government could lead to a shift in priorities, potentially delaying or even stalling the implementation of these regulations.
Overall, the impact of the UK’s staking and stablecoin regulations will depend on how effectively they strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting investors. If successful, these regulations could propel the UK to the forefront of the global crypto scene. However, if they are too restrictive, they could hinder the growth of the crypto sector and limit the UK’s potential in this rapidly evolving space.On the Flipside
The proposed regulations only target staking and stablecoins, leaving other aspects of the crypto industry unregulated. 



The UK’s regulations might not align with those of other countries, creating fragmentation and complicating cross-border crypto activities for businesses and investors.
Why This MattersThe UK’s regulations targeting staking and stablecoins could set a precedent for global crypto adoption. A successful framework could attract investment, boost stability, and solidify the UK as a crypto hub, but overly strict rules risk stifling innovation and competitiveness. This delicate balance will determine the regulations’ impact on the cryptocurrency market’s future.Interested in how the UK tackles crypto crime?

Obligate to Utilize Lisk's Layer 2 Network With New Deployment



                    

Lisk, a key player in the Layer 2 blockchain arena and part of the Optimism Superchain, has announced a strategic collaboration with Obligate, a Swiss-based on-chain capital markets platform known for its innovative financial services on the blockchain. This partnership marks a significant step for both entities as they leverage Lisk’s network to enhance decentralized financial services, particularly in emerging markets.



Obligate will operate on Lisk L2, which is celebrated for its high efficiency, speed, and scalability. This integration is underpinned by Ethereum within the Optimism Superchain framework, ensuring robust security and performance. The primary aim of this collaboration is to empower businesses in emerging markets by offering easier access to capital solutions through blockchain technology, thereby bypassing traditional banking hurdles like high interest rates and intermediaries.




Dominic Schwenter, CPO of Lisk, expressed his enthusiasm about the partnership, stating, “Lisk has consistently led the way in making blockchain technology accessible, focusing specifically on solving real-world problems in emerging markets. Integrating Obligate’s platform with Lisk not only promotes financial inclusion but also pioneers advanced solutions for real-world assets (RWA) and off-chain assets (OCA). This deployment is a crucial step towards our goal of introducing the next billion people to the Web3 ecosystem.”



Echoing Schwenter’s sentiments, Benedikt Schuppli, co-founder of Obligate, highlighted the synergy between Lisk L2’s capabilities and Obligate’s mission. “Lisk L2’s design to support real-world applications and assets aligns perfectly with Obligate’s mission to offer secure and regulated blockchain solutions. Our partnership will provide robust, efficient, and transparent financial options to the regions most in need, and we are eager to witness the positive impacts of our joint efforts.”



The deployment of Obligate on Lisk L2 holds particular significance for its potential to transform how businesses utilize real-world assets for funding. By streamlining the access to capital, Lisk L2 and Obligate aim to enable businesses to leverage their physical assets more effectively, fostering economic growth and stability in challenging markets.




This collaboration not only utilizes Lisk L2’s technological advantages, such as enhanced scalability and improved user experience, but also sets a precedent for adopting blockchain solutions in markets with diverse technological infrastructures.

Did Regulations Push LocalMonero Out? Privacy Coin Platform Bites The Dust


								The winds of regulatory change are howling through the cryptocurrency space, and a prominent victim has emerged. LocalMonero, a veteran P2P (peer-to-peer) trading platform for the privacy-focused Monero (XMR) coin, announced its closure on May 7th, citing a combination of “internal and external factors.” This move has sent shockwaves through the Monero community and reignited the debate between financial privacy and regulatory oversight.

LocalMonero: P2P Platforms In The Crosshairs
LocalMonero’s demise comes amidst a period of heightened scrutiny by US authorities towards the crypto industry. From the arrest of the developers behind the privacy-focused Samourai Wallet to the SEC’s crackdown on centralized exchanges like Robinhood, regulators are wielding a heavy hand in an effort to enforce anti-money laundering (AML) and securities laws. P2P platforms, with their decentralized nature and potential for anonymous transactions, have become a particular point of concern.


While the exact reasons behind LocalMonero’s closure remain shrouded in some mystery, the timing paints a bleak picture. The platform’s decision to shut down follows a warning from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental watchdog, highlighting the potential misuse of P2P platforms for illicit financing. This, coupled with the ongoing delisting of privacy coins by major centralized exchanges, creates a chilling effect on the entire privacy-focused crypto ecosystem.

Privacy Vs. Regulation: A Collision Course
The closure of LocalMonero has sparked outrage and fear within the Monero community. Many see it as a blatant attack on their right to financial privacy. Freedom advocates have labeled the current regulatory landscape a “war on crypto,” urging users to band together and learn about digital privacy tools. They also compare the government’s approach to “terrorism,” arguing that it stifles innovation and creates an atmosphere of fear.

However, the concerns of regulators shouldn’t be entirely dismissed. Privacy coins, with their ability to obfuscate transaction details, can indeed be attractive for those seeking to launder money or finance illegal activities. Striking a balance between user privacy and effective AML/KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations is a complex challenge.
The Future of Privacy-Focused Crypto
The future of privacy-focused crypto projects like Monero hangs in the balance. While LocalMonero remains optimistic, pointing to upcoming developments within the Monero ecosystem like Haveno DEX and Full Chain Member Proofs (FCMP), the regulatory pressure is undeniable.

Airbnb Shares Slide Over 6% on Weaker-Than-Expected Q2 Outlook - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) shares tumbled more than 6% on Wednesday after the vacation rental company issued a weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter.



The stock had gained about 9.34% over the past 12 months. For the quarter ending March 2024, Airbnb had reported an EPS of $0.41, beating expectations by approximately 75%.



Airbnb Stock Price Update



Airbnb shares fell over 6% since the market opened at the time of writing, trading at $147. The stock finds a zone of support between $141 and $148 from the 200-day moving average and price action dating back to September last year.



However, failure to hold above this support zone opens the door for Airbnb’s stock price to potentially decline to lower support around $126.





Why Airbnb Stock Dipped Today



Airbnb reported first-quarter revenue of $2.14 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.41, beating analyst estimates of $2.06 billion in revenue and $0.24 EPS. Despite the strong results, Airbnb’s second-quarter revenue forecast of $2.68-$2.74 billion, representing 8-10% growth, had its midpoint below the $2.74 billion Wall Street consensus, disappointing investors.



The company cited headwinds to second-quarter results from the timing of Easter, an extra leap-year day in the first quarter, and foreign exchange fluctuations. Jefferies maintained a Hold rating and $150 price target on Airbnb stock, stating that the results failed to ease growing fears of slowing growth.

Ripple and XRPL Labs Join Digital Asset Recovery Protocol DeRec Alliance | Coinspeaker



The DeRec Alliance now has Ripple and XRPL Labs as founding members, as they develop a protocol for easy asset recovery.

Ripple and XRP Labs are now members of the Decentralized Recovery (DeRec) Alliance, an association formed to create an open-source and industry-standard methodology to simplify digital asset recovery. Along with Hedera blockchain network developer Swirld Labs, and the Algorand Foundation, Ripple and XRPL Labs are the founding members of the DeRec Alliance.
DeRec Alliance Simplifies for Crypto Asset Recovery
An official press release notes that today’s Web3 applications require a “highly sophisticated user” that understands and can handle the task of securing sensitive information, including digital assets, keys, accounts, and passwords. With decentralized recovery, self-custody, cold storage, and other forms of account recovery are unnecessary.




The Alliance was founded by Dr. Leemon Baird, also the co-founder of Hedera. Baird stated:
“The DeRec Alliance is a group of individuals and organizations committed to making the process of securing and recovering digital assets, accounts, passwords, and other secrets as simple as existing Web2 experiences. We encourage every blockchain and every industry to work together to create the standards and the open source code needed to bring safety to the promise of Web3, without the complexity.”
Members of the DeRec Alliance also include The Hashgraph Association, Casper Association, Acoer, and Constellation Network. Others are The HBAR Foundation, Revive Labs, The Building Blocks, Blade Labs, and BankSocial. All Alliance members are tasked with providing input and feedback on policies that will help create an interoperable recovery standard. The plan is to ease the recovery and adoption of crypto and other assets.
According to Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President of RippleX, the developer and community platform created by Ripple, The DeRec Alliance solves one of the biggest problems facing crypto adoption. Infanger said by developing clear standards for key recovery, the Alliance gives users more control and boosts their confidence. XRPL Labs founder and CEO Wietse Wind echoed Infanger’s sentiments, adding that user-friendly solutions for key recovery are essential to mass retail adoption.
The DeRec Alliance features a Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) with two-year seats filled by founding members. The TOC’s function is to offer input on the Alliance’s governance structure and core policies.
DeRec Protocol Shares Secrets among “Helpers”
The Alliance’s method is the Decentralized Recovery (DeRec) open-source protocol that takes a secret-sharing approach to recovery data management. The protocol helps a user share secrets among a list of helpers (businesses or friends)that can help the user recover their secret whenever necessary. Each helper’s share does not indicate any information about the original secret, which can only be properly compiled by the original user. Also, the user can reconstruct their original secret even if only half the helpers reveal their shares. This works even if the user has lost their primary two-factor recovery device, such as their phone.
To maintain availability, the DeRec protocol periodically uses regular confirmations to ensure that helpers still hold their shares of the secret. In addition, the protocol initiates automatic re-sharing whenever the secret changes, or a helper leaves or joins. Throughout the process, the user never has to reveal any helper’s identity or the number of helpers they have. In the same way, helpers also do not have information about other helpers.

Binance Rejects Secret Crypto Settlement as Nigerian Authorities Detain Compliance Chief



                    

Recent revelations have surfaced regarding the interactions between Nigerian officials and Binance representatives, implicating that Nigerian authorities attempted to pressure Binance into an undisclosed settlement paid in cryptocurrency. 



These events reportedly transpired during meetings early in 2024.




Binance’s CEO, Richard Teng, has spoken out about the situation, specifically addressing the ongoing detention of Tigran Gambaryan, a former agent of the United States Internal Revenue Service and the current head of Binance’s financial crime compliance team. Gambaryan was detained in Nigeria while on a business trip. 



According to Teng, this incident marks a concerning precedent as it reflects the potential risks global companies may face when operating internationally.



Teng’s statement condemned the Nigerian government’s approach, claiming it set a “dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide” following the detainment of Gambaryan and another employee. 




He narrated how Binance made efforts to engage positively with Nigerian officials, participating in regulatory discussions and collaborating with law enforcement to address any concerns transparently.



The matter escalated after Binance was invited to a public investigative hearing by the chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC). 



Despite being prepared to address any allegations in a public forum, Teng noted that the details of the accusations were not provided to them, leading to their request to respond in writing, a proposal still pending response from the committee.



Amidst these discussions, Binance personnel were approached by unidentified individuals offering to settle the allegations secretly using cryptocurrency, demanding a substantial payment within 48 hours.

Teng disclosed that their local legal counsel was presented with these terms by an agent of the HCFC, emphasizing the secretive and urgent nature of the deal. Binance declined the offer and continued to seek a diplomatic resolution to the matter.



Following the refusal, further meetings were arranged involving representatives from various Nigerian governmental bodies, including the National Security Adviser’s office and the Central Bank of Nigeria, among others. 



Despite the complexity of the situation, Teng stated that Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, head of Binance Africa, were assured of their safety for these meetings.



However, the situation worsened when Nigerian officials detained Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, confiscated their passports and phones, and demanded that Binance comply with specific requests, including delisting the Nigerian naira from their platform. 



In response to the escalating demands and the continued detention of its employees, Binance has temporarily shut down certain services in Nigeria, hoping to secure their release and resolve the situation amicably.

Robinhood (HOOD) Wells Notice Shouldn’t Deter Eventual SEC Approval of an Ether (ETH) Spot ETF: JPMorgan

The popular trading platform received the notice – a preliminary warning from the regulator about potential enforcement action – on May 4, the company said in a filing on Monday. The notice should be viewed as a “continued attempt by the SEC to reinforce its position that all crypto tokens outside bitcoin and ether should be classified as securities,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.

Binance banned Tron Foundation for market manipulation, report


A report from the Wall Street Journal has alleged that on multiple occasions, Binance ignored its own internal investigations about market manipulation in favor of preserving relationships with important clients. 
In one case in 2023, a trading firm called DWF Labs, led by Russian Andrei Grachev, was making over $4 billion in trades on Binance per month. DWF allegedly offered a service to clients where it would create “artificial volume” and drive up the price of tokens. 
One example described in the report is about Yield Guild Games, a token that DWF invested in. Grachev tweeted about it, DWF sold a huge number of tokens, and very shortly afterwards, the price of the token collapsed. 

Following some of these events, the internal surveillance team at Binance recommended removing DWF and included wash trades it identified as part of this analysis.
However, a second internal Binance team investigated the surveillance team, allegedly determining that the wash trades conducted by the firm, which advertised its ability to create “artificial volume,” may have been accidental, after which Binance chose not to offload DWF Labs.
The report claims that two traders accounted for two-thirds of all Binance volume in 2023, which may have motivated the reticence.
This internal surveillance team also raised concerns about Binance’s own internal accounts trading cryptocurrencies on Binance, an allegation which was echoed in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) complaint that Binance recently settled.

Following the surveillance team’s report about DWF, the Wall Street Journal noted that the head of the team was fired, several other investigators were ‘laid-off’ as a ‘cost-saving measure’, and others resigned. 
Tron and Justin Sun
Grachev previously worked for Huobi, now HTX, leading it’s Russian arm. HTX is advised by Justin Sun, who also leads the Tron Foundation, which also ran afoul of Binance’s internal investigators.
In the months following Sun and the Tron Foundation being charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with market manipulation and wash trading last year, Binance decided to off-board the Tron Foundation. 
However, despite the alleged market manipulation of the Tron Foundation, Binance did still decide to make TrueUSD a ‘zero-fee’ base asset for a variety of trading pairs around the same time they were offboarding Tron Foundation. Sun has been accused of owning TrueUSD but denies the accusations. Sun has admitted he is a ‘partner market maker’ for this asset, and the previous issues with Sun projects manipulating markets did not prevent Binance from embracing this project. 

More recently, the market cap of TrueUSD has collapsed as Binance has moved to other stablecoins like First Digital USD.
The Wall Street Journal report alleges a culture of allowing illicit activity to continue as long as it benefits Binance.

Donald Trump Says 'You Better Vote' For Him If You're Pro-Crypto: But Has He Always Been 'Fine With It'? - Benzinga

Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday publicly endorsed cryptocurrency, declaring it a significant election issue—a move that contrasts with President Joe Biden‘s perceived unfamiliarity with the crypto world.What Happened: In a series of video clips uploaded by Frank Degods, a notable NFT creator and influencer, Trump expressed his support for the crypto industry.Addressing a group of buyers of his NFTs, Trump contrasted his approach with that of President Joe Biden: “I’m fine with it,” Trump stated, adding, “If you like crypto in any form… if you’re in favor of crypto you’d better vote for Trump.” His comments were met with enthusiasm from the crypto community.The remarks were reportedly made during a gathering organized by Trump to meet with purchasers of his “Mugshot Edition” NFTs. Attendees, who individually acquired over 47 NFTs priced at $99 each, were treated to dinner with the former president. Trump emphasized his role in revitalizing interest in NFTs, declaring, "We made NFTs hot again."Trump also addressed the issue of crypto firms leaving the US due to what he termed as “hostility” from Democrats and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. He emphasized the need to embrace these firms.Also Read: JPMorgan Analysts Optimistic About Future Approval Of Spot Ether ETFs Despite Regulatory HurdlesWhy It Matters: This marks a significant shift in Trump’s stance on crypto, having previously dismissed Bitcoin as a scam against the dollar in 2021. He also called crypto a “disaster waiting to happen” in 2021. The former President warmed up to digital assets over time, noting in March this year that he is “having fun with crazy new currencies.” Avichal Garg, Co-founder of Electric Capital, lauded Trump’s evolving stance on crypto, suggesting it could have implications for the political landscape. However, Trump's campaign declined to provide further comment on the matter.The comments come on the same day as President Biden’s announcement that he would veto a resolution seeking to repeal a Securities and Exchange Commission accounting policy, which makes it more expensive for financial institutions to custody digital assets.What’s Next: These topics are poised to be hotly debated at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry leaders will discuss the evolving relationship between cryptocurrency and mainstream politics.Read Next: Is Ethereum ‘This Cycle’s Basket Case’? 10x Research Points Out ETH’s ‘Only Bull Story’Image: Shutterstock

Ether Reverts to Inflationary Asset Following Fee-Reducing Dencun Upgrade

Ether was a deflationary asset following the Merge, with the total supply of the token dropping from 120.491 million to 120.097 million since September 2022. However, the total amount of fees burned decoupled from network activity following Dencun, meaning that the natural increase in supply is outpacing the amount burned in fees. Ether's supply has thus increased by 400,000 tokens since April.

Elon Musk Enables Dogecoin (DOGE) Payment for Tesla, Is DOGE Integration Imminent for X too? - Benzinga

Elon Musk has strongly supported DOGE for several years, dating back to his first tweet about the token in 2019. Since then, Musk has made multiple moves to incorporate DOGE into his various business ventures. Most recently, he has enabled DOGE as a form of payment for Tesla merchandise and is securing payment licenses for his social media platform, X. These moves signal that Musk is intent on providing DOGE payments on X, which could have a huge impact on the cryptocurrency industry. Don't Miss:In early May 2024, Musk and Tesla quietly enabled DOGE payments on the Tesla website. The new feature came after Musk visited the Berlin gigafactory, where he was asked about enabling DOGE payments. "We should enable that," Musk responded. Tesla customers can now send DOGE to the Tesla wallet in exchange for merchandise. Though Tesla did not formally announce the change, DOGE enthusiasts were quick to spot it and the price of DOGE rallied more than 20% in the following days. Additionally, Musk and X have been acquiring payment licenses in U.S. states. At the time of this report, they hold 25 licenses, and the count is growing monthly. These licenses are necessary for enabling peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, similar to how Venmo and Cash App operate. Also, an interesting anecdote from Musk's biography notes that he had dreamed of offering DOGE as a form of payment on a social media platform long before he even acquired X. So, the money transmitter licenses could indicate that the X team is moving closer toward DOGE payments on the platform.This idea was furthered by a retweet from Musk that had a picture of the old X.com logo next to the current X.com logo with the caption "The Everything App." The post was originally tweeted by a DogeDesigner on X. The account says that they work for DOGE, doing UX/UI design. Musk commented on the retweet saying, "The circle will be complete." The post currently has over 65 million views and 126,000 likes. The old X.com was a banking and payment website in the early 2000s that Musk founded. The company merged with Confinity to form PayPal, where Musk served a short stint as CEO. Flash forward to 2024, and Musk is hoping to complete the circle by bringing back the payment aspect of the original X.com. So, the signs point toward Musk wanting to offer DOGE as a form of peer-to-peer payment on the X platform. However, different regulatory hurdles could make this somewhat challenging. Acquiring the payment licenses is a very tedious and slow process. However, Musk seems determined to bring payments to the app and move closer to the "everything app" that he has envisioned for years. Read Next:

SEC Delivers Deadly Blow To Ripple’s Latest Stablecoin Project | Bitcoinist.com


								Ripple has run into problems once again with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following the announcement of its highly anticipated stablecoin. The stablecoin, which is to be pegged to the US dollar, is expected to give established stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC a run for their money. However, the SEC is less than pleased with this launch, going after Ripple before it even launches.
SEC Says New Stablecoin Qualifies As Securities Offering
In April 2024, Ripple announced that it is launching its very own stablecoin that will be pegged to the US dollar. This stablecoin launch came as part of the company’s continuous expansion worldwide, as it continues to spread its wings in the payments sector.
CEO Brad Garlinghouse had revealed that the company’s reasoning behind the launch was to help combat the de-pegging events in stablecoins through the years that have cost crypto investors billions. While this sounds like a noble endeavor, the US SEC is less than pleased.
According to the regulator, the stablecoin which Ripple plans to launch qualifies as an unregistered crypto asset. This was made known in a redacted brief filed by the SEC in the ongoing legal battle with the crypto firm.
The regulator’s most recent allegations tie back into its claims that XRP, which was launched in 2012, qualifies as an unregistered security offering. The SEC argues that Ripple has built its business on offering unregistered securities to investors, and its latest stablecoin project falls under that umbrella as well.
“Ripple’s primary business continues to be, as it has been since 2013, unregistered sales of XRP. It also plans to issue a new unregistered crypto asset,” the filing read. Given this, it seems the regulator is trying to stop Ripple ahead of launch, which is scheduled to happen toward the end of 2024.
The State Of Ripple’s Lawsuit
Even though Ripple has been able to secure a number of partial victories against the SEC in the last year, such as Judge Analisa Torres ruling that secondary programmatic sales did not qualify as a securities offering, its battle with the regulator is far from over.
A settlement is expected between both parties, but even that is proving to be a challenge. The SEC is demanding a $2 billion fine to be levied against the crypto firm as an appropriate amount for the ‘violations.’ However, Ripple has fired back against this, offering only $10 million, which the regulator has called a “slap on the wrist”.
Both parties are currently in the remedies stage, filing their briefs along with their supporting exhibits. Given this, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty believes that the almost 4-year long battle is coming to an end. “The good news is that we are closer than ever to putting this lawsuit behind us,” Alderoty stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post.

                        The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) may be the next “killer use case” for the crypto industry.Investment bank Citi released a report in March 2023 showing that the market for RWAs is projected to reach $4 trillion to $5 trillion by the year 2030. The report notes that the potential for tokenization via blockchain is transformative, yet the technology is still not at the point of mass adoption. While this may be the case, industry experts believe that artificial intelligence (AI) solutions could push tokenized RWA use cases forward.
Understanding Tokenized RWAs
RWA tokenization has been a long-time concept and dates back to 2018 when security token offerings (STOs) were all the rage. Fortunately, today’s tokenized RWAs differ from previously seen STOs, which were largely unregulated.Dave Hendricks, CEO and Co-founder of Vertalo, told Cryptonews that RWAs now have a degree of tangibility.“If a custodian can’t hold on to the asset legally, and if it’s not considered a high-quality liquid asset by banks for international settlements, then some might not even consider that an RWA asset in the traditional sense,” explained Hendricks.Hendricks added that Vertalo – a digital transfer agent and enterprise software platform – has been tokenizing RWAs since 2018. According to Hendricks, tokenization use cases are an important part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.He noted that use cases like stablecoins differ from tokenizing valuable and scarce assets like art, diamonds, or real estate.“Assets like art, diamonds or even real estate can now be fractionalized via tokenization,” said Hendricks. “Investors can now own part of that asset and receive income from the lease or use of the asset. When you tokenize an asset, each token represents a percentage of the asset.”
Benefits of Tokenized RWAs
While Hendricks pointed out that tokenizing RWAs makes assets more easily tradable, he noted that a tangible benefit of tokenized RWAs lies in their transparency and mid/back-office applications within the traditional asset management function.“This is why we are now seeing large financial institutions looking at improving asset management functions using distributed ledger technology,” he said.This appears to be the case, as the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, recently led a $47 million funding round for Securitize. The company focuses on bringing physical and traditional financial assets onto the blockchain.Payments giant Mastercard also announced on Wednesday that it will test new distributed ledger technology to enable tokenized asset settlement between its entities. In a May 8 statement, Mastercard said the project is focused on increasing the efficiency of cross-border settlements and reducing the chance of error and fraud.
How AI Can Help Tokenized RWA Use Cases
While it’s notable that the tokenization of RWAs is gaining traction, industry experts believe that AI will help advance use cases.Meysam Alizadeh, Senior Researcher at the Digital Democracy Lab at University of Zurich and CEO of Coinfident, told Cryptonews that AI can help with RWA token trades.For example, Alizadeh mentioned that AI can enable asset value prediction.“Imagine a venture capitalist (VC) that manages multiple startups and RWAs and uses them to back a token,” said Alizadeh. “In this case, given the availability of a VC’s portfolio, AI can be used to predict the future values of its assets and RWAs of its startups, or to predict demand for their services.”Alizadeh added that this can help traders have a better understanding of the future valuation of a VC’s portfolio.“This could result in a better valuation of its RWA token,” he said.
Using AI for Predictive Pricing of RWAs
To put this in perspective, Jacques Voorhees – CEO and Founder of tokenization platform RealCap – told Cryptonews that RealCap would soon be using AI to help determine the price of RWAs.Voorhees explained that RealCap initially began tokenizing diamonds but noted that the platform now helps tokenize rare artwork and other unique assets.“When we started with diamonds, we didn’t need to use AI for price predictions,” said Voorhees. “But once RealCap began tokenizing RWAs with less available pricing information, we realized we needed an AI solution to help determine prices.”Voorhees elaborated that RealCap recently created a technology called “virtual fungibility,” allowing tokenized RWAs to be more tradable with reduced price discrepancies.Yet he noted that virtual fungibility requires AI to determine the price of certain RWAs.“Let’s say an investor wants to buy art,” he said. “They can go online to different galleries, but an investor still may not know what the best price is for a piece of art. You need an objective measure. AI can help with predicative prices of each piece of art in this instance.”RealCap is currently building and developing its AI solution to ensure predictive pricing.
Using AI To Streamline RWA Workflows 
Alizadeh further noted that AI could be applied to automate RWA workflow analysis.“One of the risks of RWA tokenization is smart contract bugs and vulnerabilities,” he said. “AI can help in two ways here – the technology can help to create reliable smart contracts, to streamline contract reviews and to detect potential bugs and compliance issues.”Natalia Karayaneva, CEO and Founder of Propy, told Cryptonews that Propy is using AI for this particular case.Propy has been tokenizing real estate since 2018 and has conducted over $4 billion in transactions across the United States. According to Karayaneva, Propy recently began using AI to streamline transaction timelines automatically.“Propy AI can read purchase agreements, create transaction trackers, and settle intelligent deadlines for deposits, loan approvals, and more,” said Karayaneva. “This level of automation ensures a smoother, secure, and more transparent property investment process, which is crucial as we integrate more into tokenized markets.”Alizadeh elaborated that AI is being applied for customer risk analysis for platforms like Propy and other tokenized RWA lending outlets.“AI can be used to evaluate the credibility of the borrower, taking into consideration the borrower’s past on-chain transactions and activities,” he said. “This is similar to the credit scoring system in the US, which banks use to evaluate the risk of the customers.”
Challenges Associated with Tokenized RWAs and AI
While AI will likely advance tokenized RWA use cases, Alizadeh warned that challenges may hamper adoption.For instance, he pointed out that data around the AI applications mentioned may not be easily accessible.“AI needs data to work, and limited data access decreases AI usability,” he said.Alizadeh further remarked that decentralized exchange users may not be required to undergo Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. This may result in a lack of information about a user’s demographic and location, impacting a customer risk assessment AI model.“Another data access challenge is getting all on-chain transactions of a user,” added Alizadeh. “Since everyone can hold multiple wallets and the identity of wallet holders is not easily verifiable, it’s not easy to get all on-chain transaction history of a crypto user. Most of the solutions to these challenges may be in conflict with users’ privacy and need more research to overcome.”
Tokenization Challenges Beyond AI
AI aside, Alizadeh believes that the primary challenges associated with tokenized RWAs are regulatory issues and asset verification.“Tokenizing an asset, such as a building, could turn them into securities, potentially attracting strict regulatory scrutiny,” Alizadeh mentioned. “This would likely decrease the incentives of RWA tokens.”He added that the verifiable authenticity of the assets underpinning RWA tokens remains problematic.“Crypto traders often express skepticism about the validity of claims concerning a token’s real-world backing asset,” he remarked.With these challenges in mind, Hendricks explained that tokenized RWAs must be carefully structured to be successful.For example, he noted that most tokenized RWAs in DeFi are debt or loan instruments.“Many if not most RWA offerings are just loans where investors put in collateral and get paid back an interest rate,” Hendricks said. “This is very lightly regulated and anyone can participate in this model. However, there may be recourse if collateral is lost and value declines.”Hendricks added that a security can be created from a tokenized RWA if the underlying asset has a secured interest.“For example, if a startup is raising money to buy an asset and fractionalize it under Reg D requirements, it can generally be sold to accredited investors,” he said. “You would then have to go through KYC and AML procedures, which would create a significant speed bump. RWA by itself doesn’t solve this, unfortunately.”

Espresso and Polygon Labs partner to address rollup interoperability - Crypto Briefing




Espresso Systems, a shared sequencer developer, has partnered with Polygon Labs, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution. The collaboration is meant to build out and produce an aggregation layer (AggLayer) that could solve the problem of fragmented liquidity across interoperable rollups.AggLayer, first introduced in January, is designed to enable transaction verification across multiple chains using a process called “proof aggregation.” This ensures that transactions across its ecosystems are valid without relying on third-party bridging solutions. Documentation from Polygon Labs state that all transactions will be guaranteed on AggLayer, providing a seamless experience for users.“Blockchains today don’t look or feel like the Internet. Instead of a unified, highly scalable network, users face scaling limitations and bad UX due to fragmented liquidity and state,” Polygon Labs said.The Espresso Shared Sequencer is a decentralized system that serves as a sequencer and data availability point to connect a variety of L2s. With such an infrastructure, the credibility, interoperability, and alignment with Ethereum, are enhanced to better achieve autonomy, neutrality, and collaboration among EVM chains.“Our respective teams have been thinking deeply about layer-2 interoperability over the last year — it’s amazing to see our solutions converge in such a synergistic way,” Espresso Labs CEO Ben Fisch said in an interview.Other projects such as Nil Foundation are also building out either modular or integrated approaches to solving scalability in Ethereum. For comparison, projects such as zkSync are pursuing “vertical” scaling, while Nil Foundation is building on “horizontal” scaling with the idea of embedding the sequencer to a protocol to enable transactions across different shards.Espresso has received significant funding in the past, including $28 million in a Series B round led by a16z crypto. Notably, Espresso serves as a marketplace for shared sequencing, allowing rollups to auction the rights to build their blocks. This market enables rollups to offer sequencing timeslots to shared sequencers through an auction. Espresso, on this end, will act as the coordinator that unifies the interdependent rollups prior to settlement on Ethereum.

FTX Bankruptcy: Fallen Exchange To Amass up to $5,100,000,000 More Than What Users Lost at Time of Collapse - The Daily Hodl


								The bankrupt crypto exchange FTX now has holdings worth billions of dollars more than the legally approved claims made by its creditors.
A recently filed disclosure statement indicates that FTX’s bankruptcy estate estimates it will hold net distributable proceeds between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion on September 30th, the projected start date for the exchange’s reorganization plan.










FTX only owes creditors approximately $11.2 billion, putting the bankrupt exchange’s creditors in a position to recover between 118% and 142% of their claim values, according to the disclosure statement.
However, FTX’s creditors’ digital asset claims are denominated in dollars and based on the near-bottom crypto prices at the time of the disgraced exchange’s collapse in November 2022. Crypto prices had cratered at the time due to the FTX turmoil and the related contagion spreading throughout the sector.
Bitcoin (BTC), for example, was trading at around $16,600 on November 14th, 2022, compared to $61,435 at time of writing. Ethereum (ETH) was trading at around $1,250, compared to $2,969, currently.
The increased dollar payouts for FTX creditors are thanks to the soaring crypto prices this year and the exchange’s sale of a stake in the AI (artificial intelligence) safety and research company Anthropic.
Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty late last year of defrauding investors and mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds related to the multi-billion-dollar downfall of the exchange in 2022.
On March 28th, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison and three years of supervised release. He also ordered the 32-year-old to pay $11 billion in forfeiture. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.

Binance Financial Penalty In Canada Is $4.3 Million For Unregistered Operations - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Canadian regulators fined Binance $4.3 million for failure to register as a foreign money services business and report large cryptocurrency transactions.



The Binance financial penalty comes amidst a series of legal challenges for Binance, including a $4.3 billion fine in the U.S. and former CEO Changpeng Zhao’s prison sentence.



Binance faces regulatory scrutiny globally and has ceased operations in Canada, with ongoing legal battles in Nigeria over money laundering allegations.




Canadian regulators imposed a C$6 million ($4.3 million) fine on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, alleging two separate violations of financial regulations.





Binance Financial Penalty In Canada Comes With Other Challenges



According to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), Binance failed to register as a foreign money services business despite multiple opportunities and neglected to report virtual currency transactions exceeding C$10,000. Between June 2021 and July 2023, Binance allegedly failed to report 5,902 crypto transactions over $10,000, along with their associated know-your-customer (KYC) information.



These violations were discovered using blockchain explorer tools. This Binance financial penalty closely follows its agreement to pay U.S. regulators a $4.3 billion fine for violating anti-money laundering laws and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao‘s four-month U.S. prison sentence for inadequate KYC/AML measures.



Binance Battles Regulatory Challenges Worldwide



Last year, Binance ceased operations in Canada, citing regulatory challenges. The exchange faces scrutiny from various regulators worldwide, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Binance previously pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws and agreed to pay a hefty fine. Additionally, Binance is embroiled in legal battles in Nigeria, where it faces accusations of money laundering and tax evasion.




The Binance financial penalty by FINTRAC is part of Canada‘s efforts to enforce financial regulations. Notably, Toronto-Dominion Bank recently faced a C$9.19 million penalty for compliance failings related to monitoring and reporting suspected money laundering and terrorist financing.



Under Canada’s Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act, administrative penalties aim to encourage businesses to improve compliance rather than punitive measures.

                        In the latest Solana meme coin skyrocket, a new Apple-themed token has exploded 76,928% overnight following Apple’s new product launches.This article will provide an analysis of APPLE’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time.The APPLE meme coin’s price has exploded amid the sensational launch of the latest iPad model, which has gone viral after its launch advert ‘CRUSH’ was met with a poor reception amongst consumers.It is worth mentioning that the meme coin, indeed, has no official affiliation with Apple the company in any capacity.Thus is the nature of the decentralized meme coin markets.
APPLE Price Analysis: As New Solana Meme Coin APPLE Surges – Is Skyrocket Heading for the Moon?
As price action continues to hammer to the upside, APPLE is currently trading at a market price of $0.00123 (representing a 24-hour change of +76,926%).This is a jaw-dropping move, as price action has sustained a major upside rallying structure for 16 hours after leaping out of rock-bottom support around 1 AM UTC on May 9.Constant pressure from $116k in retail investor volume has propelled APPLE to fire up in a skyrocket that has so far topped out around $0.00125.Now standing at a market cap of $1.22M, it seems likely that APPLE will continue to sustain upside moves.Although, it is worth noting that there is no way of telling whether the market is being manipulated or whether even the token is a honeypot scam being pushed higher by bots and insiders.For that reason, some concern emerges that such a rally could result in a thunderous dump which is why smart money investors are chasing more reliable Solana meme coin returns in an emerging project that has secured a whopping $13M in presale funding.Indeed, there is growing concern that such a dramatic rally might lead to a significant market correction.This has prompted savvy investors to seek more reliable returns in the meme coin space, particularly in an emerging project that has already secured an impressive $13 million in presale funding.
Next To Pump: Dogeverse – Over $13M Raised in Viral Meme Coin PresaleWhile Dogecoin price basks in the afterglow of fleeting Tesla support, the Dogeverse presale continues to gain traction. The latest presale statistics show that the project has raised over $13 million. Going by recent trends, this could just be the beginning of this upswing.Dogeverse offers better features than Dogecoin.Most importantly, it is the first multichain meme coin and will deploy on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, and Base, among other platforms.Moreover, Dogeverse, unlike Dogecoin, supports staking, meaning presale investors can diversify income streams from passive gains and decent DOGEVERSE yields.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

What Is Fantasy Top? The Ethereum Game on Blast Turning Crypto Twitter Into a Fantasy Sport - Decrypt

We’ve seen mash-ups of fantasy sports and NFT trading cards, but what about something with more crypto-native subject matter? Enter Fantasy Top.Built on Ethereum layer-2 network Blast, Fantasy Top takes the premise of fantasy football and other fantasy sports games, but swaps out pro athletes for crypto influencers. It’s like Crypto Twitter: The Game, and it’s more than just a surface-level riff on the social media sphere.Fantasy Top has gotten off to an electric start, dominating industry chatter while driving surging trading volume—and becoming one of the most profitable protocols or apps across all of crypto. Curious how to get started? Here’s what you need to know.What is Fantasy Top?Crypto Twitter often feels like a spectator sport, so it makes sense that someone turned it into a fantasy game. Fantasy Top takes the core premise of fantasy football, soccer, or baseball, and swaps in 120 (and counting) crypto influencers, traders, content creators, and personalities.Each “hero” in the game is based on a denizen of Crypto Twitter, and they get their own NFT cards minted on Ethereum layer-2 network Blast. You can buy and trade the NFTs, which come in multiple rarity levels and can be upgraded by acquiring multiple copies of a lower-level edition and trading them up. Higher-level cards come with a larger score multiplier.In Fantasy Top competitions, you’ll select a lineup of five owned NFT cards and lock it in. Scoring is based on the actual Twitter engagement of your industry “heroes,” amplified by your cards’ particular score multipliers, so there’s strategy involved in both buying up cards for your lineup and picking the best cross-section of crypto tweeters to place highly in a competition.Cards in Fantasy Top. Image: Fantasy TopRewards thus far include Ethereum (ETH), Blast Gold points that will go towards the network’s upcoming BLAST token drop, and FAN points, which may ultimately lead to future benefits on Fantasy Top—or perhaps an allotment of airdrop tokens.Do I need NFTs to play Fantasy Top?Yes, Fantasy Top requires NFT cards to play. You’ll need at least five to lock in a lineup for a competition, and at this point, there’s no option to play the game without the NFTs.Fantasy Top sells packs of cards with dynamic pricing based on demand (currently around 0.4 ETH, or nearly $1,200), or you can purchase individual cards from the app’s NFT marketplace.Fantasy Top is played via the website, and like with other fantasy sports, you simply set your lineup and then watch the points roll in. Your leaderboard placement at the end of each competition period determines your rewards.What can I win in Fantasy Top?With such significant demand right out the gate, the early rewards are substantial indeed. In the first “main competition,” Fantasy Top served up a total prize pool that included over $150,000 worth of ETH, potentially more than $2 million worth of Blast Gold (based on analyst projections), and other perks to players.And the crypto influencers who've become in-game heroes are seeing sizable benefits, too. A share of the overall pack sales, along with a cut of the marketplace fees, are paid out to the influencers.Less than a week after Fantasy Top’s mainnet launch on May 1, 2024, the game paid out $1.25 million worth of ETH (in total) to heroes, along with what’s estimated to be at least $25,000 worth of Blast Gold points.The futureFantasy Top is early and buzzy, but the team has already teased plans ahead for the future—and it also clearly has some kinks to work out along the way.One week after launch, the game has already added leagues, which split players up into Silver and Bronze categories based on their performance thus far. Rewards will apparently vary by league designation, with “rewards increasingly skewed towards the top performers,” according to a tweet.What’s ahead? More in-game heroes, apparently, along with an improved scoring model, a “whole array of sub-competitions,” and other “surprises” to come.But as Fantasy Top attempts to grow, it will also need to deal with the immediate problem of users (or external observers) “botting” tweets from the heroes, manipulating the scoring and leading to some early pivots as the team figures out how to handle it all.Some heroes have complained of being targeted by botters, and Fantasy Top already decided to end its first main competition early due to manipulation concerns. The game is built around social media engagement, so that’s something they’ll have to sort out if Fantasy Top is going to try and parlay this early buzz into a sustainable game model.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Stocks Rebound As Rising Jobless Claims Sustain Rate-Cut Hopes, Dollar Falls, Gold Rallies: What's Driving Markets Thursday? - Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) - Benzinga

Wall Street is seeing a day of gains as all major indices traded in the green around noon in New York, driven by a surprising uptick in unemployment claims prompting speculation over Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.Jobless benefits rose from 209,000 to 231,000 in the week ending May 4, surpassing market expectations of 210,000 and reaching the highest level in eight months. Consequently, the U.S. dollar Index (DXY), tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF UUP, declined by 0.2% in reaction to the data, as market participants slightly increased bets on a September Fed cut. The S&P 500 index inched up by 0.1%, following Wednesday’s flat close, while blue chips of the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4%, aiming for their seventh consecutive day of gains, the longest streak since December 2023. Small caps, tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, increased by 0.5%. Gold surged by 1% and silver by 2.8% due to the lower dollar. Bitcoin BTC/USD saw a 1.4% increase.Elsewhere, the Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged, while flagging rising chances of imminent rate cuts as new inflation projections reveal that price pressures will fall below target in two years.

Bitcoin Surges Past $64,000 as Market Liquidity Swings; U.S. and Hong Kong ETFs See Bullish Inflows



                    

Bitcoin (BTC) saw a resurgence above the $64,000 mark on May 7 as it experienced significant liquidity on both sides of the order book.



This upward movement was identified from data provided by Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, which showed BTC escalating from a low of $62,864 at Bitstamp earlier in the day. 




The currency remained within a trading range that had been established since May 3. Despite this, the price fluctuations were rapid, creating a volatile environment that led to the liquidation of positions in both directions.



The late trading hours saw a focus on bid liquidity near $63,500 before Bitcoin reversed direction, targeting a more substantial liquidity pool roughly $1,000 higher, as per the data from CoinGlass.



Daan Crypto Trades, a recognized trader, commented on the behavior seen over the weekend, specifically the closure of the CME futures gap. 




“Took some hours after the futures re-open but got there on Monday which is something we tend to see quite often,” he mentioned, discussing the patterns observed.



Another trader, Skew, pointed out several crucial levels that should be monitored going forward. 



He noted, “Price currently still chopping around $64K,” in his latest market analysis, adding the importance of trading the monthly open and $61K as significant demand markers in the market, with a high timeframe pivot at $67K.



The recovery from recent two-month lows around $58,000 also marked a notable divergence from the 2021 bull market trend, when Bitcoin first reached similar levels.

This difference was attributed to strong spot buyer demand, as emphasized by Skew.



Regarding the ETF market, the narrative around U.S. and Hong Kong Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) turned bullish. 



On May 6, the day before the price surge, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), witnessed substantial inflows. 



Data from Farside, a UK-based investment firm, revealed positive inflows totaling $217 million across all 10 spot ETFs. 



This influx marked GBTC’s first day of positive inflows since its conversion to an ETF.



The stability of inflows into the newly launched Hong Kong spot ETFs was also highlighted, with “very stable volume-wise with consistent $8-9 million,” as noted by popular commentator WhalePanda. 



He further added, “As long as inflows stays positive here the supply is getting scooped up so overall quite bullish.”

Bitcoin Price Struggles to Stay Above $62,000 despite Positive European Equity Rally



This ongoing Bitcoin volatility has forced Bitwise, an asset manage­ment firm, to advise caution, suggesting the­ halving event might have be­en a “sell the ne­ws” scenario. 

The cryptocurre­ncy market continues to defy e­xpectations. While European stocks surge­ to record highs, Bitcoin remains stubbornly stuck below the­ $62,000 mark. This comes despite the­ Bank of England (BoE) hinting at a potential summer rate cut, a move­ traditionally seen as positive for riskie­r assets like Bitcoin.
The major Europe­an and UK stock markets experie­nced a positive day on Thursday. London’s FTSE 100 reache­d a new all-time high, closing at 8,393 after a 22-point gain. The­ broader European Stoxx 600 index also had a positive­ day, rising 0.15% to 516.




This optimistic sentiment in traditional markets stands in stark contrast to the­ ongoing struggles of Bitcoin. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency has be­en unable to capitalize on the­ positive sentiments, hovering above the $62,000 mark.
BoE Interest Rate Impact on Bitcoin
The Bank of England opted to maintain interest rates at their current level of 5.25% for the sixth consecutive meeting. This “wait-and-see” approach reflects the central bank’s cautious stance on inflation. However, Governor Andrew Bailey offered a glimmer of hope, suggesting a rate cut as soon as next month if inflation falls in line with their forecasts.
“We’ve had encouraging news on inflation and we think it will fall close to our 2% target in the next couple of months,” Bailey said. “While we need more evidence of sustained low inflation before a rate cut, I’m optimistic things are moving in the right direction.”
Despite the prospect of a summer rate cut, analyst Myron Jobson of Interactive Investor tempers expectations. He emphasizes that a broader environment of higher-for-longer interest rates is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
“Interest rates could remain higher for the next decade than they were in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis,” said Jobson. This could dampen the appeal of Bitcoin, which has historically thrived in low-interest-rate environments.
Bitcoin’s Post-Halving Volatility Persists
The Bitcoin halving e­vent, which ended on April 20th, cut the­ block mining reward by half. These halving e­vents have often le­d to significant price rises. For example­, the 2012 halving saw a 9,500% price increase­, and the 2016 event re­sulted in a 3,000% jump the following year. Howe­ver, the 2020 post-halving rally was more mode­st, with Bitcoin appreciating by 650%.
Before the­ recent halving, Bitcoin expe­rienced a volatile 110% price­ increase. The we­ek leading up to the e­vent saw a sharp 17% dip from $72,000 to $60,000. Contrary to expectations, the­ post-halving rally has not materialized. Bitcoin briefly re­ached $67,000 on April 24th but quickly fell back to $62,500 within three­ days.
This ongoing volatility has forced Bitwise, an asset manage­ment firm, to advise caution, suggesting the­ halving event might have be­en a “sell the ne­ws” scenario. Analysts from JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank share­ this view, projecting that Bitcoin could drop as low as $42,000 in the coming we­eks.

AI Coins represent one of crypto's fastest growing sectors
                        Many crypto tokens attached to top AI/blockchain projects are rallying hard ahead of Nvidia’s earnings report on May 22.Nvidia is the premier AI play in the stock market.The stock has an eye-watering market capitalization of $2.2 trillion and some of the highest returns of any asset.For comparison, Bitcoin pulls up most of the $2.37 trillion crypto market with a capitalization of $1.2 trillion.Nvidia’s stock is down 2% today, roughly in line with both Bitcoin and Ethereum’s ($ETH) depreciation over the last 24 hours. However, while Nvidia has only moved about 4% in the last month, several AI coins have exploded in the last seven days.Most of the top ten AI-related cryptocurrencies rallied by double-digit percentages over the past week.The $4.1 billion market cap Render ($RNDR) leaped nearly 40% to trade at $10.68.The only token in the sector that matched its performance was AIOZ Network ($AIOZ), which rose 35% to $0.8402.Multiple leading AI coins rallied between 20-30% this week.

Binance Co-Founder Yi He Responded to WSJ Claims! - Bitcoin Sistemi

In today's news, WSJ claimed that Binance detected that popular market maker DWF Labs was engaged in market manipulation.
Based on the statements of a former Binance employee, WSJ claimed that Binance researchers manipulated the prices of DWF Labs' Yield Guild Game (YGG) token and at least six altcoins in 2023.



While DWF Labs X denied WSJ's claims, a Binance spokesperson also denied the news and told Cointelegraph:

“Binance categorically denies any allegation that its market surveillance program allows market manipulation on our platform. We have a robust market surveillance framework that detects and takes action against market abuse. Any users who violate our terms of use will be excluded; we do not tolerate market abuse .”

Sarcastic Thanks to WSJ from Binance Co-Founder Yi He!
A reaction to WSJ's manipulation allegations came from Binance co-founder Yi He. Yi He, who denied the allegations from the X account and stated that they had no privileged actions against any fund, said the following:






“We monitor market makers closely. We do not target any fund or market maker. However, there is great competition among market makers and there is a lot of fraudulent behavior.
Anyone who wants can pay money to advertise, but don't bother with me.
“We will ensure our own fairness and will not participate in such games, and will continue to report honestly to auditors and other regulatory authorities.”

Yi He made another statement after this post.
Stating that WSJ has consistently targeted Binance, Yi He said, “I would like to thank WSJ for its long-term investment in Binance. Because WSJ has been consistently reporting about us for a long time. “I am grateful to them for saving us their budget. However, while reporting this kind of news, WSJ did not report that Binance was assisting law enforcement and assisting in the arrest of Zkasino's main culprit. This shows that WSJ acted with bias.” said.

Bitcoin About To ‘Blow Higher’ Despite This Week’s Pullback, According to Glassnode Co-Founders - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								The founders of crypto analytics platform Glassnode are predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) will soon soar even higher after being up 7% in the last week.
In a new thread, the co-founders of Glassnode, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 62,900 followers that key indicators suggest Bitcoin is gearing up from a massive breakout.










The analysts say Bitcoin appears to be forming a bullish pennant pattern. They also suggest that Bitcoin is correcting to a Fibonacci retracement level, in the low $60,000 range, which often predicts a continuation of an upward trend.
“BTC still looks like it is about to blow higher! Last week’s candle was a reversal candle – a hammer with a long wick. Price moved back into the pennant structure. This candle still dominates the structure. This week’s pullback, hence, seems like a healthy correction before higher. Corrections often pull back either 50% or 61.8% of the previous impulse move.”
Source: Negentropic/X
Looking at their chart, the analysts suggest that Bitcoin has or is about to complete a three-wave ABC correction. The Elliott Wave theory states that a bullish asset often witnesses a fresh leg up after an ABC correction of three wave impulses.
The analysts believe Bitcoin could break through the $85,000 level before the start of summer, which officially begins on June 20th.
“BTC is currently in the process of breaking the trendline of pennant and the 50-day SMA (simple moving average). When the level of $65,000-$66,000 is broken, BTC will move on to first $73,500, then $76,500, and chances are that we see $85,200 before the summer.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $62,016 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.

New Shibarium Node Validator K9 Unfolds 420M KNINE Giveaway - DailyCoin


        
Freshly-appointed Shibarium validator K9 launches 420M KNINE contest.



The sweepstakes will run for two weeks, ending at 3 PM EST on May 22, 2024.



SHIB consolidated at $0.000022 as most altcoins pulled back on Thursday.
Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) upcoming Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) platform on Shibarium Layer-2 has awakened the curiosity of Shiba Inu custodians. K9 Finance DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind the dynamic staking platform, launched a contest with 420M KNINE tokens up for grabs in the prize pool.The sweepstakes is being held in celebration of K9 Finance DAO becoming a node validator on Shibarium L2. This adds an extra layer of security to SHIB’s own blockchain after the hard fork in early May 2024. Moreover, the close partnership with SHIB Token lets K9 Finance DAO work on bolstering Shibarium’s liquidity by bringing unprecedented functionality to the chain.How to Get Your Hands on 420M KNINE Prize PoolCryptocurrency aficionados should head to TaskOn, where they can find a task list of mandatory and optional activities. In order to participate, SHIB Army members can log in to TaskOn in multiple ways, including Web3 and social media gateways. 
Shibarians can choose from X, Telegram, Discord, or email as an authentication method, while MetaMask, Bitget Wallet, Wallet Connect, and TronLink are the options for authentication via Web3. Once logged on, crypto enthusiasts are presented with two mandatory tasks.The first task revolves around swapping at least $100 of ETH to KNINE on UniSwap v3; the buying action follows the social task to quote a tweet, including the hashtags #K9Finance and #buycontest on Twitter. As the sweepstakes are run on raffle-based entries, the chances can be improved by doing optional tasks on the contest page.
These include following the campaign’s host, K9 Finance DAO, on Telegram and Twitter. Users can complete the smaller tasks worth five entries by following the SHARBI token, ChewySwap, Bad Idea AI, WoofSwap, CoinMerge, and other Shibarium-related products to gather all possible points.What K9 DAO’s Staking App Brings to ShibariumK9 Finance DAO serves the same purpose as Lido Protocol on Ether (ETH). When Lido entered the largest Proof of Stake (PoS) network, blockchain aficionados could diversify their digital asset staking portfolios across different smart contracts, magnifying the potential returns. K9 Finance DAO’s core product, BONE Crusher, is set to employ Shibarium’s Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) in a dual token system. Once Shibarium L2 users delegate their BONE to the BONE Crusher decentralized application (dApp), they get an equivalent of knBONE, the in-app version of Shibarium’s gas fee token.While the liquid yield project aims to bolster Shibarium’s on-chain liquidity, the participants can collect their staking rewards in both KNINE and BONE. Set for a Q3 of 2024 launch, the BONE Crusher dApp will run on Shibarium L2 and employ a bi-folded LSD system that rewards both the SHIB Army and K9 Army for participation in staking activities.On the Flipside
Two months into launch, K9 Finance DAO’s KNINE token backtracked 89% from its all-time high of $0.0003468, which was reached on March 10, 2024.



With a global market capitalization of $4,111,158, KNINE can be traded on MEXC, BitMart, and decentralized crypto waters.
Why This MattersSHIB Token’s leading team members have joined K9 Finance DAO’s advisory board, acclaiming the forthcoming liquid staking project as an official component of the Shibarium Ecosystem.Check Out DailyCoin’s popular crypto stories:“Crypto Is a Garden of Snakes:” Rep Sherman Backs SEC ActionFTX Pens Plan Promising 118% Cash Back to Creditors

ETH Founder Buterin Charts New Territory with Ethereum Gas Pricing Overhaul - Coin Edition


							

Multidimensional gas pricing enhances Ethereum’s scalability by decoupling resources for tailored pricing.
The introduction of “blobs” in Ethereum’s Dencun hard fork showcases the potential of multidimensional gas pricing.
Balancing scalability and security remains a challenge, especially in accommodating stateless clients’ storage proofs.




In Ethereum’s ongoing quest for scalability and efficiency, Vitalik Buterin has recently explored the concept of multidimensional gas pricing in a blog post. Gas, traditionally a singular measure encompassing various computational efforts within the Ethereum network, has been subject to scrutiny due to its limitations in accurately representing different resource constraints.







Buterin highlights the inefficiency stemming from the one-dimensional nature of gas pricing, which fails to account for the distinct safety limits of various network resources. This oversight can lead to either the exclusion of safe blocks or the acceptance of unsafe ones, hindering overall throughput by a substantial margin.



A novel approach introduced in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844, termed multidimensional gas, has sparked significant interest. This approach decouples resources such as computation, data bandwidth, and storage, allowing for separate pricing mechanisms tailored to each resource’s unique constraints.









The introduction of “blobs” in the Dencun hard fork exemplifies the potential of multidimensional gas pricing. By allocating separate space for rollup-friendly data within blocks, transaction costs on rollups have plummeted, transaction volumes surged, and theoretical block sizes expanded marginally, all while maintaining network safety.



Looking ahead, the impending challenge of accommodating stateless clients necessitates a similar reevaluation of gas pricing. With storage proofs becoming a focal point, the Ethereum community faces the dilemma of balancing scalability with security.



Buterin proposes a paradigm shift towards floating prices for state size-increasing operations, offering a nuanced approach to managing network resources. By setting floating prices to target specific average usage levels, Ethereum could mitigate long-term scalability concerns without imposing rigid per-block limits.



However, implementing multidimensional gas pricing poses technical challenges, particularly concerning gas limits in sub-calls within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). While solutions like EIP-7623 offer incremental improvements, achieving a comprehensive multidimensional pricing scheme requires careful consideration of backward compatibility and protocol economics.

Robinhood CEO Speaks After SEC's Wells Reporting! Supported Cryptocurrencies! - Bitcoin Sistemi

As it is known, the SEC recently sent a Wells Notice to the US-based cryptocurrency platform Robinhood.
While the possible effects of the Wells Statement on the crypto market continue to be discussed, a statement came from Robinhood Co-Founder and CEO Vlad Tenev.



Speaking to CNBC, Robinhood CEO made statements about the SEC's latest actions.
Stating that cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular and important, Tenev argued that Americans should have access to cryptocurrencies.





The famous CEO, who thinks that it is unacceptable for Americans not to have access to cryptocurrencies, stated that they met with the SEC 16 times before receiving the Wells Notice.
Vlad Telev said that as a result of these meetings, they learned that Robinhood would face SEC sanctions in the future.



“We tried to create what is called a special purpose broker-dealer for the purpose of trading cryptocurrencies.
And we actually came to meet with the SEC in good faith. I think we met with the SEC 16 times.
However, these talks did not yield any response and we learned that we would face SEC sanctions.
The SEC has the ability to change the rules to allow brokers to trade cryptocurrencies, but it does not appear to have any intention of doing so. Rather, the SEC continues to regulate through enforcement. And that's disappointing.
“I didn't want to be in this situation with the SEC, but we have to defend ourselves and our customers.”

CryptoQuant CEO Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed, Is $265,000 Too Ambitious?


																Ki Young Ju, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis firm CryptoQuant, has given an ultra-bullish prediction for Bitcoin. The crypto founder alluded to certain factors that could spark the flagship crypto’s rise to such heights. 
Bitcoin Could Rise To As High As $265,000
Young Ju mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “Bitcoin’s network fundamentals could support a market cap three times its current size compared to the last cyclical top.” He added that this development could help BTC rise to $265,000. The fundamental that the crypto founder was alluding to was the Hashrate/Market Cap ratio.

 

Source: CryptoQuant
The accompanying chart that Young Ju shared showed that Bitcoin’s hash rate is currently more than three times what it was at the last market cycle top. Meanwhile, BTC is still at the price level it was during that period. As such, the CryptoQuant CEO believes that Bitcoin could also see a 3x increase in its price, just like the Hash rate. 
Young Ju’s prediction provides a much-needed bullish outlook for Bitcoin, especially given the flagship crypto’s recent decline and talk that Bitcoin may have already attained the market top for this cycle. Tom Lee, co-founder of research firm Fundstrat, also recently shared his bullish sentiment towards BTC, stating that the crypto token will still reach $150,000 this year. 
Meanwhile, similarly to Young Ju’s prediction, crypto analyst MacronautBTC had previously stated that Bitcoin could rise to $237,000. The crypto analyst made this “conservative” calculation based on BTC’s demand outpacing its supply in the long run, especially with the halving further reducing Miners’ supply. 
A Rise To $265,000 Not Ambitious
Young Ju’s prediction of $265,000 for Bitcoin is far from ambitious when considering that Samson Mow, the CEO of JAN3, predicted that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $1 million this year. He explained that this unprecedented rise was possible due to the impressive demand that Bitcoin was currently enjoying. 

Pseudonymous crypto analyst PlanB also echoed a similar sentiment, stating that BTC hitting $1 million is possible, although he suggested that could happen in 2025 rather than this year. He made this prediction based on the Bitcoin stock-to-flow (STF) indicator, which hints at $500,000 being the average price level for Bitcoin in this market cycle. 
As such, the analyst believes that $1 million could be the market top for this bull run. Meanwhile, PlanB mentioned that Bitcoin hitting $100,000 this year was “inevitable.”
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $61,700, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Binance co-founder and DWF Labs speak out against market manipulation allegations

Amid new allegations of market manipulation brought by The Wall Street Journal, both Binance co-founder Yi He and market make DWF Labs have denied any involvement. In an X post on May 9, He described the media report as an occurrence that “greatly increased our exposure and saved us a lot of marketing budget.” However, the co-founder denied any of the allegations made against Binance, writing: “I have noticed an interesting phenomenon where some mainstream media articles are increasingly driven by emotions and biases rather than facts. For example, the complaints of former employees can become the basis of an article, while Binance’s proactive assistance to law enforcement agencies in investigating and apprehending the mastermind behind Zkasino (as a matter of fact) is not deemed worthy of reporting.”In a similar post the same day, DWF Labs said the allegations were “unfounded and distort the facts” and that the firm “operates with the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and ethics, and we remain committed to supporting you and our over 700 partners across the crypto ecosystem.” Earlier on May 9, a Wall Street Journal report claimed that DWF Labs, one of Binance’s largest trading clients, engaged in market manipulation, wash trading and inflated trading volumes amounting to $300 million through deals with crypto projects. After the exchange’s surveillance team recommended offboarding the client, Binance allegedly sided with DWF Labs and fired the investigator, arguing insufficient evidence for the claim.“We affirm our strict market surveillance program [and] do not tolerate market abuse,” He commented. “Over the last three years, we have offboarded nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of more than $2.5 trillion for violating our terms of use,” He added, continuing: “Market maker competition is fierce, and our investigation team’s job is to be neutral and look at the evidence without any bias, including bias that might come from market-making firms’ claims against their competitors.”DWF Labs is a prominent trading firm in the crypto industry. Founded by Andrei Grachev in 2021, the firm invests in promising projects and provides long-term financial support. Related: Binance denies reports of DWF Labs market manipulation

Biden backs Gensler as House advances resolution to power-check SEC - Blockworks


President Joe Biden has promised to back Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler after a resolution to overturn an agency accounting practice advanced out of the House Wednesday evening. 
The House on Wednesday approved joint resolution 109 — which would invalidate the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 — in a 228-182 vote. The measure now moves on to the Senate, but Biden’s administration warned it would veto the resolution if it makes it to the president’s desk.
“Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty,” the Biden administration wrote in a statement Wednesday. 
SAB 121, introduced in March 2022 and enacted the following month, states that digital asset custodians should report a liability and “corresponding assets” on their balance sheets for all custodied cryptocurrencies. The practice, SEC staff said, is intended to guard against the “significant risks and uncertainties associated with safeguarding crypto assets.” 
Reps. Mike Flood, R-Neb., Nick Wiley, D-N.C., Tom Emmer, R-Minn., Darren Soto, D-Flo., and French Hill, R-Ark., introduced the joint resolution in the House in February. 
“The SEC issued SAB 121 without conferring with prudential regulators despite the accounting standard’s effects on financial institutions’ treatment of custodial assets, and the SEC issued SAB 121 without going through the notice-and-comment process,” Rep. Flood said of the resolution in a statement earlier this year. “In the face of overreach by a regulator, it is the role of Congress to serve as a check.” 
Read more: SEC failed to follow the Congressional Review Act, may have broken the law
While SABs are not enforceable rules under securities law, they are used by staff for interpretations and practices, the SEC said. Unlike traditional rules issued by the agency, SABs do not require public notice or comment periods and do not reflect the official approval of Commissioners, a point Flood and his co-sponsors find troubling. 
All voting House Republicans were in favor of passing the joint resolution Wednesday. 21 Democrats also supported the measure.
Senator Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., a long-time crypto supporter, introduced a companion joint resolution in the Senate, although she lacked bipartisan support. Lummis’ effort has not advanced to Committee markup or a vote, and now that the House’s resolution is making its way to the Senate, the measure is all but dead. 
Gensler in December 2023 defended SAB 121, saying it was “just a staff accounting bulletin,” and it is consistent with precedent set in US bankruptcy court. 
Read more: Empire Newsletter: The SEC’s internal rift
“It basically addresses whether liabilities should be on balance sheet, and what we have found actually in bankruptcy court, time and again, many times now, that indeed bankruptcy courts have said that crypto assets are not bankruptcy remote,” Gensler said during a Dec. 2023 appearance hosted by the American Bar Association. 
Gensler, who has previously denied that he is working against the clock, could face significant headwinds in advancing his agenda after this year’s election. Should Republicans gain control of both chambers in November, additional efforts to overturn and undermine agency policy are likely to continue.

Scammer's Regret? $71 Million Bitcoin Thief Sends Ethereum to Victim - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Ethereum user who accidentally sent $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin to the wrong address last week—after being hit with an apparent “address poisoning” scam—may be about to get their money back. Or at least some of it.On May 3, address 0x1E227 sent 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)—about $71 million worth—to a scammer’s crypto address, after being fooled into thinking the recipient's address was one of their own. The victim has been corresponding with the thief over the blockchain ever since, and was partially refunded with 52 ETH ($156,000) early Thursday.“Please leave your Telegram and I will contact you,” wrote the thief within the blockchain transaction on Thursday.The attacker initially stole the funds through a popular technique called “address poisoning” or “wallet contamination.” This involves a scammer sending a zero-value transaction to a target’s wallet from a crypto address purposefully picked to look like one that the victim regularly corresponds with.In this case, both the victim’s real target address and the scammer’s address began with characters 0xd9A1, and ended with 853a91, making them difficult to tell apart at first glance within most wallet apps.The scammer’s goal is to bait the victim into copying the fake address from their transaction history the next time they intend to send themselves money, and to intercept that transfer for themselves.After losing the funds last Friday, the victim initially messaged the thief to admit that they “won”, and asked that they return 90% of the money, keeping 10% as a clean reward.“We both know that $7 million will definitely make your life better, but $70 million won't let you sleep well,” the victim wrote.The scammer responded by demanding the victim send the $1.6 million in DAI stablecoin remaining at the wallet address, or else they wouldn’t consider the offer. “If you don't, you won't hear from me again & I won't respond,” the scammer wrote.The victim followed up with threats to track down the hacker based on their transaction history if they didn’t take the initial 90/10 offer.“We both know there's no way to clean [these] funds. You will be traced,” the victim wrote. “We also both understand the ‘sleep well’ phrase wasn't about your moral and ethical qualities.”Onlookers joined in on the conversation, with one offering services to provide data about the hacker, such as IP addresses, in return for $100,000. Others came to the scammer’s defense, congratulating the theft and assuring them that the victim’s threat was a bluff—and calling the victim a “dumb, greedy whale.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

3 reasons why Bitcoin traders say a BTC price trend reversal is overdue

Bitcoin (BTC) price is down 1.85% over the last 24 hours and currently trades 17% below its all-time high of $73,835 reached on March 14.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewDespite this performance, the technical setup, whale activity and on-chain data show that Bitcoin traders believe a trend reversal toward news highs could be in the making.Bitcoin price retests key support areasData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows Bitcoin price oscillating between $60,648 and $62,800 over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s monthly chart shows the current price range is retesting an area that acted as a resistance when the BTC hit previous all-time highs, as observed by popular analyst Rekt Capital.According to Rekt Capital, this area is now acting as support for BTC since last month’s halving sell-off did not pull the price below this range.“On the monthly timeframe, Bitcoin is still retesting the old All Time High major resistance area (red) as new support (green).”BTC/USD monthly chart. Source: Rekt CapitalFellow analyst Moustache made the same observation, sharing a BTC/USD three-day chart showing that the price was trading at a level close to the previous all-time high.According to Moustache, this has happened only twice in the past—in 2017 and 2020. In both cases, previous all-time highs supported Bitcoin’s price, after which the coin went on a parabolic uptrend, hitting new record highs. Source: MoustacheIn another X post on April 25, Moustache commented on a similar set-up on the monthly chart, saying that BTC was going higher after retesting the line. “After reclaiming the line in 2012, 2016 and 2020, Bitcoin was just getting started.

Robinhood CEO says SEC unwilling to facilitate crypto industry despite 'good faith'

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev voiced strong concerns about the limitations regarding the accessibility of crypto for Americans and criticized the SEC for its “regulation by enforcement” approach toward the industry.Tenev made the statement during a CNBC interview on May 9, where he also discussed the significant increase in crypto trading on the platform and the SEC’s recent Wells Notice against the firm’s crypto unit that claims it is selling unregistered securities.Regulatory hurdlesRobinhood’s crypto trading volumes surged 224% in the first quarter. Despite this growth, Tenev disclosed that the company’s discussions with the SEC had stalled after 16 meetings without any progress as the regulator did not engage in productive discourse.Tenev explained during the interview:“We tried to create what we call a special purpose broker-dealer for transacting in crypto assets… Unfortunately, a clear path forward with the SEC never emerged, and they did not reciprocate our efforts.”The failed discussions ultimately resulted in the SEC issuing a Wells Notice against the firm, indicating potential enforcement actions for alleged securities violations.Tenev expressed disappointment over the SEC’s decision to halt discussions and highlighted the regulator’s preference for “regulation by enforcement” rather than adapting its rules to facilitate the evolving crypto industry.He argued for regulatory adjustments to permit brokers to incorporate digital assets, a move he believes the SEC is currently reluctant to make.Tenev added that the SEC has the ability to change the regulatory framework for crypto but there seems to be no intent to do so from the regulator.Importance of accessThe Robinhood CEO framed the situation as a broader issue of consumer rights, stressing the importance of crypto and the necessity for Americans to have unfettered access to them.Tenev said the firm does not agree with keeping Americans out of the crypto industry, especially as it is becoming “more and more important.”The Wells Notice against Robinhood marks a significant moment in the broader discussion on how financial regulatory bodies should manage the growing crypto market.The conflict with the SEC places Robinhood at the center of a critical debate over the future of crypto regulation and the role of traditional financial oversight in an increasingly digital economy.Mentioned in this article

BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes Predicts Bullish Crypto Market Surge Ahead of U.S. Elections



                    

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, believes the next few months present a prime time for cryptocurrency investment, particularly for those with disposable fiat money. 



In an interview with Cointelegraph, Hayes emphasized, “Those people who have fiat and extra cash that want to allocate to crypto, this is the perfect opportunity to do so.” 




He sees the current stagnant market conditions as a golden chance to buy before the expected uptrend in the crypto market.



He attributes the anticipated rise in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies later this year to inflationary monetary policies. 



Hayes suggests that these policies will play a central role in driving the market upwards.

He states, “Major economies around the world are going to print even more money between now and, say, the next 18 to 24 months,” signaling potential inflationary pressures that could increase the value of decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin.



Furthermore, Hayes argues that the forthcoming United States presidential elections will act as a bullish catalyst for the cryptocurrency market. 



He believes that financial authorities in the U.S. will likely adopt looser monetary policies to aid President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign. 




Such actions, according to Hayes, will mirror past trends where monetary expansion was linked to rallies in the crypto market.



He explains the process by which governments can influence the economy and, by extension, the crypto market: “When you control the purse of the government, it’s very easy to do so by printing money, borrowing it, and handing it out to people in various forms.” 



This method of monetary manipulation historically correlates with increases in the cryptocurrency market, suggesting a similar outcome could occur in the upcoming election cycle.

DCG First Quarter Revenue Hits $229 Million Despite Grayscale's GBTC Slump - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Digital Currency Group (DCG) reports a strong Q1 2024 performance, with revenues reaching $229 million, marking a 50% year-over-year increase.



Subsidiaries Grayscale, Foundry, and Luno contribute to DCG first quarter revenue growth, despite challenges such as heavy redemptions and increased competition.



Grayscale’s revenue remains steady at $156 million, despite outflows of $17.4 billion post-conversion to an ETF.




According to Bloomberg, Digital Currency Group (DCG) showcased a stellar performance in the first quarter of 2024, posting revenues of $229 million.





DCG First Quarter Revenue Achieves Outstanding Performance



DCG first quarter revenue marks an impressive year-over-year surge of over 50% and an 11% increase from the previous quarter. The surge in revenues aligns with the broader resurgence witnessed in the crypto market during the same period.



Grayscale contributed significantly to the DCG first quarter revenue, accounting for $156 million. Despite facing heavy redemptions and a reduced management fee following the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF, Grayscale’s revenue remained steady from the previous quarter.



Foundry, another subsidiary of DCG, experienced a 35% increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter, attributed to higher revenue from staking and equipment sales. Similarly, Luno, DCG’s crypto exchange, saw a notable uptick in revenues, up by 46% to $16 million, driven by increased trading volumes amid heightened market activity.




Grayscale’s Steady Revenue Amidst Industry Shifts



The company highlighted key industry developments in Q1, including the approval of Grayscale’s GBTC and spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., and Bitcoin prices hitting all-time highs in March. Despite facing outflows and increased competition, Grayscale’s revenue from GBTC exceeded expectations.



However, Grayscale witnessed outflows of about $17.4 billion since the conversion of GBTC into an ETF, as investors shifted assets to lower-cost funds offered by competitors. Despite this, Grayscale’s ETF still generated $156 million in revenues, reflecting the enduring demand for its products. The company attributed the flat revenue to the redemption and the drop in GBTC’s sponsor fee.



DCG’s robust performance in Q1 underscores the resilience and growth potential of the crypto industry, despite regulatory challenges and market fluctuations.

SEC Scuppers Exodus' Stock Debut in Sudden U-Turn - DailyCoin


        
The SEC has delayed listing the cryptocurrency wallet company Exodus’s stock exchange.



The SEC’s last-minute request for further review mirrors similar challenges other crypto companies face.



Exodus has remained hopeful for a swift resolution and may explore alternative listing options.
Exodus Movement Inc., a leading developer of self-custodial cryptocurrency wallets, hit a hurdle in its journey to a major stock exchange listing. The company announced that the NYSE American, originally slated for a May 9 Class A Common Stock debut, has postponed the listing.Exodus Follows Ripple’s PathThis development highlights the ongoing tension between innovation in the cryptocurrency space and regulatory oversight from government bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The SEC requested further review of Exodus’ registration statement at the last minute, causing the delay. Exodus remains hopeful for a swift resolution and indicated they might seek a listing on a national exchange after the SEC completes its review. In the meantime, trading will continue on the OTC Markets’ OTCQX exchange.“While we are surprised and confused by this last-minute decision, we remain hopeful that the SEC will follow through on its commitment to treat us as the law intends. Exodus has been fully transparent and responsive throughout this process and we expect a swift resolution in this matter,” Exodus CEO JP Richardson exclaimed.This incident isn’t isolated. Ripple, another prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry, faced similar challenges during their IPO plans. In January, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shelved the company’s public offering plans due to what he called a “hostile” regulatory environment in the US. Crypto Firms Struggle Against SECThis move followed a legal battle with the SEC, dating back to 2020, over allegations of unregistered securities sales. Referring to the difficulties faced by Coinbase, another major crypto company that encountered legal issues following its IPO despite initial SEC approval, Garlinghouse had this to say:“In the United States, trying to go public with a very hostile regulator that’s approved your S-1, that doesn’t sound like a lot of fun to me,” Garlinghouse stated. The SEC plays a critical role in safeguarding public offerings through regulations. The agency has historically taken a cautious approach towards the cryptocurrency sector. Their rigorous review processes have impacted other companies like Robinhood, which initially delayed its IPO due to SEC scrutiny of its crypto offerings. Robinhood eventually went public in July 2021.
The delay in Exodus’ listing underscores the challenges faced by cryptocurrency companies seeking mainstream recognition through traditional stock exchange listings. As the industry continues to evolve, navigating the complexities of regulations will remain a crucial hurdle for crypto businesses aiming for broader public participation.On the Flipside
A delay in stock exchange listing does not necessarily hinder a company’s growth. Exodus can continue trading on the OTCQX exchange and focus on other avenues for expansion.



Exodus can use this time to strengthen its product and user base, making it more attractive to future investors.
Why This MattersThis incident exemplifies the roadblocks cryptocurrency firms encounter when seeking legitimacy through traditional stock markets. The SEC’s scrutiny of Exodus and Ripple’s shelved IPO plans highlights the potential for regulatory hurdles to stifle innovation and hinder wider public adoption of cryptocurrency businesses.If you found the regulatory hurdles faced by Exodus concerning, then you won’t want to miss this:Grayscale Drops Ether Futures ETF Bid as SEC Stalls ApprovalAre you interested in the recent war on crypto?

                        Binance is fighting back against the DWF Labs allegation against the platform on May 9. This follows an explosive report from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that revealed that Binance dismissed an employee who uncovered evidence of market manipulation by DWF Labs, a major market on the trading platform.According to the WSJ report, the dismissed employee and his colleagues at Binance’s market surveillance team had identified instances of pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading conducted by “VIP” clients, including $300M by DWF Labs. These activities violated Binance’s terms and conditions.
Binance & DWF Labs Allegation Entails $300 Million of Wash Trading
The investigators recommended removing DWF Labs from the platform, which they accused of manipulating the price of several cryptos, including the YGG token.Instead, Binance launched an inquiry into the team’s work, claiming there was insufficient evidence of wash trading by DWF Labs. According to the WSJ, the head of surveillance was fired afterward.DWF Labs, an investor in crypto projects that gained prominence in 2023, was reportedly involved in trades of over $4 billion monthly on the Binance platform.In response to the allegations, Binance refuted the claims, asserting they do not tolerate market manipulation.The exchange also revealed its successful record of removing high-profile traders who broke the rules. Binance claimed to have removed over 355,000 users who violated its terms of service in the past. The exchange said the ousted market makers had a combined transaction volume of $2.5 trillion.
Binance & DWF Allegation Slammed as “Unfounded and Not Accurate”
DWF Labs released a Telegram announcement shortly after the WSJ report, which entails the rebuttal of the report that it engaged in price drive, artificial volume, and $300 million of wash trading on Binance in 2023.“It has come to our attention that a recent article contains many allegations that we believe to be unfounded and that do not accurately represent our ethical business practices,” the market-making firm stated. “We have always prioritized our relationship with our partners and the broader community, successfully supporting more than 700 portfolio companies in the crypto ecosystem. We take pride in being compliant, transparent, and diligent in our work.”Last year, Binance settled charges brought forward by multiple US regulators, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in settlement over alleged violations of operating an unregistered exchange, insufficient controls over market manipulation, and commingling of funds.The US SEC’s litigation against Binance exchange resulted in a plea deal and a settlement of $4.3 billion for violating US anti-money laundering standards. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also stepped down as the CEO as part of the settlement. He has been sentenced to four months in prison with an additional fine of $50 million.

Tokenization to unlock interoperability across payments, investments

The lines between payment and investment assets are becoming increasingly blurred. In the near future, it may be possible to split a dinner and pay using shares of tokenized funds, a blend made possible by tokenizing assets.Rob Durscki, senior director of tokenization at the Stellar Development Foundation, shared the prediction during the TokenizeThis 2024 event in Miami on May 9. According to him, the bridge between payments and investments will unlock new utilities across financial products. Durscki noted: “What we’re seeing now with partners like Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and others issuing this new round of assets on-chain is that they want to unlock yield, [...] but they also want to make it almost seamless to use as a payment tool as well.”Tokenization is the process of converting rights or ownership of an asset, like real estate or stocks, into a digital token on a blockchain. This enables a digital representation of the asset, allowing for fractional ownership, increasing liquidity and making some financial products more accessible to small investors.“Nothing prevents us here from splitting the check on the dinner, and I’ll pay with Franklin Temple funds because I can send you $20 in 3.6 seconds on Stellar. [...] If you forget about that, you’re still getting 5%, 6% a year on that dinner. [...] This positive blur between investment and payment because it’s ultimately value, right? And we’re unlocking the movement of value.” TokenizeThis 2024. Source: Sam Bourgi/CointelegraphRipple’s vice president of engineering, Bradley Chase, also participated in the panel and spoke about customization trends emerging from enterprise customers. According to Chase, more and more enterprises are seeking to receive stablecoin payments and hold tokens on-chain as a way of generating additional revenue.“Those customers now have their own customers that want to pay in stablecoins and they want to hold those stablecoins. So that’s kind of the simplest on and off-ramp gateway for them into the space.”More than $1 billion worth of U.S. Treasurys has already been tokenized across Ethereum, Stellar, and other blockchains. A recent estimate from Ripple forecasts tokenized markets to reach $16 trillion in the coming years, a figure eight times larger than the total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency sector.

Crucial ETH and SEC Statement from Ethereum Co-Founder - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ethereum co-founder and cryptocurrency billionaire Joseph Lubin has expressed concerns about the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approach to regulating the cryptocurrency industry. Lubin argues that the SEC's current stance could potentially “cripple” the industry's growth.
Lubin explained that the SEC appears to have reclassified Ethereum as a security without informing the public. The move has raised concerns specifically about ETH spot ETFs, which the SEC fears could flood the cryptocurrency ecosystem with excessive interest and capital.


The SEC also alleged that popular cryptocurrency wallets Coinbase and MetaMask acted as brokers. Lubin warns that this sets a dangerous precedent. “The SEC is now scouring the GitHubs of software developers who don’t even develop financial applications to find out which products can be classified as brokerage firms,” Lubin said.

Lubin believes the SEC's current regulatory approach is an “attempt to paralyze” the crypto industry. He argues that the SEC does not want Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies to shape the banking landscape.





Additionally, Lubin warns that the SEC's anti-crypto stance could cripple Ethereum's growth in the US, hindering acquisition and development. He argues that irrational regulations must be resisted for the sector to grow.

Bitcoin Traders Closing More Positions As Prices Range Above $60,000


																Bitcoin has been trending lower after failing to break above $66,000 in early May, deflating hopes of immediate price gains post-Halving. Taking to X, one analyst shared on-chain data that paints a more nuanced picture than a simple loss of confidence in recent weeks. 
Bitcoin Open Interest Remains Low: Bullish?
The analyst, pointing to CryptoQuant data, observes that leveraged traders on perpetual trading platforms like Binance appear to be closing their positions more than opening new ones. The analyst notes that the reading is at -20% at the monthly change in Open Interest. 
BTC open interest in one month | Source: Analyst on X
At this level, it shows that more traders are closing more positions than opening new ones. This development suggests that most traders adopt a strategic wait-and-see, watching prices evolve.

Despite the decrease in positions opening, it’s important to note that this is not a sign of BTC’s downfall or the invalidation of a potential surge. The analyst interpreted this contraction as a strategic move by traders, who are cautiously optimistic and not exiting the market due to bearish expectations. 
In a separate post, the analyst added that the Bitcoin market needs the current wave of liquidation and “negativity” for accumulating short positions. All short positions opened at spot levels bet that BTC will continue trickling lower, even breaking below $56,500. 
BTC long liquidation dominance | Source: Analyst on X
However, the more short positions there are, the higher the possibility of a “short squeeze” forming. When this happens, there will be a sudden price spike, liquidating shorts and forcing sellers to buy back into the market to prevent further damage. 
BTC Inside A Trade Range: Will $60,000 Fail?
Despite the potential upside hinted by on-chain data, prices remain confined within a narrow range. Last week, bulls failed to close above $66,000, confirming the impressive march from May 3. 
Bitcoin trending sideways on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView
Bitcoin found resistance and is moving lower toward the psychological $60,000 level. From price action, losses below this line might fast-track the collapse toward $56,500 registered in early May. 
Going forward, traders will closely monitor how prices evolve after the all-important Halving on April 20. Considering the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the involvement of institutions, some analysts expected prices to shoot higher immediately.

Nonetheless, this has not been the case. Prices continue to hang amid fluctuating inflows to spot ETFs, and the United States Federal Reserve is still not slashing interest rates.

Dencun Destroyed The Ethereum "Ultra-Sound Money" Narrative: CryptoQuant


								Researchers at CryptoQuant, a crypto analytics platform, are now disproving the idea that Ethereum is “ultra-sound money,” especially after activating the highly anticipated Dencun Upgrade in mid-March. 
Analysts observe that the hard fork has slowed the number of coins going to the “furnace.” Accordingly, ETH is now more deflationary, considering the rising daily supply over the past weeks. 
The Impact Of Dencun On Gas Fees
Analysts say the Dencun Upgrade was one of the major updates after The Merge. With Dencun, Ethereum developers introduced proto-danksharding for more efficient and cheap transaction processing, especially by layer-2 platforms like Arbitrum. 
Besides helping reduce gas fees for layer-2 solutions, the update enhanced the mainnet scalability. Accordingly, the primary layer could handle more transactions without congestion or gas fees spiking.

Though layer-2 gas fees have drastically fallen, activity on Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base have registered more activity. However, the problem with lower gas fees from layer-2 transactions, which are bundled and confirmed mainnet, means Ethereum is now increasing fewer coins. 
Ethereum price trending sideways on the daily chart | Source: ETHUSDT on Binance, TradingView
As such, ETH gradually becomes inflation after months of supply reduction, reflecting the adoption of the mainnet and off-chain solutions.
The rate at which ETH became deflationary pre-Dencun meant the “ultra-sound money” narrative was valid. Due to the rapidly falling supply, ETH, like BTC or gold, could become a store of value.
Ethereum Is Becoming Inflationary: Study
However, CryptoQuant data now paints a concerning picture. A report found that shrinking gas fees from layer-2 platforms translates to lower ETH being taken from supply. 
ETH supply rising after Dencun | Source: CryptoQuant
This “structural shift” researchers discovered, means that ETH supply is no longer decreasing as rapidly as before. In their assessment, they noted that in recent days, the ETH supply has been growing at the fastest daily rate since the Merge.
ETH burning post-Dencun is falling | Source: CryptoQuant
At this pace, if the rate of ETH burning continues to drop, Ethereum may no longer be on track to become deflationary. It will be especially so if activity shifts, as has been the case, to competition low-fee and scalable networks like Solana and Avalanche. 

Falling Ethereum and Bitcoin prices will further exacerbate the burn rate. Whenever prices crumble, on-chain activity tends to contract sharply over time.

								Global trading and technology firm Susquehanna is making massive investments in spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
In a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company says it bought 17,271,326 shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in three tranches of $6.3 million, $1.05 billion and $34.77 million for a total of $1.09 billion.










The GBTC investment, which is now worth $955.10 million based on the current market price of $55.30 per share, represents Susquehanna’s biggest spot Bitcoin ETF allocation.
The trading firm also bought 1,349,414 shares of Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) for $83.74 million, 583,049 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) for $23.6 million, 560,832 shares of Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) for $21.7 million and 508,824 shares of ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) for $36.1 million.
Susquehanna’s portfolio also includes 256,354 shares of VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) bought for $20.6 million, 255,814 shares of WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) valued at $19.3 million at time of purchase, 166,200 shares of Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) acquired for $11.8 million and 192,391 shares of Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) worth $3.9 million.
In all, the trading giant with $481 billion in total assets under management (AUM) invested $1.31 billion in nine spot Bitcoin ETFs.
The SEC greenlit 11 applications to offer the BTC investment product in January, though it did warn that Bitcoin is still considered a volatile and speculative asset.

Canadian regulator fines Binance $4.4M for AML and CFT violations

The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) announced it was imposing a $4.4 million administrative monetary penalty on Binance for failing to register and report large transactions in digital assets.In a May 9 notice, FINTRAC said it had imposed penalties on Binance Holdings Limited for noncompliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations. According to the regulator, Binance failed to register as a foreign money services business and report digital currency transactions that exceeded $10,000. FINTRAC said it had fined Binance 6,002,000 CAD, or roughly $4.4 million at the time of publication.

Major US City Handing $32,000,000 To Residents As Guaranteed Income Program Reboots - The Daily Hodl


								A major US city is preparing to relaunch a multimillion-dollar basic income program that will hand cash directly to residents.
Mayor Brandon Johnson says he is allocating $32 million to reboot the Chicago Resilient Communities pilot, reports CBS News.










The revived program seeks to hand out $500 per month for a period of one year to families experiencing financial struggles.
The mayor says funding will come from the $1.9 billion that the city received from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in 2021.
The city of Chicago is giving the guaranteed income program new life in an effort to distribute the remaining ARPA funds or risk giving it back to the federal government next year.
Chicago Resilient Communities was initially launched by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot in 2022 to help 5,000 low-income households get back on their feet after the pandemic.
The Johnson administration has not yet divulged the qualification details for the rebooted program. Participants of the original pilot were Chicago residents at least 18 years old at time of enrollment, had a family income at or below 250% of the Federal Poverty Line and faced financial difficulties due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The exact number of families that will receive the $500 monthly payment under the restarted program also remains unknown.

                        With cryptocurrency markets choppy on Thursday as Bitcoin (BTC) rebounds from session lows in the $61,000s back to the mid-$62,000s, traders are parsing through their options in the altcoin market as they hunt for the best crypto to buy now on May the 9th.Some attributed the bounce in Bitcoin from session lows to weaker-than-expected US jobless claims data.This data comes following last week’s softer-than-expected official US jobs report.But, in the grand scheme of things, Thursday’s Bitcoin bounce means very little for the near-term outlook.Bitcoin remains locked within recent ranges as traders monitor long-term market themes.These include spot Bitcoin ETF demand, the outlook for Fed rate cuts, the evolution of post-halving sell pressure (it is expected to eventually ease, potentially precipitating a major rally) and the upcoming US elections.Former President Donald Trump remains the favorite to resecure election. And that could be bullish for crypto.Just last night, Trump commented that “if you’re in favor of crypto – you better vote for Trump”.https://twitter.com/marionawfal/status/1788392597993496935Elsewhere, as Ether (ETH) pivots either side of $3,000, traders are focusing on its shifting supply dynamics.
Ether Turns Inflationary as Ethereum Fees Drop 
The recent Dencun upgrade has reduced Ethereum fees by as much as 4x, according to CryptoQuant data.That has substantially reduced the cryptocurrency’s burn rate, with the Ether supply recently turning inflationary as a result.This has concerned some ETH traders. Many see continued ETH deflation as a key value proposition for holding the cryptocurrency.However, these traders must remember the chilling impact that high fees has on Ethereum’s adoption.If Ethereum is going to retain its spot as the dominant smart-contract-enabled blockchain in web3, lowering fees is key.After all, why would everyday users choose to transact on Ethereum if fees are 100x higher than on other chains.
Will Token Unlocks Hit the Altcoins Markets?
Lower fees on Ethereum could also help breathe life into meme coins and altcoins.That being said, 10x Research fed the FUD on Thursday with a note postulating that the cryptocurrency bull market cycle might be shorter than previous ones, and unlikely to culminate in a broad altcoin rally.They cite nearly $2 billion in token unlocks which could lower the market in the coming ten weeks.Affected tokens include Aptos, Starkware, Arbitrum, Optimism and Ethena, which see between $50-100 million in unlocks, and Avalanche and Sui, which see $330 million and nearly $1 billion in unlocks respectively.Traders hunting for the best crypto to buy now will thus need to be selective.Here are some strong performers on Thursday that traders will be watching.
Best Crypto to Buy NowArweave (AR)
Arweave (AR) is a market leader on Thursday, up around 13% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.Last at $41.70, the cryptocurrency is eyeing a break above recent highs in the $42,50 area.That could open the to a retest of March highs between $46.50 and $47.50.AR has found strong support at its 100DMA in recent weeks, suggesting the bulls remain in control.Arweave stands a good chance of testing its 2021 highs above $90 this bull market. Thus, it could potentially be the best crypto to buy now.AR bulls are in control and the crypto could be the best to buy now. Source: TradingViewRender (RNDR)
Render (RNDR) is another token with strong momentum, hitting new multi-week highs on Thursday above $11.Last up 12% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap, Render was last trading around $10.94.Render broke to the north of a pennant structure earlier this month and the bulls have since been in control.The prospect of a quick 23% pump makes Render potentially the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewIt could soon retest its March highs in the mid-$13s.  The prospect of a quick 23% pump makes Render potentially the best crypto to buy now.
Toncoin (TON)
Toncoin (TON) is another very strong performer on Thursday, up 7.5% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.TON hit its highest level since mid-April on Thursday above $6.30, having founds support at its 50DMA earlier this week.The latest rally opens the door to a rebound back to TON’s all-time highs above $7.50.
Crypto Alternatives to Consider
All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make 10x gains.But, for those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in crypto presales.See the below video where analysts at Cryptonews outline their top 5 presale picks right now.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4A9P2LbaRo

SEC Stifling Innovation by Hindering Ethereum's Potential in Banking: Joseph Lubin

                        Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin launched scathing criticisms against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 9, accusing the regulatory body of deliberately impeding innovation and obstructing Ethereum’s transformative potential in the banking landscape.Speaking at FT Live’s Crypto and Digital Assets summit in London, Lubin criticized the SEC’s approach, alleging that instead of fostering open discourse and providing clear regulatory guidelines, the SEC has opted for strategic enforcement actions, causing uncertainty within the cryptocurrency industry.“The SEC probably doesn’t want to see a wave of innovation that will really transform the landscape,” he said.
Joseph Lubin On Why SEC is “hindering Innovation.”
Lubin’s remarks were made in light of Consensys’s decision to sue the SEC after receiving a Wells notice from the regulator. Lubin asserted that the SEC’s actions, such as reclassifying Ether as a security without transparent communication, were designed to instill fear and doubt, potentially driving cryptocurrency companies offshore.“The SEC appears to have reclassified Ether as a security without telling anybody that that’s the case,” Lubin said. “They are going about a strategic series of enforcement actions rather than open discourse and clear rulemaking.”Central to Lubin’s critique is the suspicion surrounding the SEC’s motives, particularly regarding its recent enforcement actions against Ethereum. Lubin suggested that the impending decision to approve Ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has spurred the SEC’s intensified scrutiny, fearing the potential influx of capital into the Ethereum ecosystem.“We believe that there’s a flurry of activity designed to enable them to say that their action wasn’t capricious in the very likely event that they deny the Ether spot ETFs,” The Ethereum co-founder explained.In Lubin’s view, the SEC’s reluctance to embrace Ethereum’s advancements in scalability and usability stems from a desire to maintain the status quo, fearing the transformative impact decentralized finance (DeFi) could have on the banking industry.“I think they’re concerned that so much attention and capital will flow to our ecosystem, considering it is improving enormously in terms of scalability and usability,” he added.Lubin further argued that the SEC’s apprehension towards innovation reflects a broader reluctance to adapt to emerging technologies, potentially hindering the growth of the cryptocurrency sector.Additionally, Lubin cautioned against the SEC’s attempts to classify platforms like Coinbase and MetaMask’s wallets as broker-dealers, warning that such actions could set a dangerous precedent and stifle innovation across the technology sector.“We’re at odds over whether we should register MetaMask as a broker-dealer,” he said. “Should ever MetaMask user have to register their wallet as a broker-dealer, it’s chilling.”
SEC Will Most Likely Reject Spot ETH EFTs
The SEC recently decided to delay its ruling on the proposed Invesco Galaxy spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The new deadline for the decision is July 5, 2024. The SEC stated additional time is required to review the proposed rule change and the associated issues thoroughly.Similarly, Franklin Templeton’s application for a spot Ethereum ETF also faces an extended delay, with the SEC pushing the decision deadline to June 11, 2024.Several other issuers, including BlackRock, 21Shares with Ark, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton, have filed applications for Ethereum ETFs, adding to the market’s anticipation.Market analysts had initially speculated that the SEC would reach a final decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications during May, coinciding with deadlines for various asset managers’ submissions.The recent delays announced by the SEC have dampened these expectations, however. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart expressed skepticism, suggesting that the current round of Ether ETF applications might face rejection, altering the landscape for Ethereum investment options in the US.

‘Just a Bunch of Noise and Garbage’: Cardano Creator Blasts Biden's Stance on Planned Repeal of SEC Custody Law - The Daily Hodl


								The creator of smart contract platform Cardano (ADA) is calling out President Joe Biden’s stance on a planned resolution that would enfeeble the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In a new video update, Charles Hoskinson tells his 315,000 YouTube subscribers that Biden saying he would veto H.J. Resolution 109 if passed is “just a bunch of noise and garbage.”










“Blah blah blah just a bunch of noise and garbage. It’s one thing to have regulation by enforcement, it’s another thing to say that when the legislative branch comes together, talks to everybody, and comes up with proposals for how we as a nation can innovate and move forward, that you’ll just veto it.”
Earlier this week, the Biden Administration sent out a memo saying that the passage of HJ Resolution 109 would disrupt the SEC from being able to protect investors within the crypto markets as it would invalidate SAB 121, which provides regulations for entities holding digital assets on behalf of others.
In the statement, the Biden Administration said he would veto H.J. Resolution 109 if passed.
“H.J. Resolution 109 would invalidate SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which reflects considered SEC staff views regarding the accounting obligations of certain firms that safeguard crypto assets… 
Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty. If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 109, he would veto it.” 
H.J. Resolution 109 is a bipartisan resolution proposed in February and sponsored by Nebraska Representative Mike Flood.

Bitcoin Short-Term Jitters: Are Whales Losing Interest? - DailyCoin


        
Bitcoin’s price has been stuck for weeks, but is this a buying opportunity or a sign of an impending crash?



Analysts have been puzzled by recent whale activity, a major factor in Bitcoin’s price movements.



While some data suggests whales have lost interest, a recent buying spree hints at a possible reversal.
Bitcoin’s price has been hovering between $60,000 and $64,000 for weeks, presenting a buying opportunity for investors eyeing a peak in the current bull cycle. However, recent on-chain data paints a conflicting picture of whale activity, a major factor influencing Bitcoin’s price movements.Whales’ Enthusiasm WanesLarge investors, or “whales,” holding over 1,000 BTC significantly bolstered Bitcoin’s price through consistent buying, particularly during market dips, throughout the beginning of 2024. This activity fueled bullish sentiment and prevented major price corrections. 
However, data from IntoTheBlock, an on-chain analytics firm, reveals a concerning trend: the volume of Bitcoin accumulated by whales has shrunk with each buying cycle over the past month.The most significant buying spree occurred between March 5 and 7, with whales acquiring over 120,000 BTC. Every subsequent price dip witnessed a decrease in whale accumulation, with the recent drop to $56,000 failing to attract a notable buying response. This decline suggests that whales might have lost some short-term interest in accumulating more Bitcoin.Recent Uptick Suggests Re-Accumulation PhaseHowever, a recent post from blockchain analytics platform Santiment indicates a potential shift. According to Santiment, large investors holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC collectively purchased over $941 million worth of Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. This resurgence in buying activity signifies a potential re-accumulation phase for whales following a period of profit-taking.
This conflicting on-chain data has divided crypto experts. Some analysts, like Willy Woo, believe investors are accumulating Bitcoin again, but a confirmation of the trend reversal might take a week. Others, like Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, view the recent whale activity as the beginning of a new bullish era.On the other hand, some analysts at Bitfinex crypto exchange believe selling pressure might be waning, potentially leading to a price recovery. This aligns with the increased positive inflows observed in the United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund market in the past week.Concerns Linger About Waning Whale ConvictionDespite the recent uptick, the initial decline in whale buying activity raises concerns about a potential reversal into a bearish trend. Some analysts even speculate that Bitcoin might have peaked in this cycle. While lower whale buying activity could stall price increases in the short term, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee a major crash. However, continuing this trend for several months could signal weakening market demand. While a drop below the current support level of $59,000-$61,000 could cause losses for many holders, most crypto analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the short-term trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. Whether the recent whale buying signals a renewed accumulation phase or a short-term blip remains to be seen.On the Flipside
Short-term profit-taking by whales could be a buying opportunity for smaller investors seeking to accumulate at lower prices.



The declining whale buying activity could be due to investors waiting for a deeper price correction before accumulating more Bitcoin.



The positive inflows into the US spot Bitcoin ETF market could indicate renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin, which could help offset any potential selling pressure from whales.
Why This MattersWhales have been a key driver of Bitcoin’s price surge in 2024. Recent data showing a decline in their buying activity, followed by a small uptick, creates uncertainty. This conflicting picture raises concerns about waning whale confidence, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s price trajectory in the coming weeks and influencing broader market sentiment.If you’re interested in learning more about the technical indicators used to forecast Bitcoin’s price, this is the article for you:Bitcoin Sees Choppy Waters Ahead: Are Bulls Out of the Race?Are you curious about what analysts think caused the recent upswing and where Bitcoin is headed next?

Bitcoin Wallet Maker Exodus 'Deeply Disappointed' as SEC Blocks NYSE Listing - Decrypt

Bitcoin wallet software company Exodus Movement has said it was “surprised, confused, and deeply disappointed” after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) move to delay the company’s planned listing on a U.S. stock exchange. Yesterday, the SEC postponed the crypto company’s listing on the NYSE American, the New York Stock Exchange’s sibling market, according to Exodus. “Today, the SEC made a surprise last-minute decision that delays Exodus from listing on the NYSE American,” Exodus said on Twitter (aka X) late Wednesday. “While we are deeply disappointed, Exodus will continue to empower customers all over the world to control their own wealth using our best-in-class self-custody crypto wallet,” the firm’s statement reads.In an official statement, Exodus CEO JP Richardson said: “While we are surprised and confused by this last-minute decision, we remain hopeful that the SEC will follow through on its commitment to treat us as the law intends.”Exodus, which offers a self-custodial software wallet for a number of cryptocurrencies, declined to comment further and respond to Decrypt’s questions. The company, which went public in 2021, was due to list its common stock on NYSE American under the ticker EXOD. Exodus’ common stock was set to be tokenized on Algorand, the crypto network behind ALGO, the 64th biggest digital asset. That would make it the only company in the U.S. to have its common stock tokenized on a blockchain. Wall Street’s top regulator, the SEC, has come down hard on the digital asset industry over the past few years. It has sued a number of top American crypto exchanges—including Coinbase and Kraken—for allegedly offering unregistered securities, and has further warned other crypto startups that enforcement actions are coming.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Address poisoning attacker sends $153K ETH to victim and agrees to negotiate

The address-poisoning attacker who allegedly tricked a user into sending them $68 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has sent $153,000 worth of Ether (ETH) back to the victim in an apparent show of good faith. In the same transaction, the attacker sent a message agreeing to negotiate and asking the victim for a Telegram username where they can be contacted. The amount sent back represents just 0.225% of the total funds allegedly stolen.Blockchain data shows that on May 5, the attack victim, whose account ends in 8fD5, sent three messages to an account ending in dA6D. The recipient of the message had received funds from the attacking account, labeled “FakePhishing327990” on Etherscan, through several intermediate accounts. This implies that dA6D was likely to have been controlled by the attacker. The messages implied that the victim was willing to give the attacker 10% of the funds as a bounty and refrain from prosecuting if they returned the other 90%. The victim stated:“We both know there's no way to clean this funds. You will be traced. We also both understand the ‘sleep well’ phrase wasn't about your moral and ethical qualities. Nevertheless, we officially admin your right to the 10%. Send 90% back. There are 24 hours for you before 10am UTC, 6th May 2024 to make a decision that will change your life, in any case.”At 11:37 am UTC on May 9, another account ending in 72F1 responded by sending 51 Ether (ETH) (worth $153,000 at today’s price) to the victim. 72F1 had also received funds from FakePhishing327990 through several intermediate accounts, indicating it was also under the attacker's control. In the transaction that sent the 51 ETH, the attacker also posted a message stating “PleaseleaveyourtelegramandIwillcontactyou.” They then attempted to correct their bad punctuation at 11:43 am, posting an additional message that stated: “Please leave your telegram and I will contact you[.]”In response, the victim posted a Telegram username where they can be contacted.Address poisoning victim negotiates with attacker. Source: Etherscan.The negotiation occurred after the attacker allegedly tricked the victim into sending 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) (worth $68 million at the time) into their account by mistake, which they did through an “address poisoning” transaction.Blockchain data shows that at 09:17 am on May 3, the attacker used a smart contract to transfer 0.05 of a token from the victim’s account to the attacker's account. The token transferred had no name listed on Etherscan and was simply referred to as “ERC-20.” Under normal circumstances, an attacker cannot transfer a token from another user without their consent. But in this case, the token had a custom design that allowed it to be transferred from an account without the user’s consent.At 10:31 am on the same day, the victim sent 1,155 WBTC to this address, apparently by mistake. The address may have appeared similar to an address used by the victim to deposit funds into a centralized exchange or for some other reason.In addition, the victim may have seen that they sent 0.05 of a token to this address in the past and therefore assumed it was safe. However, the 0.05 tokens were sent by the attacker and only appeared to have come from the victim. When an attacker attempts to confuse victims by spamming them with transactions that appear to be coming from them but are actually coming from the attacker, security experts call it an “address poisoning attack.” Experts recommend that users carefully inspect the sending address in a transaction before confirming it, so as to avoid costly errors from these kinds of attacks.Related: How to avoid zero-value transfer address poisoning attacks

Will Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Be Able to Reinitiate Recovery?


Dogecoin (DOGE) is sitting in a crucial position, and losing it could cause considerable losses to investors. 
The broader market is becoming increasingly bearish, so DOGE may find it hard to prevent a drawdown.
Dogecoin Investors May Witness Losses
At the time of writing, Dogecoin’s price is trading above a crucial support loss, which could result in a potential death cross. The crypto market is cooling down from the recent rally, and this impact can be seen across digital assets.
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence hints at the same. (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that identifies trend changes by comparing two moving averages of an asset’s price. 

The indicator observes the formation of a potential bearish crossover with the green bars on the histogram declining. This suggests that bullishness is receding even though the past week was the first instance of optimism in the past month.

Generally, when the market does not support a recovery, investors tend to be the saviors of an asset. However, this is not the case with DOGE since investors will likely opt to step back.
This is because, as noted on the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator, about 12.48 billion DOGE bought between $0.13 and $0.15 will lose profitability if Dogecoin’s price falls. This $1.8 billion worth of supply becoming turn loss-bearing will potentially incentivize investors to HODL until gains are visible.

Thus, this would affect their participation, which in turn will slow down any chances of recovery Dogecoin may have.
DOGE Price Prediction: The Last Ray of Support
Trading at $0.14, Dogecoin’s price is sitting above a key support level, which has been tested multiple times in the past. Falling through this crucial support in the past has resulted in a drawdown to the $0.12 support level.

The Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) are forming a potential death cross. A death cross is a bearish technical pattern where a short-term 50-day EMA crosses below a long-term 200-day EMA. This indicates a potential downtrend continuation.

Consequently, DOGE could fall to $0.12 support and, in the process, result in $1.8 billion worth of losses as well.
However, if Dogecoin’s price returns from the $0.14 support, it could note a recovery beyond $0.15. This would invalidate the bearish thesis and make the 12.48 billion DOGE profitable again.

How Ethereum EIP-7702 Boosts Wallet UX with Minimal Downsides - DailyCoin


        
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has launched a proposal to improve the wallet experience of crypto users.



The new proposal, dubbed EIP-7702, rivals EIP-3074, which has come into focus recently.



The recent proposal has sparked a debate over which should be included in Ethereum’s next upgrade.
Ethereum is hunting for a halfway solution to improve the user experience of traditional wallets.Until recently, EIP-3074 was the major contender to fill the gap, and it had already been earmarked for the network’s next upgrade, known as Pectra. But just as users were digesting the implications of EIP-3074, a competing proposal from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin arrived on the scene: EIP-7702.
How do the rival EIPs compare?A Less Disruptive and More Future-Proof Change?First proposed in 2020, EIP-3074 intends to allow users of traditional wallets to enjoy the same benefits as smart wallets created in 2023 by EIP-4337. These benefits include the ability to batch transactions, sponsor transactions of one wallet, and recover wallet addresses with social recovery tools. The proposal makes code changes to the EVM, allowing users to delegate wallet control to smart contracts called invokers.Despite the potential benefits, EIP-3074 raises security and forward compatibility concerns. The security concerns come from market participants fearing that many users could lose their assets by delegating to malicious invokers. To address this, however, wallets will likely create a trusted list of invokers from which to choose. On the other hand, addressing forward compatibility concerns has yet to be as straightforward. With the network eventually intending to fully transition to smart wallets under EIP-4337, building with EIP-3074 could lead to interoperability issues in the future. Enter EIP-7702.
Proposed on Tuesday, May 7, by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and co-authors Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, and Matt Garnett, EIP-7702 intends to realize all the benefits of EIP-3074 without the forward compatibility concerns. Instead of making code changes to the EVM, EIP-7702 defines a new transaction type that allows users to temporarily populate the existing “contract_code” field in traditional wallets with smart contract code for a given transaction, effectively converting the wallet to a smart contract wallet for the duration of the transaction. Explaining how EIP-7702 addresses the issue of compatibility with EIP-4337 in a HackMD post on Tuesday, Buterin wrote:"The contract code that users would need to sign could literally be existing ERC-4337 wallet code."With EIP-7702 offering a less disruptive and more forward-proof change, it has already begun to garner significant support within the Ethereum community.EIP-7702 To Make It to Pectra?Highlighting the level of support being seen by EIP-7702, Safe co-founder Lukas Schor asserted that it was even receiving support from proponents of EIP-3074.At the same time, some community members have begun advocating for the inclusion of EIP-7702 over EIP-3074 in Pectra. Whether the EIP will be included in the proposal could be determined in the All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) meeting scheduled for Thursday, May 9.On the Flipside 
EIP-7702 is still in the draft stage, meaning its authors can freely edit it.
Why This Matters As the crypto space matures and looks to go mainstream, a key hurdle has been how to abstract away the complexities of the technology. For users of the Ethereum network, this discussion has often settled around how users store their crypto assets and perform transactions, leading to the rise of a concept called account abstraction. EIP-7702 promises to give users of traditional Ethereum wallets the benefits of smart contract wallets while not compromising the network’s account abstraction roadmap.Read these for more on Ethereum:Ethereum’s Next Upgrade Will Boost Wallet UX, but at What Cost?Ethereum Network Growth Spikes Again in Bullish Sign for Price

Majority of Swing State Voters Feel Financial System ‘Favors Elites Over Regular People’: DCG Survey - The Daily Hodl


								Most voters in US swing states think that the financial system is not fair, according to a new survey commissioned by venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG).
The Harris Poll surveyed 1,201 registered voters in Michigan, Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona to explore the attitude of the electorate towards crypto and the current financial system.










The survey found that voters in key battleground states are skeptical of the current financial system. Only 38% percent of the respondents think that the current financial system is meant for people like them while 25% see the system as fair for all.
Reads the report,
“The current financial system is broadly unpopular, with widespread voter agreement that that system is inequitable and that younger generations in particular, are disadvantaged.”
Four in every five registered voters also think that the current financial system favors the elites over regular people.
“The current financial system garners negative reactions from voters, with the majority agreeing that the system favors elites over regular people (80%), lacks transparency (79%), is difficult to understand (67%), and that younger generations are set up to fail (63%).”
Only 14% of the voters own digital assets and 69% do not feel knowledgeable about crypto, but nearly a third have positive feelings towards crypto, of which around 90% are planning to vote in the upcoming 2024 elections.
“Nearly half of voters do not trust political candidates that would interfere with crypto. One-quarter say that enthusiasm towards crypto would make them trust a political candidate more. 30% would be more likely to support a political candidate that is friendly to crypto.”

$1.35B in Bitcoin options expire this week - Do BTC bulls or bears have the upper hand?

Whenever Bitcoin's (BTC) price action exhibits significant corrections, analysts and traders are quick to search for a reason, often pointing fingers at derivatives markets where bears allegedly exploit futures contract liquidation levels or anticipate increased profits from weekly BTC options expiries. Such talk has been on the decline recently, thanks to Bitcoin’s range-bound price action, but now that murmurs of a trend reversal have come back, let’s take a look at how whales are positioned using Bitcoin derivatives markets.Will the May 10$1.35 billion BTC options expiry bring volatility?The recent failure to maintain prices above $65,000 on May 6 is an example of how some market participants blame the weekly options expiry for the recent downtrend. If this were the case, which can be inferred by BTC derivatives metrics, further downward pressure could be expected ahead of the 8:00 am UTC expiry on May 10.From a top-down perspective, the $1.35 billion options open interest seems substantial enough to justify the effort from Bitcoin bears. However, a more detailed analysis reveals a different scenario. Deribit holds an 84% market share for the May 10 options expiry, so data will primarily be extracted from that exchange. Since the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) only offers monthly contracts, it was excluded from the analysis.It's worth noting that call (buy) and put (sell) options are not always matched when stacked against each other, a common feature for such instruments regardless of the underlying asset. Thus, the first relationship to consider is the volume discrepancy between these instruments. Generally, increased demand for puts indicates bearish markets.Deribit BTC options put-to-call volume. Source: Laevitas.chNote that the average BTC options put-to-call volume at Deribit stood at 0.60 for the past 10 days, meaning put (sell) instruments had 40% lower volumes compared to call (buy) options, which has been the norm for the past month. In essence, it's difficult to justify that bears have set some kind of trap or anticipated Bitcoin's failure to sustain $65,000 on May 6.Bitcoin bulls cast overly optimistic betsHowever, one should not take every call option buyer at face value, especially given that there are less than 13 hours ahead of the actual expiry on May 10. For instance, there is hardly a way to justify a right to buy Bitcoin at $74,000 or even $90,000 in such a short time. Therefore, one should not account for those overly optimistic bets when measuring the open interest.Open interest for May 10 Bitcoin expiry at Deribit, in BTC terms. Source: DeribitEven though the put-to-call ratio shows a 35% lower demand for put options, bears are at less risk, as most of the call instruments were placed at $63,000 and higher. In fact, the open interest for call options below this level is $91 million, which means 87% of them will be worthless on May 10. However, if Bitcoin bulls manage to reestablish the $64,000 support, the open interest for call options will surpass the put instruments by $115 million.Related: Despite Bitcoin price volatility, factors point to BTC’s long-term successWhile bears may have avoided significant losses had Bitcoin stayed above $65,000, this doesn't necessarily mean they will come out ahead in the end. Put options at $61,500 or higher have a total open interest of $104 million, which is just enough to balance the equation. The best-case scenario for bears requires a Bitcoin price below $61,000 to secure a $100 million advantage.There is no indication that Bitcoin bears placed additional bets using BTC options to profit from a price crash ahead of the May 10 expiry. There was no unusual demand between put and call instruments, and there is no specific price level that greatly benefits bears. Whatever strategies were employed, the result is an apparent balanced impact at $62,000, suggesting no price surprises are expected.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

How the latest TradFi blockchain trial could mark the ‘five-yard-line’ for mass adoption - Blockworks


The TradFi world has been exploring more ways to use blockchain tech for years now.
But the sheer number of financial players involved in the latest proof-of-concept makes it different from most. Not to mention the size of the entities, and their approach.
Payment giants Visa and Mastercard are coming together with banks JPMorgan, Citigroup and others to test a so-called Regulated Settlement Network. 
The proof-of-concept sets out to experiment with shared ledger technology to settle tokenized commercial bank money, wholesale central bank money, US Treasury securities and other tokenized assets, a Wednesday news release notes.
Read more: Digital Asset Summit Day 2: Financial giants say they’re here to stay
This project represents a new phase of the Regulated Liability Network. Launched in November 2022, the initiative set out to demonstrate the use of shared ledger technology for regulated money movement on one platform.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) is set to manage the new proof of concept. Others involved include Swift, TD Bank, US Bank, USDF, Wells Fargo and Zions Bancorp.
Lamine Brahimi, co-founder of crypto platform Taurus, said he welcomes any initiative that puts cash on-chain at scale. 
“The real benefits of tokenization will come when both the securities and the cash legs of a transaction are both on-chain,” he told Blockworks.
An evolution of projects
Financial players have long explored how it could unlock greater automation and more standardized data rails via blockchain tech while cutting costs and offering greater transparency.
Blockchain-focused proof-of-concepts and other tokenization efforts have seemed to ramp up in recent months. 
JPMorgan’s blockchain arm Onyx last year carried out tests under the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian to explore how fund managers could tokenize portfolios on various blockchains in a permissioned manner.
BlackRock used JPMorgan’s Tokenized Collateral Network to tokenize shares in one of its money market funds around the same time. It then sent those tokenized interests to Barclays as collateral for an over-the-counter derivatives trade.
Also under Project Guardian, Switzerland-based UBS brought a tokenized investment fund on Ethereum in November.
Even more recently, Citi tokenized a private equity fund issued by Wellington Management on Avalanche’s Spruce subnet in February.

But the latest efforts revealed on Wednesday appear “incrementally more important” than prior trials, said Colin Butler, global head of institutional capital at Polygon.
“I say that because the parties mentioned are looking to align on a standard, to which they’re getting closer,” he told Blockworks. “This represents to me the five-yard-line for mass institutional adoption.”
The financial industry’s approach to more recent blockchain projects is “qualitatively different” than in the past several years, said Ralf Kubli, board member of The Casper Association.
“It is clear that large institutions have decided that shared ledger technology offers a compelling value proposition in many critical areas of the value chain, and that they must be part of this development,” he explained. 
Institutional involvement in this space has come through experimentation, or by investing in or acquiring startups with mature technology stacks, Kubli noted.
The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) closed its deal in December to acquire Securrency — a blockchain-based financial and regulatory technology developer. 
The world’s largest asset manager last week led a $47 million funding round for Securitize, a firm focused on bringing physical and traditional financial assets on-chain.

“This strong commitment by established financial institutions will drive the emergence of enterprise grade infrastructure by startups and spinouts, as well as provide a glimpse on the future interaction between public chains and permissioned environments,” Kubli told Blockworks.  
Proof-of-concept expectations
The proof-of-concept will publish an analysis of whether the network could operate under existing laws or guidance in the United States. Findings intend to inform “next generation settlement models,” SIFMA said in a news release.
Brahimi said he hopes to see “the confirmation of major efficiency gains” by having both securities and cash on-chain. The experiment could also demonstrate reduced counterparty risk and improved collateral transfers between institutions.
“A legal assessment of what needs to be modified to scale these activities will also be useful,” he added. “Based on the projects Taurus is involved in, it will be faster than what people think.”

Morgan Krupetsky, who leads business development for institutions and capital markets at Ava Labs, said she is encouraged by the array of entities involved. 
Still, more buy-side participation from asset managers, corporates, hedge funds and pension funds, for example, in such blockchain trials would be beneficial. Having that segment’s buy-in and support will be critical, she added.
“They often experience comparable pain points, [and] they’re increasingly viewing this space as a strategic imperative,” she told Blockworks. “[It] would provide valuable input and insight to the banks who ultimately service these, and other, clients.”
Those anxiously awaiting an overhaul of legacy financial services infrastructure and systems will have to stay patient. 
The lengthy experimentation ultimately helps financial institutions, infrastructure providers and regulators assess the benefits of dedicating resources to ultimately building products that use shared ledger tech, Krupetsky explained.  
Kubli added: “I believe we will see serious and productive environments in the coming six to 12 months as part of the various peer-to-peer engagement…and more importantly, through the various sandbox approaches and central bank-led initiatives, including the [Bank for International Settlements].”

With Bitcoin at a ‘Range Low’, Crypto Analyst Picks Out Two ‘Promising’ Altcoins for Traders To Watch - The Daily Hodl


								One widely followed crypto analyst says Bitcoin (BTC) needs to hold current price levels or face a precipitous drop.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 717,100 followers on the social media platform X that BTC could potentially fall by $10,000 in value if current levels aren’t maintained.










“Bitcoin is at the range low. This is technically the area where you’d prefer to see it hold, so the upward momentum continues, and the range holds.
If this doesn’t hold, then we might expect $52,000-$55,000 as a potential low on this correction.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is trading for $61,966 at time of writing, up 5% on the week.
The analyst next breaks down AIOZ Network (AIOZ), a blockchain project seeking to embed itself at the intersection of Web3, AI, storage and streaming.
“This one looks very promising and is one of the strongest trending assets.
In-trend level to hold: $0.65-0.68.
If that’s lost, then the long-term investment region comes into play.
If we hold, I expect $1.35-1.45 might seem next. 
Very strong one.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
AIOZ is trading for $0.853 at time of writing, up 10% on the day.
Van de Poppe also looks at the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Injective (INJ). Even though INJ has been down big since December, Van de Poppe says the altcoin has a lot of room to run.
“The hype has faded away, and it’s down 70% against Bitcoin.
A prime example of rotation.
Peaked in December ’23. 
Bitcoin did a +70% since then, INJ a -40%. 
Never marry your bag; rotate to Bitcoin to make more Bitcoin. 
An attractive area for a long.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
INJ is worth $23.69 at time of writing.

Giant Whale May Have Sold a Large Amount of the Most Talked About Altcoin of Recent Weeks - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Onchain data, a large cryptocurrency whale may have recently sold heavily in an altcoin listed on Binance.
Data shows that an account with short wallet address 0x58FD transferred 14.53 million Ethena (ENA) to Bybit minutes ago. The amount in question corresponds to 12.54 million dollars at the time of writing this article.


Balina wallet purchased this amount of ENA tokens from the developer company Ethena Labs on April 1.
Although the whale wallet's transfer of tokens to a central cryptocurrency exchange most likely means sale, it is not possible to determine exactly whether the whale actually sold these tokens.






ENA, one of Binance's Launchpool projects, was recently launched and made a big splash. Ethena has a stablecoin called USDe and is compared to Terra, the $40 billion cryptocurrency ecosystem that went bankrupt due to the high interest income it promised. However, the developers claim that they have no connection with Terra's system.
At the time of writing this article, ENA price has lost 3.78% of its value in the last 24 hours and is traded at $0.87.

SEC has taken ‘too expansive’ a view of crypto, says former commissioner

Troy Paredes, who served as a commissioner at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 2008 to 2013, suggested that the regulator might be overreaching on what digital assets it considered securities.Speaking at the TokenizeThis 2024 conference in Miami on May 9, Paredes said SEC Chair Gary Gensler seemed to suggest that the commission had clarity on his views of what constituted a security under the Howey test. However, he said there was still a “jurisdictional question” the SEC needed to address on digital assets.“I mean, if it’s not a security, then it’s outside the scope of the federal securities laws in the SEC’s jurisdiction,” said Paredes. “The commission, I believe, has taken a very expansive view as to what constitutes a security under the Howey test.”Troy Paredes speaking at TokenizeThis 2024. Source: Sam BourgiThe former commissioner added that many in and outside of the SEC seemed to be focusing on labeling certain tokens as securities, but they weren’t addressing how to “adapt the regulatory regime” for digital assets.

                        An NFT trader lost over $145,000 worth of tokens in a BAYC phishing scam, according to May 9 data from on-chain security platform PeckShield.PeckShield revealed that a trader known as “tatis.eth” fell victim to a phishing scam perpetrated by an attacker identified as “PinkDrainer.” The malicious entity stole three valuable BAYC NFTs – BAYC 7531, BAYC 6736, and BAYC 2100 – from the trader’s wallet.
The BAYC Phishing Scam That Led to the Loss of $145,000 Worth of NFTs
BAYC, also known as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), is a collection of 100,000 Ethereum-based collectibles. These NFTs are among the most influential and expensive ones around. They feature profile pictures of bored cartoon apes in various facial expressions and clothing.A similar report from ZachXBT revealed that the stolen NFTs were transferred to a phishing address labeled “Fake_Phishing328357” on May 8 at 5:47 PM UTC. Thereafter, the attacker sold the three NFTs for a total of 48.5 ETH, equivalent to approximately $145,000.Source: Blockchain Data/ZachXBTThis is not the first time the “PinkDrainer” scammer has been involved in such atrocious activities. Cyvers Alerts, a real-time security alert platform, recently reported a similar phishing scheme where a victim’s wallet was drained of $92,800 worth of Ethereum to the same “PinkDrainer” address.In December 2023, the same hacker group reportedly stole Chainlink (LINK) tokens worth $4.4 million by tricking users into authorizing transactions linked to the “IncreaseAllowance” function.In Q4 of 2023, recurrent incidents of scammers impersonating reputable platforms and protocols to obtain transaction approvals and steal digital assets from unsuspecting users were widely reported.A notable instance was the JPEG’d NFT protocol, where the community had to come out in October 2023 about multiple fraudulent platforms imitating its offerings in an attempt to obtain transaction approvals so they could scam users of their NFTs and digital assets.
Over $104 million Has Been Lost to Crypto Phishing And NFT Scams in 2024
The crypto industry has been on the receiving end of enormous losses due to phishing attacks in the first two months of 2024.According to Scam Sniffer data, an estimated 97,000 users have fallen victim to these sophisticated scams, resulting in a total loss of $104 million worth of cryptocurrencies. This was followed by its report that showed $46.86 million worth of crypto was stolen in February 2024.The Ethereum ecosystem has been specifically targeted, with $78 million of the total losses coming from users’ Ether and ERC20 tokens being drained from their wallets.Most of these funds were lost due to unsuspecting users signing malicious signatures, such as “ERC20 Permit” and “increaseAllowance,” which grant attackers unauthorized access to their assets.Crypto News also reported in April 2024 that phishing campaigns were targeting users of Etherscan, with several advertisements being used for malicious operations.
Scam Sniffer’s analysis revealed that cybercriminals have been leveraging social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), to lure unsuspecting victims to phishing sites.These hackers post deceptive comments under the X posts of targeted accounts in a way that impersonates their customer representatives and directs users to malicious websites where their assets are compromised.While the losses in the first two months of 2024 are concerning, they represent only a fraction of the $300 million in total funds lost by users to crypto phishing attacks throughout 2023.

Trump's Crypto Embrace | Bankless


Trump Pump. Crypto had a mainstream moment last night at 2024 US Presidential candidate Donald Trump’s NFT trading card gala. Could a Trump re-election be bullish for the crypto industry, and what tokens managed to pop off?Collectors of Trump’s NFT trading cards got access to an exclusive Q&A with the former President at his Mar-a-Lago Palm Beach golf estate, and many of his responses at the event quickly found their way into virality on Crypto Twitter.In one clip, Trump states he does not want to see crypto companies forced to leave America because of hostile regulation.In another, he berates Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler and the broader Democratic party for their anti-crypto attitudes, juxtaposing himself as the candidate who is “fine with it” and the only choice for pro-crypto voters come the general election this November.Trump's message resonated strongly with an overwhelming majority of CT, leading many thought leaders to throw their weight behind the controversial Presidential hopeful in an election that has increasingly become a single-issue contest for many industry participants.
While there is certainly a possibility that Trump was simply pandering to his pro-crypto audience given the nature of the event, President Biden's administration has clearly demonstrated that it will do everything possible to stall and hinder the growth of crypto.From executive branch agencies that have done little besides suing leading crypto companies for breach of unclear regulations while failing to provide clarity to President Biden’s commitment to veto a recent House bill seeking to eliminate onerous capital requirements imposed by the SEC on banks that custody crypto assets, the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the current administration is committed to maintaining a hostile stance toward crypto.
A Trump re-election would be monumental for the industry, considering that his statements – alongside his NFT collection – suggest his administration would adopt a much more pro-crypto approach to regulation than its predecessor, potentially providing the needed regulatory clarity to fuel widespread adoption.Additionally, while the proposed Biden Budget for 2025 would send the highest capital gains tax bracket to its highest level since 1922 and includes a novel 25% on unrealized gains, Trump has vowed to make expiring provisions from his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent upon re-election.Extension of these tax cuts would not only increase the amount of capital retained by investors, it is also anticipated to increase the US fiscal deficit by $3.8T over the next decade. The former factor would fuel investment by crypto insiders and the latter would bolster the attractiveness of decentralized monetary systems to the masses.PolitiFi tokens have yet again emerged as one of the preeminent avenues to gamble on the outcome of the upcoming election and express support for the candidates.Given the Donald’s strong alignment with the crypto industry, the majority of degens were aping Trump-associated memecoins, sending the derpy TREMP memecoin on Solana skyrocketing over 200% and the more vulnerable Ethereum-native TRUMP surging 80% at their peaks.While the impact was substantially more muted for the premier Joe Biden memecoin, BODEN, the token also experienced a minor pump, gaining as much as 40% after Trump responded to a fan’s question about the coin at his gala.Unfortunately for BODEN apes, and potentially PolitiFi token holders at large, Trump indicated in his response that the token was overvalued.

Binance Whistleblower Alleges Profit Before User Protection - DailyCoin


        
New allegations emerge over Binance prioritizing profit over users.



A high-rolling VIP client is at the center of the storm.



The whistleblower claimed Binance management turned a blind eye to fraud.   
Following last year’s bombshell charges and fines from US authorities over money laundering and sanctions violations, Binance was keen to move on and put the past behind them. While many observers thought Binance was the victim of an overzealous regulators’ crackdown, emerging allegations from a former senior employee at the company are punching holes in that narrative.Binance Under FireEmerging allegations published by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) alleged that systemic fraud took place at Binance, based on the testimony of a former senior employee in the exchange’s market surveillance unit. The whistleblower, who was subsequently fired, claimed management turned a blind eye to manipulation and fraud by VIP clients.
DWF Labs, a crypto market maker and investment firm headed by Russian national Andrei Grachev, is the client at the center of the allegations. At Binance, traders with over $4 billion in monthly volume qualify for VIP status, unlocking discounted fees and access to dedicated account managers.According to the fired investigator, DWF Labs allegedly used the Binance platform to artificially inflate trading volumes, manipulate token prices, and generate hundreds of millions in illegitimate profits through wash trading.Market ManipulationThe alleged manipulative practices occurred with at least seven crypto tokens traded on Binance, including Yield Guild Games (YGG). In February 2023, DWF Labs invested $13.8 million in YGG to acquire around 35% of its token treasury. 
Summer 2023 saw a 510% jump in YGG’s price over the week of August 7, 2023. The token subsequently crashed over 80% by August 17, 2023, fueling rumors of manipulation.YGGUSDT daily chart per Trading ViewBinance’s internal investigators uncovered evidence that DWF Labs had engaged in fraudulent trading related to YGG and other tokens, violating the exchange’s terms of service. The investigative team submitted a report recommending that DWF Labs be de-platformed due to their findings.However, the report allegedly faced fierce pushback from Binance’s department, which handled VIP accounts. This led to a separate internal probe into the investigators who raised red flags about the trading firm’s conduct in the first place.Management Turns Blind EyeThe second internal probe stated that there was insufficient evidence that DWF Labs had intentionally engaged in market manipulation and that identified instances of washing trading could be coincidental, which alone did not constitute fraudulent actions.The inquiry also raised concerns that the head investigator had collaborated too closely with a competing trading firm that originally flagged DWF to Binance. Ultimately, Binance’s leadership team rejected the recommendation to remove DWF Labs from the platform. Instead, the exchange fired the lead investigator who oversaw the DWF case. Several other investigators were subsequently let go, while others quit voluntarily.Binance denied participating in manipulative trading and said it continuously improves its compliance operations.Is Binance Dodgy?Although the allegations relate to events before the Department of Justice’s charges became public late last year, the whistleblower’s claims still lighten the narrative that Binance was a victim of regulatory hostility. Throughout Binance’s legal battle with US authorities, former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) had insisted the exchange operated above board. In his resignation tweet, CZ defiantly declared that his plea deal meant US authorities “do not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, and do not allege that Binance engaged in any market manipulation.”On the Flipside
Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement and to leave the US market following DoJ charges.



Current CEO Richard Teng stated that Binance‘s core values of protecting users and being a platform people love to use remain unchanged upon taking over from CZ.
Why This MattersThis case exposed crypto exchanges’ inherent conflicts between enforcing fair trading rules and maintaining lucrative relationships with high-volume traders. Crypto cryptics, such as SEC chair Gensler, will no doubt relish the whistleblower’s claims.Richard Teng calls for Nigerian authorities to release imprisoned Binance exec.Binance CEO Urges Nigeria to Release Tigran GambaryanPresidential hopeful Donald Trump sides with the US crypto industry.Trump Backs US Crypto Industry, Says “I’m Good With It”

Lucky Whale Spent $6,500 to Buy This Altcoin and Turned It Into $5.6 Million with 870x Profit - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to the incident noticed by the analysts of the cryptocurrency analysis company Lookonchain, a crypto wallet managed to turn an extremely low capital into a fortune with great luck.
Wallet address waxl.eth purchased $6,500 worth of TRUMP tokens and sold them for $5.6 million for an 870x profit.


According to Onchain data, the waxl.eth wallet purchased the 2.08 million TRUMP tokens by paying $6,500 with two different wallets. Then he sold TRUMP, worth $1.24 million, for $902,000. However, the lucky whale still has 832 thousand TRUMP in his wallet, and their value is around 4.7 million dollars at the time of writing.

To make the incident even more interesting, the same wallet in question managed to reach high amounts in the altcoin named BasedAI (BASEDAI) almost simultaneously, using a very small principal amount. According to the data, the wallet purchased 249 thousand BasedAI by spending 4 thousand dollars. Then he sold 19,500 of them for 137 thousand dollars. Currently, the whale has 238 thousand BASEDAIs and their value is around 1.1 million dollars.





However, it should not be forgotten that memecoins, especially those used by the whale, are extremely risky assets and many more users lose money in these coins than winning users.

Meme Coin Devs Are Doing Wild Things on Livestreams to Pump Tokens - Decrypt

Livestreaming your supposed mom shaking her breasts on camera to pump your meme coin is peak crypto degeneracy. But this sexually suggestive token, called LIVEMOM, is only the beginning of an increasingly weird—and rapidly expanding—wormhole of meme coin livestreams.Kidnapping, even more half-naked women, and fraudulent amputees are all part of this emerging livestream meta that has taken underground Solana degen traders by storm.At the same time that LiveMom was shaking her 36DDs next to her purported son, another livestream was underway. Aspiring political candidate Leland King Fawcette was attempting to create a meme coin called IMLIVEKICK, but the token fell from a $110,000 market cap to $10,000 in an hour—while the streamer raged in hilarious fashion, viewers say.It’s now effectively worthless. Since then, Fawcette has streamed five more times with countless more meme coins going to zero. The streamer claims that sniper bots are “rugging” his tokens, and so he’s now devised a plan to “rug” the sniper bots in return. But some people in his Discord believe that it’s been the streamer rugging this whole time.And so it goes amid this increasingly gonzo trend that's seeing some developers get creative as they attempt to stand out in a crowded meme coin market.Where did this come from?Every livestream meme coin that Decrypt has seen was launched using Pump.fun. This protocol allows anyone to create a Solana meme coin in minutes for only 0.02 SOL ($3). As a result of the barrier for entry being lower than ever, Solana has seen an explosion of new tokens.Notable meme coins like Michi, Shark Cat, and Mewing Coin were all launched using Pump.fun, along with countless thousands of others. In fact, the daily record for new Solana-based tokens minted was just broken on Tuesday, with 16,534 new tokens flooding the network in a single day. And Pump.fun is now one of the most profitable protocols across all of crypto.Pump.fun is even how the “first” live stream token was created, according to its devs. Richard Podgurski, co-founder of LiveTwitch, said he had an “extremely unhealthy obsession” with Pump.fun, as he watched random memes surge to million-dollar market caps. “Pump.fun, combined with freedom of speech and internet memes, has birthed 4Chan 2.0 on degenerate steroids,” Podgurski told Decrypt via email. “And I love every damn inch of it… the bad, the funny, the ugly. It's nothing short of the greatest corner of the internet at the moment.”Soon, he wanted in on the action and created LiveTwitch on March 26 with his partner Savanna—before setting off on a 52-hour livestream. The goal was to reinvent the social media revenue model, using the token as a subscriber model.While LiveMom promised to twerk if her coin hit a $750,000 market cap, the LiveTwitch couple have promised they’d get married if they hit $20 million. LiveTwitch’s more wholesome approach to a livestream token, however, didn’t appear to garner the same level of attention that LiveMom did.Degeneracy prevailsIn the days that followed LiveMom mania, the livestreaming meta spread—and the level of degeneracy only grew from there.A copycat project, LIVESIS, spawned with the goal of hitting a market cap of $100,000 for the streamer’s sister to take her bra off. Once the goal was reached, the purported sister revealed her chest—though many viewers believe it was a man—before the token plummeted to pretty much zero, allegedly due to a rug pull.We also saw a man called Roman get “kidnapped” by devs promising to release him at a $100,000 market cap. Amid a livestream showing Roman being poked with a stick while wearing a backpack over his head, the token quickly imploded.Only a couple days later, a man claimed that he had no hands and thus couldn’t possibly conduct a rug pull and drain all of the liquidity from the coin. Well, he lied. After only three minutes of livestreaming with a sign tucked under his chin, the man revealed his hidden arms, sprinted to his computer, and immediately sold his $1,000 worth of HANDS.This livestreaming meta shines a light on the troubling truth that, as humans, we’re attracted to the weird, insane, and downright wrong. Just like watching the latest serial killer documentary on Netflix or slowing down as you drive past a car crash, it’s hard to look away from the shock value of the ever-evolving nonsense that’s steadily popping up on Pump.fun and elsewhere in crypto.Normally, being rug-pulled is a thing of nightmares for investors. But the livestreaming meta is reinventing why investors are looking for low market cap gems.Did investors in LIVESIS believe it was going to be the next blue chip meme coin? Or did they just want to see the streamer strip and hope to avoid the dump in the process? Did Roman investors care about their own bag, or the bag over Roman’s head?With the crypto markets broadly cooling off in recent weeks, some crypto devs apparently can’t help but try shocking new tactics to gin up interest in their meme coins. And some investors, it seems, can’t help but look—and buy in, too.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Hit Decade Low Amid Growing Institutional Interest



                    

Bitcoin exchange inflows have plummeted to levels last seen nearly a decade ago, according to recent data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant.



Daily BTC inflows have been decreasing significantly since the cryptocurrency’s peak price of $73,800.




As of April and May 2024, major cryptocurrency exchanges are recording some of the lowest daily inflows in ten years. 



On April 20, only 8,400 BTC entered exchanges, a number reminiscent of times when Bitcoin was priced under $1,000 per coin.



CryptoQuant monitors a substantial number of spot and derivative exchanges to gather these insights. 




This trend signifies a major shift in investor behavior, indicating a newfound reluctance to position Bitcoin for quick sales on exchanges.



Institutional interest in Bitcoin has been growing, suggesting the dawn of a new era in cryptocurrency investment. 



Despite the price’s recent volatility, including a drop to $56,500 last week, the desire to increase Bitcoin holdings remains strong, according to reports from Cointelegraph.

Market analysts continue to keep a close eye on Bitcoin whales—investors who hold large amounts of BTC. 



CryptoQuant contributor Mignolet noted that whales, particularly those holding between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, have been largely inactive in terms of selling during the current market uptrend. 



“Whales may not be willing to sell yet as the cycle has not ended,” Mignolet explained, highlighting a potential increase in over-the-counter (OTC) market activities that could absorb significant sell volumes without requiring deposits into exchanges.



Checkmate, a pseudonymous lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode, expressed skepticism about the practice of “whale watching.” 



He suggested that many of the large wallets being tracked might be linked to entities like ETFs rather than individual high-stake investors. 



“There will be some actual whales yes…but as both buyers and sellers. Not once have I seen true alpha extracted from whale watching,” he stated on social media platform X.

Pump.Fun Surpasses Uniswap in Weekly Revenue - The Defiant

The memecoin launchpad raked in $3.3 million over the past seven days, putting it in second place behind Ethereum.Pump.Fun, a memecoin launchpad platform, has become the second-largest revenue-generating platform in DeFi over the last week, surpassed only by the Ethereum network.Top Projects By Weekly RevenueThe platform allows users to launch a token on Solana or Blast in minutes with no coding experience. During a Pump.Fun token’s initial launch phase, the token will trade along a bonding curve within the platform. Upon reaching a particular market capitalization, the bonding curve liquidity is transferred to Raydium, where the token commences trading on the open market.Pump.Fun Daily FeesDespite major memecoins such as $WIF and $PEPE trading lower over the past month, Pump.Fun activity has continued to trend higher. Over 450,000 unique tokens have been launched on the platform since March 1, with some tokens, such as $MICHI and $SC, eclipsing the $100m market cap level after launching at a market cap of $5,000.Pump.Fun’s ascent to one of the top earners in DeFi is indicative of the memecoin mania that has defined 2024.Its bonding curve mechanism acts as “un-ruggable liquidity” and allows users to speculate on microcap tokens without the worry of a malicious developer removing the liquidity on a traditional token launch. This significantly improves the user experience of high-risk, high-reward microcap trading.

Digital Currency Group revenue jumps 51% in 1Q24 despite GBTC outflows

Digital Currency Group (DCG) saw a surge in revenue in the first quarter of 2024, driven by the recovery of crypto markets. The crypto conglomerate’s revenue jumped 51% year-over-year to $229 million, the company reportedly wrote in a letter to shareholders.Grayscale’s revenue held steady during the quarter despite $17.4 billion in outflows from its Bitcoin fund since it was converted to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January. The asset manager generated $156 million in revenue thanks to rising asset prices, offsetting losses in assets under management.Grayscale’s outflows have arisen from the growing competition between Bitcoin ETF issuers offering lower management fees. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) charges 1.5% in management fees, while other funds, such as the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), charge 0.2%. “While Grayscale expected outflows alongside increased competition under the ETF wrapper, Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC nevertheless exceeded our expectations,” Digital Currency Group said in the letter. Data from YCharts shows GBTC managed assets totaling over $18.1 billion as of May 9.GBTC Bitcoin holdings. Source: CryptoQuantOther businesses under DCG’s umbrella also posted revenue growth during the quarter. Crypto mining pool Foundry’s revenue jumped 35% to $51 million, boosted by staking services and equipment sales. Investing platform Luno saw its revenue soar by 46% to $16 million thanks to higher trading volumes. The conglomerate has been facing regulatory challenges in the United States. The New York Attorney General’s Office (NYAG) has recently expanded a fraud lawsuit against DCG, its CEO Barry Silbert, and Genesis Global Capital’s former CEO Soichiro Moro, to seek $3 billion in restitution. The NYAG accuses the companies of defrauding over 230,000 investors out of $1 billion through the Gemini Earn program. According to the initial complaint, the lawsuit seeks to ban Gemini, Genesis, and DCG from operating in New York, along with restitution for investment losses.Magazine: 1 in 6 new Base meme coins are scams, 91% have vulnerabilities

Ripple, XRPL Labs join Algorand Foundation as founding members of Decentralized Recovery Alliance - Crypto Briefing




Ripple and XRPL Labs have become founding members of the Decentralized Recovery (DeRec) Alliance, joining forces with Algorand Foundation and Swirlds Labs. As founding members, they will hold two-year seats on the Technical Oversight Committee, contributing to governance and policy development, said DeRec in today’s blog announcement.The HBAR Foundation, the Hashgraph Association, Acoer, BankSocial, Blade Labs, The Building Blocks, Casper Association, Constellation Network, and Revive Labs, have become DeRec’s Alliance Members. They will help create a new interoperability recovery standard to facilitate the recovery and adoption of digital assets, DeRec stated.Initially launched by Hedera and Algorand members, the DeRec Alliance’s mission is to simplify digital asset recovery, making it as user-friendly as Web2 experiences.Currently recovering crypto can be complicated. The Alliance wants to make it as simple as recovering an online account. This will be especially helpful for new users who might be discouraged by the complexity of Web3.The DeRec Alliance is developing an open-source protocol designed to help users recover lost digital assets such as secret keys, passwords, and seed phrases. By facilitating the recovery of secret keys, passwords, and seed phrases in a completely decentralized manner, the protocol ensures that personal data remains confidential and secure.The Alliance hopes that all blockchain companies will adopt this standard, making recovery easier across the entire crypto ecosystem.“The DeRec Alliance is a group of individuals and organizations committed to making the process of securing and recovering digital assets, accounts, passwords, and other secrets as simple as existing Web2 experiences,” said Dr. Leemon Baird, Hedera co-founder.Markus Infanger of RippleX expressed Ripple’s commitment to the Alliance’s goals. He also emphasized the importance of user-friendly private key management.“The DeRec Alliance addresses one of the biggest challenges facing mainstream crypto adoption—secure and user-friendly management of private keys,” Infanger stated. “Together, we can revolutionize how users manage their private keys, representing a major step forward for user security and adoption – not just for XRP Ledger users, but for everyone in crypto.”As noted, Alliance Members, including Acoer and BankSocial, are adopting DeRec standards and practices to make decentralized recovery accessible. They contribute to policy and oversee the development of DeRec-based solutions, with some already integrating the protocol into their systems.The DeRec Alliance represents a collective effort to overcome the challenges of digital asset self-custody and recovery, aiming to bring peace of mind to users and promote mainstream adoption of digital assets.“Improving the user experience and interoperability is required for mass adoption of digital assets and Web3 technologies more broadly. The innovative and democratized approach of DeRec is a huge step forward and we are excited to be a part of this evolution,” said Shayne Higdon, Co-Founder and CEO, The HBAR Foundation.“We are excited to join this alliance, recognizing the opportunity for greater levels of interoperability across chains and significantly improved user experience that will enable mainstream adoption of token holding,” said Ralf Kubli, Senior Director, Casper Association.

Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) Will Explode 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token. 




ANDTATE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Andrew Tate Coin.



Currently, Andrew Tate Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. 



To buy ANDTATE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Andrew Tate Coin by entering its contract address – Cp7qyqdzXAqF7fqKXzS8LwTE7JQvh2V3vYGnDdx6j4ii – in the receiving field.




ANDTATE currently has a market cap of just under $20,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. 



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Solana Drops on FTX Liquidation, Open Interest Drops - DailyCoin


        
Solana’s price experiences a downturn following FTX announcement.



Open interest drops on heightened uncertainty. 



Technical indicators still show bullish signals. 
Solana, known for high speed and low fees, has recently shown resilience amid the ongoing FTX bankruptcy. Despite large sales of FTX’s Solana holdings to major institutions, the token has so far been shielded by significant lockups. However, Solana’s price recently dipped due to renewed concerns over FTX liquidation. This was followed by a significant drop in open interest, as traders reassess their positions. Solana Drops on Renewed Concerns Over FTXOn Thursday, May 9, Solana (SOL) dropped 3.43% to $143.08, triggered by FTX’s plan to sell its assets to repay creditors. FTX’s announcement read that, with the sale of all its assets, it would have enough funds to repay its creditors. 
Consequently, the concerns over liquidation have caused a decrease in derivatives trading. Solana’s derivatives trading volume decreased by 6.52% to $5.53 billion, suggesting that traders are holding back from speculative bets. This hesitation is further highlighted by a 5.53% drop in open interest, down to $1.80 billion, with traders reducing their exposure. In the last 24 hours, Solana witnessed $7.61 million in total liquidations, with long positions accounting for $4.7 million and short positions for $2.91 million. However, this could change if Solana experiences a rebound; data suggests this may be likely. Long-short ratios reveal traders’ optimism about Solana’s potential rebound. For instance, the long-short ratio on Binance is 2.3557, meaning that more accounts are betting on a SOL rebound. On OKX, the ratio is 1.75, showing a similar optimistic sentiment. Technical analysis also shows bullish signals.Solana Technicals Lean BullishSolana’s technical indicators reveal a predominantly bullish sentiment. For one, both the 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 144.29 and the Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 142.20 signal buy. However, longer-term moving averages, including the 30-day EMA and SMA, indicate potential resistance at higher levels. 
Oscillators are generally neutral, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 47.89, which indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Moreover, the Stochastic %K at 64.59 and the MACD Level at -3.00 both suggest neutral to slight bullish momentum. The indicators show a generally positive sentiment towards SOL/USD in the short term while indicating a more neutral outlook in the medium term. On The Flipside
Technical indicators reflect current market sentiment rather than a prediction of future movements. 



Solana has been battling with ongoing congestion issues, largely caused by an increase in DEX volumes. 
Why This MattersUnderstanding Solana’s technicals provides insight into the market’s reactions to SOL’s FTX sales.

Ether Prices Drop Amid SEC Uncertainty and Technical Corrections, Despite Bullish Patterns



                    

Today’s market sees a downturn in the value of Ethereum‘s Ether token, largely influenced by negative developments within the cryptocurrency sphere. 



As of May 7, the price of Ether fell to $3,022, marking a decline of around 6.20% from its previous day’s peak. 




This downward trend is not isolated to Ether; Bitcoin also experienced a similar fall of approximately 4% during the same period.



A significant factor contributing to this decline is the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) handling of a proposed Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). 



The SEC has postponed its decision regarding the ETF application by Invesco and Galaxy Digital to July 2024. 




The delay is due to the SEC’s need for more public comments and to consider further regulatory aspects before allowing trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange.



This comes at a time when the SEC is scrutinizing Ethereum more closely, especially after its shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.



SEC Chairman Gary Gensler hinted that staking mechanisms in cryptocurrencies could meet the criteria set by the Howey test to classify as securities.



The postponement dampens potential price boosts that might have resulted from increased institutional investment through the ETF. 




Another blow to the cryptocurrency market came with the SEC issuing a Wells notice to Robinhood on May 6, regarding potential securities violations in its cryptocurrency operations. 



READ MORE: Sui Network Addresses Token Supply Concerns, Asserts Transparency and Third-Party Oversight



This notice could signal upcoming enforcement actions, fostering a climate of regulatory uncertainty that may affect Ether and other digital currencies adversely.



Ether’s current price movement also aligns with a technical correction phase, entering what is known as the “sell-off zone.” 



This area includes both a descending trendline resistance and Ether’s 50-day exponential moving average, which have historically capped its price rises.



Despite these challenges, technical analysis suggests that Ether’s market outlook could still be bullish. 



It’s recognized within a falling wedge pattern—a setup that often precedes upward price movements once the upper trendline is breached. 



If Ether breaks above this boundary, it might ascend to between $3,640 and $4,115 during May.



However, if the price breaks below the pattern’s lower trendline, it could invalidate the bullish scenario, potentially dropping to around $2,780, aligning with its 200-day exponential moving average and the 0.5% Fibonacci retracement line.

Record-breaking user engagement on Polkadot despite price slump

Polkadot blockchain activity has surged to record levels, with active addresses hitting all-time highs for two consecutive months.Data from DotLake indicates the network boasted around 650,000 active addresses on-chain as of the end of April. The growth continues the uptrend that saw the number of active blockchain addresses surpass its previous high of 605,000 in March.Polkadot Active Addresses. (Source: DotLake)Polkadot said this milestone represents a significant uptick in activity, marking a new all-time high for monthly active accounts since the launch of parachains in 2022.The rising active addresses can be primarily attributed to Moonbeam. During the reporting period, the parachain accounted for over 60% of these addresses, totaling 397,515, while Polkadot had only 136,612 addresses.Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot that is attracting considerable attention from the community. According to data from Polkadot Insider, the network had the highest user acquisition among Polkadot’s parachains in April.Meanwhile, Polkadot’s number of unique addresses with non-zero balances decreased slightly, dropping from 6.96 million in March to 6.8 million at the end of April.

Will May Make Or Break Bitcoin? Crucial Events To Watch This Month


								May brings a series of pivotal events that could significantly influence the trajectory of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.
These events, ranging from regulatory decisions to economic indicators, appear capable of profoundly swaying market dynamics.

Regulatory And Economic Indicators On The Horizon
This month is marked by crucial dates, starting with a significant meeting involving Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. His upcoming press conference today is particularly noteworthy, following recent economic data showing a dip in consumer confidence amidst persistent wage pressures.
In his previous addresses, Powell has highlighted ongoing challenges in curbing inflation and the “robustness” of the job market, which continue to influence monetary policy expectations.
Moreover, on May 15, the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April is eagerly anticipated. This event is closely followed by the announcement of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision on approving Spot Ethereum ETFs.

The outcomes of these events could either dampen or ignite investor enthusiasm, with significant repercussions for market liquidity and volatility.
Particularly, the SEC’s response to VanEck’s Ethereum spot ETF application on May 23 and a Bitcoin spot option ETF application on May 29 are seen as potential catalysts for market movement.
Market Impact And Analyst Insights On Bitcoin
The anticipation of higher interest rates continuing longer than previously expected is already impacting the cryptocurrency markets.
Bitcoin, for example, has witnessed a sharp decline, plunging by over 6% in just 24 hours, marking one of its lowest points in recent months at $56,757. This downturn has led to considerable market liquidation, with Coinglass reporting over $394.82 million in liquidations, affecting 106,104 traders within the same period.

With his deep understanding of market patterns, renowned financial analyst Peter Brandt suggests that Bitcoin might face further declines before any potential recovery.
According to Brandt, Bitcoin could dip into the $40,000 region as part of its market correction phase before possibly embarking on a new bullish run.

Brandt also pointed out that despite various market stimulants such as halving events and spot ETF launches in past years, Bitcoin has struggled to surpass its peak prices from three years ago.

Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Price Will Drop To $2,500, Here’s Why


																The Ethereum price has been closing mirroring the performance of Bitcoin recently and since the Bitcoin price has been on a downtrend, the ETH price has followed. However, Ethereum on its own seems to possess more bearish fundamentals compared to Bitcoin, leading crypto analysts to believe that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap will fall further from here.
Ethereum Poised To Crash Further
A crypto analyst known as Shin Forex took to the TradingView website to share an interesting analysis of the Ethereum price. The analysis, which focused on the ETH/BTC chart, unveiled some concerning developments in the ETH price.

The analyst explained that during this time, the liquidity in Ethereum has been dwindling. Instead of flowing toward altcoins like ETH, it is instead flowing toward Bitcoin. This suggests growing disinterest in Ethereum from investors and as liquidity flows to Bitcoin, Ethereum has nothing propping it up at this time.
Furthermore, the crypto analyst explains that the ETH/BTC pair has now broken below its support of 0.05. Now, this drop below its support level is important given what has happened each time that it broke. Shin Forex points back to the last two market cycles, one in 2016 and one in 2019, of the ETH/BTC breaking below its support.
Both times that this has happened, a crash in the price has followed, before it can rally again. The crypto analyst does not expect this time to be any different and believes that ETH/BTC will fall below 0.04. If this happens, it will send Ethereum spiraling and the analyst has set a price target of around $2,500 for this.
Can ETH Price Survive The Crash?
In the short term, the Ethereum price doesn’t look to good, especially as the altcoin is currently trending downward inside its current channel, according to the crypto analyst. However, zooming out to the larger timeframe can help give an inkling of how the ETH price could perform after the crash.
Looking at Shin Forex’s chart of the last two times that a formation like this occurred, it has also set a precedent for money to flow back into Ethereum. In November 2016, the price had crashed but in a few months, there was a massive recovery as ETH/BTC rose to a new all-time high.

Source: TradingView.com
A similar thing happened the next time in 2019, with the crash coming ahead of a market rally, albeit a bit slower at this time. So, if this trend holds, then the ETH crash is inevitable. However, a recovery is expected that will likely kickstart the beginning of another massive rally.

For now, bears continue to dominate the Ethereum market and have successfully dragged the price down below $3,000. It is trading at. $2,975 at the time of this writing, with a small 0.36% decline in the last day, according to Coinmarketcap.

Toncoin Spikes on Notcoin Rollout as Bitcoin, Ethereum Trade Flat - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsToncoin, the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON), is one of the biggest gainers atop the crypto markets Thursday amid launch news about one of the network’s most anticipated tokens. And it comes as the two largest overall coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have barely moved over the last day.Over the past 24 hours, TON is up nearly 13% to a current price of $6.46, per data from CoinGecko. That makes it the second-largest coin in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap behind Akash Network (AKT), an AI-centric cloud computing project that’s seen a 16% jump on the day.Much of the gains came after The Open Network project Notcoin, a viral Telegram-based game, announced that its anticipated token NOT will be launched on May 16. The project attracted 35 million players ahead of April 1, when the “mining phase” ended, and the launch has been on the horizon for weeks amid a couple of previously missed listing targets.One of the biggest TON price increases so far on Thursday came shortly after crypto exchange Binance announced that it would offer billions of NOT tokens as rewards to its customers via pre-listing staking rewards.Along with a similar campaign from rival exchange OKX, more than 4 billion NOT tokens will be distributed via such rewards initiatives. OKX users, in particular, will need to stake TON tokens to earn rewards, which could drive an increase in Toncoin purchases in the days ahead.In the last day, perpetual-centric decentralized exchange (DEX) dYdX also announced support for Toncoin, while Hong Kong’s HashKey exchange listed TON on Thursday. With today’s price action added in, Toncoin is now up 24% over the last week.There have been few big gainers among the top 100 cryptocurrencies over the past day, however, and as noted, Bitcoin and Ethereum are doing little.Bitcoin’s price is up 1% on the day to $62,420 as of this writing, marking a 5% total gain over the past seven days, while Ethereum has nudged up by about 2% today to $3,020—but over the past week, it hasn’t even gained by 1%.DisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) to Surge 8,000% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and DogeCoin



                    

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Zombie Coin presents a similar opportunity.



Zombie Coin has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,000% in the coming two days, and Zombie Coin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Zombie Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Zombie Coin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Zombie Coin by entering its contract address – FbkoYsCAPbcyJkSoqXTxDKKoGQrYoqgtdLf9GBEqy2vr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ZOMCOIN.

Decentralizing Ethereum with Heroglyphs | Bankless


Whether we want to admit it or not, centralization remains a significant concern and issue for our industry, facing most major blockchains, even Ethereum.To combat this, protocols like Rocket Pool and Etherfi have worked to lower the bar for people to join the network as validators. A new protocol, Heroglyphs, approaches this problem differently, turning to speculation to make the solo staker’s role more enticing. Developed by OGs like 0xMaki, the anon co-founder of Sushiswap, this new system seeks to harness the often overlooked potential of Ethereum’s Graffiti—a small segment of arbitrary data in block headers—to empower a more distributed and robust network of complete validators by providing them the ability to earn, deploy, and lease (yes, lease) tokens. via HeroglyphsEthereum’s Centralization IssueWhile Ethereum's shift to Proof of Stake (PoS) brought many improvements, like energy efficiency, it also ushered in a new era of concerns around centralization. Namely, the consolidation of validation power in the hands of a few large operators poses significant risks, including greater vulnerability to regulatory pressures (as we’ve seen with block builders and relays) and potential network failures. via Ethereum Censorship DashboardThis centralization dilutes the foundational decentralized ethos of blockchains, and needs to be guarded against. Here, then, cue in Heroglyphs.How Heroglyphs Attempts to Solve ThisHeroglyphs aims to tackle validator centralization through a feature called Graffiti, which uses a small piece of arbitrary data that validators can include in the blocks they propose. via Heroglyphs WhitepaperThrough Graffiti, Heroglyphs introduces three key operations: encoding, translating, and leasing, each designed to maximize the potential of this small piece of data within its transactions. Let’s break these pillars down:Encoding involves embedding critical operational data into the Ethereum block's Graffiti like, encoding commands for the creation, emission, transfer, and transformation of assets such as NFTs, memecoins, and beyond. By inserting this data into the Graffiti, the block space becomes a secure and immutable medium for developing tokens and storing detailed transactional instructions.Translating follows the encoding, acting as the operational executor within Ethereum. Whether minting new NFTs or processing transactions for memecoins, the translator system ensures that these operations adhere to that token’s outlined parameters encoded in the Graffiti.Leasing introduces a strategic and economic layer to the use of Graffiti. In this model, validators or miners assign and pay a regular tax on a value to each Heroglyphs "ticker," i.e. token. This value determines their operational lease and sets the stage for competition. For example, other validators can outbid each other for leases if they see a ticker as undervalued and want it for themselves. Most revenue from leasing and actions such as minting or transferring tickers in the Heroglyphs network is shared among all complete validators. via HeroglyphsAll in all, this new platform is a novel and degen-centric approach to decentralizing Ethereum’s network. The grand vision? Use Graffiti to foster a new meta-system where solo stakers are actively incentivized to participate thanks to making the validator experience more lucrative, engaging, and fun. Now validators have the tools to create and manage tokens all their own, granting the role a new privilege. If the Heroglyphs mission pans out, then Ethereum will become more robust, and we’ll have a fresh case study in how speculation can be beneficial and provide real value in crypto. In the meantime, this is a protocol to watch around the memecoin and NFT frontier!

Crypto Mixers Facing the Blender as U.S. Amps up Enforcement - DailyCoin


        
United States policy makers are pushing for stronger regulations in the crypto mixer sector.



The DOJ has recently commenced enforcement actions against the sector.



The lawmakers have raised concerns over the Tether stablecoin.
Recent months have seen regulatory actions focused on the crypto mixing sector by United States authorities, marked by sanctions against service providers and increased alarm on their activities. The increasing enforcement has seen the Justice Department clamp down on two notable mixers, Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet, alleging the facilitation of illegal financial transactions.Taking the enforcement actions a step further, four lawmakers have proposed a bill to clamp down on the section.Crypto Mixers Face SanctionsDuring a House hearing on May 7, US Representative Sean Casten introduced the Blockchain Integrity Act, an upcoming regulatory framework targeting the crypto mixing sector.
Co-signed by three additional democrats, Brad Sherman, Bill Foster, and Emanuel Cleaver, the Blockchain Integrity Act will address concerns associated with mixers to mitigate their roles in facilitating illicit transactions for sanctioned individuals.By imposing a two-year ban that prohibits financial institutions, including crypto exchanges, from transacting with funds that have gone through digital asset mixers, the act will allow regulatory watchdogs such as the SEC and DoJ to investigate the illicit activities associated with the sector.According to Casten, mixers are key to allowing illicit actors to instantaneously move massive amounts of money around the globe for criminal purposes without detection”
The presumption should be that these are money laundering channels,” stated Casten, adding "Let's go through and get that cleaned up and fixed," he stated during the hearing.Congressman Sherman added that the legislation is a vital first step in banning crypto mixers in the United States, aiding the litigation of the sector’s dangers.Crypto mixers are not the only flagged sources of concern among the Democrats.According to Rep Casten, the Tether (USDT), stablecoin has been at the core of terror financing over the past years and has evolved into a killer app for criminals.Casten emphasized that USDT’s place in funding was machines for countries such as Russia, adding that it was the favored choice for the majority of the crypto assets adopted by the terrorist troop Hamas.In response to the Democrat, former SEC official John Reed Stark asserted the lack of transparency regarding Tether’s auditing, stating that it fails to declare whether its offerings are backed by real securities openly.“Tether claims to have some sort of audit, but it’s essentially a satellite snapshot of days of its events,” stated Clark.The representatives stressed the need for stringent anti-money laundering measures in stablecoin regulations and emphasized the SEC’s role in protecting investors through enforcement actions.On the FlipsideWhy This MattersThe ongoing enforcement actions against crypto mixers reflect the tightening regulatory standards against the crypto industry, which could significantly impact service providers and investors. Read more about this crypto mixer’s response to the mounting regulatory pressure:Wasabi Wallet Exits Mixing Sector as DOJ Pressure Piles onHere’s how policymakers are opposing the crypto industry, read more:“Crypto Is A Garden of Snakes:” Rep Sherman Backs SEC Action

Bugs in Gains Network fork let traders profit 900% on every trade: Report

Two different bugs in a fork of the Gains Network leveraged trading protocol could have allowed traders to profit 900% on every trade, regardless of the price of the token traded, according to an April 19 report from blockchain security firm Zellic. One of the bugs existed in a previous version of Gains but was later patched. The other was only found in a fork of the protocol. According to Zellic, its staff informed the developers of Gains forks Gambit Trade, Holdstation Exchange, and Krav Trade of the vulnerability, and these development teams have ensured their protocols do not contain such two flaws. However, other Gains forks may still be vulnerable, Zellic warned.According to its official website, Gains Network is an ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) products on Polygon and Arbitrum. The official name for its leveraged trading app is “gTrade.” It has facilitated over $25 billion in derivatives volume since its inception in May 2023, according to blockchain analytics platform DefiLlama.User interface for gTrade, the Gains Network leveraged trading app. Source: Gains NetworkZellic claimed that several popular DeFi trading apps are derived from Gains Network’s base code, including the aforementioned Gambit Trade and Holdstation, as well as many other protocols. They discovered the exploit while studying a particular fork but declined to name which one they discovered it in.According to the report, Gains Network contracts allow users to open either a market, reversal or momentum trade order. A market order buys or sells an asset immediately, regardless of price. When a user asks to open a momentum or reversal trade, the smart contract records an “order” that contains data about what price the user is willing to trade at. Once this price is reached, any user can call the executeLimitOrder function to fill the order. The user who calls the execution does not have to be the same one who placed the order. Users who call the execution get paid a small “execution fee” for performing this role. This allows users to place limit (momentum) and stop-limit (reversal) orders similar to the way they can in a centralized exchange, but without needing a centralized entity to perform the order fills.When a user places an order, they can set a take-profit price, stop-loss price or both. The intention of this design is to allow traders to automatically exit a profitable trade at the take-profit point or a losing trade at the stop-loss point. Bug in Gains fork allowed 900% profit on buy ordersIn the Gains fork it studied, Zellic discovered that when an order was opened, the stop-loss price became stored in the “currentPrice” variable used to calculate profit and loss. This meant that if a user was able to set the stop-loss above the open price, they could automatically profit from any trade. For example, consider a scenario where the price of Bitcoin (BTC) was $63,000 and the user entered $62,000 as the open price and $64,000 as the stop-loss. In this case, if the price fell to $62,000, the order would become filled. But the price would be immediately below its stop-loss, triggering an automatic exit.In addition, the stop-loss set by the user would be recorded as the current price. This meant that the user would profit $2,000, even though the correct profit should have been approximately $0. This could have allowed an attacker to profit from every trade and eventually drain the protocol of all of its funds.To prevent this exploit, the protocol contained a check that threw a “wrong_sl” error if the user attempted to set their stop-loss above their open price on a buy order.Gains Network fork check to prevent wrong take-profit or stop-loss. Source: ZellicHowever, the investigators discovered that this check could be bypassed in certain circumstances. When a user first opened an order, they set the price at which they wanted to open the trade, which was then recorded in the variable “openPrice.” It was at this point that the check was performed. However, the function used to execute an order changed this variable to the value of “a.Price,” which was the current price plus the price impact from the order being opened. This meant that if the user entered an extremely high open price, an executor could bypass the check by simply executing the order. This also allowed the executor to fill the order at an open price below what it was originally set to. As an example, Zellic considered the idea of an attacker who places an order to buy a token at $100000e10 ($1 quadrillion) and sets a stop-loss at $1 less than this or $999.999999999999 trillion. Once the order is placed, the attacker then executes their own order, causing openPrice to change from $100000e10 to whatever the current price is after the trade’s price impact is taken into account. The trade then executes and becomes open. As long as the resulting opening price is below the stop-loss that was originally set, it can now be closed by executing the stop-loss. When the attacker executes their own stop-loss, they profits from the difference between the closing price and the price of the stop-loss.The trade would have resulted in a 900% profit for the attacker, Zellic claimed.Gains fork exploit example. Source: ZellicThis flaw was not present in Gains Network at the time the Zellic team discovered it. It only existed in the forked version it was investigating. However, in the process of studying this issue, it ran across a second flaw that was present in an earlier version of Gains itself.Second bug allowed 900% profit on sell ordersThe second bug allowed traders to profit 900% on sell orders regardless of price action.When a trade was closed in the Gains fork, it converted the user’s stop-loss or take-profit point into a variable called “int,” which it then used to calculate profit in percentage terms. But if a user entered a stop-loss or take-profit value that was exactly 2^256-1, the resulting calculations would have caused “int” to become negative. This was because 2^256-1 is the max value for positive numbers in Ethereum, causing any value above it to “overflow” or start over at zero and because the calculation added the open price to its total. In the Solidity programming language, 2^256-1 is also known as “type(uint256).max.” According to Zellic, as long as an attacker used leverage of greater than 9x, they could profit 900% from this exploit:“Let’s consider a sell order, with currentPrice as type(uint256).max. The resultant value of diff would be openPrice + 1 (int(type(uint256).max) = -1 ), and hence the profit percent would be nearly equal to 100 * leverage. Therefore, if the leverage is greater than 9, the function will return the profit as 900%.”There was a check in the contract that attempted to prevent 2^256-1 from being entered as a take-profit. However, this check was only performed at the moment the order was first opened. If the user changed their take-profit point after the order was opened, they could bypass the check and enter 2^256-1 as the take-profit, allowing them to gain an automatic 900% profit each time they traded.This second flaw did exist in a previous version of Gains but was subsequently patched. The current version does not contain this flaw, as it performs the check when the take-profit and stop-loss are updated as well as when they are first set.Zellic reportedly informed all of the above forks about these two security flaws and contacted the Crypto Security Alliance in an attempt to find other protocols that may be affected by them. However, it warned that some Gains forks may still contain these bugs, putting users’ funds at risk of being drained.Cointelegraph contacted Gains Network, Gambit Trade, Holdstation Exchange, and Krav Trade for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.Gains Network claims that it provides the “real spot price” of listed assets, as opposed to what it sees as less accurate prices based on perpetual contracts. It also claims to offer superior forex trading compared to competitors.Related: Libra-related Sui blockchain fixes critical bug that put ‘billions’ at risk

Playing Fantasy on Blast | Bankless


What do you get when you cross Crypto Twitter (CT) with NFTs, fantasy sports, and Blast farming season?Fantasy.top.Fantasy is a social trading card game (TCG) on the Blast L2 centered around collecting, trading, and competing with digital cards representing the most popular CT influencers. It’s become a sensation fast, too, as the game has already racked up nearly 30k users and +9,000 ETH worth of trading volume since its May 1st, 2024 launch. via hildobbyThe big idea? Join tournaments with 5-card decks, with Twitter engagement metrics determining the final winner. Banger posts from “Hero” accounts on Twitter translate to more points for holders of that influencer on Fantasy. via BREADCards can be purchased in VRGDA auctions, which rise and fall with demand, or on Fantasy’s native secondary marketplace, where players can list and buy Heroes to manage and improve their decks. via FantasyHeroes cards come in four different rarities—Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary—with each tier granting 1x, 1.5x, 2x, and 2.5x score multipliers respectively. Additionally, every Hero has a unique score and rank based on their engagement over the past week, and you can burn 5 of a kind if you want to increase a card’s tier for better scores. via BREADWith at least 5 cards in hand, you’ll be ready to enter tournaments, with the first two already having distributed over $4M worth of prize money to Heroes and players. Tournaments are conducted across 5 possible leagues, and the first batch of players just progressed to the Silver League, paving the way for them to earn higher rewards. This brings us ‘round to the question of why the game has taken off so fast, to which I think there are a handful of reasons:Farming for Blast Points and Blast GOLD is in full swing, so people are hungry for trying new Blast appsCT degens love gaming and gambling, and this is a gamified avenue to gamble on each other, which has created a layer of social intrigueHeroes receive game revenue payouts in ETH, Blast GOLD, and FAN points, offering a novel monetization avenue for something they would already be doing anyways, i.e. posting on TwitterMore than a few early players have already made considerable gains, both via flipping cards and tournament rewards, and players can also use their Heroes NFTs to enter win Blast Jackpot prizesTaken altogether, these factors suggest Fantasy has plenty of room to run for the foreseeable future as more people flock to the buzz and possibilities here. That said, going forward it’ll be key for the platform to lock down its anti-botting strategy to keep tournaments fair and to continue rolling out new advances to polish up the player experience. If it can achieve these pillars, Fantasy’s near-term prospects will continue looking good. If you’re keen to try the game, sign up with your Twitter account on fantasy.top to receive an embedded Privy wallet that you can deposit into (or export into MetaMask, etc., for entering your cards for Blast Jackpots). To move ETH in, I recommend Relay by Reservoir for quick transfers to Blast.All in all, Fantasy certainly won’t be for everyone, but if you’re looking to dive into the Blast NFT scene and potentially reap rewards, it's a top contender to check out right now. My suggestion? Analyze available Heroes, buy cheap floor cards, and try steadily grinding up to better scores!

EU securities watchdog to review crypto eligibility for UCITS investments

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has initiated a review of the rules governing crypto asset investments by UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) as part of a broader examination of the EU’s financial regulatory framework.The review comes in response to a request from the European Commission (EC) to ensure that UCITS rules keep pace with rapid market developments, including the burgeoning crypto sector.Reevaluating asset inclusionSince the implementation of the UCITS Eligible Assets Directive in 2007, the landscape of financial instruments has expanded significantly, necessitating a reevaluation of what assets should be accessible for UCITS funds.These funds are known for their high level of investor protection and are a popular choice among retail and institutional investors across Europe and globally.The current regulatory framework defines the criteria for assets that UCITS can invest in, with the aim of ensuring liquidity and risk diversification.However, the rise of digital assets like cryptocurrencies has presented new challenges and opportunities that the existing directives do not specifically address. Digital assets, known for their high volatility and emerging market trends, pose unique risks and potential rewards for investors that need to be regulated appropriately.Notably, UCITS funds typically revolve around securities, and including crypto could imply that digital assets would be regulated as such in the EU. The watchdog has yet to clarify its stance on the matter.Consultation processESMA’s call for evidence seeks input from stakeholders on how to adapt the UCITS framework to include digital assets, focusing on direct and indirect exposures. The agency is particularly interested in understanding the implications of allowing UCITS to invest in crypto — both in terms of investor protection and market stability.The consultation process, open until Aug. 7, will gather feedback from investment firms, consumer advocacy groups, and other financial entities.ESMA will consider these responses in preparing its technical advice to the Commission, which is expected to address whether and how the scope of eligible assets should be expanded to include crypto and other contemporary investment vehicles.As the financial markets continue to evolve, the outcome of this review could significantly impact the accessibility of crypto investments for European funds, potentially paving the way for greater integration of digital assets into mainstream financial portfolios.The findings will also influence how these assets are regulated, balancing innovation with investor protection in the rapidly changing landscape of global finance.

Consensys Lawsuit Over Ethereum Won’t Deter SEC, Former Regulator Says - Decrypt

A preemptive lawsuit filed in Texas federal court aims to definitively determine Ethereum’s regulatory status. But the move by blockchain software company Consensys in its home state may be far from the final legal showdown over crypto’s second-top coin, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has national reach.“The SEC can bring a case anywhere in the country,” Christopher Gerold, a partner at Lowenstein Sandler LLP told Decrypt. “They can just as easily file a lawsuit today and allege sale of unregistered securities in a jurisdiction that they find favorable: California, New York, [or Washington] D.C.”In its complaint, the MetaMask maker claimed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has internally viewed Ethereum as a security for over a year. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) Among other rulings related to MetaMask’s features, Consensys seeks a judicial declaration that Ethereum is not a security.Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin said Thursday that the firms’ lawsuit is aimed at “getting clarity from U.S. courts.” But the legal tussle, despite being in Texas, probably won’t bring clarity about on its own, according to Gerold, who previously served as the chief of the New Jersey Bureau of Securities. “You have a lot of judges [in Texas] that are concerned about the expansion of federal agencies and the role they play,” Gerold said. “If you're anti-regulation [...], that's where you bring your case.”Consensys may have made a strategic choice in filing its lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, where “judge shopping” has proved contentious. But that doesn’t preclude the SEC from picking its own favorable legal turf if it decides to move forward with a separate lawsuit, Gerold explained.If the SEC wanted to find that Ethereum was a security publicly, they don’t have to do it through the Consensys lawsuit, he continued. And depending on how higher courts rule as those cases are appealed, Ethereum could be considered a security in one part of the U.S. but not the other.“Something could be legal in New Jersey and illegal in Texas,” Gerold said, noting that federal circuit courts are not bound by the decisions of other federal circuit courts.A patchwork of case law could become cemented if the Supreme Court then decides not to take up the question of whether Ethereum is a security. Of course, Congress could step in at any moment with new laws that ultimately determine how digital assets are treated, Gerold said.The SEC has not filed any charges related to the Ethereum-centered investigation that Consensys alleges is occurring. And Gerold expects the agency will first seek to dismiss the case without telegraphing its internal thoughts on Ethereum’s legal status.A lawsuit from the SEC could then follow, which would build upon a Wells Notice issued to Consensys, as is usually the case, Gerold said. A Wells Notice from the SEC typically precedes formal charges. It could still be years until the regulatory matter over Ethereum is fully settled, coming to a head in several different courtrooms along the way.“There's different paths [that this] could go.” Gerold said. “But this idea that Consensys’ lawsuit is going to answer the question [of] whether Ethereum is a security or not—and that's the only forum that has that ability right now—is a fallacy.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Attention XRP Community: Ripple Announces a New Partnership - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ripple and XRPL Labs recently joined forces with Swirlds Labs, developer of blockchain network Hedera, and the Algorand Foundation to become members of the Decentralized Recovery (DeRec) Alliance.
DeRec Alliance, which includes members such as Acoer, BankSocial, Blade Labs, The Building Blocks, Casper Association, Constellation Network, The Hashgraph Association, HBAR Foundation and Revive Labs, was founded by Hedera co-founder Leemon Baird. The alliance aims to accelerate the recovery of lost digital assets by providing an open-source process.



The Algorand Foundation and Swirlds Labs first partnered to form the DeRec Alliance in January of this year. Founding members provide feedback on alliance policies and governance structure and receive a two-year seat on the Technical Oversight Committee.
Expressing his support for the initiative, Wietse Wind, Founder and CEO of XRP Labs, said: “As we move towards mass individual adoption, it is increasingly clear that advanced yet user-friendly solutions for key recovery are required.

Joe Biden Is Trying to ‘Kill Crypto’, Says Cardano Creator - Decrypt

A fight over a non-binding resolution passed in the U.S. House has erupted into a broader battle, pitting the crypto industry against the Biden administration.“The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto,” wrote Charles Hoskinson, creator of Cardano, on Twitter.Yesterday, the White House said U.S. Pres. Joe Biden would veto resolution H.J. Res. 109, which demanded that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) retract a staff bulletin on digital asset custody accounting. The resolution won a bipartisan vote of 229-193, declaring that the SEC’s views were holding back American innovation in the digital asset space.Hoskinson declared the move only the latest in what he called "Operation Chokepoint 2.0."“This November, if you vote for Joe Biden as a cryptocurrency holder, please understand that the intent of this administration is to destroy the American cryptocurrency industry,” he said on a Twitter livestream late Wednesday. “Understand that. It’s unambiguously clear.”The White House argued that the resolution would hurt the SEC's efforts to protect investors in crypto markets and safeguard the broader financial system. But crypto enthusiasts don’t see it that way—and many believe that former president Donald Trump will be the better option in November's election."The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry,” Hoskinson tweeted.“The enforcement is tone-deaf and continues to carry on the same policy, which has cost tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of American jobs as well as the loss of a trillion-dollar industry," Hoskinson said.“They have confiscated, lied, and repeatedly throughout the years hurt our industry in every way possible, whether it be restricting access to bank accounts, regulation through enforcement, anti clarity, in some cases reversing decisions that had already been made, and now obstructing the legislative process,” he continued. “Understand that a vote for Biden is a vote against cryptocurrencies.”Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, also expressed concern about Biden’s position on crypto.“If Biden is reelected, they’ll hit stablecoins by requiring bank licenses for issuers, all tokens for being unregistered securities, all DeFi for unlicensed money transmission, Bitcoin mining, layers on top of BTC, and self-hosted wallets to collect crypto unrealized gains.”The CEO of Irreverent Labs, Rahul Sood, also expressed his disappointment, suggesting that voting for Biden is now even harder for those who care about crypto in the U.S."Wow—well, that settles it,” Sood tweeted. ”Thanks for making it easy, Joe."The Founder of Helium, Amir Haleem, echoed the sentiment. "Sad state of affairs,” he wrote on Twitter. “If you care about crypto in the US, voting for Biden is now even more impossible.”The document at the root of the dispute is a so-called Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB), which SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said is uncontroversial."It basically addresses whether liabilities should be on the balance sheet, and what we have found actually in bankruptcy court, time and again, many times now, is that indeed, bankruptcy courts have said that crypto assets are not bankruptcy remote,” he said in December. “So, the staff, as they have done over 50 years, did really good work."But Gensler has many vocal critics on Capitol Hill.Republican Patrick McHenry accused him of wanting to “choke off” the crypto industry. Even the courts have criticized the SEC over its “arbitrary and capricious” decisions.Crypto holders may be growing in importance as a constituency worth courting by politicians. A recent study by the Blockchain Association found that 90% of all crypto holders plan to vote in the next election, with the majority worried that politicians may be stifling innovation via overregulation. 45% liked or self identified as Democrats, 43% as Republicans, and 11% identified as independent.Biden’s rival, Donal Trump is taking the opportunity to earn the adoration of concerned crypto holders.“Crypto is moving out of the U.S. because of hostility towards crypto,” Trump said during a special event in Florida yesterday. “Gensler is very much against it, the Democrats are very much against it, but I’m good with it.”This pro-crypto stance sharply contrasts with his previous statements back from when he was president of the United States. “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” Trump wrote on Twitter in 2019.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Meme coin traders can benefit from fundamental analysis, says HashKey Capital's Jupiter Zhang - Crypto Briefing




Meme coins registered 1,300% returns on average during the first quarter, according to a report by CoinGecko. This made meme coins the most profitable narrative in that period and made the number of tokens issued on Solana, the hottest blockchain for meme coin trading, reach an all-time high of 14,648 tokens launched.In this landscape, new investors might be tempted to spray their funds over different meme coins and hope for stellar growth. Jupiter Zhang, head of liquid funds at investment firm HashKey Capital, highlights that “for every success story there are dozens more failures.”“Market fundamentals have never been more important. […] FOMO is not a long-term strategy,” shared Zhang with Crypto Briefing. “Fundamental analysis provides a structured, analytical approach to investment, especially crucial in a volatile market like crypto. While the high returns from meme coins might seem attractive, they are often driven by hype and speculation rather than underlying economic value.”Recently, HashKey Capital published a 217-page book titled “Digital Asset Valuation Framework”, a guide to fundamental analysis in crypto. Zhang is the lead author, and he says that by understanding fundamental analysis, investors can identify assets with real potential and longevity, reducing risk and fostering a more sustainable investment strategy.“This is crucial because, as the meme coin narrative shows, not all that glitters in the crypto world is gold.”Why bother with fundamentals?Meme coins, as the name suggests, rise by backpacking on a famous meme. Because of this, most of them usually have short lifespans. Investors might not be inclined to learn how to do proper research since spreading money might be more profitable.“Even in the seemingly whimsical area of meme coins, fundamental analysis can provide insights. For instance, evaluating the community engagement, development activity, and use cases of the token can offer a glimpse into its potential sustainability and growth,” explains Zhang.Moreover, fundamental analysis can be useful for identifying what meme coins have a strong enough narrative to sustain longer-term interest from those that are likely to fizzle out with the fading of initial hype.“Fundamental analysis doesn’t necessarily lie in opposition to narrative-driven investing, which focuses primarily on the stories and trends that capture market interest and investor sentiment. They can be used in tandem to provide a more well-rounded evaluation of a digital asset’s potential.”Zhang adds that while fundamental analysis aims for long-term growth against the market’s often emotional and speculative waves, narrative-driven investments are useful to ride the waves of market enthusiasm and investor psychology, potentially reaping quick rewards.However, narrative-driven investing often leads to the fear of missing out (FOMO), and that usually ends in bad investments. In other words, narrative-driven demands an effort to time the market and move swiftly before the narrative shifts, while fundamental analysis delves into the intrinsic value of an investment, looking to identify assets with strong fundamentals that suggest a higher intrinsic value than the market price.“This is a more methodical path to potentially sustainable gains, as it requires rigorous assessment of data. Some things we look at when evaluating the fundamentals of digital assets: a thorough evaluation of a token’s utility, governance structure, supply mechanics, technical stack, and potential innovations there.”More VCs into meme coinsThe meme coin market was always a way for investors to bet without generating returns for VCs. That is because when a token from a protocol is made available to the public, VCs already have their hands on it for a significantly smaller price. Consequently, if this token gets popular and its price jumps, VCs are the true winners.Meanwhile, since meme coins are issued by the community, this is one sector VCs can’t profit from. Or couldn’t until recently. Shiba Inu closed a $12 million funding round with the participation of Mechanism Capital, Big Brain Holdings, Cypher Capital, and Shima Capital, among others, and this may turn the tide in the meme coin market.“Across sectors, industries, and opportunities, investors will seek returns in all corners of the market. So large-scale investments in meme coins are not really surprising,” says Zhang about the recent movement of VCs into these tokens. “The fundraising success of Shiba Inu suggests that even meme coins can capture serious investor attention when they align with a compelling narrative and show potential for broader ecosystem development based on community engagement.”Therefore, that’s where fundamental analysis shows its weight. Zhang believes that as more people get equipped with fundamental analysis tools, the number of serious investments directed at selected meme coins will show sustained growth over time.“These will likely be the ones that demonstrate real utility, ongoing social value, or strategic significance within the crypto market, beyond just the initial hype.”

SUI Token Shatters Recovery Hopes as It Falls Below $1 Peg - DailyCoin


        
The SUI token is struggling to recover from its price lows.



SUI has fallen below its one dollar peg.



The Sui network recently celebrated its first year anniversary.
SUI, the native token of the SUI system, had an impressive start to the year, doubling its year-start value to reach new highs. However, the situation took a different turn when the token suffered a sharp decline on May 12, 2024, reaching a bottom low before seeing slight recovery gains.However, optimism for SUI’s rebound has been cut short as prospects further dwindle, with the token now recording a new low.Sui Token Plummets to $0.9 MarkAccording to CoinMarketCap data on Thursday, May 9, SUI, currently wavering at $0.995, has suffered an approximate 6% decline in the past 24 hours, The token’s current training price marks its week low value, dropping it approximately 14% from its highest point this week, $1.141.
The underperformance marks SUI’s third consecutive week of losses, which has seen the token drop a staggering 40% in the last 30 days. The downward trend, which commenced following the geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran, has dashed the initially heightened hopes for SUI to reclaim its $2 peg and surpass its all time high record of $2.18.Sui’s downward trend is not isolated, fueled by its vulnerability to negative market trends and inability to swiftly recover. Additionally, the ongoing decline echoes the broader downtick across the market,  signaling choppy waters ahead for the native token. The drop in SUI’s price contrasts with the broader bustling activity across its ecosystem,Sui Celebrates AnniversaryOn May 2, 2024, Sui network celebrated its first year anniversary as a Layer-1 solution focused on digital asset ownership.
Reflecting on its journey, SUI highlighted its milestones over the past year, such as its $720 million milestone in total value locked (TVL), as well as its native token climb since inception. The network also announced a collaboration with Google Cloud, which will provide its developers with refined analytics tools and advanced Web3 innovation.At press time, Sui’s total value locked (TVL) sits at $643.5 million, securing the 13th position and outpacing chains such as Cardano, Aptos, and Pulsechain.Sui was recently accused of centralizing the ownership of its native token read more:Sui Network Dispels ‘Shady’ Token Supply Allegations Are crypto mixers being driven out of the United States?

SEC Cripples Ripple’s Latest Stablecoin Project - Says It Qualifies As Securities Offering | Cryptopolitan

No other crypto firm has gone to war with the SEC as Ripple has. Unfortunately, the legal face-offs are not over yet. The SEC vs Ripple cases still continue in the courts today, and just recently, the SEC has hinted at a new possible avenue to sue the XRP issuer. The XRP issuer has been battling the SEC for about four years now in court. The legal battles have somewhat crippled the firm, limiting innovations and eventually hurting the growth of XRP. In response, Ripple announced its plans to launch a stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar, to compete against the larger stablecoin issuers like Tether and CENTRE – a joint venture between Coinbase and Circle. Ripple Labs’ attempt to launch the stablecoin has hit yet another roadblock, as the SEC says the stablecoin qualifies as an unregistered securities offering just like XRP. The company announced the Stablecoin plans last month, and since then, the regulator has not been resting. The SEC’s issue with Ripple Labs’ StablecoinThe Securities and Exchange Commission continues to attack Ripple after it announced its plans for a new stablecoin project. The Stablecoin, according to Brad Garlinghouse, is meant to fight against the de-pegging events that have caused stablecoin users to lose billions. Despite this noble reason, the SEC remains adamant and thinks the XRP issuer is in the business of issuing out unregistered securities, just like it’s been doing over the years. “Ripple’s primary business continues to be, as it has been since 2013, unregistered sales of XRP. It also plans to issue a new unregistered crypto asset,” the filing read.The XRP issuer has had minor wins against the SEC over the four-year court battle. As the legal warfare nears its end, despite the existing challenges. The SEC reportedly demanded a $2 billion fine from Ripple Labs; however, the defendant only offered $10 million. The SEC thinks that a significantly low amount for the XRP issuers’ alleged violations of the law.“That certainly could be part of the solution. I think there is a certain strangeness that the SEC has kind of picked winners here: it said that Bitcoin is not a security, it said that Ether is not a security, but really everything else, I think, is kind of at risk. Particularly given what they have done in the lawsuit against Ripple. But, you know, we could do that.”Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEOBrad said this in an interview with CNN, hinting a stablecoin solution might be the proper alternative to XRP amid SEC scrutiny. Unfortunately, the SEC has a similar view on the yet-to-launch stablecoin as well.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Valued at $25,000,000 Leaves Robinhood Crypto in the Wake of the SEC’s Wells Notice - The Daily Hodl


								Tens of millions of dollars worth of the meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) has left Robinhood Crypto after the firm received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
New data from blockchain-tracking platform Bitcoinsensus reveals that 164 million DOGE worth $25 million was transferred out of Robinhood after the firm’s crypto branch received notice that the regulatory agency would be taking enforcement actions against it.










A Well Notice is a warning given by the SEC informing an entity that legal action is going to be taken against them, though it is not an indication of any wrongdoing. Robinhood received its notice on May 6th.
Earlier this week, crypto attorney Jake Chervinsky said that the SEC was abusing its power and issuing Wells Notices as a scare tactic.
“If the SEC brings as many enforcement actions as it has sent Wells Notices, it will be in flagrant violation of both the law and its Congressional mandate. If not, it’s clearly abusing the Wells process to get free discovery and terrorize upstanding US companies. Which is it?”
However, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev took to social media after the firm received the notice, saying that he would challenge the SEC in court if it came down to it.
“While we strive to maintain positive and productive relationships with our regulators, if necessary we will use our resources to contest this matter in the courts, with the intent of both defending our crypto business and establishing regulatory clarity in the United States for the benefit of our customers.”
News of the transfer had minimal impact on DOGE as the digital asset is trading for $0.149 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin network challenges: Are miners behind BTC's decline? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s difficulty is expected to decline in the coming days.
Price of BTC fell along with the velocity of the coin.

Bitcoin [BTC] has been struggling to push past the $65,000 level for quite some time. One of the main determinants of BTC’s price would be the state of miners on the Bitcoin network.
Difficulty declines
A drop of over 6% in Bitcoin mining difficulty is expected for BTC in the next 24 hours. This would be the largest difficulty decrease since FTX collapsed in December 2022, which saw a drop of over 7%.
At press time, blocks were coming in at an average time of 10.7 minutes. The recent difficulty drop is likely due to a decrease in the network’s hash rate, which is the total computing power dedicated to mining Bitcoin.
Source: X
The revenue generated by miners declined significantly as well over the past month, from $72,000 to $59,000.
This decline in revenue can have a severe impact on not only the Bitcoin network, but also BTC’s price.
As miner revenues decline, it gets harder for miners to remain profitable, so miners have to resort to selling their BTC so that they can stay afloat. As a result, selling pressure on BTC increases.
Source: Blockchain.com
State of the Bitcoin network
Another thing that can impact miner revenue and BTC’s price would be the activity on the Bitcoin network. At the time of writing, Daily Active Addresses on the Bitcoin network had declined significantly.
This slowdown in activity could signal a potential decline in interest in Bitcoin’s ecosystem, which may impact sentiment around the network in the long run.
Source: Santiment
At press time, BTC was trading at $61,655.60. Also, the velocity at which BTC was trading at had plummeted significantly in the last few days. 
A falling velocity implied that the frequency with which BTC was being traded at had declined.

Coinbase sees infinite interoperability potential with Ethereum and USDC

Coinbase is preparing for a future of a billion customers using decentralized applications on millions of blockchains safely and securely in a system integrating the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC). Coinbase head of tokenization Anthony Bassili, speaking at TokenizeThis 2024 in Miami, said Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 Base blockchain will save time on Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) with identity attestation through the Ethereum Attestation service and Coinbase verification, which creates a tag on the user’s so-called smart wallet. Coinbase verification is available after the customer has completed its KYC procedure. While that may not be sufficient in all cases, Bassili said:“We expect that eventually to evolve into something like a KYC reliance model. […] And it will start to form market structure that makes it a lot easier for a simpler KYC process.” Already more than 300,000 wallets have been attested. Related: Coinbase's Base could make it the NVIDIA of DeFiTo give those customers with wallets and verified identities Web3 access, Base will leverage the interoperability of EVM networks. The ecosystem will be supported by USDC. Coinbase took an equity stake in Circle in August. “Right now, we're somewhere above $28 billion of total assets” in Circle, Bassili said. Coinbase also has the ability to mint USDC.Coinbase head of tokenization Anthony Bassili (right) at TokenizeThis 2024.

Bassili said:“I think […] we're a while away from [that goal], because we need regulatory structures to show up, we need products themselves to be designed with identity checks instantly, and there is a lot of market structure that is still has to come.”“Crypto is the perfect embodiment of a liquid free open market structure where you can design any amount of complexity into it and have assets, trade with each other, don't have to be dollar pairs trade,” Bassili said. In the meantime, USDC provides a first step to developing that market structure.Magazine: 6 Questions for Kim Hamilton Duffy of Centre

&nbsp
The world of cryptocurrencies is witnessing a whirlwind of activity, and at the center of this storm is Shiba Inu. Riding high on the popularity of meme coins, the Shiba Inu ecosystem has experienced a remarkable surge in engagement, particularly on its layer-2 blockchain platform, Shibarium.



Shibarium has seen its transaction fees spike by a staggering 500% in the past few days. This surge in fees, coupled with a remarkable 211% increase in active accounts, paints a picture of a rapidly evolving ecosystem that is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This article delves into the implications of these developments for Shiba Inu and its ecosystem.



According to data from Shibariumscan, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, BONE, has witnessed a remarkable surge in transaction fees. Gas commissions paid in BONE have surged from 12 BONE to a remarkable 61.47 BONE, marking a fivefold increase within a single day. This transaction fee surge indicates the heightened network activity on Shibarium, as users flock to participate in the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

Accompanying the surge in transaction fees is a notable increase in active accounts on Shibarium. Within the same 24-hour window, active accounts on the platform surged by an astounding 211%, jumping from 1,724 to 3,650. This surge in active accounts indicates a significant uptick in user engagement as more individuals participate in the Shiba Inu ecosystem.



The surge in transaction fees and active accounts on Shibarium raises essential questions about the future of Shiba Inu and its ecosystem. Will this increased activity lead to further growth and adoption of Shiba Inu tokens? How will Shibarium adapt to accommodate the growing demand while maintaining efficiency and scalability? Moreover, what impact will these developments have on the broader crypto market, particularly amidst the current market volatility?

Meme Coin Market Outlook



Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme cryptocurrency, has recently faced a steep decline but has surged by almost 14% within 7 days. Currently, DOGE is trading at an average price of $0.15, marking an 83% decrease from its all-time high of $0.737 recorded on May 8, 2021. Despite this, its 24-hour trading volume has surged by 13% to reach $1.1 billion, maintaining a market cap of $18 billion.



On the other hand, Shiba Inu, the second-largest meme coin, has also experienced challenges despite a notable 104% surge year-to-date. SHIB’s price soared by over 4% in the last 24 hours. This recent downturn comes after SHIB’s impressive 134% gain in the last 90 days, indicating a shift in market sentiment. Currently trading at an average price of $0.0000233, SHIB’s 24-hour trading volume has increased by 20% to $371 million, with a market cap of around $13.7 billion.



Similarly, the newly emerging meme coin PEPE saw a remarkable surge of over 560% in the last 90 days. However, the recent market slump has led to a 22% drop over the past week, followed by an 11.26% increase in the last 24 hours. Despite this, PEPE is still the third-largest meme crypto, trading at an average price of $0.000008514. Its 24-hour trading volume has risen by 18% to $900 million, maintaining a market cap of $3.58 billion.

                        A South Korean convenience store chain, Emart24, is teaming up with the popular cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb to offer Bitcoin Meal packs. These unique meal boxes will provide customers with an opportunity to win small amounts of Bitcoin, adding a crypto twist to their lunch break.
Bitcoin Meal Packs
Approximately 30,000 Bitcoin Meal packs will be available for purchase at Emart24 locations by the end of the month, priced at 5,900 Korean won (USD $4.30) each. The process is simple: after purchasing a meal pack, customers can download the Bithumb app and enter a coupon code inside the box to potentially win 10,000 won worth of Bitcoin.An additional 20,000 won worth of Bitcoin will be awarded to those who choose to create a Bitcoin account with NH Nonghyup Bank. Existing Bithumb users need to connect their accounts to redeem their rewards.Bithumb, a Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA) member alongside Coinone, Upbit, Gopax, and Korbit, plays a major role in South Korea’s crypto market. Despite delays in IPO plans, the exchange recently announced its plans to become the first crypto exchange listed on the South Korean stock market.
Crypto Regulations in South Korea
Over the past few years, South Korea has implemented stricter crypto regulations surrounding the market. Legislators have also implemented stricter penalties for crypto-related crimes and established new regulatory guidelines. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, South Korean financial authorities mandate that cryptocurrency users report any unlicensed exchanges operating within the country.Despite these regulations, the collaboration between Emart24 and Bithumb demonstrates the continued growth and integration of cryptocurrency within South Korea’s economy.

Chiliz Joins Forces with SBI Holdings in Japan


SBI Digital Asset Holdings, a branch of SBI Holdings that focuses on cryptocurrencies, has joined forces with Chiliz, a top sports blockchain provider. 
Together, the two companies are launching a joint venture in Japan. It aimed to enhance the Japanese sports landscape by introducing fan tokens from globally celebrated football clubs like Manchester City and AC Milan.
SBI Holdings Teams Up with Chiliz 
This partnership extends beyond access to fan tokens. It offers a variety of interactive experiences and rewards, such as game-day activations. It also provides opportunities to influence club-related decisions. 
With 82 fan tokens and over 150 sports entity partnerships, Chiliz leverages its platform, Socios.com, to boost fan engagement significantly.

Fernando Luis Vázquez Cao, CEO of SBI Digital Asset, emphasized the venture’s capability to deliver new experiences tailored to Japan’s robust fan culture. 

“This partnership allows us to harness the passion of Japanese sports fans, bringing them closer to the teams they love through innovative Web3 features,” he noted.


Integrating fan tokens in Japan aligns with local cultural norms. Japanese investors often seek engagement and perks, not just financial gains. Therefore, fan tokens offer these without needing ownership in sports teams.
This venture has grown to include Azuro, a major player in on-chain predictions. Chiliz uses Azuro’s advanced liquidity pools, tools, and Oracle solutions to enter the on-chain prediction market. This move lets Azuro platform applications launch with low initial costs, focusing on user engagement and revenue.

Mastercard, Visa, Citi, JPMorgan and Other Giants Start Experiments for Cryptocurrency Technology - Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Mastercard is collaborating with some of the largest U.S. banks to test a shared ledger technology that could revolutionize the settlement of tokenized assets such as commercial bank money, Treasuries, and investment-grade debt securities.
The Regulated Payment Network's proof-of-concept system in testing will simulate transactions in dollars, aiming to enable transactions across borders and systems, reduce errors and fraud, and make the process faster and easier.


Currently, securities such as commercial bank money, wholesale central bank money, and investment grade debt are all managed in separate systems. The introduction of this ledger technology can significantly change the financial landscape. Once these assets are tokenized and run on the distributed ledger, they can be traded on the same system.

This trial builds on a previous 12-week test that started in late 2022 and focused on domestic interbank payments in the US and cross-border payments in dollars.





Participants in the new trial include Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., US Bancorp, Wells Fargo & Co., Visa Inc., Swift, TD Bank NA and Zions Bancorp.

Pantera Capital Predicts Bitcoin Price at $117,000 by 2025


Pantera Capital projects an astonishing ascent for Bitcoin, estimating its value at $117,000 by August 2025. 
This price prediction hinges on historical data surrounding Bitcoin halvings — a phenomenon that halves the reward for mining a block on the network.
Pantera Capital’s Bitcoin Price Prediction
In a recent report, Pantera Capital suggests that post-halving periods herald significant bull rallies. However, after the 2024 halving, Bitcoin suffered a price correction to $57,000. This pattern is typical of previous market cycles and predicts a potent bull run leading up to 2025.

In 2023, Bitcoin dipped to $28,168, yet it experienced a 1.8x increase by 2024. Pantera Capital extrapolates from this trend a robust 4.2x climb by late August 2025, just 480 days post-halving, culminating near a striking $117,482. Another optimistic prediction suggests Bitcoin might climb as high as $155,000 by the same year.
However, achieving these numbers requires overcoming substantial market resistance, particularly around $63,000. Pantera Capital points to Bitcoin’s current trajectory, which includes a “triple top pattern.” The analysts also foresee continued volatility as an indicator of the challenges ahead.


“A pattern has formed that we often call the triple top pattern. BTC/USD is currently experiencing a corrective recovery. However, breaking through the $63,000 resistance level remains a challenge and goal. The greatest volatility occurs after a breakout,” the report noted.

Nevertheless, the firm’s analysis remains steadfast, supported by successful past predictions, like when Bitcoin hit a market bottom of $17,000.

Bitcoin Whales Acquire Nearly $1 Billion BTC Amidst Price Stagnation ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience amidst a history of price fluctuations in recent weeks. Notably, on 14th March, Bitcoin surged as high as $71,827 ahead of the halving event. However, since the beginning of May, the leading crypto asset has faced a notable downturn, dropping to as low as $57,000 towards the end of last month.



Nevertheless, despite this volatility, Bitcoin appears to have entered a phase of relative stability. Its price hovers between $61,000 and $64,000, showing minimal volatility compared to its past erratic movements. This period of price stagnation hints at a temporary balance in the market, with neither bullish nor bearish sentiments dominating.



That said, while some investors interpret this as a precursor to a potential price swing, others see it as an opportunity for strategic accumulation. On Wednesday, popular crypto analytics platform Santiment highlighted how Bitcoin whales have made significant accumulation moves following the recent price dip.



“As Bitcoin ranges tightly between $61,000 and $64,000, large whales have made some accumulation moves over the past 24 hours. Wallets with 1,000-10,000 BTC have collectively accumulated $941 million worth of coins, rebounding to their highest holding level in 2 weeks,” tweeted Santiment.







Notably, Santiment’s late finding aligns with previous reports indicating a similar trend. On May 3, Santiment reported how Bitcoin whales accumulated over 47,000 BTC (over the past 24 hours), demonstrating resilience amidst market fluctuations. The consistent accumulation by large holders amidst market uncertainty underscores their confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and resilience.

That said, indicators like the MVRV 90-Day Ratio technically suggest that Bitcoin remains in an attractive buy zone, further bolstering investor sentiment. Ki Young Ju, CEO of Cryptoquant, also chimed in on Bitcoin’s current state, highlighting Bitcoin’s robust network fundamentals and suggesting a potential market cap three times its current size.



“Bitcoin network fundamentals could support a market cap three times its current size compared to the last cyclical top, potentially sustaining a price of $265K,” wrote Ju.



Elsewhere, Glassnode analysts “Negentropic” also echoed optimism, suggesting that Bitcoin is primed for further upward movement. According to the experts, last week’s “reversal candle,” coupled with its movement back into the Pennant Structure, indicates a potential breakout.



“BTC still looks like it is about to BLOW higher! Last week’s candle was a Reversal Candle – a Hammer with a long Wick. Price moved back into the Pennant Structure. This candle still dominates the structure. This week’s pullback hence seems like healthy Correction before higher. Correction often pulls back either 50% or 61.8% of the previous Impulse move.” They wrote on Thursday. 







Bitcoin was trading at $62,623 at press time, reflecting a 1.85% surge over the past 24 hours.

Crypto Presidential Rally: TRUMP Soars 36.2% And Flips BODEN


																In a year full of global elections, the crypto industry remains expectant and critical of every candidate’s stance on cryptocurrencies. The US presidential elections could pose a turning point for regulations and adoption that could affect the industry worldwide. 
On Wednesday, Donald Trump, former US president and Republican candidate, stated his support for the industry and criticized Biden’s administration for its stance on digital assets. MAGA (TRUMP), the Trump-inspired memecoin, saw its price skyrocket  63% in the following hours.

	Related Reading



Trump’s Stance On Crypto 
The Republican candidate held a gathering on Wednesday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Holders of NFTs bearing Trump’s name and likeness attended the Trump Cards NFT Gala. 
During this event, the former US president strongly criticized Biden’s administration and its hostility towards the sector. He revealed he is “fine” with crypto and wants to make it a “solid” industry.
Trump claimed he’s the best option for those who are in favor of cryptocurrencies:

(…) I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else. But I’m good with it. And if you want, if you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for me.

Moreover, the Republican candidate asserted that “crypto is moving out of the US because of the hostility towards it,” something he alleges he doesn’t want to continue and promises to stop.


When asked what he would do to stop the exodus of digital asset businesses, he stated that to embrace them, they would have to let them be in the country. To achieve this, the candidate promised a more welcoming regulatory framework for crypto. 
As part of his jab at the current administration, Trump mimicked US President Joe Biden, claiming he would be clueless if asked about cryptocurrencies. He further added, “The Democrats are very much against it.”
TRUMP Flips BODEN As Price Soars 
After Trump’s declarations, two memecoins inspired by the politicians saw a price reaction. Jeo Boden (BODEN) soared 23.5% in the following hour, going from $0.34 to $0.42. 
Since then, the price has retraced to hover between the $0.35-$0.36 range. BODEN is trading at $0.3492, representing a 15.1% increase in the last 24 hours. 
The token’s daily trading volume also saw a significant 35.7% surge, with over $20 million traded in the past day. Despite benefiting from the Republican candidate’s jab at its inspiration, BODEN Still displays red numbers in the longer timeframes, with a 29.9% and 59.8%  weekly and monthly decrease.


As a result, TRUMP’s $252 million market capitalization flipped BODEN’s $239 million. The Trump-inspired token became the 14th largest memecoin by market capitalization, per CoinGecko data.

Moreover, TRUMP seemingly won this round with crypto investors, which rallied 63% after Trump’s statement. The token surged from $4.2 to $7.1 in the following hours before retracing to the $5.3 level.

Diving into Bitcoin whale activity: 15K BTC snapped up in 2 days - AMBCrypto



A cohort of BTC whales have continued to fill their bags.
This has happened despite the coin’s recent price action.

Bitcoin [BTC] whales have intensified accumulation despite the coin’s recent decline below $62,000. 
According to on-chain data provider Santiment, BTC whales holding between 1000 and 10,000 coins accumulated 15,121 BTC valued at $930 million between the 7th and the 8th of May.
 This pushed the cohort’s total BTC holding to its highest level in 14 days.


At press time, this group of BTC investors held 38% of the coin’s circulating supply of 20 million BTC. 
BTC has the bears to contend with
At press time, BTC exchanged hands at $61,621. The coin recently crossed below its 20-day simple moving average (SMA), putting it at risk of a further decline in the short term. 
When an asset’s price falls below its 20-day SMA, it suggests that the short-term trend for the asset is downward. 
Market participants often view this as a sign that sellers are in control and that the asset’s price will likely continue declining.
Readings from BTC’s price movement on a 1-day chart showed that its price fell below its 20-day SMA on the 7th of May and has since witnessed a 3% decline in its value.
Further, the coin has seen a decline in demand among general market participants. An assessment of its key momentum indicators showed them below their respective center lines at press time.
For example, the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 44.12, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 23.21. At these values, the indicators showed significant bearish pressure in the market.
Likewise, as of this writing, the coin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was poised to cross below the zero line. This indicator measures the money flow into and out of the coin’s market. 
A CMF value below zero indicates market weakness, suggesting increased liquidity exit.

If the bears strengthen their position, they may pull the coin’s price down to the support line of BTC’s descending channel pattern.

 If this happens, the leading cryptocurrency asset will exchange hands at the $57,000 price region. 
However, if this bearish projection is invalidated as bullish activity gains momentum, BTC’s price may rally toward the pattern’s resistance line and attempt a crossover.

CZ hits back at WSJ, Hong Kong crypto ETF’s take ‘$50B equivalent’: Asia Express


            
Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry’s most important developments.



Binance is under scrutiny yet again 



Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has been accused of firing its own investigators after discovering that its VIP client, props trading firm DWF Labs, engaged in alleged acts of market manipulation. 



A May 9 Wall Street Journal report claimed that DWF Labs engaged in market manipulation, wash trading, and inflated trading volumes amounting to $300 million through deals with crypto projects. After the exchange’s surveillance team recommended offboarding the client, Binance allegedly sided with DWF Labs and fired the investigator, arguing insufficient evidence for the claim.

Binance has denied involvement. “We affirm our strict market surveillance program. We do not tolerate market abuse,” said the exchange in a tweet. “Market maker competition is fierce and our investigation team’s job is to be neutral and look at the evidence without any bias, including bias that might come from market-making firms’ claims against their competitors.”  



According to the exchange, its staff has offboarded 355,000 users with a transaction volume of $2.5 trillion for violating its terms of use in the past three years. 



DWF Labs, too, has denied the allegations. “We want to clarify that many recent allegations reported in the press are unfounded and distort the facts,” they said. “DWF Labs operates with the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and ethics, and we remain committed to supporting you and our over 700 partners across the crypto ecosystem.”



Binance’s co-founder and spouse of its co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, penned a response dripping in irony, writing: 




“I am very grateful to the WSJ for their consistent and long-term devotion to Binance, which has greatly increased our exposure and saved us a lot of marketing budget. However, I have noticed an interesting phenomenon where some mainstream media articles are increasingly driven by emotions and biases rather than facts. For example, the complaints of former employees can become the basis of an article, while Binance’s proactive assistance to law enforcement agencies in investigating and apprehending the mastermind behind Zkasino (as a matter of fact) is not deemed worthy of reporting.” 




DWF Labs is a prominent trading firm in the crypto industry. Founded by Andrei Grachev in 2021, the firm invests in promising projects and provides long-term financial support to them, as stated on its website. 






Thailand Web3 Music Festival concludes 



Music idol protocol Fansland’s music festival in Bangkok, Thailand attracted over 30,000 festival go-ers from May 4 to 5. 



The Web3 aspect was perhaps of less appeal than a performance by South Korean pop star PSY, the creator of “Gangnam Style.” More than 20 other artists graced the stage, including renowned Cantonese Hip-Hop artist Edison Chen, powerhouse vocalists Henry Lau, Gen1es, BKPP, Chanyeol, BUS, Dreamnote, Pretzelle, Sistar19, Taemin, and 24kGoldn. “Their electrifying performances set the stage ablaze, creating an atmosphere of pure excitement and energy that left the audience in awe,” organizers breathlessly reported. 







In addition to human performances, the festival featured tokenized music products and AI-generated music idols. 



The festival featured a unique NFT ticketing system where tickets were minted as NFTs on Fansland and became tradable on secondary markets. The tickets can also be used as an access point to interact with Fansland DeFi. 



The first batch of NFT ticket holders for this music festival automatically became early participants in Fansland.AI, unlocking perks such as token airdrops and future whitelist qualifications. 



Fansland aims to create a decentralized fan economy infrastructure so that global music lovers can interact with their singers and idols. It focuses on Web3 music festivals, NFT ticketing, and real-world asset DeFi. Last month, Fansland secured a $10 million funding round led by IME, Linear Capital, and Falablock.

Hong Kong ETFs attract $317M, but can it last?



The total assets under management of six Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have surpassed $317.4 million since their inception on April 30. 



Data from local crypto exchange OSL, which also serves as the trading platform and sub-custodian for a few of the aforementioned ETFs, show that a combined 2,079.42 Bitcoin (BTC) and 396.79 Ether (ETH) have flowed in. 



“Together, we have addressed some of the most intricate challenges of our industry —regulated digital asset custody, ensuring stable liquidity, and bridging traditional financial markets with the speed of on/off-chain operations,” commented Patrick Pan, CEO of OSL. 



The Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs are denominated in three fiat currencies and allow investors to subscribe and redeem ETF units in both crypto and fiat. However, it appears that the vast majority of assets managed by the ETFs — well over $200 million, were subscribed prior to their listing. 



As per data compiled by Farside Investors, total asset flow into the six ETFs has amounted to just $24.7 million since April 30, a mere fraction of the tens of billions of dollars that went into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in their first week of launch. 



Nevertheless, many industry veterans remain optimistic



“The HK ETFs at $310m is equiv to $50b in US market,” said senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on April 6, in reference to the Hong Kong market’s relative size and liquidity compared to the United States. “So in that regard these ETFs already as big to their local mkt as US ones are to its.”



ApolloSats co-founder Thomas Fahrer claimed “rumors are swirling of a pending approval into Hong Kong Stock Connect which would allow Mainland Chinese to invest and could ignite this market.” However these are merely rumors and mainland Chinese investors are currently prohibited from accessing the Hong Kong crypto ETFs, barring a population of over 1 billion from entering the space. 



Despite high hopes, the Hong Kong crypto ETFs did not attract as many assets as expected. 



$128 million pledged for Hong Kong crypto ETF liquidity fund 



Market makers remain bullish on the prospects of the Hong Kong ETFs. 



On May 8, digital asset managers LD Capital, Antalpha Ventures, and Highblock pledged a total of $128 million “to provide market-making services to Hong Kong ETFs, aimed at enhancing liquidity, improving the efficiency of capital flows, and reducing the risks associated with liquidity fluctuations and transactional volatility.”



LD Capital is a digital asset fund with a focus on primary and secondary blockchain investments, with over 300 blockchain enterprises in its portfolio. Antalpha Ventures is a financial services platform affiliated with Bitmain, a major manufacturer of Bitcoin mining ASICs. 



Highblock Limited, which was established by former executives from major international digital asset trading platforms, has more than ten years of experience in blockchain quantitative trading. The company is licensed for digital asset quantitative trading in Hong Kong and provides quantitative trading and investment portfolio management services in the digital asset sector.



The liquidity addition may be significant as due to liquidity restraints in the Hong Kong market and ongoing market downturn in China, the six spot crypto ETFs only saw trading volume of around $100 million on day one.

                        To commemorate the 25th anniversary of His Majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu II’s reign, Ghana Post launched a collection of “Crypto stamps” linked to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on May 9. The initiative blends Ghanaian cultural heritage with cutting-edge blockchain technology, offering a unique way to celebrate the King’s Silver Jubilee.
Ghana NFT Stamps: Bridging Tradition and Technology
These limited-edition Ghana Crypto Stamps, priced at $18 (250 Ghanaian cedi) each, are linked to unique NFTs, verifiable on the blockchain, providing collectors with proof of ownership and authenticity. Only 7,200 Crypto Stamps are available, making them potentially valuable collectible for collectors and technology enthusiasts.The integration of NFTs ensures the security and transparency of the Ghana crypto stamp collection. By using blockchain technology, collectors can verify the authenticity of their stamps through a simple smartphone scan, generating a unique authentication message for each scan. This process effectively combats counterfeiting and safeguards the integrity of each collectible.With the release of these NFTs, Ghana has become the first African country to release a commemorative stamp collection on the blockchain.
African Adoption of Cryptocurrency
Ghana’s foray into NFT stamps reflects a growing adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology across Africa.The South African Reserve Bank recently announced plans to regulate and integrate cryptocurrency and central bank digital currency (CBDC) into its financial system. This initiative seeks to modernize payment infrastructure, enhance access to financial technology, and ultimately benefit the local economy. While the South African plan focuses on the domestic market, it underscores the continent’s increasing openness to embracing digital currencies.

                        Grayscale, the company behind the world’s largest Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, saw flat revenues in Q1 despite non-stop outflows from its world-famous fund throughout the quarter.
Grayscale’s Bitcoin: Outflows VS Revenue
Per a shareholder letter from Grayscale’s parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) netted $156 million between January and March – nearly identical to its Q4 2023 figure.As usual, this comprised most of DCG’s total $229 million revenue, up 11% from the prior quarter. The conglomerate’s gains were primarily driven by its mining pool giant Foundry and investment platform Luno, up 35% and 46% respectively.
“While Grayscale expected outflows alongside increased competition under the ETF wrapper, Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC nevertheless exceeded our expectations,” read the shareholder letter.
Upon converting into a Bitcoin spot ETF on January 11, GBTC lowered its long-standing management fee from 2% to 1.5%, following through on a promise to cut charges for critical investors who often labeled the fund as “exploitative.”However, most of Grayscale’s competitors who launched alongside them that day sported ultra-low fees of 0.3% or lower, including funds launched by recognizable names like BlackRock and Fidelity.As such, new and prospective Bitcoin ETF buyers had no incentive to invest through Grayscale, leaving little to no demand/inflows to counterbalance regular outflows from the fund.Such outflows have been seismic, to be sure: the fund now only controls 291,790 BTC, less than the 619,000 BTC it held as of January 10.As explained by market analysts at Glassnode, Grayscale’s investor base mostly represents long-term holders who have chosen to sell their Bitcoin at a profit as the asset’s price climbed.Last week, the fund experienced its first net inflow day since January 11.Losing Bitcoin ETF Market Share
That said, thanks to the value of its existing BTC rising over the past quarter, the company’s assets under management (AUM) has suffered less, falling from $30 billion to $18 billion.BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has nearly caught up to GBTC in size, controlling 273,25 BTC as of May 8, according to on-chain data.On a yearly basis, DCG’s revenue rose 51% compared to Q1 2023. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has risen 125% since this time last year.Regulators are currently reviewing an application for Grayscale to launch an Ether (ETH) spot ETF, though analysts don’t like their odds of approval. The company recently rescinded its application to launch an Ether futures ETF.

Binance Fined $4.3M in Canada as Global Regulators Circle - DailyCoin


        
Binance has been slapped with a multi-million dollar fine in Canada.



The fine comes about a year after the firm left the jurisdiction.



The firm is also under scrutiny in several other jurisdictions.
Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by market capitalization, can not seem to catch a break.The crypto exchange’s years of operating in the gray area and eschewing traditional corporate practices appear to be catching up with it. In November 2023, the exchange was slapped with $4.3 billion in fines from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)  for money laundering violations.
Now, the firm has been slapped with another fine, this time in Canada for similar violations.Binance Slapped With $4.3M FineIn a press statement on Thursday, May 7, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) disclosed that it had imposed an “administrative monetary penalty” of $6 million CAD or about $4.3 million USD on Binance for failing to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules.According to the regulator, the crypto exchange failed to report transactions over $10,000 on the exchange. The fine comes nearly a year after the exchange disclosed that it was closing shop in the country, citing restrictive regulations related to “stablecoins and investor limits.”A Global Noose Tightening?Beyond the U.S. and Canada, Binance faces significant regulatory scrutiny in several other jurisdictions, including the Philippines and Nigeria. Regulators have moved to block the exchange’s online presence in the Philippines.
In Nigeria, the firm faces charges of money laundering and tax evasion. The situation in Nigeria is further complicated by the arrest of the exchange’s Chief Financial Crime Compliance Officer, Tigran Gambaryan. The American has been held in the country for over two months and named in the charges against the exchange.On the Flipside 
Despite its several regulatory challenges, Binance is still the largest crypto exchange in the world.



Binance CEO Richard Teng has committed to steering the firm down the regulatory-compliant path.
Why This Matters The recent fine Binance faces adds to the exchange’s growing regulatory troubles. At the same time, it is another signal of shifting industry dynamics compelling crypto exchanges to comply with regulations in their jurisdictions.Read this for more on Binance’s history with Canada:Binance Canada Exit Leaves Crypto Community SplitFollow Ethereum’s latest effort to improve wallet UX:How Ethereum EIP-7702 Boosts Wallet UX with Minimal Downsides

Shiba Inu Team Issues Critical Warning To SHIB Community Following Major Listing | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu team has issued a crucial warning to its community, alerting them to the presence of fraudulent groups seeking to exploit the trust of SHIB community members for personal gain. This cautionary message from the team arrives as the cryptocurrency scored another significant listing milestone.
SHIB Team Cautions Against Scams
The Shiba Inu team has advocated for heightened vigilance against scams targeting community members. In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Shibarmy Scam Alerts, a social media handle dedicated to exposing scams, issued a stern warning regarding multiple scam attempts observed on Telegram social media platform.
The scam tracker has urged community members to watch out for fake or fraudulent groups impersonating legitimate Shiba Inu channels on Telegram. They disclosed tactics employed by these deceptive channels, including “promising giveaways, exclusive content, investment opportunities, and offering assistance for transaction issues to deceive unsuspecting community members.  
Excluding Telegram, the Shiba Inu community has also seen a rise in scam activities via X, with numerous scammers targeting community members using similar impersonation tactics or phishing attacks. 
While informing Shiba Inu members of these latest scam attacks on the community, Shibarmy Scam Alerts also outlined various ways SHIB community members can protect their privacy and security. The SHIB tracker emphasized the importance of verifying the authenticity of Telegram groups by checking for verification badges and announcements from reputable sources. 
Furthermore, the team stressed the significance of avoiding suspicious links and refraining from sharing wallet addresses in public chat rooms to reduce the likelihood of becoming a primary target for malicious attackers. Finally, Shibarmy Scam Alerts has urged users to stay updated on security alerts and adhere to optimal security practices, such as reporting any suspicious scam activities to the relevant authorities.  
Shiba Inu Gets Listed By Crypto Exchange Nexo
Amidst efforts to combat scam attempts within the Shiba Inu community, the cryptocurrency is celebrating a new milestone, securing listings from major exchanges. Nexo, a Switzerland-based all-in-one crypto platform, announced in a post on X on May 7, that it has officially integrated Shiba Inu into its crypto offerings. 
In its post, the crypto exchange lauded SHIB’s impressive growth over the years, highlighting the important role the Shiba Inu community, including its developer and dedicated supporters, has taken in boosting the development of the SHIB ecosystem. 
This listing also comes as Shiba Inu’s demand in the broader crypto market is growing at a rapid pace. Including Nexo, over 50 other crypto platforms or exchanges have listed SHIB, such as Binance, Robinhood, Bitget, and recently, Bitcoin.com.au.

Crypto influencers become 'PokÃ©mon cards' on Blast game - Crypto Briefing




Influencers from the crypto community on X were turned into a trading card game by the Blast-based game Fantasy.top. In the past four days, the cards related to these influencers reached 9,518 Ether (ETH) in trading volume, according to a Flipside dashboard created by user Hildobby.The cards’ power level is defined by how regularly the influencers publish with their X account, their follower count, and the reach of their tweets. Moreover, the more an influencer card is used by players, the more they receive from Fantasy.top. The power levels are based on the last seven days.Image: Fantasy.topFantasy.top leverages the current narrative of social finance, or SocialFi, which is hot after Friend.tech launched its native token FRIEND. FRIEND launched at an initial price of $3.03 but fell sharply in just three hours to $0.89. However, the token made a significant recovery to $2.19 at the time of writing.A crypto researcher known as DeFi Edge explained in his newsletter that Fantasy.top is better than Friend.tech at aligning the interests of users, influencers, and the protocol itself.“Influencers will get a share of revenue from: users/card traders want to buy cards from their favorite influencers; influencers are intrinsically motivated to improve their X engagement; this boosts their points, so users and influencers are perfectly aligned; the platform is giving money to influencers whose cards are used in competitions, so influencers are happy; the protocol wants more traders and influencers on their platform, so they’ll keep shipping features to make Fantasy.top more attractive.”Influencers receive 1.5% of all the fees collected from the trading volume of their respective cards, and also a 10% cut on pack sales which is split between the cards discovered. Packs are like boosters found in traditional trading card games, where a user gets random cards by opening them. At the time of writing, the platform’s marketplace generated 285.5 ETH in fees, equivalent to $863,000.The Fantasy.top platform is only accessible with referral codes, and it doesn’t have a native token yet.

Ethereum Whale Makes Massive Bet on ETH After 20% Price Drop | Cryptoglobe


                                
An Ethereum whale has made a massive bet on the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after withdrawing funds from leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance and staking them, to then borrow with those holdings and buy more.



According to data first shared by on-chain analysis service Lookonchain the Ethereum whale withdrew 6,030 ETH tokens worth over $18 million from leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance as it kept on accumulating funds since the beginning of the month, to the point they managed to have 10,758 ETH worth over $32.14 million in their wallet.



The whale then swapped their ETH for Lido Staked ETH (stETH), a liquid derivative token representing Ether that’s staked on Lido, a decentralized liquid staking protocol. The tokens represent ETH that’s earning from validating transactions on the network, while being liquid to use on other decentralized finance protocols.



The whale then deposited the stETH into decentralized lending protocol Aave to borrow $28.5 million in stablecoins, which it then used to buy more ETH, effectively leveraging their position on the second-largest cryptocurrency.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The whale’s bet on ETH comes after the cryptocurrency lost nearly 20% of its value over the last 30-day period to now trade below the $3,000 mark, while still being up around 30% year-to-date.



As CryptoGlobe reported a major ETH whale has recently cashed in on a successful year, as after purchasing a significant amount of ETH at around $1,890 per token, the whale started taking profit.



The whale first withdrew 12,906 ETH, valued at roughly $24.39 million at the time, from the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The tokens were then deposited into Lido, before the whale withdrew 7,000 ETH from it and redeposited the funds on Binance to sell them.

                        The Ethereum (ETH) price is swinging either side of the $3,000 level as traders monitor a spike in whale purchases and ask whether the cryptocurrency could soon be set for a rebound.On-chain-focused analytics X account @lookonchain reported on Wednesday that a whale recently accumulated $32.14 million in ETH.These tokens were withdrawn from Binance, before being sent to Aave to borrow $28.5 million in stablecoins.These stablecoins were then promptly used to buy more Ethereum.Increased buying activity from whales is almost always taken as a good sign for a cryptocurrency.Whales are often looked at as smart money that might have some market insight the rest of us don’t.Ether bulls will be hoping that accumulation from this whale marks the bottom of ETH’s recent dip.The Ethereum price, last at $3,020, is down 26% versus its early March highs.The Ethereum price has pulled 26% lower versus its March highs. Source: TradingViewEthereum Underperforming Bitcoin – Here’s Why
The downturn in the Ethereum price since March is mostly a result of broader market conditions turning less bullish.After hitting record highs above $73,000 in March on ETF demand optimism, easing ETF flows and macro headwinds have forced Bitcoin lower to the $62,000s.However, where Bitcoin is currently down around 15% versus its March peak, Ethereum’s pullback has been harsher.That can partially be explained by the fact that Ether is generally a higher beta asset versus Bitcoin. That’s to say, its likely to perform relatively better in times of risk-on and relatively worse in times of risk-off.But its also likely due to the pricing out of optimism that spot Ethereum ETFs will soon gain approval.The SEC is widely expected to reject these ETF applications this month as it probes crypto firms for evidence that Ethereum might be a security.However, given these rejections are now widely expected, this is unlikely to have much market impact.
Ethereum Price Prediction – Where Next for ETH?
While whale activity has some hoping the Ethereum price could soon rebound, technical analysis suggests the outlook remains fragile.The Ethereum price remains locked within a downward trend channel that has been in play since March.It has also broken to its 50 and 100DMAs. A recovery to the $3,200 area is plausible, but this is a very strong area of resistance.With the next leg of the crypto market rally unlikely to take hold anytime soon, Ether could continue to struggle.While whale activity has some hoping the Ethereum price could soon rebound, technical analysis suggests the outlook remains fragile. Source: TradingViewA test of support at $2,700 in the coming weeks is very plausible, especially if Bitcoin dips back under $60,000.This is roughly in line with where the 200DMA resides and so should be a strong zone of support.
Ether Turns Inflationary as Ethereum Fees Drop 
The recent Dencun upgrade has reduced Ethereum fees by as much as 4x, according to CryptoQuant data.That has substantially reduced the cryptocurrency’s burn rate, with the Ether supply recently turning inflationary as a result.This has concerned some ETH traders. Many see continued ETH deflation as a key value proposition for holding the cryptocurrency.However, these traders must remember the chilling impact that high fees has on Ethereum’s adoption.If Ethereum is going to retain its spot as the dominant smart-contract-enabled blockchain in web3, lowering fees is key.After all, why would everyday users choose to transact on Ethereum if fees are 100x higher than on other chains.
ETH Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
Crypto investors looking for investments with greater upside potential than ETH should check out presale investing.Web3 projects and protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to raise funds for development.If presale investors can find a good project that gains traction in the market, they can book exponential gains.One project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is Mega Dice Casino.This already well-established crypto casino has launched a presale of its utility token, DICE.DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can generate passive income via DICE staking.The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.The project has already raised $870,000. Potential investors may want to move quickly, as the DICE price will rise when the $1 million milestone is hit.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Is Plummeting-Here’s Why - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin just got much easier to mine—should we be worried? Data from BTC.com shows that Bitcoin mining difficulty plunged nearly 6% to 83.1 trillion hashes yesterday. The higher the mining difficulty—measured through the energy and resources that miners use to keep the network secure—the more difficult Bitcoin is to attack.A drop in difficulty, therefore, isn’t a good sign. But it’s expected, at least in the short term, experts told Decrypt.“If there isn’t enough margin for miners to make a profit, they turn off, which causes the hash rate to go down,” Luxor mining pool CEO Nick Hansen told Decrypt.“Hash rate” refers to the speed at which a miner produces hashes—the process of encrypting data. This model is known as proof-of-work, a key differentiator for Bitcoin. Bitcoin last month underwent a quadrennial event called the halving. The update cut miner rewards in half from 6.25 BTC for each block they process to 3.125 BTC. Miners—who produce new coins and keep the network ticking along by processing new transactions—now have to work harder to stay in the game. And with smaller rewards but harder work, a lot of miners are closing up shop altogether. Nishant Sharma, founder at BlocksBridge Consulting—a research and communications strategy firm dedicated to the Bitcoin mining industry—said that this is what usually happens after a halving. “After a Bitcoin halving, the drop in mining rewards leads less efficient miners to unplug their machines,” he said. “This self-adjusting feature favors leaner operations, as remaining miners receive increased rewards due to the reduced difficulty,” said Sharma.Scott Norris, CEO of mining firm Optiminer, concurred: “This is a normal occurrence after a halving event and healthy for the network and the well positioned miners,” he said.“The miners who planned properly will grow or the ones who turned off will get newer tech and find cheaper energy while everyone waits for the price to reflect the halving,” Norris added. “Either way, the network will continue to grow.”The price of Bitcoin is also playing a part in the drop in mining difficulty: the asset touched a new all-time high of $73,737 last month but today stands at $62,506, a drop of 15%, according to CoinGecko. If the asset were priced higher, mining the asset would be more profitable, rewards for miners would be higher and more would be able to stay in business. But a declining BTC price makes this more difficult, compounding the effects of the halving.Still, Norris says this isn't a surprise—and neither is the lull in the market.“It always happens this way,” said Norris. “Historically, it’ll be late in the year before we see much price rise [for Bitcoin].”Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin (BTC) on Verge of Losing $60,000, Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready for It? Solana (SOL) Forms Reversal Pattern

Bitcoin is currently on the brink of dropping below the $60,000 level, a significant psychological and technical level for the cryptocurrency. As observed on the chart, a descending trendline is clearly applying downward pressure, guiding Bitcoin into forming lower lows. This pattern suggests that the downward momentum might continue in the near term.The current market dynamics show Bitcoin's price being squeezed by this descending trendline. Every attempt to push upwards meets resistance, leading to lower highs — a classic indicator of a continuing downtrend. Notably, the volume of trades has been decreasing, which typically indicates a weakening of the current trend and potentially sets the stage for a trend reversal. However, the current signals suggest that the market is not yet ready to reverse to being bullish.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAdding to the complexity of the movements is the potential formation of a higher low, which could be the first sign of an impending shift in trend. This is a critical observation as it could signify that although the overarching trend is bearish, there is some buying interest at lower levels that prevents further drops, providing a temporary floor for Bitcoin's price.The immediate future of Bitcoin's price largely depends on its interaction with the trendline and key moving averages. Currently, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) sits around $65,000, acting as potential upper resistance in case of any bullish reversal.Shiba Inu hits thresholdShiba Inu is currently navigating a critical phase as it hovers around a strong support level at approximately 0.00002260.The current chart formation presents a descending triangle pattern, a typical bearish signal in technical analysis, suggesting that SHIB could be under significant selling pressure. This pattern is forming just as SHIB tests its support, making the 0.00002260 level crucial for determining its short-term trajectory. A break below this could lead to a test of the next major support at the 0.00002100 level, aligning closely with the 100-day EMA. It often acts as a dynamic support in downtrends, providing a potential rebound zone for the price.Conversely, the immediate resistance is located around 0.00002400. Overcoming this level could invalidate the bearish pattern and possibly trigger a short-term bullish reversal. However, the convergence of the EMAs above this price point may complicate any upward movements, potentially capping gains and adding to the volatility.Given these dynamics, the situation with Shiba Inu remains highly uncertain. The descending triangle, combined with the convergence of moving averages and key support and resistance levels, suggests that SHIB could experience increased volatility in the near future. This unpredictability makes it a risky asset for traders and investors at this time.Is Solana aiming at reversal?Solana is currently showing signs of a potential reversal pattern. As it approaches the 100-day EMA we might see a reversal. However, it is important to note that this EMA has not been tested before, which brings a degree of uncertainty about its reliability as a support.The current price movement has brought SOL closer to what might be seen as a critical juncture. The nearest solid support level is established around $128, but this level has already been breached once, adding to the unpredictability of its strength in holding future dips. Such breaches can undermine confidence in the support level, suggesting that it may not be as robust as hoped.Despite these concerns, there are positive signs in the market dynamics. The descending volume indicates that selling pressure is diminishing, which could mean that sellers are getting exhausted. This scenario typically sets the stage for buyers to regain control and potentially drive the price upwards. However, the volume profile does not support the formation of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, a common bullish reversal indicator, casting some doubts on the immediacy of a bullish turnaround.In the midterm, if buyers can capitalize on the reduced selling pressure, there is a chance for Solana to make significant gains.

$300M Scandal Rocks Binance: Fired Investigators Accuse DWF Labs Of Manipulative Trading | Bitcoinist.com


								Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has come under scrutiny after a Wall Street Journal report revealed that the platform fired its top investigators following their allegations of wash trading involving a top VIP client, DWF Labs. 
Binance Refutes Wash Trading Allegations
The report alleges that DWF Labs conducted over $300 million in wash trades across seven tokens in 2023, manipulating the price of Yield Guild Games’ native token, YGG and other cryptocurrencies. 
However, Binance has refuted the allegations, stating that the transactions were proprietary and did not constitute manipulation. The exchange also accused the head of the monitoring team of collaboration with DWF’s competitors, leading to his termination.

In response to the Wall Street Journal report, Binance affirmed its strict market surveillance program and commitment to combating market abuse. The exchange stated that it does not tolerate such practices and has offboarded nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of over $2.5 trillion for violating its terms of use in the past three years. 
Binance emphasized the importance of maintaining “neutrality and unbiased investigation”, even in the face of claims made by market-making firms against their competitors. The exchange aims to ensure healthy competition in the industry and protect users from market manipulation.
DWF Labs Strongly Denies Accusations
Binance heavily relies on VIP customers, who contribute two-thirds of the platform’s total trading volume. The report highlights a similar incident involving the Tron Foundation last summer, which Binance investigated. In response to the WSJ report on DWF, Binance co-founder He Yi said:  
We have been monitoring the MM market and we are very strict. We do not target any fund; There is competition among MMs, and the means are very shady. You can buy PR as you like, but don’t get close to me. We will ensure our own fairness and not participate, but we will also report truthfully to the monitor and other regulatory authorities.
DWF Labs, the VIP client accused of wash trading, has responded to the allegations, asserting that they operate with the highest integrity, transparency, and ethics standards. 
The company stated that the recent allegations reported in the press are “unfounded and distort the facts.” DWF Labs remains committed to supporting its partners across the crypto ecosystem and vows to report all relevant situations to regulatory authorities truthfully.

In sum, the firing of Binance’s top investigators after they alleged wash trading by VIP client DWF Labs has raised concerns about market manipulation and the exchange’s handling of such incidents. 
Binance maintains that the transactions in question were proprietary and not manipulative while accusing the head of the monitoring team of collaboration with DWF’s competitors. 
As the investigation unfolds, the cryptocurrency industry will closely watch how Binance addresses these allegations and upholds its commitment to market surveillance and user protection.

Base set for ‘material share’ of SocialFi activity: Franklin Templeton

Trillion-dollar asset manager Franklin Templeton suggests “Base Season” has arrived with the rise of Social Finance (SocialFi) apps, with Base leading other Ethereum layer 2s in the vertical. “[It is] positioning itself well to capture a material share of SocialFi activity and remain a leader in the Ethereum L2 sector going forward,” Franklin Templeton said in a May report.About 46% of transactions related to SocialFi are on Base, which has increasingly stripped market share away from the BNB Chain and Polygon in recent months, according to one of the charts provided by Franklin Templeton.Franklin Templeton said support from Coinbase has played a key role in Base capturing nearly half of the SocialFi market share to date.Friend.tech is perhaps the most notable SocialFi application built on Base, which allows creators to connect and monetize their content through “key” shares or “tokenized attention.”“Base has hit a homerun in the world of SocialFi,” which will remain a “key vertical to watch” for Base’s adoption and growth over the long haul, Franklin Templeton said.Source: Franklin TempletonTheta Network, Decentralized Social, Fantasy.top and Steem are among the other popular SocialFi blockchains and protocols. Franklin Templeton highlighted the recent memecoin mania as another key contributor to Base’s rise in network activity.

Biden Is "Destroying Crypto": Cardano Founder Lambasts Admin - DailyCoin


        
President Joe Biden has vowed to shut down Congress’s efforts to open banks to crypto customers.



Charles Hoskinson launched a tirade against the Biden administration.



The Cardano founder claimed that a vote for Biden was a vote against crypto.
The US crypto industry has been in a multi-year intense battle with the Biden administration, trying to navigate the nation’s murky and tangled web of legislation and its alleged campaign against digital assets.Hope glimmered for the industry after the US House of Representatives passed a groundbreaking resolution on Wednesday to overturn the SEC’s crypto accounting guidance, which had barred banks from handling crypto customers. However, before Congress could celebrate, US President Joe Biden vowed to stay the course with his anti-crypto stance, pledging to veto any pro-crypto legislation.
Appalled and angered by President Biden’s statement, many influential figures in the industry voiced their concerns, including Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, who accused the current administration of hurting the US’ standing in the global crypto arena.A Vote For Biden is a Vote Against Crypto, Charles Hoskinson“Please understand the intent of this administration is to destroy the American cryptocurrency industry,” Charles Hoskinson warned in his latest social media post, expressing his deep-seated concerns about President Biden’s pledge to derail a major development for the crypto industry. The Cardano founder was visibly upset by President Biden’s statement, promising to veto the US House of Representatives’s decision to potentially allow banks to deal with crypto customers by rejecting the SAB 121 legislation that the SEC issued prohibiting banks from dealing with crypto.In his tirade, Hoskinson accused the current US administration of perpetuating lies throughout the years and hurting the crypto industry in “every way possible.” The crypto pundit highlighted a series of enforcement actions by the White House, including restricting access to bank accounts and deliberately avoiding clarity to impede legislative processes.
“A vote for Biden is a vote against cryptocurrencies,” Charles Hoksinson claimed. The contentious founder lamented that it caused him a great degree of heartburn to witness an industry with the potential to create hundreds of thousands of jobs being pushed beyond borders, despite many of the underlying technologies originating on US soil.Hoskinson Worries Biden is Driving Crypto Out of US SoilIn his video, the Cardano Founder highlighted the US’s pivotal role in inventing cryptography and algorithms, emphasizing the abundance of talent and infrastructure within the country. However, despite these advantages, President Biden’s staunch anti-crypto stance threatens to harm the industry and the 53 million Americans holding cryptocurrencies severely.The rowdy pundit cautioned President Biden’s hostile policies could trigger a brain drain from the country and potentially allow rivals like China and the Middle East to leverage or weaponize crypto against the US. However, while President Biden’s administration doubles down on the crypto industry, his major rival, former President Donald Trump, is embracing the asset class with open arms. Trump Rubber Stamps Crypto During a recent gala dinner Q&A with collectors of his “Mugshot Edition” NFT collection, Trump expressed his support for the besieged US crypto industry. When asked what he would do about firms leaving the US over regulatory hostility, Trump responded, “We’ll stop it because I don’t want that.” "If we're going to embrace [the crypto industry] then we have to let them be here," Trump added. During the session, the former president also took the opportunity to mock President Biden’s understanding of digital assets while drawing a line between both parties by distinguishing Democrats as the anti-crypto party. In contrast, Trump endorsed cryptocurrencies by saying, “I’m good with it.”Basking in the spotlight, President Trump delivered a parting shot: "If you're in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump."On the Flipside
Crypto policy is not a concern for most voting Americans, as just 17% have invested in digital assets.



Under the U.S. Constitution, the House could override President Biden’s veto with a two-thirds majority vote.



Donald Trump’s campaign has announced that it will also accept cryptocurrency in donations.
Why This MattersThe crypto industry has been subjected to several punitive enforcement actions and regulatory crackdowns in recent years. President Biden’s pledge to veto pro-crypto legislation reveals Democrats’ public disdain for digital assets.

                        Georgia’s security service has claimed overseas actors are using crypto to fund a spate of protests that have divided the country.Thousands have taken to the streets in the capital Tbilisi in recent days, with smaller protests also taking place in the cities of Zugdidi, Kutaisi, and Gori.But the State Security Service of Georgia (SSSG) says the masterminds behind the protests are using “funds from abroad.”And, the SSSG claimed, protest organizers are making use of crypto in a bid to “cover their tracks.”
Georgia Protests Are ‘Crypto Funded,’ Says Intelligence Agency
The SSSG is Georgia’s state intelligence agency. Per the Georgian media outlet Ambebi, the SSSG said that “a group of people” based overseas is “planning and organizing rallies in the Georgian capital.”The agency claimed that these individuals want to engineer “destructive and violent incidents.” And the SSSG said:
“Citizens of Georgia who are based abroad – in particular a certain group of Georgians participating in the hostilities in Ukraine – in taking part in criminal plans.”
The agency accused these overseas “agents” of plotting to sabotage Tbilisi’s traffic networks.The agency said agents also plan to barricade access to the roads around government institutions and strategic facilities.It claimed these same individuals plan to block railway networks and “set up encampments” outside law enforcement agencies. The SSSG explained:
“[The masterminds] funds are receiving funds from abroad. And they are using cryptocurrency, in many cases, to cover their tracks.”
The SSSG thinks that “foreign instructors” visited Georgia “at the end of April of this year” to conduct “cryptocurrency transaction-related training sessions.”It said that “the organizers” of the protests “received instructions on how to secretly receive funding” for their “radical actions.”Bill Sparks Fury in Georgia
Protests have raged in Tbilisi in recent days, with many taking to the streets to vent their anger about a so-called “foreign agents” bill.Many have taken to the streets waving EU flags, apparently concerned that their nation’s bid to join the European Union could result in failure.The Georgian parliament is poised to vote on a bill that proposes labeling all political and civil society NGOs that receive over 20% of their funding from overseas “foreign agents.”Critics say the bill is a copy of a Russian law that seeks to identify “foreign agents.” Moscow parliamentarians have accused Western-backed “foreign agents” of using crypto from abroad to fund their activities in Russia.EU Membership Plans in Jeopardy?
An article in the British magazine The Spectator claimed:
“Such a law would [..] dash any hope of Georgia joining the EU. This week, in reaction to the government’s heavy-handed attempts to disperse the protestors, more than 30 members of the European Parliament called on Brussels to withdraw Georgia’s EU membership candidate status.”
The bill has become a political hot potato in Georgia, where President Salome Zourabichvili says she intends to veto the bill.The nation’s parliament, however, has the power to overrule a Zourabichvili veto.Western media commentators have claimed that the result of the vote could “mean revolution” for Georgia.Government officials have claimed the protestors are agitated by Western-backed groups seeking a “revolution.”The SSSG said that the protesters’ goal is to spark violence and “provoke law enforcement agencies.”The agency warned of the danger of “panic, stampedes, serious injuries, and casualties” should the demonstrations continue.Crypto remains popular in Georgia, as does crypto mining. In 2018, the nation began exploring plans to adopt blockchain technology in government operations.

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) to Skyrocket 8,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 8,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SHIDOGE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Doge Hybrid (SHIDOGE) could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Shiba Doge Hybrid on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for SHIDOGE by entering its contract address – 797CmcxqkLZaSjMd7MdyNZ9swuSzaGdYWkJ65jehiXWa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIDOGE.

If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin When Donald Trump Said The Crypto's Value Was 'Based On Thin Air,' Here's How Much You'd Have Now - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump spoke positively about cryptocurrency during a speech Wednesday, May 8, 2024. The comments from Trump are creating optimism for the crypto market under a potential re-election of Trump in the 2024 presidential election.Trump Flips On Crypto Opinion: While Trump praised the cryptocurrency market during his speech, also saying his campaign would accept crypto for donations and pro-crypto voters should support him, he hasn't always been supportive of cryptocurrency."If you like crypto in any form … if you're in favor of crypto you'd better vote for Trump," the former president said to the crowd on May 8.Trump has been known for being vocal about a number of topics and people over the years, often sharing those opinions on social media platforms. One of the many sectors Trump has been outspoken about is the cryptocurrency sector.In 2019, Trump spoke out about Bitcoin BTC/USD and cryptocurrency."I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air," Trump tweeted on July 11, 2019.Trump also went on to call out Libra, a virtual currency that Meta Platforms Inc META was working on at the time."If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks."Trump said the real currency is the U.S. dollar, which he added would remain the "most dominant currency anywhere in the world."Investing $1,000 in Bitcoin: On the day Trump blasted Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the leading cryptocurrency traded between $11,158.92 and $12,144.62.Based on the high of the day, an investor could have purchased 0.0823 BTC at the time of Trump's tweet.That $1,000 investment would be worth $5,138.70 today based on a price of $62,438.61 for Bitcoin at the time of writing. This represents a return of 413.9%.At its peak of $73,750.07 set in March 2024, the investment would have been worth $6,069.63, up 506.9% from the time of Trump's tweet.Related Link: EXCLUSIVE: Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is Key 2024 Election Issue For Young VotersWhy It's Important: While he criticized Bitcoin in 2019, Trump would later use the power of cryptocurrency to launch his own non-fungible token collection. Trump has now launched three NFT collections since December 2022. Many on social media were quick to point out the previous comments against cryptocurrency by the former president at the time his NFTs launched.The price of Bitcoin soared in 2023 and 2024, rebounding from a 2022 year that saw a drop in the price due to volatility from the bankruptcies of several cryptocurrency trading platforms.The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 increased optimism for the crypto sector and helped kick off new all-time highs for Bitcoin months later.Skeptics of Bitcoin such as Trump have been proven wrong over the years with the price of Bitcoin soaring to new highs and gains outpacing other assets.This article was previously published by Benzinga and has been updated.Read Next: If You Invested $1,000 In Meta Platforms Stock When Donald Trump Said Facebook Was Always Anti-Trump, Here’s How Much You’d Have NowPhotos: Shutterstock

How Wall Street scored big in the FTX bankruptcy mess | Cryptopolitan

Wall Street never misses a beat, even in the throes of cryptocurrency chaos. When FTX, once a titan in the crypto exchange world, stumbled into bankruptcy in November 2022, savvy investors from the traditional finance realm were already positioning themselves to profit.Opportunistic Moves Amid CrisisIn the immediate aftermath of FTX’s collapse, the price of claims against the company plummeted, trading for mere pennies on the dollar. Veteran investment firms like Attestor, Farallon, Oaktree, and Silver Point capitalized on the turmoil. These players, accustomed to the high-stakes game of distressed assets, began scooping up claims for as low as 20 cents on the dollar. They wagered on the eventual recovery of FTX’s assets, a bet that would require patience and a keen eye for timing.As the bankruptcy proceedings unfolded, the task at hand was clear: liquidate every asset FTX had touched—from digital tokens to venture capital stakes—and convert them into cash. This massive sell-off coincided with a surge in cryptocurrency values, inflating the returns on these distressed assets. Before long, claims that once seemed nearly worthless were trading close to their full value.Despite the complexity of the situation, including competing claims from government entities like the Department of Justice and the IRS, the restructuring plan moved swiftly. Under the guidance of John Ray III, the newly appointed CEO tasked with navigating the bankruptcy, FTX managed to outline a path to significant recovery for its creditors. The stark contrast to prolonged liquidations of the past, such as those following the Enron and Lehman Brothers scandals, highlighted the efficiency of the process this time around.The Windfall in WaitingPatience paid off handsomely for those who had the foresight to invest in FTX’s beleaguered claims. The total face value of these claims was around $12 billion, but with the assets liquidated and the market rebound, total recoveries are projected to surpass $15 billion. This represents a staggering gain, largely benefiting the few who dared to bet against the tide.Meanwhile, the typical FTX account holders faced mixed emotions. Although the plan proposed a return of 118 cents on the dollar based on the cryptocurrency prices at their lowest in 2022, these individuals missed out on the dramatic price rallies that followed. Their recovery, substantial as it may seem, did not fully capitalize on the market’s upturn.The narrative of FTX’s fall and partial redemption is a testament to Wall Street’s acumen in navigating financial disasters. While the crypto community had heralded platforms like FTX as pioneers of financial democratization, the old guards of finance—armed with experience and capital—were the ones who emerged in a position to dictate terms.Despite the resolution appearing favorable, with almost all small creditors set to recover fully, the larger story is the reminder of traditional finance’s resilience and strategic depth. The swift and strategic actions by investment firms amidst FTX’s collapse illustrate a broader theme: in the world of high finance, timing, and experience often triumph over turmoil.As the final details of the bankruptcy plan await court approval, stakeholders from across the financial spectrum are watching closely. FTX’s saga is far from a solitary event. Rather, it’s a clear indicator of how the financial establishment adapts and thrives, even as the ground changes beneath it.

EigenLayer's EIGEN Airdrop Might Signal Demise of Once-Popular 'Points'

But when it comes to protecting investors and offering transparency, Robert Leshner, the founder of Compound and Robot Ventures, an investor in EigenLayer developer Eigen Labs, thinks points are the worst of all worlds. "The entire root of investor protection is making sure that there's not an information asymmetry between the investors and the sponsors. And points create the largest information asymmetry that exists in crypto," he said. "Everything is at the team's discretion, and users and investors are just praying that they get treated right by the team."

Bitcoin could soon ‘BLOW higher’ on bullish candle hammer: Glassnode execs

Bitcoin (BTC) traders are pointing to a “bullish candle hammer” that has emerged on Bitcoin’s weekly price chart — which they say could signal a possible reversal of the past month’s downtrend.“Bitcoin still looks like it is about to BLOW higher,” market intelligence firm Glassnode founders Jan Happel and Yana Allemann wrote on their shared X account “Negentropic” in a post on May 9. They noted that the Bitcoin price chart closed on May 5 with a bullish hammer — the name given when there is a small body above a thin long line, referred to as a “wick.”“Bitcoin weekly bullish hammer candle…reversal is imminent,” added pseudonymous crypto trader Mister Crypto.Source: Mister CryptoIt could signal a reversal as traders pushed prices down significantly during the 7 days, but buyers managed to aggressively close it near the candle open, suggesting a shift in sentiment.“This week’s pullback hence seems like a healthy correction before higher. Corrections often pull back either 50% or 61.8% of the previous impulse move,” Negentropic said.Pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital explained that long downside wicks have often been key to ending more than 20% corrections for Bitcoin “for the past year and a half,” in a May 9 X post.Bitcoin closed the week ending May 5 at $64,109, as per CoinMarketCap data. A 20% increase from this level would take it beyond its current all-time high, reaching $76,822.At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s price is $62,830.Bitcoin's price is down 8.93% over the last 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCapHowever, crypto trader Mags anticipates that it may come up slightly short of that estimate, though not by much.“If price holds the current levels, the next stop would be a range high of $72,000,” they stated to their 73,300 X followers on May 9.Related: Bitcoin distribution ‘danger zone’ over, analysts sayAlthough this single candle pattern is seen as a bullish signal to traders, most wait for confirmation of the change of direction in the following candle.

Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) Will Explode 16,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 16,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




ANDTATE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Andrew Tate Coin.



Currently, Andrew Tate Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. 



To buy ANDTATE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Andrew Tate Coin by entering its contract address – Cp7qyqdzXAqF7fqKXzS8LwTE7JQvh2V3vYGnDdx6j4ii – in the receiving field.




ANDTATE currently has a market cap of just under $20,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. 



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Marathon Digital misses Q1 estimates on bad weather, utility failures

Bitcoin (BTC) miner Marathon Digital missed Wall Street analysts’ revenue estimates in its first quarter 2024 results, blaming bad weather and equipment failures.Marathon’s Q1 revenues increased 223% year-on-year to $165.2 million in results shared on May 9 — but it still missed the $193.9 million estimate from investment analyst firm Zacks by 14.80%.The firm mined 2,811 BTC over the quarter, currently worth $176.7 million, a 28% bump from a year ago but down 34% from the 4,242 BTC mined in Q4 2023.On a May 9 earnings call, Marathon CEO Fred Thiel said its production was marred by “unexpected equipment failures, predominantly transformers that our third-party hosted sites, utility company transmission line maintenance and a higher than anticipated weather-related curtailments across multiple sites.”In its earnings report, Marathon said the bad weather hit its Garden City site in central Texas and “other sites.” It acquired the Texas site on April 2.He added it “mitigated a number of these issues” and was operating at “a record high” of 27 exahashes per second (EH/s)Thiel clung to its expectation that it would ramp up to 50 EH/s by the end of the year which it bumped up in late April from its prior target of 35 to 37 EH/s. The BTC miner’s first-quarter net income was up 184% year-on-year to $337.2 million, a $1.26 earnings per share that topped the $0.02 Zacks estimate.However, its income was boosted by new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rules that Marathon adopted allowing it to record the $488.8 million quarterly paper gain it had on the 17,320 BTC it held as of March 31.Related: Digital Currency Group first-quarter revenue jumps 51% despite GBTC outflowsMarathon Digital (MARA) shares closed 2.19% down on May 9 at $19.65 and fell an additional 1% in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance.MARA hit an after-hours session low of $18.60 before recovering to $19.45.

Bitcoin & Ethereum Decouple From Trad Markets, What It Means


								Data shows that Bitcoin and Ethereum correlate little to traditional markets, implying that cryptocurrency is forging its destiny.
Bitcoin & Ethereum Have Been The Master Of Their Fates Recently
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the correlation between BTC and ETH with traditional markets and commodities has been close to zero recently.
The “correlation” here refers to the correlation coefficient (r) from statistics, a metric that tracks how connected two quantities have been over a given period.

When the value of this metric is greater than zero for any two assets, it means that there exists some positive correlation between their prices, implying that the assets are moving in tandem. The closer this value is to 1, the tighter the relationship.
On the other hand, the indicator’s negative value suggests that while there is some correlation between the two, it’s a negative one, as the price of one asset reacts to movements in the other by moving oppositely to it. In this case, the extreme where the correlation is the strongest is -1.
The correlation coefficient standing at or near zero suggests no relationship between the assets. In statistics, the variables are said to be independent in this case.
Now, here is a table that shows how the 30-day correlation between the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum, looks like against some of the traditional assets:

The data for the correlation matrix of BTC and ETH | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
As is visible above, Bitcoin and Ethereum have appeared to have a low correlation to these assets over the past month. Out of these, the coins are the most correlated to the S&P 500, with the coefficient standing at 0.4 for BTC and 0.49 for ETH.
Thus, this would mean that ETH is slightly more correlated to the S&P 500 than BTC. Like this, ETH also has a more prominent relationship with the others on the list compared to BTC, although it’s still not strongly correlated to any of them.
The low correlation coefficient with the traditional markets suggests that cryptocurrencies have been running more or less independently in the past month.

Generally, correlation can be something to watch when an investor is looking to add an asset to their portfolio. Assets that have a high correlation make up for poor diversifying options, as they would either mimic a similar performance (positive coefficient) or counteract each other (negative coefficient).
Since Bitcoin and Ethereum lack any solid correlation to traditional markets and commodities, the two coins may be viable options for traditional investors to add to their portfolios.

BlockFi to shut down web platform, turn to Coinbase as distribution partner

Bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi said on May 9 that it would shut down its web platform by the end of May and rely primarily on Coinbase as a distribution partner.The change ensures that BlockFi Interest Account (BIA), Retail Loan, and Private Clients can continue to access withdrawals as part of the bankruptcy claims process.Crypto-eligible customers will be able to access funds in kind if they have an open or approved Coinbase account. The condition applies to crypto-eligible customers who did not withdraw crypto from BlockFi’s web platform by April 28 or did not verify their identity by May 10.Crypto-eligible customers who do not create a Coinbase account or cannot create one will instead receive funds in cash.BlockFi emphasized that it has not partnered with any other crypto companies for distributions and warned users of scams from bad actors claiming otherwise.BlockFi and Coinbase will contact users who are on file with instructions.BlockFi’s FTX fundsThe plan administrator in BlockFi’s bankruptcy case may perform future distributions through Coinbase, including those related to funds recovered from FTX.BlockFi was expected to receive nearly $875 million from FTX as of March. Only the first $250 million is prioritized, while the remainder depends on FTX’s ability to pay customers in its own case.BlockFi said that, without Coinbase’s involvement, the plan administrator would only be able to make cash distributions rather than crypto distributions going forward.BlockFi originally filed for halted withdrawals on Nov. 10, 2022, citing a “lack of clarity” around FTX’s separate bankruptcy as the reason for its own shutdown. Weeks later, BlockFi entered bankruptcy proceedings that revealed FTX as its second-largest creditor.BlockFi emerged from bankruptcy in October 2023 and began to pay users this year. FTX remains in bankruptcy proceedings.Mentioned in this articlePosted In: US, Bankruptcy

Grayscale Battling Outflows And Lower-Cost ETFs, Q1 Revenue Stays Flat At $156M


																Grayscale Investments, the issuer of one of the recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, saw flat revenues in the first quarter of the year due to its decision to maintain fees on its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). 
Grayscale Exceeds Expectations Despite Outflows
According to a shareholder letter from its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), the operator of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust recorded $156 million in revenue, showing little change from the previous quarter.

	Related Reading



Since the GBTC trust’s conversion to an ETF in January, Grayscale has seen outflows of about $17.4 billion as investors appear to have shifted their assets to new, lower-cost funds offered by BlackRock and Fidelity, the leaders in the US ETF race in terms of inflows recorded since January. 
While GBTC charges a 1.5% management fee, many of its competitors charge less than 0.3%, leading to outflows. In response, Grayscale announced plans in March to seek approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to spin off some of Grayscale’s assets into a new, lower-fee “Bitcoin Mini Trust.” 
Despite the outflows, the Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC exceeded Grayscale’s expectations. The firm had previously anticipated outflows due to increased competition under the ETF wrapper. Grayscale previously charged a 2% sponsorship fee before the trust was converted. 
The flat revenue was also attributed to higher average Bitcoin and Ethereum prices and a decrease in assets under management (AUM).
In contrast to Grayscale’s performance, all US spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a total net inflow of over $11 billion thus far. However, demand for these ETFs has recently declined amidst tightening financial conditions in the US, where the Federal Reserve (Fed) faces the challenge of addressing persistent inflation.
DCG Reports 11% Q1 Revenue Increase
Digital Currency Group, founded by Barry Silbert and the parent company of Grayscale, reported an 11% quarter-over-quarter increase in Q1 revenue to $229 million, primarily due to higher asset prices. 
However, revenue growth lagged behind Bitcoin’s price appreciation, which rose more than 60% during the same period. In its letter, DCG attributed this disparity to lower GBTC sponsor fees, redemptions, and steady mining revenues at its Foundry subsidiary.

Foundry, DCG’s mining subsidiary, experienced a sequential revenue increase of 35%, propelled by staking and equipment sales revenue. Meanwhile, Luno, the company’s crypto exchange subsidiary, witnessed a 46% quarter-over-quarter sales boost, driven by a significant surge in trading volume.

Australia’s Tax Office Targets 1.2 Million Crypto Users in Compliance Crackdown



                    

Australia’s tax authorities are stepping up their efforts to address tax compliance among cryptocurrency users, reflecting a global trend towards stricter regulation of digital assets.



The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is seeking detailed personal and transaction data from up to 1.2 million users of cryptocurrency exchanges. 




This initiative is part of a broader attempt to identify those who may have skirted tax obligations on their crypto trades, as detailed in a notice issued last month, which was obtained by Reuters.



The ATO’s data request includes not only basic identity information like users’ birth dates, but also extends to their social media accounts, phone numbers, and financial particulars such as wallet addresses, the types of coins traded, and associated bank account details. 



The notice explains that cryptocurrencies, unlike traditional foreign currencies, are considered taxable assets in Australia. 




This classification means that profits from cryptocurrency sales are subject to capital gains tax.



This move by the ATO coincides with significant profits in the cryptocurrency markets, highlighted by substantial increases in the values of major cryptocurrencies. 



Bitcoin, for instance, has seen a 44% increase since the start of the year, while Ether’s value has risen by 32%. 



Additionally, the market capitalization of other significant altcoins (excluding Bitcoin and Ether) has climbed over 27%, according to TradingView.




READ MORE: Bullish Momentum Looms: Bitcoin’s Price Eyeing Upsurge on Inverse Head-and-Shoulders Confirmation



The ATO notice points to the potential for using cryptocurrencies for tax evasion due to the possibility of purchasing crypto assets under false identities. 



This concern is not isolated to Australia, as similar regulatory actions are taking place globally. 



For example, the Canada Revenue Agency’s compliance branch director general, Sahil Behal, disclosed that the agency is conducting over 400 crypto-related audits and investigating numerous crypto investors to recover unpaid taxes. 



This action builds on the discovery of an estimated $39.5 million in unpaid taxes from the 2023-2024 fiscal year.



In Turkey, upcoming legislation expected later this year aims to establish a legal framework for taxing cryptocurrencies, recognizing the country’s position as a significant player in the crypto economy. 



Meanwhile, in the United States, there are proposals to increase the long-term capital gains tax rate to 44.6% for high earners, alongside a potential 25% tax on unrealized gains for extremely wealthy individuals. 



According to Matthew Walrath, founder of Crypto Tax Made Easy, despite these stringent proposals, they are unlikely to affect the vast majority of people, describing them as “a big, fat nothing burger” since they are still merely proposals.

Bitcoin’s Ordinals, Runes key to solving the mining subsidy problem: ViaBTC

Bitcoin transaction fees from applications such as Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20s will be key to making sure miners stick around even as more halving events occur, according to a cryptocurrency mining pool.“[The Bitcoin network’s] evolution has led to an expanding array of use cases and a growing user base [which] has significantly impacted miners’ fee income from on-chain transactions,” ViaBTC told Cointelegraph in a recent interview.Prior to the Ordinals protocol’s launch in January 2023, miners relied on peer-to-peer transaction fees to accompany the block subsidy — which halves every 210,000 blocks and thus has an “indisputable” impact on miners’ revenue over the long haul, ViaBTC said.Mining revenue can also increase with a rise in Bitcoin’s (BTC) price, but further development at the application layer will increase network activity, broaden its utility and thereby compensate miners handsomely, ViaBTC explained.ViaBTC experienced this first hand on April 20 when it mined the highly sought-after halving block, at block 840,000, which came with a record-setting 37.6 BTC transaction fee — worth $2.4 million at the time.The reward, which totaled 40.7 BTC when factoring in the new 3.125 BTC block subsidy, came from memecoin and nonfungible token enthusiasts competing to inscribe “rare satoshis” and fungible tokens via the new Runes token standard, which launched at the halving block. Source: 10x ResearchViaBTC told Cointelegraph it had a “premonition” that transaction fees would eventually break the 30, 40, 50 BTC barrier but didn’t expect they would be the beneficiaries of such a massive reward — let alone at the halving block. While Bitcoin miners cashed in an eye-popping $78.3 million on halving day, they’ve also made more from fees than Ethereum stakers and Uniswap liquidity providers in nine of the last 20 days since the halving, according to Crypto Fees.Fees by blockchains and protocols on April 20. Source: Crypto FeesBitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, predicted that transaction fees would eventually become miners’ main compensation source as the block subsidy halves, ViaBTC noted.Related: Bitcoin post-halving price consolidation could last 2 months — Bitfinex“If these transactions find broader utility in the future and make significant technological advancements, they may garner increased attention and recognition,” ViaBTC added.However, Ordinals inscriptions, Runes and BRC-20s have seen several rises and falls in popularity since each protocol launched, which has brought about some instability in miner revenue.ViaBTC has endured three halving events since it started operating in 2016, with block 840,000 being the 37,534th block that it had mined in its 2,900-day existence.The mining pool’s hash rate is sourced from miners in 118 countries.Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?

Bitcoin ETF Issuer WisdomTree Introduces Prime App In NY, Gains Approval For New Crypto Offerings | Bitcoinist.com


								One of the issuers of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, WisdomTree, has announced the expansion of its WisdomTree Prime app to users in New York. 

Expanded Custody And Stablecoin Services
This development closely follows WisdomTree’s recent achievement of a New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) charter, granting the company the status of a limited-purpose trust company under the New York Banking Law. 
This charter enables the asset manager to custody digital assets, including offering digital wallet services, issuing and exchanging DFS-approved stablecoins, and managing stablecoin reserves through its newly established entity, WisdomTree Digital Trust Company.
According to the asset manager’s announcement, the trust charter and added authorities enable WisdomTree Digital Trust Company to provide increased customer protection, particularly regarding asset safekeeping. 
WisdomTree Prime App And Visa Debit Card Make Joint Debut In NY
The launch of the WisdomTree Prime app in New York coincides with the recent introduction of the WisdomTree Prime Visa Debit Card issued by Stride Bank. 
According to the Bitcoin ETF issuer, this card will allow users to purchase with their available wallet balance wherever Visa is accepted, effectively bridging personal finance and digital asset investing. 

Will Peck, Head of Digital Assets at WisdomTree, expressed his excitement about the company’s accomplishments:
Since our initial entry into select states’ app stores last summer, we have gained significant momentum across various fronts, including the launch of new digital funds, payment capabilities, and collaborations with regulators like the New York State Department of Financial Services. Our aim is to empower consumers in utilizing digital assets in their everyday financial lives. We are excited to provide retail investors in New York with access to the app, as we recognize the rapid growth of the digital asset market in this region, which we expect to be highly influential for WisdomTree Prime.
In addition to New York, WisdomTree Prime has gone live in several other states, including Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Nevada, and Ohio, bringing the total number of states in which it is available to 41.

Tether slams Deutsche Bank over suggestion its stablecoin could fail

Stablecoin giant Tether has slammed Deutsche Bank over a newly released report suggesting that stablecoins — including its dollar-pegged token Tether (USDT) — could witness a “peso moment,” that would wreak havoc on the crypto industry. In a May 7 research report on stablecoins, Deutsche analysts cited the 2022 collapse of the Terraform Lab’s algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (TUSD) which saw at least $40 billion wiped from the market in a few days, as cause for wider criticism of dollar-pegged stablecoin products.From a study of 334 currency pegs from the last 223 years, analysts found that 49% of fixed currencies failed over the course of their median life span of approximately eight to ten years. 42% of European consumers believed stablecoins would fail eventually. Source: Deutsche BankThe analysts concluded that most of the pegged assets in the crypto space will experience significant “turbulence” stemming from speculative sentiment and eventually suffer some kind of de-pegging event. “While some may survive, most will likely fail, particularly due to the lack of transparency in stablecoin operations and vulnerability to speculative sentiment.”Deutsche analysts also noted Tether’s lack of transparency concerning its reserves and described the firm’s solvency status as “questionable.”However, Tether lashed out at Deutsche’s report, saying it “lacks clarity and substantial evidence” and relies on “vague assertions rather than rigorous analysis.”In comments shared with Cointelegraph, a Tether spokesperson said that while the report attempts to forecast the decline of stablecoins, it failed to “provide concrete data to support its claims.”“Moreover, its comparison to Terra, an algorithmic stablecoin, is misleading and irrelevant to the discussion on reserve-backed coins,” said Tether in response. “Questioning the credibility of any financial institution, especially one with Deutsche Bank's track record, seems ironic. Deutsche Bank's history of fines and penalties raises doubts about its own standing to critique others in the industry.”Related: Tokenizing money is the ‘greatest innovation’ after fiat — Tether co-founderTether has been the subject of criticism over the transparency of its reserves.However, the firm has released several financial attestations, which suggest the firm holds over $110 billion in fiat-denominated reserves — though some critics argue it’s not the same as a financial audit. Audits are conducted to look at data, risks, or compliance issues that may not have been known before the audit took place while an attestation is a more simple tool used to take a snapshot of certain data. In 2021, the New York Attorney General settled with Tether to pay an $18.5 million fine and barred it from practicing in the state for allegedly misrepresenting the degree to which its reserves were backed fiat collateral. Despite never releasing an official audit since the firm’s inception in 2014, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick says he believes Tether “has the money,” on hand.

Coinbase's Hidden Gem: Analysts See ‘Amazon-like’ Potential in Layer-2 Network Base | Cryptoglobe


                                
Cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise has recently shared analysis on the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), suggesting it could be in a similar position to Amazon before it exploded and became a near $2 trillion company.



According to Bitwise’s analysis there’s a “game-changer hidden in Coinbase’s recent earnings report,” namely its Ethereum layer-2 network Base that allows users to move funds on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible decentralized applications for next to no cost.



Coinbase reported net revenue of $1.6 billion in the first quarter of the year, seeing a rise of 72% quarter-on-quarter and 116% year-over-year, beating analyst estimates of $1.36 billion. Its trading revenue, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, rose 93%, while institutional trading revenue rose 105% and stablecoin revenue 15%.



Its blockchain rewards revenue rose 59% over the same period, with the firm’s total profits hitting $1.2 billion while total cash on hand rose to $7.1 billion. To Bitwise’s analysts, a “little-noticed crypto-native business line” they believe could be a game changer is Base itself, which account for 1% of the firm’s revenues in the first quarter.







They noted that when “something is much cheaper, faster, and easier to use, people are going to use more of it,” and added Base is the “fastest-growing Layer 2, with transactions rising 74% quarter-over-quarter in Q1.” Base, they added, processed 40% more transactions in April alone than in the whole first quarter, while Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong said the number of developers on it is surging.



As a result, Bitwise added, Base could be a “massive revenue generator for Coinbase, with extremely high gross margins.” Coinbase is a “sequencer” verifying transactions on the Layer-2 network, which batches them before posting them to the Ethereum mainnet.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Coinbase is the only sequencer on Base for now and as a result pocketed $15.5 million in fees in the first quarter of the year, out of $27.4 million Base users paid in transaction fees to use the network. In April, those fees accounted for $11 million of Coinbase’s revenue.



The analysts added:



If Base continues to grow, it could reliably deliver $10 million, $20 million, or more in profit to Coinbase each month. In the longer term, if Base becomes the primary network on which developers build applications, Coinbase could end up owning a core piece of crypto infrastructure. 



Bitwise further noted that some noted “this could put Coinbase in a similar position to Amazon,” as Amazon started off with selling books online before expanding, and now over half of its profits come from its cloud computing service Amazon Web Services.



Similarly, Coinbase could become a core infrastructure provider within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Latest Bitcoin Top Is Different From 2021 Peak, Analyst Explains Why


																An analyst has explained why the recent high in Bitcoin has experienced different market conditions than those observed during the 2021 bull run peak.
Bitcoin Liquidations Have Been Short-Dominated In Recent Market High
In a new post on X, on-chain analyst Checkmate pointed out how the latest 2024 high achieved following the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows has a major difference when compared to the 2021 peak.

	Related Reading



The difference lies in the trend registered on derivatives markets. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the dominance of long liquidations in the sector over the last few years.

The distribution of liquidations on derivatives market over the last few years | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X
“Liquidation” here naturally refers to the act of forceful closure that any derivatives market contract undergoes on an exchange when it accumulates losses of a certain degree.
The risk of a contract getting liquidated becomes higher, and the more volatile the asset price gets. During sharp rallies and crashes, huge amounts of liquidation can pile up in the market.
From the chart, it’s visible that as the rally in the cryptocurrency had occurred this year, the short holders had been taking a beating. This was only natural as surges pile up losses for these investors betting on a decline, so price growth as rapid as the one witnessed would have pushed many of these contracts toward liquidation.
Interestingly, the scale of the short dominance maintained throughout the run, implying that the investors didn’t quite believe the run would continue any further at every point of the rally, so they bet against it.
This has also remained true in the recent stagnation following the top, as short liquidations have outweighed the long ones even though the price has decreased.
As is apparent in the graph, the 2021 peaks saw a different trend. Longs were getting liquidated as Bitcoin topped out during both the first half of the 2021 peak and the second half.
In those periods, the investors had become too greedy and were only betting on the rise to continue even when the asset had slowed down. This greed appears to haven’t overtaken the market in the bull run.
While the current Bitcoin rally differs from the last one in this metric, analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post another indicator where the trend appears to be similar to that observed in previous peaks.

This indicator is the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), which basically tells us about the scale of dormant coin movement that’s happening in the market right now. It would appear that this metric had attained very high levels recently.

“Coin Days Destroyed has probably peaked,” says Maartunn. “Bitcoin’s price typically reaches its peak around the same time.” It should be noted that although this has been true for some of the tops, the 2021 peak took months to form after the metric peaked.

US House Opposes SEC’s Crypto Policy With New Resolution


								The US House of Representatives has voted for a resolution to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s 2022 bulletin on crypto custodian accounting.
US President Joe Biden released a statement opposing the resolution and revealing a possible veto if the bill passes the Senate.

Democrats And Republicans Join Forces Against The SEC
On May 8, 21 Democrat House Representatives joined 207 Republican Representatives to vote in favor of H.J.Res.109 to nullify the Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. The bulletin requires all custodians of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets to recognize these assets as a liability in their accounting books.
As reported by Bitcoinist, the rule has prevented US banks from holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it made their crypto business “non-viable.” Republican Congressman Mike Flood argued that “the SEC’s accounting standards for firms that custody crypto are unfair and hinder banks looking to provide such services.”


Wednesday’s vote was passed with 228 representatives in favor and 182 opposing it. The bill now awaits the Senate’s vote to be passed to the President’s desk. If approved, the resolution would allow financial institutions to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under viable requirements.
Fox Business Journalist Elizabeth Terret asserted that the bipartisan decision saw a “larger number of supporting House Democrats than expected.” However, the journalist considers that the bill “likely won’t pass the Senate or the President’s desk.”
SAB 121 has been greatly criticized by important figures like Patrick McHenry, the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee.
On Wednesday, the Committee’s Chair called the bulletin “one of the most glaring examples of the regulatory overreach that has defined Gary Gensler’s tenure at the SEC.” During his speech on the House floor, Chair McHenry remarked his support for the resolution, stating:

This bipartisan resolution is an essential effort to protect consumers and foster innovation in digital asset markets. It’s also critical to stop the SEC’s regulatory power grabs and efforts to circumvent the Administrative Procedure Act.

Senator Cynthia Lummis has also expressed disagreement with the “unnecessary” SAB 121 rule on different occasions. On May 1, the pro-crypto senator criticized the US government’s “overreach” on the industry, revealing her concerns over the Department of Justice (DOJ) “hyper-aggressive” arguments against the sector.
President Biden In Favor Of SEC’s Crypto Crackdown
After the news of the favorable vote by the US House Representatives, the White House addressed the matter. According to the statement, Biden’s administration “strongly opposes” the resolution’s passage.

The president considers the bill “disruptive” against the SEC’s “work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.”
Moreover, the statement claims that the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate regulations in the future could be “constrained” by invoking the Congressional Review Act.
The White House considers that “limiting” the SEC’s ability to regulate digital assets “would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.” Ultimately, the statement affirms that President Biden would veto the resolution if passed by the Senate.

Bitcoin price extended losses below the $62,000 and $61,200 levels. Finally, the bulls appeared near the $60,600 zone. A low was formed at $60,650 and the price is now correcting losses.
There was a move above the $61,200 and $62,000 resistance levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $65,500 swing high to the $60,650 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $62,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.
Bitcoin is now trading near $63,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Immediate resistance is near the $63,000 level. The first major resistance could be $63,200 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $65,500 swing high to the $60,650 low or the 100 hourly Simple moving average.

The next key resistance could be $64,350. A clear move above the $64,350 resistance might send the price higher. The main resistance now sits at $65,500. If there is a close above the $65,500 resistance zone, the price could continue to move up. In the stated case, the price could rise toward $67,500.
More Downsides In BTC?
If Bitcoin fails to climb above the $63,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $62,400 level.
The first major support is $62,000. If there is a close below $62,000, the price could start to drop toward $61,200. Any more losses might send the price toward the $60,600 support zone in the near term.
Technical indicators:
Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone.
Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.

                        Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital reportedly battled against “operational challenges” to produce record financial results in the first quarter of 2024.In its first-quarter earnings report, the firm reported producing 2,811 Bitcoins during the first quarter of 2024, compared to 4,242 in the last quarter of 2023, a decline of 33.73%.Marathon Digital reported revenues increased 223% to $165.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 from $51.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The firms’ energized hash rate which measures the computational power of a blockchain network, increased 142% to 27.8 EH/s in the first quarter of 2024 from 11.5 EH/s in the first quarter of 2023.Marathon Digital shared trading under the ticker “MARA” were down 2.19% at $19.56 at market close on Thursday.“During the first quarter of 2024, we doubled the size of our portfolio of digital asset compute, launched our first products and services to support the Bitcoin ecosystem, and we battled against operational challenges to produce record financial results,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and chief executive officer, a press release.Thiel explained in less than four months the mining firm initiated, closed, and integrated the acquisitions of its first three sites. Due to this, the firm doubled the size of its portfolio to 1.1 gigawatts of capacity, 54% of which is directly owned and operated by Marathon Digital.The firm said it had secured its first paying customers for MARA firmware and began building a sales pipeline for its two-phase immersion system.
HODL Strategy Helps Firm Gain Momentum
“Despite the operational challenges we faced in the first quarter, we were able to leverage our agility to redistribute equipment to newly acquired sites amidst ongoing repairs,” said Thiel. “When combined with our HODL strategy, these actions allowed us to capitalize on Bitcoin’s positive momentum and produce record financial results for the quarter,” added Thiel.The firm went on to grow its topline to $165.2 million, improved net income to a record $337.2 million, and generated adjusted EBITDA of $528.8 million.
Mining Companies Experience Production Decline
Earlier this year, several public mining companies reported decreases in Bitcoin production ranging from 6% to 12% for April following the halving event. Major Bitcoin miners, including Bitfarms, Cipher, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Riot, and Terawulf, were all affected, according to a report from The Miner Mag.However, the report said that the robust Bitcoin fee market briefly mitigated the impact of the halving on these companies. Hut 8, one of the prominent Bitcoin mining companies in North America, has reported a significant decline in its proprietary production for April. In their monthly update released on Monday, Hut 8 disclosed that they mined 148 BTC with their proprietary mining fleet during April, marking a 36% decrease compared to March.

Solana NFTs: Traders surge 111%, but sales are down - Why? - AMBCrypto



The number of NFT traders on Solana recently rallied to a multi-month high.
The steady decline in SOL’s price has led to a fall in NFT sales volume.

The daily count of non-fungible token [NFT] traders on Solana [SOL] climbed to a multi-month high on the 8th of May, data from CryptoSlam showed.
According to the NFT data tracker, 123,426 traders executed the sale of at least one Solana-based NFT on that day. This marked a 111% rally from the 58,405 NFT traders on the network recorded the previous day.
Source: CryptoSlam
However, despite the surge in NFT traders count, NFT sales volume on Solana cratered by 16% on the 8th of May. That day, the USD value of all Solana-based NFTs sold was $3.01 million. 
On the 7th of May, it was above $3.5 million.
This decline in sales volume is due to the steady decline in SOL’s value in the past few days. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the coin’s value fell by 7% between the 7th and the 8th of May. 
At press time, SOL traded at $143.04. 
While a decline in SOL’s price can make minting and buying NFTs on Solana more affordable, it might not translate to the same total spending as before.
Also, with SOL’s low price action, investors who bought SOL-based NFTs for potential appreciation in SOL’s value might become hesitant to sell.
 This could lead to fewer high-value NFT purchases, impacting the overall sales volume.
State of the NFT market
An assessment of the performance of the general NFT ecosystem revealed a decline in the past 30 days, mirroring the downtrend in the general cryptocurrency market. 
According to CoinGecko’s data, global cryptocurrency market capitalization has plunged by 15% in the last month. At press time, this was $2.4 trillion.
According to NFTGo’s data, NFT sales volume during that period totaled $488 million and declined by 29%.
Due to the decline in trading activity, NFT market capitalization plummeted. At $17.28 billion at press time, this dropped by 15 % in the past 30 days.

During that period, the NFT trader count fell by 9.5%.
Per NFTGo’s data, the total number of unique addresses that bought or sold at least one NFT from any of the NFT collections tracked over the last month was 107,000.

Sui's zkLogin Now Adds Multi-signature Recovery And Support For Apple Accounts - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Sui’s zkLogin introduces multi-signature recovery and Apple account support, enhancing user options and account recovery capabilities.



The integration of multi-signature recovery improves account recoverability.



These updates reflect Sui’s commitment to simplifying Web3 adoption and bridging the gap for non-crypto users.




Sui Foundation, in a recent announcement on its official blog, unveiled two significant enhancements to its social login basic tool, zkLogin. 





Sui’s zkLogin Introduces Multi-Signature Support



The updates include multi-signature recovery and support for Apple accounts, providing users with expanded options and improved account recovery mechanisms.



Initially introduced last year with support for Google, Twitch, and Facebook accounts, the integration with Apple of Sui’s zkLogin offers users the convenience of consolidating all their social logins under one platform, particularly beneficial for iOS users seeking seamless integration with Sui wallet creation within iPhone applications.



The introduction of multi-signature (multi-sig) recovery presents a novel approach to account recovery, prioritizing both security and user accessibility. With zkLogin’s reliance on the application client ID and issuer, such as Google, multi-sig significantly enhances account recoverability, ensuring users can regain access even if the original application or credential issuer becomes inactive.




Sui Foundation’s Commitment to Web3



Sui’s concerted efforts to onboard new users to Web3 align with the platform’s mission to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized technologies. Recognizing the challenge faced by both Sui and other Web3 companies in retaining non-crypto users during initial platform access, Sui’s zkLogin marks a pivotal step towards enhancing user confidence and usability within the Web3 ecosystem.



Through the creation of a multi-sig wallet with zkLogin and an additional private key backup, users can maintain access to their assets in the event of app or credential issuer discontinuation. Moreover, the integration of multi-sig with zkLogin facilitates more intricate use cases, enabling builders to incorporate up to 10 zkLogin accounts from various credential providers with customizable weights and thresholds, thereby expanding the tool’s versatility and utility.

BlockFi Shut Down Will Take Place In May, Users Need To Withdraw Asset Before April 28 - Coincu



	

Key Points:




BlockFi shut down will take place at the end of May, and Coinbase will be reliant on it for distribution.



Clients who missed withdrawal deadlines will have their crypto holdings transferred to Coinbase instead of being liquidated to cash.



The partnership ensures continued access to crypto assets, with BlockFi highlighting Coinbase’s involvement as crucial for facilitating future crypto distributions.




BlockFi, a crypto lender undergoing liquidation, has announced plans to close its web platform by the end of May 2024.





BlockFi Shut Down Will Take Place in Partnership with Coinbase for Distribution



In a bid to facilitate the withdrawal process for its clients, BlockFi will be teaming up with Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, as its primary distribution partner.



BlockFi shut down comes as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, ensuring that clients with BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIAs), retail loans, and private accounts can still access their funds. Eligible customers who have not withdrawn their crypto holdings by April 28 or completed identity verification by May 10 will have their assets transferred to Coinbase instead of being liquidated to cash.



Continued Access to Crypto Assets Through The Partnership



Clients will have the option to access their funds in kind through their existing or newly created Coinbase accounts. Those unable to create a Coinbase account will receive their funds in cash. BlockFi has emphasized that it has not partnered with any other crypto companies for distributions and warns users of potential scams.




The partnership between BlockFi and Coinbase aims to enable seamless access to crypto holdings during BlockFi shut down. Instructions will be provided to users by both companies, with future distributions potentially facilitated through Coinbase by the plan administrator in BlockFi’s bankruptcy case.

Starknet Foundation Launches $5 Million Seed Grants Program to Boost Final-Stage Blockchain Projects



                    

The Starknet Foundation recently unveiled a significant $5 million Seed Grants Program, designated in USDC, to propel the development of nascent projects on its network. 



This initiative is set to provide vital financial backing to at least 200 emerging teams, each receiving $25,000. 




The focus is on aiding projects in their final stages, helping them overcome the “last mile” challenge to successfully launch on Starknet. 



Starknet operates as an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution employing zero-knowledge rollup technology, which has been gaining traction among developers.



Diego Oliva, CEO of the Starknet Foundation, emphasized the rationale behind this substantial financial commitment. 




He explained, “We’ve been listening carefully to devs [developers] and hearing about the main challenges they face. 



“We are talking about people with amazing creativity and vision who need support with that ever-hard ‘last mile’ to get a project over the line and into production. 



“So we responded with this program, which is intended, very directly and with minimal bureaucracy, to address this.” 



This quote highlights the foundation’s strategic approach to foster a robust development environment and streamline project completion.

The program targets Starknet-associated projects that have already developed a minimum viable product (MVP) or proof-of-concept, which are considered ready for the next leap.



Oliva further stated, “In general, we want to reduce the barriers and burdens young teams face when considering starting a project. 



We’re trying to clear the path to innovation,” reflecting the foundation’s commitment to reducing entry barriers for newcomers and catalyzing innovation within the blockchain ecosystem.



The rising interest in Starknet is evidenced by the growing number of developers engaging with its ecosystem. 



According to Electric Capital’s 2023 Developer Report, the total monthly developers associated with Starknet surged to over 22,400 by December 2023, marking an increase of more than 113% since December 2020.



Blockchain gaming, in particular, stands out as a significant area of growth and application within the Starknet and broader blockchain environment. 



Oliva commented on the exciting developments in this sector, stating, “Starknet is leading the way in fully on-chain gaming. 



Key projects in this area include Realms, Influence, and Dojo. 



This sector is growing fast, with more teams building on Starknet using the Dojo standard. 



Gaming is important not just for gamers but for everyone because it’s demanding on the network, testing its capabilities and demonstrating its power.” 



According to DappRadar, blockchain gaming accounts for 35% of the total decentralized application activity, attracting over 2.2 million daily unique active wallets, underscoring the substantial impact and potential of gaming on blockchain platforms.

Tether Criticizes Deutsche Bank’s Research on Stablecoins


							

Deutsche Bank Research analysts recently released a paper on stablecoins launched since 1800.



The analysts conclude that most pegged coins failed, with only 14% surviving.



Tether criticizes the researchers, claiming they failed to produce concrete data to support their arguments.




In a recent study, Deutsche Bank Research analysts concluded that most stablecoins failed, with only 14% surviving. Raising concerns regarding the future of stablecoins, the researchers posited, “Some may survive, although most will likely fail.”



Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to another asset like fiat currency, gold, etc. As these types of currencies are stable, most investors depend on them in the highly volatile crypto market.









The analysts surveyed nearly 334 pegged currencies launched since 1800. They asserted that only a very few currently exist among the total stablecoins. They added that the successful stablecoins boasted three features that the failed stablecoins lacked: credibility, reserve backing, and tightly controlled systems.



As per the research, 49% of the stablecoins failed, existing only for 8 to 10 years. The analysts argued that “macroeconomic factors are key to determining a peg sustainability.” Marion Laboure, Senior Strategist at Deutsche Bank Research, stated, “Issues around governance and speculative forces could also indicate when there’s a possibility of de-pegging.” He added,




 “We chose to compare stablecoins to peg currencies because historically their similarities make them a close proxy as both are pegged currencies. Both require ample reserves and credibility from issuers, are exposed to speculative forces, and the majority of both stablecoins and historical currency pegs track the USD.” 




However, Tether, the issuer of stablecoin giant USDT, raised its voice against the Deutsche Bank Research report, claiming that the analysts failed to produce “concrete data” supporting their arguments. While the researchers pinpointed Terraform Labs’ TerraUSD as an example of the fall of stablecoins, Tether commented, “Its comparison to Terra, an algorithmic stablecoin, is misleading and irrelevant to the discussion on reserve-backed coins.”

                        Embattled crypto lender BlockFi announced Thursday that it plans to close its web platform this month, and is partnering with Coinbase to distribute funds to clients.The New Jersey-based firm said its Coinbase partnership will allow eligible BlockFi Interest Account, Retail Loan, and Private Clients to withdraw their crypto holdings.BlockFi filed for bankruptcy in Nov. 2022 after FTX’s collapse. CEO Zac Prince, who testified as a government witness in Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial, claims the FTX founder’s actions directly caused BlockFi’s bankruptcy.
Missed BlockFi’s Withdrawal Deadline? You Can Still Recover Your Crypto
In 2023, BlockFi announced it was shutting down and planned to return customers’ crypto holdings. The deadline for most customers to request withdrawals was April 28, 2024.On Thursday, the lender told clients that since the deadline to withdraw their digital assets from the current estate distribution has passed, clients will receive instructions on how to set up a Coinbase account. Through this method, they can withdraw their digital assets if they have an existing or new approved Coinbase account.The company is also giving another chance to those who missed the withdrawal deadline. They will still have the option to withdraw from BlockFi’s platform. Those who do not establish an approved Coinbase account may have their assets liquidated into cash and distributed to them accordingly.
BlockFi Tells Customers To Download Important Documents Before Platform Closure
The plan administrator will have the power to use Coinbase for upcoming distribution rounds, which may involve distributions from recovered funds from FTX. Without this capability, the administrator would be limited to distributing cash for subsequent distributions.BlockFi said it does not plan to collaborate with any additional providers for cryptocurrency distributions. Consequently, it cautioned investors to remain vigilant against potential scam attempts from third-party entities. BlockFi has previously been the target of fraudulent activity, where claimants received deceptive emails resembling legitimate communications, falsely promising immediate withdrawals of their remaining balances.Customers were further encouraged to retrieve their transaction history, tax documents, and any other pertinent information from BlockFi before the shutdown occurs.

                        An attacker involved in a $68 million address poisoning scam has exhibited a gesture of goodwill by returning $153,000 worth of Ether to the victim.The address-poisoning attack initially saw the attacker tricking a user into transferring $68 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), which has taken a new twist with the recent kind-hearted act of returning a fraction of the stolen funds.
Attacker Expressed Willingness To Negotiate
The attacker, operating under the alias “FakePhishing327990” on Etherscan, sent $153,000 Ether to the victim, accompanied by a message expressing willingness to negotiate and seeking communication via Telegram.The Victim contacting the address poisoning attacker Source: EtherscanBlockchain data reveals that the victim, identified by their account ending in 8fD5, initiated communication with the attacker. The victim proposed a resolution in which the attacker would return 90% of the stolen funds in exchange for a 10% bounty and a commitment to refrain from legal action. The victim emphasized the inevitability of tracing the funds and provided a deadline for the decision.Subsequently, another account controlled by the attacker, ending in 72F1, responded by sending 51 Ether to the victim. This symbolized a fraction of the stolen funds returned as a demonstration of goodwill. The accompanying message reiterated the attacker’s willingness to negotiate and requested the victim’s Telegram username for further communication.The negotiation unfolds against the address poisoning scam, in which the attacker utilizes a smart contract to deceive the victim into transferring 1,155 WBTC by exploiting the appearance of similarity between addresses.This sophisticated tactic, known as an “address poisoning attack,” involves spamming victims with transactions that mimic their own, ultimately leading to costly errors. Security experts caution users to scrutinize transaction details meticulously, particularly the sending address, to mitigate the risks associated with such attacks.
Phishing Attacks On Rise
An NFT trader recently fell victim to a phishing scam, losing over $145,000 worth of tokens. The trader, known as “tatis.eth,” was targeted by an attacker named “PinkDrainer,” who stole three valuable BAYC NFTs from the victim’s wallet.BAYC, short for Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of highly valued Ethereum-based NFTs featuring unique cartoon ape designs. The stolen NFTs were transferred to a phishing address and sold for 48.5 ETH.This incident is part of a broader trend of phishing scams targeting cryptocurrency users, with notable losses reported in the first two months of 2024.According to Scam Sniffer data, over $104 million worth of cryptocurrencies has been lost to phishing attacks in this period, with a significant portion coming from the Ethereum ecosystem.

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) to Rally 8,000% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and DogeCoin



                    

Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Zombie Coin (ZOMCOIN), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Zombie Coin presents a similar opportunity.



Zombie Coin has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,000% in the coming two days, and Zombie Coin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Zombie Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Zombie Coin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Zombie Coin by entering its contract address – FbkoYsCAPbcyJkSoqXTxDKKoGQrYoqgtdLf9GBEqy2vr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ZOMCOIN.

Key Points:




Slow Mist founder exposes TON phishing messages, which users tricked into believing they receive cheap USDT via TON message comments.



TON’s increased user base attracts scammers who are exploiting its asynchronous nature and smart contract functionality.




A recent revelation by Slow Mist founder sheds light on a new phishing scam leveraging the Telegram Open Network (TON) transfer mechanism to deceive users into receiving seemingly inexpensive USDT tokens.





Slow Mist Founder Exposes TON Phishing Message



The TON phishing messages scam operates through misleading message comments within the TON blockchain, with content suggesting the receipt of substantial amounts of USDT, such as “Received +5,000 USDT.” However, users fall victim to the illusion of receiving such funds, unaware of the deception.



The TON blockchain, renowned for its asynchronous nature and smart contract functionality, facilitates data transmission among its users. The surge in TON’s user base, driven by the growing interest in blockchain technology, has unfortunately led to the proliferation of fraudulent schemes like TON phishing messages.



TON, an integral component of the Web3 ecosystem, aims to redefine decentralized experiences beyond DeFi, dApps, and DAOs. With developers actively collaborating to support Telegram‘s vast user base exceeding 700 million, the TON Foundation plays a pivotal role in fostering this innovative landscape.




Crypto Community Grapples with Persistent Phishing Scams



Crypto phishing scams, a persistent menace in the digital asset realm, exploit unsuspecting individuals by masquerading as legitimate entities and offering false promises of free tokens or coins.



Amidst this backdrop, the crypto community grapples with the aftermath of various scams, including the recent ZKasino fraud case, resulting in investors losing an estimated $33 million in digital assets. Dutch authorities have taken action, apprehending a suspect linked to the ZKasino scam on April 29, signaling efforts to combat fraudulent activities within the industry.

Jack Dorsey says Bitcoin will be worth 'at least a million' by 2030

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey says the price of Bitcoin (BTC) could reach a price of at least $1 million by the year 2030, adding that its value could grow even further from that point onwards. Speaking in a May 9 interview with journalist Mike Solana on Pirate Wires, Dorsey offered a bullish outlook for the long-term price action of Bitcoin as well as providing further context behind his abrupt departure from the board of BlueSky — a decentralized Twitter alternative he helped launch in 2019. Dorsey told Solana he believes Bitcoin's price could reach “at least a million” by 2030 adding that that it most likely “hits that number and goes beyond.”Dorsey — now the head of the financial services firm Block — noted that Bitcoin’s price isn’t actually the most interesting aspect of Bitcoin, and instead pointed to the collaborative nature of the ecosystem and the way it incentivizes collective efforts to enhance the network.“The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up.”“It's a fascinating ecosystem and movement, more than anything else,” he said before adding, “It taught me a lot.”Source: Mike SolanaRelated: Bitcoin could soon ‘BLOW higher’ on bullish candle hammer: Glassnode execsDorsey raised eyebrows earlier this week when it was confirmed he would be departing the board of Bluesky, a decentralized social network he helped start as an alternative to Twitter.He said that Bluesky was “literally repeating all the mistakes [Twitter] made,” adding that it is not a protocol that could be deemed truly decentralized. “It’s another app,” he said.Dorsey originally envisioned Bluesky as an open-source protocol that Twitter and other social media platforms could build on top of, separating the protocol layer from the application layer to reduce censorship risks.However, he said the firm started behaving more like a traditional company that began pushing for moderation tools. “Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an open source protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board. That's not what I wanted, that's not what I intended to help create.”Dorsey, who has since deleted his Bluesky account, said the platform with Nostr, an anonymous, open protocol with no company or centralized control, aligned more with his goals of censorship resistance.In a note to shareholders on May 2, Dorsey said that his fintech firm Block will flip 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin-related products back into buying more BTC every month.On May 1, it was reported that US federal prosecutors were probing Block after documents alleged compliance violations at the firm’s payment divisions, Square and Cash App.Magazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime

Franklin Templeton: Friend.Tech and SocialFi Fuel Base Growth


Franklin Templeton, a prominent asset manager with a vast portfolio exceeding $1.4 trillion, recently turned its analytical gaze towards Base—a layer-2 (L2) blockchain solution crafted by the crypto exchange Coinbase.
Launched to the public on August 9, 2023, Base has swiftly climbed the ranks within the blockchain community. Particularly, it has caught the eye for its innovative approach in the Social Finance (SocialFi) domain.
Base’s Emergence as a SocialFi Contender
Franklin Templeton’s analysis reveals that roughly 46% of all transactions on Base are intertwined with SocialFi applications. This marks it as a pivotal sector for Base’s adoption and subsequent growth. Franklin Templeton highlights Friend.Tech as a prime example.
Friend.Tech is a mobile-only application that capitalizes on monetizing social interactions on its platform. It has recently made headlines due to the launch of its second version (Friend.Tech V2) and a native token airdrop—FRIEND.

The FRIEND token is claimed to be solely owned by its user base. It boasts a market cap of around $200 million, highlighting the robust community engagement and investor confidence in Base’s ecosystem.
Furthermore, Franklin Templeton outlined that integrating SocialFi applications directly with Coinbase’s expansive user base provides Base a unique advantage.


“With the support of the Coinbase platform, Base has a strong combination of SocialFi applications and direct integration with Coinbase users, positioning itself well to capture a material share of SocialFi activity and remain a leader in the Ethereum L2 sector going forward,” Franklin Templeton analysts wrote.

Base uses “optimistic rollups” to speed up transactions and cut costs. It batches transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain. Then, it consolidates these transactions and finalizes them on the Ethereum mainnet.
This process allows Base to reduce costs significantly while maintaining Ethereum’s high-security standards. Thus, Base stands out among other L2 solutions.
Compared to other L2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, Base has shown unprecedented growth. L2BEAT data shows that Base’s total value locked (TVL) increased by over 630% from $742.63 million to $5.45 billion in the year-to-date (YTD) time frame. Meanwhile, Arbitrum, the top L2 solution with a $16.03 billion TVL, saw only a roughly 47% increase during the same time frame.

Despite its numerous achievements, Base faces ongoing challenges, notably with the security of its meme coin projects. As per previous reports, 91% of meme coin projects on the Base platform are susceptible to security breaches, potentially jeopardizing user investments. 
This risk highlights the need for ongoing security improvements to protect users and maintain trust in Base’s ecosystem.

Trump-Inspired MAGA Coin Leaves Parody Biden Memecoin In The Dust With 23% Weekly Gain As Ex-President Warms Up More To Crypto - Benzinga

A cryptocurrency themed around former U.S. President Donald Trump surged this week as the firebrand leader stepped up his endorsement of digital currencies. A rival coin, however, saw its fortunes tank.What Happened: MAGA Coin TRUMP/USD saw a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and a 23% rise since the beginning of the week, as per data from Coinmarketcap.This uptick coincided with Trump’s amplified crypto-friendly rhetoric, particularly notable at a recent NFT event where he emphatically endorsed cryptocurrencies, even proclaiming, “If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.” Santiment data confirms a surge in Trump’s mentions across major crypto-centric social platforms, reflecting his growing advocacy for digital assets.See Also: Best 10 Altcoins In May 2024Conversely, mentions of President Joe Biden escalated amidst concerns over potential stringent crypto regulations. This negative sentiment impacted Jeo Boden BODEN/USD, a cryptocurrency parodying the incumbent president, which experienced an 18.88% drop in the last 24 hours and a 28% decrease over the week.Why It Matters: MAGA Coin, inspired by the “Make America Great Again” movement, has skyrocketed 25x year-to-date, signaling the potential rise of a new category of political finance cryptocurrencies, colloquially termed “Politi-Fi.” This trend underscores Trump’s strategic alignment with the growing crypto demographic in the U.S., as highlighted in a Visual Capitalist report revealing approximately 53 million Americans as crypto owners in 2023, the highest in absolute numbers and the third-highest by population share.Since its launch on Aug. 11, 2023, MAGA has surged by an astonishing 35,211%, while BODEN, launched on March 10, 2024, has seen a 768% increase.Read Next: Donald Trump Says ‘You Better Vote’ For Him If You’re Pro-Crypto: But Has He Always Been ‘Fine With It’?Photo via Shutterstock

Can Crypto Markets March Higher When $1.1B Bitcoin Options Expire Today?


																Aside from a minor mid-week dip, crypto markets have been relatively inactive in the past several days and continue to trade sideways.
However, around 18,280 Bitcoin options contracts are set to expire on May 10, which may inject some volatility.
The notional value for this week’s batch of expiring BTC contracts is around $1.15 billion, according to Deribit. The batch is slightly smaller than last week’s expiry event.
Bitcoin Options Expiry
The put/call ratio for this week’s BTC options is 0.64, which means that more calls, or long contracts, are expiring than puts or shorts.
The longs are also dominating in open interest (OI) with almost $700 million at the $70,000 and $100,000 strike prices. Open interest refers to the number or value of contracts that have yet to be settled.




OI for put contracts is also starting to creep up with around $360 million at the $50,000 strike price, according to Deribit.
Overall, the open interest for Bitcoin call options is more than double the OI for put options, indicating bullish trader sentiment.
Call options give the right to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.
Moreover, trading firms like QCP Capital and Paradigm have observed revived demand for upside call options, including buyers closing existing positions to roll into higher strike calls expiring in July and September.
Bitcoin Options Expiring Contracts. Source: Deribit
In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, 276,000 Ethereum contracts are also set to expire.
These have a notional value of around $840 million and a put/call ratio of 0.74. There is a lot of OI, around $636 million, at the $3,600 strike price, indicating that Ethereum derivatives traders are also bullish.
Crypto Market Outlook
Crypto markets have gained 2.1% on the day to reach $2.45 trillion in total capitalization. However, they have consolidated around this level since mid-April with very little movement in either direction.
Bitcoin dipped below $61,000 on May 9 but has recovered to tap $63,000 during the Friday morning Asian trading session. The asset has been down trending since its all-time high in mid-March and has lost 15% since then.
Ethereum prices hit an intraday low of $2,953 but have since recovered to reach $3,032 at the time of writing.
The altcoins are mostly in the green at the moment, with larger gains for Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON).

                        Tech leader Jack Dorsey is betting big on Bitcoin, forecasting a price explosion to over $1 million by 2030.As Pirates Wires’ Mike Solana asked for his take on Bitcoin’s future value, Dorsey said: “I don’t know. Over… at least a million. I do think it hits that number and goes beyond.”Still, the crypto asset’s price itself takes a backseat for Dorsey, who reiterated his core fascination with Bitcoin lies in other aspects.“The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up,” he said in the interview published Thursday. “It’s a fascinating ecosystem and movement, more than anything else. It taught me a lot.”Dorsey isn’t alone in foreseeing Bitcoin reaching remarkable levels. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood also sees a $1m valuation for Bitcoin by 2030. Additionally, Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, has projected a seven-figure range for Bitcoin estimating it to fall between $1m and $10m in 2030.
Dorsey Ditches Bluesky For Repeating Twitter’s ‘Mistakes’
This week, Dorsey, the one-time Twitter CEO, revealed he stepped down from Bluesky’s board. The platform, envisioned in 2019, aims to be a decentralized social media alternative.“Everything we wanted around decentralization, everything we wanted in terms of an open source protocol, suddenly became a company with VCs and a board,” he told Pirates Wire. “That’s not what I wanted, that’s not what I intended to help create.”He attributed his departure to Bluesky’s path, saying it was “literally repeating all the mistakes [Twitter] made as a company.”Dorsey further revealed his true focus lies with Nostr, another decentralized platform challenging Twitter. He said he wanted to support Nostr’s development as a genuine open-source protocol.
Jack Dorsey’s Block Announces Strategic Monthly Bitcoin Purchases
Dorsey is currently head of payments firm Block, which is doubling down on Bitcoin. Last week, the firm announced a new strategy to invest 10% of its Bitcoin product profits into buying more Bitcoin every month.Block was one of the first public companies to invest in Bitcoin, with a $220m investment in 2020. The company’s Bitcoin holdings have surged 160% to reach $573m by the end of Q1 2024.

Harvest Plans To Open Bitcoin ETF To Mainland China


								Harvest Global Investments, a Chinese fund house and one of the issuers of Hong Kong’s first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has confirmed plans to potentially open these funds to mainland Chinese investors through the Hong Kong Stock Connect. This development could vastly expand the investor base and significantly impact the cryptocurrency market in Asia.
Harvest CEO Eyes Mainland Access For HK Bitcoin ETF
Currently, Harvest Global offers Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong, with these products enabling direct investment in the respective cryptocurrencies. The possibility of including these ETFs in the ETF Connect scheme, part of the broader Stock Connect initiative launched in 2014 to link Hong Kong with mainland Chinese exchanges, was discussed by Harvest CEO Han Tongli at the Bitcoin Asia conference.
Han stated, “We don’t rule out applying for our ETFs to be included in the connect programme, as long as everything goes smooth and well in the next two years.”

The move to integrate crypto investments into the Stock Connect could be a significant step, given the previously restricted access to such products for mainland investors. Hong Kong’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has been more open compared to mainland China, where most commercial crypto activities are banned, but trading and ownership by individuals remain a gray area legally.
Despite the innovative nature of these spot crypto ETFs and their ability to offer direct exposure to cryptocurrencies rather than derivatives or stocks of companies related to digital currencies, the initial trading volumes have been underwhelming compared to the US market. According to Han, this is partly due to the market’s cautious view of Hong Kong’s virtual asset policies and its implications for the future of these ETFs.

Han remarked during a panel at the Bitcoin Asia conference that the local market could potentially double the size of the US products, emphasizing the strategic importance of Hong Kong as a more neutral ground with broader appeal in Asia. He attributed the slow start to various factors, including the market’s doubts about Hong Kong’s commitment to becoming a crypto hub, stating, “People are still skeptical about Hong Kong’s status as a special [administrative] region. It’s located in China, and many people don’t want to see Hong Kong become more successful for whatever reason.”
In his discussion, Han also highlighted the competitive advantages of Hong Kong’s crypto products, like the possibility for in-kind subscriptions — buying ETFs directly with bitcoin and ether — and temporary waiving of management fees to attract investors. These features, along with the potential inclusion in the Stock Connect, are seen as critical to gaining traction and establishing Hong Kong as a key player in the global cryptocurrency market.
At press time, BTC traded at $62,754.

Russian Opposition Leader Mark Feygin Launches Blockchain-Based Referendum on Vladimir Putin’s Election Win

The results of this effort would, of course, have no legal weight in Russia and would not end Putin's presidency per se, but the referendum could, in theory, give a public relations boost to efforts to oust him. And it gives Russians a way to voice criticism in a nation where the consequences of dissent can be high; opposition leader Alexei Navalny recently died while jailed in an Arctic penal colony.

President Joe Biden is trying hard to 'kill crypto', says Cardano founder

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has lashed out at United States President Joe Biden, claiming that he’s making a concerted effort to kill the crypto industry in the United States.In a May 9 video posted to X, Hoskinson said it was “unambiguously clear” the Biden administration is trying its best to “destroy the American cryptocurrency industry.”He said that over the past few years, the U.S. government had “hurt [the crypto] industry in every way possible,” citing the restricted access to bank accounts, the Securities and Exchange Commission's policy of regulation by enforcement — and most recently — the White House "obstructing" the legislative process. “A vote for Biden is a vote against the American cryptocurrency industry.” Hoksinson’s comments came following a statement from President Biden's office, which said he would veto legislation looking to overturn SEC guidelines that discourage banks from custodying crypto assets. On May 8, the White House said it “strongly opposes” members of the House of Representatives that later passed a joint resolution to overturn SAB 121.The White House claimed nullifying SAB 121 would hinder the SEC’s ability to “protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.”Source: Charles HoskinsonAdditionally, Hoskinson lashed out at the SEC for leveraging antiquated legislation that he said shouldn’t apply to new and emerging asset classes. “The Securities Exchange Act passed in 1933, to say that it is sufficient to regulate assets that came 90 years later is an absurd statement.” He cited Switzerland, Singapore, and Dubai as jurisdictions that welcome crypto companies and have reaped the benefits of millions of dollars worth of investments, stemming from the 3,000 firms that “probably would have domiciled in the United States had our crypto policy been reasonable.” Related: President Biden says he would veto resolution countermanding SEC crypto ruleA user on Twitter pushed back on Hoskinson’s Biden-specific claims, saying that the previous Trump Administration hadn’t exactly been open to crypto either. Hoskinson didn’t mince words in response, saying this stance was “completely wrong.”“The [Trump] administration had its issues but mostly ignored our industry. The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto.”In April, Cointelegraph reported that the Biden Administration asked Congress to target the American Bitcoin mining industry, citing China as an example for the U.S. to follow.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Altcoins will bottom in early summer before bull run - Analyst

Bitcoin (BTC) aside, the cryptocurrency market could find its local bottom in June, marking the start of the next altcoin bull cycle, according to market analysts. Altcoin bottom could occur in June: analystBased on historical chart patterns, altcoins could be set to find their local price bottom around the beginning of June, according to popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital, who wrote in a May 8 X post:“Altcoins are following the plan perfectly. Altcoins bottomed in early February. Altcoins sold off around the BTC Halving. Altcoins to bottom early summer.”Altcoin hype cycles. Source: Rekt CapitalThe altcoin market took a beating during the past month. The market cap of altcoins, excluding the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, fell over 21% during the previous month to $265 billion.Altcoin market cap, Source: TradingViewDespite the monthly slump, the altcoin market cap is still up over 24% year-to-date (YTD), and over 167% during the past year.Altcoin sentiment is historically correlated with Bitcoin price. Altcoins could find their local bottom around June, as market sentiment and Bitcoin price remains subdued by decreasing inflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Alex Onufriychuk, blockchain advisor and coach at QUBIC Labs Accelerator. He told Cointelegraph:“There is a possibility that could find their local bottom by June due to the lack of sufficient new liquidity from Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and Hong Kong. This indicates that the consolidation period may be prolonged.”Related: Did XRP price just bottom against Bitcoin?Bitcoin breakout will spark altcoin bull cycle: NansenDespite seeing a potential local bottom, an altcoin bull run would first require Bitcoin price to break out to the upside, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, who told Cointelegraph:"Altcoins are high beta crypto, they are successful when the sentiment is very bullish. Since mid-March, the sentiment among crypto investors is less exuberant. As BTC price consolidates around the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), there is more volatility in Alts. We need a break above and a clear resumption of BTC uptrend for alts to outperform."BTC price has been posting lower highs since mid March. But many analysts argue that this is a healthy period of consolidation after the halving. Moreover, the charts hint at a multi-month bull flag taking shape for new all-time highs later this year. BTC/USDT, 1-day chart. Source: TradingviewSince altcoin sentiment is strongly related to Bitcoin price, finding a local bottom wouldn’t necessarily translate into an altcoin rally, wrote QUBIC Labs’ Onufriychuk:“Even if altcoins find their local bottom around June, it does not necessarily mean that a bull run will start. For a significant turnaround, more fundamental changes are required, such as increased retail and institutional investment and favorable regulatory developments, given the scarcity of new liquidity and heavy reliance on institutional reinvestment into newer projects.”On the monthly chart, 10 out of 12 moving averages (MA) are flashing a buy signal for the top altcoins, such as Ether (ETH), which has struggled. Moving average indicators are commonly used in technical analysis to determine the average price of the underlying asset, in relation to a set period.Moving average, altcoins.

Tether Hits Back Deutsche Bank’s Argument Over its Solvency


                        
                            Stablecoin Issuer Tether Hits Back Deutsche Bank’s Argument Over its Solvency

                        In a latest response, Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin, has vehemently criticized Deutsche Bank’s statement, which questioned the sustainability of stablecoins and Tether’s solvency.A Deutsche Bank research, published Tuesday, studied 334 currency pegs since the year 1800 and concluded that only 14% survived. Applying the research to stablecoins, the bank’s analysts noted that the asset class is prone to “turbulence and de-pegging events.”
“While some may survive, most will likely fail, particularly due to the lack of transparency in stablecoin operations and vulnerability to speculative sentiment.”
The research analyzed the collapse of TerraUSD stablecoin, leaving a ripple effect on the entire crypto market. “These incidents highlight the volatility and risks associated with stablecoins, and the need for greater transparency and regulation in the cryptocurrency market,” the report read.Further, Deutsche Bank criticized Tether – a dominant stablecoin – questioning its solvency and its industry standard for crypto derivatives.
“A ‘Tether peso moment’ could cause significant losses, negatively impacting leveraged traders and causing severe repercussions for the entire crypto system.”
Additionally, the report stressed the challenges in constructing stable currency pegs, despite the novelty of cryptocurrencies. “It is likely that we will see much more instability in the years to come,” it added.The German banking giant surveyed over 3,350 consumers in March (550 in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, UK each and 600 in USA), questioning the stability of stablecoins.“Only 18% of consumers expecting them to thrive, while 42% expect them to fade,” the survey found.
Tether Slams Deutsche Bank’s Stablecoin Warning
Notably, the research team wrote that they are concerned about Tether, given its implications amid “monopoly in the stablecoin market.” According to a Bloomberg report, the analysts also pointed out reliance on Tether in the crypto derivatives market.“The 30% de-peg rate among some stablecoins is therefore hardly surprising, and many defunct stablecoins are hard to account for.”Retaliating back to Deutsche Bank’s stablecoin claims, Tether said that the research “lacks clarity and substantial evidence, relying on vague assertions rather than rigorous analysis.”“While it attempts to forecast the decline of stablecoins, it fails to provide concrete data to support its claims.”

Telegram-Linked Toncoin Price Soars, But So Do Scams As Hackers Steal $140K Worth Of Tokens From Unsuspecting Users - Benzinga

Telegram-linked cryptocurrency Toncoin's TON/USD impressive run on the price charts this year has thrilled market participants, but the rising popularity has inadvertently drawn the attention of bad actors as well.What Happened: According to Web3 anti-scam platform Scam Sniffer, an address with a criminal history swindled as many as 22,000 TON tokens from unsuspecting users over the past few days. At the current market price, the stolen amount was worth $140,000. Digging deep into the modus operandi, the on-chain sleuth showed how users are duped into clicking a popup that promises to transfer USDT USDT/USD to their wallets. However, these were nothing but phishing links that ended up emptying their wallets of TON tokens.Similar findings were reported by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which unearthed a sophisticated phishing operation active since November 2023 that targeted TON holders. Why It Matters: Toncoin has been one of the crypto market's success stories in 2024, soaring 185% on a year-to-date basis, according to data from Benzinga Pro.According to a report by Santiment last week, Toncoin witnessed the fastest network growth among leading cryptocurrencies over the last six months.  The growth was fueled by social messaging giant Telegram's public support for the project, and its growing utility within the Telegram ecosystem. However, as the network grows in strength, and valuation increases, it would attract the predatory gazes of scammers and phishers, who don't need any second invitation to jump on money-making opportunities. Scam Sniffer reported losses of nearly $300 million due to crypto phishing scams in 2023, and $173 million already as of March. Price Action: At the time of writing, TON was exchanging hands at $6.58, marking double-digit gains of 11% in the last 24 hours.Read Next: If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin When Donald Trump Said The Crypto’s Value Was ‘Based On Thin Air,’ Here’s How Much You’d Have NowImage via Shutterstock
