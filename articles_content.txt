Why 'You Should Only Buy Bitcoin' And All Other Top 20 Cryptos Are 'Really Jokes,' According To This Trader - Benzinga

Bitcoin investor Fred Krueger pointed out why “you should only buy Bitcoin BTC/USD,” even though there have been significant changes in the top ten and top 20 of cryptocurrencies over the years. What Happened: In an extensive tweet on Monday, Krueger argued that all other cryptocurrencies in the top 20 are “a joke,” despite their combined market cap of over $500 billion. The analyst list includes Ethereum ETH/USD as an underperformer since 2019 when it touched 0.12 ETH /BTC and is now at 0.056 in the "falling channel." He cited that the SEC has multiple lawsuits against Ethereum in play. Tether USDT/USD is stable so there is no scope for an upside, but while interest rates are at 5%, it does not pay interest.BNB BNB/USD is termed a “highly centralized exchange coin,” with Binance in decline and former CEO Changpeng Zhao in prison. Solana SOL/USD is “a completely centralized meme coin factory” and is down 40% from Bitcoin since 2022. He also noted the problem of periodical shutdowns for system upgrades.Other cryptocurrencies Krueger dismissed include:
USDC USDC/USD: Depegged a few years ago.



Ripple XRP/USD: “No actual use.”



Toncoin TON/USD: Telegram coin which “nobody uses.” It also got in trouble with the SEC.



Cardano ADA/USD: “Nobody uses” this “useless coin” promoted by someone claiming, ‘Bitcoin won’t make it.’
Among meme coins, he terms Dogecoin DOGE/USD a literal joke with no redeeming features and no one using it. Shiba Inu SHIB/USD is a bad copy of Dogecoin and Pepe PEPE/USD is just a “$6 billion frog coin.”His tweet also highlighted Avalanche AVAX/USD as worthless, Chainlink LINK/USD as “just stupid for providing feeds” to Ethereum chains. He adds Polygon MATIC/USD as an Ethereum sidechain with “terrible tokenomics” and down 75% from the peak.Major crypto traders reacted to his viral tweet, with Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo tweeting that most of the cryptocurrencies have their main real case as "buying them" at the right time and stacking more Bitcoin. He adds, "USDT has been a past favorite of mine during crypto winter."What’s Next: Bitcoin and the rest of the 19 top cryptocurrencies will take center stage in discussions at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is also expected to be thoroughly explored.Read Next: Crypto Expert Reveals How To Find ‘High-Risk High Reward’ Meme CoinsImage: ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Data Revealed: Transactions in This Altcoin Are 505 Times Cheaper Than Ethereum - Bitcoin Sistemi


Although Ethereum is the world's largest altcoin, it has almost always been associated with high transaction fees.
Especially during busy periods during the week, incredible figures can be seen in Ethereum transaction fees. At the time of this writing, complex transactions such as swaps, borrowings and NFT sales on the ETH network cost between $20 and $30 on average.


Layer-2 altcoins, which aim to increase the scalability of the Ethereum network without losing its security features, continue to be popular due to the high fees of ETH.
However, there is an altcoin that, according to data, can perform the same transactions at almost 500 times cheaper than the transaction fees in ETH.





According to the data, transactions in Arbitrum can currently be concluded on average 505 times cheaper than Ethereum.

Here's how much less costly layer-2 altcoin networks are to trade than ETH, according to the latest data:



Arbitrum – 505 times
Starknet – 449 floors
Manta Pacific – 202 floors
zkSync – 155 times
Optimism – 135 times
Base – 92 floors

This Altcoin Network Spawned Half a Million Brand New Altcoins in May: Founder Explained - Bitcoin Sistemi


Nearly half a million tokens were launched on the Solana blockchain in May. The increase in token creation is attributed to lower barriers to entry and increased desire to create a popular memecoin.
In May alone, 455,000 tokens were created on Solana, dwarfing the numbers seen on other platforms. In comparison, 177,000 tokens were created on Ethereum layer 2 protocol Base, while 39,000 tokens were created on BNB Chain. The Ethereum mainnet and Layer 2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism each produced less than 20,000 tokens.



Austin Federa, director of strategy at the Solana Foundation, attributes this rise to Solana's unique features. “Solana is designed to be a high-throughput general-purpose layer 1 with fast completions and extremely low transaction fees,” Federa explained and added:

“As a result of these features, the increased mass token creation activities in Solana reduce the cost of experimentation and new idea generation to almost zero. Creating tokens in Solana should be as easy as creating content on the internet.”

Interestingly, the majority of Solana tokens are memecoins, which have recently attracted the attention of the cryptocurrency community. This trend comes after some Solana-based memecoins such as Dogwifhat, Bonk, and Book of Meme skyrocketed in the crypto market.

Shiba Inu Team Member Shares Important Security Update With Community | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu, due to its large community, has often been the target of scams due to the trust of the community in the project. As a result, the team has taken to routinely remind the community of multiple scams targeting them, and the latest has come from the admin, Da Vinci.
New Token Scams Targets Shiba Inu Community
Shiba Inu community member @Digarch shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) carrying a screenshot of a warning for the SHIBArmy regarding buying new tokens. The post which was made in the Discord group dives into the token scams and how they hope to exploit the community.

Da Vinci explained that these tokens were tricking investors by pretending to be connected with the Shiba Inu and Shibarium developers. Furthermore, they continue to exploit the Shiba State and Canine code to push their scams to unsuspecting victims. “They have even resorted to posting the shib.io address in their videos to lend false credibility to their schemes,” the post read.
The post further pointed out that the team cannot exclusively ban these tokens from its decentralized exchange (DEX) because of its decentralized. However, they have urged Shiba Inu investors to exercise caution, coupled with comprehensive research, when investing in any token to avoid being scammed.
Another major part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem being exploited is the TREAT tokens, which have not yet launched. However, it hasn’t stopped a number of fake TREAT tokens from popping up and trying to take advantage of the Shiba Inu community. “We will not hesitate to voice our strong disapproval of these scammers and their unethical practices,” Da Vinci said. “Stay informed and protect yourself.”
SHIB Investors Coming Back To The Table
Amid the warnings being sent to the community, Shiba Inu is seeing positive momentum in the market. This is especially visible in its daily trading volume, which is up 37% in the last day. This increase in the daily trading volume suggests a return of positive sentiment among investors.

Furthermore, SHIB continues to maintain its position as the 11th-largest cryptocurrency in the market, behind the likes of Toncoin and Cardano. However, despite its significant jump in daily trading volume, it has fallen behind newcomer, Notcoin, which currently boasts the 6th-largest daily trading volume at $4.25 billion.
At the time of writing, the SHIB price is trending at $0.00002491, indicating a 0.54% gain in the last day. According to CoinMarketCap data, the price is down 2.08% in the last week, but still painting 9.6% gains on the monthly chart.

Pantera Capital's $5 Million Investment Altcoin Decides to Change Its Name - Bitcoin Sistemi


Connext (NEXT), which describes itself as a Blockchain interoperability platform, will change its name to Everclear, according to its official statement.
The project stated that it will develop a kind of “exchange layer” in this context. According to the statement, this exchange layer is designed to address challenges related to rebalancing and reconciliation of intentions. Functioning as its own blockchain, this layer will serve as a backend liquidity platform that facilitates order matching for intent-based bridges.


To support the development and implementation of the clearing layer, Everclear sold $5 million of Connext (NEXT) tokens to cryptocurrency company Pantera Capital through an over-the-counter deal.

The development seems to have been welcomed by the token's community. The altcoin, which is traded on Bybit, one of the major stock exchanges, has gained approximately 8% in value in the last 24 hours.





According to its own statement, Connext hosts decentralized applications that work on all chains and can use all tokens, and claims to hold a total locked value of $ 1 billion.

Bitcoin's Make-or-Break Moment? | Bankless


Decision Time? Crypto assets steadily gained overnight after a stagnant weekend as market players around the globe returned to their desks. But shortly after the opening of U.S. markets, the move stalled out! Why has price run into resistance? Confirmation last month that pending spot Ethereum ETF applications would receive approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) turbocharged crypto prices, fueling a leg up that placed many tokens within striking range of achieving new cycle highs.The unexpected shift in approval odds caused underexposed traders to feverishly ape ETH, pushing the token just shy of new cycle highs above $4k; BTC was propelled within 2% of new all-time highs, briefly touching $72k.Source: TradingViewAlthough ETH achieved a higher local high last Monday, BTC was hammered lower prior to achieving one last week, a potentially worrisome sign for bulls that indicates sellers retain some amount of control. With BTC setting up to reject for the third time from range highs off a lower local high after an attempted breakout, crypto markets appear to be at a pivotal make-or-break moment…Continuation of the rally would swiftly send BTC to new all-time highs, undoubtedly yielding major tailwinds for the valuations of broader crypto assets, however, a breakdown from here would send the token tumbling back down towards the $60k range lows that have supported price throughout the last three months, subsequently putting further downside into play.Tangentially, spot volumes on BTC and ETH sharply fell last week, demonstrating a lack of interest at current prices that suggests a reversal in trend could be coming in the near future.Source: The BlockWhile crypto markets have been relatively devoid of significant volatility post spot ETH ETF approval confirmation, certain TradFi assets lit up their tapes with erratic swings in price this morning.Pseudonymous GameStock bull Roaring Kitty (aka Keith Gill) returned to the spotlight this weekend after a two week hiatus from social media, disclosing his ownership of 5M GME shares, unmasking himself as the whale that had accumulated a monster call position on the stock last week, and tweeting a green uno reverse card.GME more than doubled amid renewed memestock excitement, rallying as high as $45 during pre-market trading this morning, but has since given back much of the move, plunging to lows of $28 in cash trading.The New York Stock Exchange also experienced a major glitch this morning and was forced to halt trading on 50 listed assets, seemingly due to a software update which impacted price band guardrails designed to limit volatility.Most notable of the assets impacted were Class A shares of Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway, which tanked 99% on the open this morning prior to the trading halt.

The Rise in Bitcoin Mobilized the Whales: Three Giant Whales Purchased Large Amounts in Three Different Altcoins! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum start the new week with a good upward momentum, there is also activity on the whale front.
At this point, we first see that the smart Ethereum whale continues to collect ETH. According to Lookonchain's post, this whale, who made a profit of $76 million on Etrhereum, bought 7 thousand ETH worth $26.7 million from Binance today for $3,814.


Accordingly, the whale currently has 36,785 ETH (141 million ) with an estimated total profit of 76.6 million (+57.9%).
Apart from the Ethereum whale, another whale is also accumulating Fantom (FTM). Accordingly, the whale withdrew 2.96 million USDC from Aave and spent 2.23 million USDC, purchasing 2.82 million FTM at $0.79.






“A whale is buying FTM!
This whale withdrew 2.96 million USDC from Aave and spent 2.23 million USDC, buying 2.82 million FTM at $0.79. “He currently has 736K USDC left.”

Finally, a new wallet purchased 02.4 billion PEPE worth $23.07 million from Binance during the day.

After the USA and Hong Kong, Another Country Launches Bitcoin ETFs! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a milestone for the Australian financial market, Monochrome Asset Management's Monochrome Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) (IBTC) will begin trading on the Cboe Australia exchange on Tuesday.
Australia to Launch First Spot Bitcoin ETF with Direct BTC Assets
This development marks the introduction of Australia's first ETF directly holding Bitcoin, offering investors a simpler and regulated entry into the cryptocurrency market.


The product has received approval from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), ensuring it complies with the investor protection rules of the Australian Financial Services Licensing (AFSL) regime.
This regime imposes strict standards for directly held crypto assets, which do not apply to ETFs that hold Bitcoin indirectly or through offshore products.






The approval comes after the US gave the green light to spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, prompting regions such as Hong Kong and Australia to follow suit.
As of April, Hong Kong approved the first batch of crypto-related spot ETFs, underscoring a global trend towards adopting these financial instruments.


Jeff Yew, CEO of Monochrome Asset Management, emphasized the importance of this launch: “This aligns with Monochrome's investor protection-focused mission to provide safe, compliant and simple ways to participate in this transformative space.
“IBTC's direct holding structure is expected to provide Australian investors with enhanced protection and clarity in line with Monochrome's commitment to security and compliance.

The US region brought in $130 million in inflows while Switzerland and Canada saw inflows of $36 million and $25 million, a stark turnaround for Canada, which saw overall outflows last month.

Bitcoin Volume Crashes To Lows: Market Boredom Setting In?


								Data shows that Bitcoin trading volume has plummeted to extreme lows recently, a sign that investor interest in trading the asset is low.
Bitcoin Trading Volume Plunges As Price Continues To Move Sideways
According to data shared by CryptoQuant author IT Tech in an X post, the BTC trading volume has been quite low recently. The “trading volume” here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin that’s becoming involved in trades on all centralized exchanges on any given day.
When the value of this metric is high, it means that investors are currently making a large number of moves on these platforms. Such a trend implies that traders are interested in the coin.

On the other hand, the low metric can suggest that investors aren’t paying much attention to the cryptocurrency at the moment as they aren’t actively making trades.
Now, here is a chart that shows how the spot and derivatives trading volumes have looked for Bitcoin since the start of the year:

The value of the metric seems to have been quite low for both types of platforms | Source: @IT_Tech_PL on X
As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin trading volume has been primarily dominated by derivatives exchanges in the year so far, implying that futures and other products have seen the most interest.
Although the spot exchange trading volume has generally been much lower than the derivatives volume, it has still been sizeable at different points in the year.
Recently, however, the spot volume has become very low. It has also been similarly low before in the year, but what’s different this time is that the latest derivatives volume has also been pretty low. Thus, the volume as a whole has dried up in the Bitcoin market.
As for what could be driving this trend, the answer may lie in the recent price action. Usually, investors find phases where price moves fast to be exciting, so volume tends to rise in such periods as they jump to make trades and participate in speculation.
When an asset is stale, though, traders get bored and start paying attention to greener pastures instead. For a while now, Bitcoin has been stuck in consolidation, so it’s not surprising that investors have lost interest.

It remains to be seen how long these low volumes persist before a volatile move inevitably arrives to spark a renewal of interest in the cryptocurrency.
BTC Price
After witnessing a setback earlier, Bitcoin has surged back above the $70,000 level with a 3% rally during the last 24 hours. It’s unknown, though, whether this move will finally take BTC out of its recent tight range or if the asset will soon lose this recovery, continuing its sideways trend.

The issue was resolved within a few hours, trading resumed, and BRK.A actually closed the day 0.59% in the green.Still, the inordinately sized red candle wasn’t a good look for Buffett, especially as someone who has harshly criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as being too speculative and volatile.“Who’s the rat poison now eh,” tweeted Blockstream CEO Adam Back on Monday. “Rat poison squared” is what Buffett called Bitcoin back in May 2018, where he said he’d be glad to “buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies.” Since that time, BRK.A is up roughly 114%, while Bitcoin is up roughly 600%.Buffett’s late vice-chairman and partner Charlie Munger was also one of crypto’s most veracious critics, having called Bitcoin a “stupid” and “evil” investment that’s “very likely to got to zero.”Many joked about the momentary annihilation of Buffett’s net worth, and the investment opportunity it presented. “Finally, I have a chance to acquire Warren Buffett,” said billionaire investor and Tron founder Justin Sun.“If you bought $500 of Berkshire Hathaway 10 minutes ago it would now be worth over $2 million,” said crypto meme account “greg” after the stock recovered. “Let that sink in.”Others, like crypto exchange Kraken, noted how Bitcoin trading can never be halted like BRK.A was on the NYSE. “Bitcoin fixes this,” tweeted famous whistleblower Edward Snowden on the matter.While the Bitcoin network is 24/7 and never goes down, various centralized exchanges have halted Bitcoin trading and withdrawals on countless occasions—sometimes indefinitely. Many have had their share of explosive price glitches too, including a BTC flash crash below $9,000 on BitMEX just two months ago.Buffett never publicly addressed the sudden Berkshire crash, though meme accounts were sure to put some words in his mouth, reminiscent of previous crypto catastrophes.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Cryptocurrency Limitation from Binance! Which Users Will Be Affected? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it will limit unauthorized stablecoins for users in the European Union due to MiCA.
Accordingly, users will need to switch to and use stablecoins issued under MICA for access.



“This announcement only affects users in the European Economic Area (EEA).
On 30.06.2024, the new MiCA stablecoin rules will come into force in the European Economic Area (EEA).
This will be the first step in introducing the new regulatory framework and will have a significant impact on the stablecoin market in the EEA.
Since it is important for all users to understand the impact of the upcoming changes, here are some important details about the new rules and how Binance is implementing them.
At this point, Binance will restrict the availability of “Unauthorized Stablecoins” for EEA users in its product offerings starting from 30.06.2024 (UTC+3).
Because as of 30.06.2024 (UTC+3), stablecoins will be issued in the EEA; This means that in practice only certain regulated companies can issue and offer publicly traded stablecoins; these stablecoins shall be “Regulated Stablecoins.”

Consensus 2024: Crypto’s back, baby - Blockworks


Consensus 2024 wrapped last Friday, and it went out with a whisper. 
To be honest, that’s the case with most crypto conferences. By the end, people are ready to hop on their flights and jet home, especially if they decided to event-hop the night before (shout out to the two guys who agreed to a 4:30 am bedtime Thursday after leaving an event that wrapped up at 8:30 pm). 
This year’s conference, multiple people told me, was all about the side events. Again, that’s not unusual, but it did make the conference itself feel emptier at times. 
I attended Consensus last year, and thought that the comparison would be stark. But this year’s conference didn’t include as many flashy booths, though there were plenty of stages filled with interesting speakers. 
Dear reader, I have to admit I wasn’t there on the first day, but attendees told me that people were excited and crowds were large on Wednesday as the conference kicked off. That seemed to taper off slightly through Thursday and Friday, though.
I was told that there were close to 15,000 attendees, up from last year’s 10,000. The Austin Police Force’s presence seemed to verify my information, as security was definitely heightened throughout the conference. By Friday, it seemed like most had relaxed, and I even saw a police officer playing life-sized chess against an attendee. 
The vibe this year was very much focused on institutions, and clearly there’s support from both sides. For example, Google Cloud had a “start-up village” which included a stage for founders, investors and entrepreneurs, and which featured constantly a rotating assortment of panels and talks.

Read more: RFK Jr is ‘happy’ about Trump’s crypto commitment
In that regard, it felt like crypto was back and definitely more upbeat than last year. While Consensus 2023 may have felt more crowded, there was a lot of healing still taking place as the industry dealt with the ramifications of the FTX collapse, bankruptcies and looming Securities and Exchange Commission actions (important to note, though, that neither Binance nor Coinbase had pending legal action at the time). 
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presence on Thursday definitely added to that, as the presidential candidate spoke both to the press and on stage. In fact, the news of former President Donald Trump’s verdict (found guilty on all 34 counts) broke while RFK Jr. was in the press conference. At first, he said he’d been “disciplined” about not commenting on the court cases. 
However, he and his team must’ve decided to change course, because he later said that he believes the verdict could end up “helping” Trump since it was the “weakest case” brought against him. 
One thing that was brought up in plenty of conversations both at the venue and the side events were the Jamie Dimon knock-offs stationed outside the entry doors. And, honestly, is it even a crypto conference if there aren’t some weird shenanigans taking place? (The answer is no.)
I still couldn’t tell you exactly what the point was, though — according to a press release in my inbox — the company behind the stunts is UNFK, “a secret society and Web3 game to prank the world’s largest corrupt corporations.”
While I heard reports about the lack of deodorant at ETH Denver, I can promise you that wasn’t the case at Consensus. I caught the strong whiff of cologne multiple times as I wandered the venue hall, even tearing up from the odor once or twice. 
There were also a large number of kids, at least on Friday, but perhaps that’s a sign of crypto maturing — though not in the way most of us expect I guess.
But, back to what’s important: Overall, it was a fun event and it felt like crypto really has bounced back. Vibes were high, side event food was good and there were productive conversations both on and off stage.

Roaring Kitty Faces ETrade Ban as GameStop Holdings Surge 48%: Report - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFamed investor and meme stock celebrity Keith Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty, may be dropped from top retail stock trading platform ETrade, according to a Wall Street Journal report.Citing “people familiar with the matter,” the WSJ said Monday that ETrade, owned by investment giant Morgan Stanley, is “growing concerned about potential stock manipulation around his recent purchases of GameStop (GME) stock.” The exclusive report comes as Gill's long-dormant account on Reddit posted a screenshot late Sunday of an investment account holding over $200 million worth of GameStop shares and call options.The return of Roaring Kitty to Twitter last month, and the DeepFuckingValue account on Reddit yesterday, has undoubtedly moved the market. After a Twitter post broke a two-week silence, the price of GME stock nearly doubled before the stock market opened the week. That price surge brought a big hit to GME short sellers, who stood to lose almost $1 billion betting against it.Even the unofficial GME tribute meme coin on Solana saw its price skyrocket over 150%.All of this echoes the meme stock mania that gripped both social media and traditional markets in 2021, where short-sellers of stocks like GME and AMC Entertainment (GME) were targeted by Roaring Kitty and other disillusioned investors, boosting their prices and causing significant losses for institutional fund managers.That frenzy caused many investment platforms—including the popular Robinhood app—to frequently halt trading of the suddenly volatile stocks, to great uproar—and eventually hearings on Capitol Hill.In fact, the WSJ reports, Morgan Stanley employees had been monitoring Gill's ETrade account since Roaring Kitty resurfaced on Twitter in mid-May, after more than two years away.The employees “saw he had purchased call options before the tweet,” and that “Gill’s trades likely generated profits thanks to the stock move his tweet generated,” the Journal reported.With GME seeing a new flurry of activity, ETrade appears to be considering pulling the plug on Gill. Based on the Reddit posts, he stands to make a tidy sum if his latest bet—that GME stock will be worth more than $20 on June 21—turns out to be true. Those who follow his lead would gain as well.Today alone, the Roaring Kitty account is up 48%, or about $85 million, according to investment tracker @unusual_whales on Twitter.Parent company Morgan Stanley engaged its financial crimes unit and external counsel on the matter. But the company knows that taking action would mean “drawing the attention of his meme army.““Morgan Stanley employees have been concerned that closing Gill’s account could result in the firm losing ETrade clients,” the Wall Street Journal noted.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Binance Announces Major Changes To Stablecoin Access In Europe From June 30 | Bitcoinist.com


								Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has recently announced significant changes to its stablecoin regulations in Europe. 
Starting from the end of June, Binance will begin restricting access to “unauthorized” stablecoins in compliance with the new MiCA stablecoin rules across the European Economic Area (EEA). 
Binance Adapts To New Stablecoin Regulations
Under the new regulations, only regulated companies will be permitted to issue and offer stablecoins to the public, which will be classified as “Regulated Stablecoins.” 
As a result, several existing stablecoins may not meet the requirements to be categorized as such. They will consequently be subject to certain restrictions, earning them the “Unauthorized Stablecoins.”

To ensure a clear transition for its users and comply with the MiCA stablecoin rules, Binance will implement phased changes to the availability of Unauthorized Stablecoins, as announced on Monday. These changes will affect various aspects of Binance’s product offerings.
Starting from June 30, the exchange will restrict the availability of the labeled Unauthorized Stablecoins for EEA users across its entire range of products and services. This includes Binance Convert, Spot Trading, Wallet, and more. 
Users cannot engage in new products or services involving Unauthorized Stablecoins. Binance aims to prevent market disruptions and ensure compliance with the MiCA stablecoin rules.
Impacts will also be felt in various areas of Binance’s ecosystem. Rewards, such as those obtained from the Rewards Center, Campaigns, and Referrals, will be altered to be distributed in Regulated Stablecoins, BNB, or other non-stablecoin tokens. 
More Changes Ahead
Spot Copy Trading will cease to be available for EEA users on June 29. Individuals using this service are advised to close their positions and transfer their funds to their respective Spot Wallets before the specified date and time. 
Margin trading will also be affected, as new borrowings and transfers of Unauthorized Stablecoins as collateral into users’ Margin Wallets will be blocked. Existing Margin loans, however, will remain unaffected and will not be subject to forced liquidation until further notice. 
Margin traders impacted by these changes are encouraged to close margin loans involving Unauthorized Stablecoins. Existing holdings of Unauthorized Stablecoins in Margin Wallets may still be utilized for trading until further notice.

Binance’s Launchpad, Launchpool, Simple Earn, Loans & VIP Loans, Auto-Invest, Dual Investment, Cloud Mining, Binance Pay, Send Cash, Red Packet, NFT purchases, Spend To Earn, Gift Cards, Web3 Wallet – Earn Section, P2P, and OTC trades will also experience specific restrictions or changes related to Unauthorized Stablecoins.

As of press time, the exchange’s native token, BNB, is currently trading at $623, following the broader market’s recovery with a 4.5% gain in the past 24 hours, inching closer to its yearly high of $642 reached in mid-March.

Bitcoin Has Solid On-Chain Cushion Below $68,900: Stage Set For Fresh Rally?


																On-chain data shows Bitcoin could have significant support between $66,900 and $68,900, which may help provide solid ground for a fresh surge to higher levels.
A Large Amount Of Investors Bought Their Bitcoin Between $66,900 & $68,900
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, BTC is currently floating above a major demand zone. In on-chain analysis, the strength of any support or resistance level is based on how much “demand” was present at it.

Below is a chart that shows the various Bitcoin price ranges near the current spot value and how they compare in terms of the total amount of the asset the investors purchased.
The latest cost basis distribution of the asset around the current price levels | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
Here, the size of the dot correlates to the total number of tokens that were last acquired at the corresponding price range. It would appear that, out of these zones, the levels between $66,900 and $68,900 currently host the cost basis of the greatest amount of BTC.
More than two million addresses have acquired 1.1 million BTC inside this range. Since the current BTC spot price is above these levels, all investors who buy there will make slight profits.
Investor cost basis is important in the on-chain analysis because the level has special psychological significance. A potential retest of it can result in a flip of the profit-loss balance for the holder.
As such, investors may be prone to making some moves when a retest like this takes place. A holder carrying losses before the retest (that is, the retest is happening from below) may be tempted to sell for fear that the price will go down in the future.
On the other hand, an investor in the green before the retest may have reason to believe the price would go up again and, thus, could decide to accumulate more.
When retests of price ranges thick with investors, one of these reactions may arise on a scale that could be relevant for the wider market, therefore, major demand zones below can act as support points, while those above can act as resistance blocks.

Bitcoin has a large support range of $66,900 to $68,900 right now, which could help cushion any falls should the asset’s price decrease.
From the chart, it’s also apparent that, at the same time, the Bitcoin ranges ahead are thin with holders. This could, in theory, provide the ideal conditions for a rally towards higher levels.
BTC Price
Bitcoin surged past the $70,000 level earlier in the day, but the asset has since retraced to $69,100.

Global AI Adoption Hits 72%, Generative AI Use Doubles in 2024: Report - Decrypt

More than seven out of 10 of businesses and organizations around the world are using artificial intelligence, a new study by the global management consulting firm McKinsey has found, a significant increase from the approximately 50% adoption rate observed a year ago.In a survey of more than 1,363 respondents, 72% said their organizations had adopted some form of AI in at least one business function, and 65% said their organizations were regularly using generative AI—twice the 33% rate reported in 2023.The impact of AI and generative AI extends across borders and industries. Last year, AI adoption was no higher than 66% in any part of the world, but this year, more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly every region report their organizations are using AI—with the largest increases in the Asia-Pacific region and China.The study garnered responses from 1,363 participants through an online survey in early 2024, with the results released last week. McKinsey says the data set could represent a full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. To adjust for differences in response rates, McKinsey weighted the data by the contribution of each respondent's nation to global gross domestic product (GDP).Last year, McKinsey published a report stating that "Generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually" to the world economy. This is equivalent to 15 to 40 percent of the entire economic impact of artificial intelligence as a whole.While AI, or artificial intelligence, is a broad term that encompasses various technologies designed to emulate human intelligence, generative AI is a specific subset of AI that focuses on creating new content. Traditional AI systems often analyze and interpret data, make decisions, and solve problems based on pre-existing information. But Generative AI uses deep learning techniques to generate new data that resembles the training dataset. This can include creating text, images, music, and even limited 3D worlds.Broken down by industry, the biggest increase in AI use was found in professional services, including human resources, legal services, and management consulting, where organizations are leveraging its power for areas that require human interaction for repetitive tasks.“The average organization using gen AI is doing so in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service development,” the study says. In sales alone, the use of generative AI has more than doubled since last year.The use of AI has matured, McKinsey reports, with organizations now more involved in mitigating its risks—particularly in terms of hallucinations and intellectual property infringement. The top concern among respondents was tackling inaccuracy, rising from 56% to 63%. Workforce and labor displacement fell as a concern, from 34% to 27%.Of the risk categories surveyed, respondents were least worried about environmental impact, political stability, and physical safety.Perhaps not surprisingly, McKinsey said AI adoption is boosting company bottom lines.“Respondents most commonly report meaningful revenue increases of more than 5% in supply chain and inventory management,” the study says.The study also found that many organizations are not just using off-the-shelf AI solutions but are customizing them or developing their own proprietary models. This trend towards tailoring AI technologies to meet specific business needs and achieve competitive advantage is particularly prevalent in industries with high public engagement, McKinsey notes.“Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs,” the report said.The study also found a significant increase in the use of generative AI both at work and in personal lives compared to last year. With the explosion of popularity of tools like ChatGPT, MidJourney and Stable Diffusion, people are using generative AI for more than business, exploring entertainment, education, and even simulating social interactions.For McKinsey, AI is more than just hype or a business trend. Generative AI is proving to be a business-changing technology.“If 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI, 2024 is the year organizations truly began using—and deriving business value from—this new technology,” the report concludes.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Early Ethereum ($ETH) Investors Cash Out After 1,200,000% Gain Since ICO | Cryptoglobe


                                
Two early Ethereum investors have recently moved the funds that they acquired at the time of the network’s initial coin offering (ICO), to seemingly cash out their funds after they appreciated around 1,200,000% from their purchase price.



According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, two separate Ethereum ICO participants have recently deposited a total of 9,518 ETH worth around $36.3 million at the time of the deposit onto popular centralized cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.



The deposit came after they invested in the now second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at the time of its Genesis, with its price then being of around $0.31 per ETH, meaning that the value of their funds appreciate 1,200,000% since then, with one ETH now trading at $3,780.







The ICO participants, however, deposited only a portion of the 200,000 ETH their received at the time they purchased it during the ICO, having spent $62,000 on the cryptocurrency, with their holdings now worth well over $750 million.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The transactions came after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved form 19b-4 filings for several spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a move that sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market and paving the way for these products to start trading.



Michael Nadeau, a prominent crypto analyst, recently provided an in-depth analysis of the current and future state of the cryptocurrency market, with a particular focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggesting ETH could significantly outperform BTC in the near future.



On top of that, data shows that since Ethereum transitioned into a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm and after the London hard fork, over $16.6 billion worth of the cryptocurrency have been burned.



The London hard fork included the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which changed the way transaction fees on the network work.

Bitcoin (BTC) to Test $70,000 Again This Week? XRP Fights for Bull Market Comeback, Did Ethereum (ETH) Hit Plateau?

Bitcoin did not give up on the $68,000-$70,000 price range and might be gaining some momentum for a breakthrough attempt. The digital gold is currently trading at around $69,000, bouncing off of the 26 EMA. However, $69,400 is a significant resistance threshold that may cause some serious trouble if BTC does not gain enough momentum.As Bitcoin attempts to break through the critical $70,000 barrier once more, the BTC/USD chart shows a bullish sentiment. The price has demonstrated resilience and the possibility of upward movement by recently rebounding off the 26-day Exponential Moving Average. BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewThis rebound implies that buyers are intervening and giving the market the support it needs to remain above $68,000. Currently Bitcoin is battling the $69,400 resistance level, a critical point that has historically been challenging to surpass. If this level is not broken, there could be a reversal toward $70,000 and lower.A correction may find additional support at the 50-day EMA and the 100-day EMA, which are both positioned below the current price. The trading volume has increased somewhat, suggesting that traders are becoming more interested and involved. Any meaningful price movement must be sustained by this volume spike.XRP's questionable stateXRP is currently in a mixed state: on the one hand, the asset is still heavily suppressed; on the other, it is gaining some power and potentially even gaining some strength for a bounce. One way or another, it is still moving under the 50 EMA and definitely has to break through in order to be considered a bounce contender.Given that XRP has not yet been able to decisively break through the 50-day EMA it is especially important. If the price continues to rise above this barrier, it may be a sign that buyers are taking charge and driving up the price. But the bearish attitude might still be prevalent as long as XRP stays below this mark.The low trading volume may indicate a lack of confidence among traders. XRP will require more trading volume to sustain the price movement in order to create a successful recovery. Strong participation is usually indicated by high volume, which can also confirm the direction of the price trend. The RSI is in a neutral zone, at around 50 and does not provide any substantial insight.Ethereum's issueEthereum is clearly facing some struggles as the asset has stayed in the same trading range for the last few weeks. Considering the trading volume, it is not the issue, since bears are not really ready to push it downwards. But there is also an important factor to consider: the exhaustion of bulls.The Ethereum/USD chart indicates that the cryptocurrency has been settling into a small range, approximately ranging from $3,750 to $3,850. The price has not broken out considerably higher despite prior bullish momentum suggesting a possible plateau. Although sellers are not actively bringing prices down this stagnation may be the result of bullish exhaustion, in which buyers lack the power to drive prices higher. More context is given by the chart's moving averages. But failing to break above the present resistance level around $3,850 might indicate a consolidation phase or even a possible retreat. The current range needs to be broken, and volume analysis indicates that trading activity has not increased significantly. Increased market participation would be indicated by a spike in volume, which might encourage a breakout. The low but consistent volume for the time being indicates that traders are waiting to see what will happen before making a big move. Ethereum is getting close to overbought conditions, as indicated by the RSI, which is currently trading between 60 and 70. Even if it is not a drastic scenario, it implies that the upside potential might be constrained in the absence of a market correction or consolidation period.

Profits of Bitcoin short-term holders dip 32%, but here's the good news - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s short-term holder metric showed the recent consolidation has eroded their profits.
An influx of new investors could arrive, which might lead to a price breakout.

Bitcoin [BTC] short-term holder (STH) profits were down 32%, crypto analyst Axel Adler observed. On the 13th of March, the profit of STHs was 42%.
At press time, even though the price of Bitcoin is not much lower, the profit is at 10%.

This is a positive development. The consolidation of the past two months has done its job and shaken out the impatient market participants. The high-profit levels have also been reset, giving Bitcoin bulls renewed energy to drive prices higher.
AMBCrypto took a closer look at on-chain metrics to understand the behavior of short-term and long-term holders, and what insights that could have for the future price trends.
Using the realized price age bands to understand holders’ sentiment

The UTXO realized price age distribution metric showed that holders whose Bitcoin is aged 1 month to 18 months saw increased activity since March. The degree of this increase varied, with the shorter-term holders being more active in the markets.
On the other hand, the 18-month to 3-year-old Bitcoin saw a decline in activity. This was a sign of reduced coin movement from these holders, which further outlined strong bullish expectations from the long-term investors.
New investors could be poised to enter the market soon
Historically, the first two months after the halving have seen BTC consolidate. The reduced activity among the older cohorts reflects this expectation as they did not see a dramatic shift in activity in the past two months.

Another post from Axel Adler highlighted this. The realized market capitalization from investors holding BTC for less than a month had fallen dramatically in recent weeks but was beginning to climb higher again.

If this uptrend continues, it could mark a new phase of price expansion for Bitcoin. Investors and traders could keep a close eye on this metric.
With STH profits down, we will likely see a move northward, but the demand was not yet in place to drive this price move.

Ripple CEO Delivers Harsh Criticism For Dogecoin, What's The Problem? | Bitcoinist.com


								The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, has taken an unexpected swipe at Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin by market capitalization. Garlinghouse has criticized Dogecoin, claiming it lacks real utility due to its meme-based nature. 
“Dogecoin Has Not Been Good For The Industry”
At the Consensus 2024 Conference, one of the world’s largest and longest-running crypto-focused gatherings, Garlinghouse publicly criticized Dogecoin (DOGE), disparaging its intrinsic value and real-world use cases. 

The Ripple CEO shed light on the prevailing speculation narrative surrounding the cryptocurrency sector, implying that the crypto industry has not yet achieved widespread acceptance and regulatory clarity, given its status as a nascent and speculative global industry. 
Additionally, Garlinghouse disclosed that the crypto sector must transcend its speculative narrative, suggesting that meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, which thrives on speculation, presented a significant hurdle to the industry’s evolutionary progress. 
The Ripple CEO also stated during the conference that Dogecoin has not been a good development for the crypto industry. He acknowledged that he was not opposed to Dogecoin, but emphasized his uncertainty about the meme coin’s real-world applications. Moreover, he pointed out that Dogecoin lacked projects aimed at providing practical solutions to utility needs. 
As a meme coin, Dogecoin’s value is primarily influenced by its community, popularity and social media trends. Although the meme coin was created as a joke in late 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, over the years, Dogecoin has grown astronomically. 
The cryptocurrency has consistently pushed beyond the bounds of the meme coin status, cultivating a community with millions of investors and supporters and rising to an all-time high of $0.73. Additionally, Dogecoin has gained recognition from prominent celebrities including SpaceX and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk. 
While the doggy-themed meme coin may not have tangible use cases, Dogecoin remains a valuable investment in the crypto industry. Additionally, it acts as a cross-border payment solution for many crypto users, offering users reduced fees and faster transactions, in contrast to Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. 
Problem Solving Takes Centre Stage In Crypto Industry
While speaking at the Consensus 2024 conference, Garlinghouse disclosed that the advancement of the crypto industry depends on solving real problems. He stressed that beyond Dogecoin, he had observed substantial utility emerging from various crypto projects across different chains, indicating that these practical solutions are what will ultimately improve the industry in the long run. 

An example of a crypto project focused on solving problems in the industry could be said to be Ripple. Operating as a cryptocurrency payments system, Ripple strives to become a payment settlement asset exchange and remittance system, offering a more efficient alternative to SWIFT, the vast messaging network utilized by banks and other financial institutions. 
Ripple’s use cases are extensive but primarily center on utilizing blockchain technology and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) native token, XRP to facilitate transactions between financial institutions, businesses and organizations.

Trader Says Ethereum-Based Altcoin ‘About To Get Sent,’ Predicts Massive Q4 Rallies for Bitcoin, ETH and Solana - The Daily Hodl


								Widely followed trader Inmortal says this year will see massive rallies for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and one additional altcoin.
The pseudonymous trader tells his 214,000 followers on the social media platform X that API3 (API3), a decentralized data oracle network that aims to connect traditional APIs with blockchain applications, is ready to “get sent” after a long consolidation period.










Inmortal mentions API3’s recent strategic funding round led by digital asset investment firm DWF labs and the bullish technicals on the altcoin’s chart.
“API3 about to get sent.
API3 has successfully concluded a strategic funding round, allocating treasury assets in exchange for four million USDC.
About the chart? nothing more to add, it’s just hyper bullish.
> +600 days accumulation over
> Clean retest of acc zone.
Send it.”
Source: Inmortal/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that the Ethereum-based altcoins will hit $6. At time of writing, API3 is trading at $3.37, up over 9% in the past day.
Looking at the broader markets, Inmortal is predicting strong 2024 finishes for BTC, ETH and SOL. According to the analyst, the next couple of months will likely be uneventful for much of the digital asset markets but expects a full-blown “parabolic uptrend” in Q4.
“> Boring June-July (chop + some traps for both sides)
> Uptrend resume in August
> Parabolic trend all Q4
BTC goes above $100,000, ETH above $10,000, $SOL above $500.
Altcoins do a x2-x5
Charts never lie.”

Dapper Labs Reaches $4 Million Settlement in NBA Top Shot NFT Lawsuit - Decrypt

Dapper Labs, the company behind NBA Top Shot and other prominent on-chain collectibles, has settled a yearslong class action lawsuit with disgruntled customers who argued that Top Shot NFTs constituted illegally offered securities, court filings revealed Monday.As part of the settlement, Dapper will pay out $4 million to the suit’s plaintiffs, the company’s CEO, Roham Gharegozlou, told Decrypt. Those funds include monetary relief for the plaintiffs’ claims, and will also cover legal fees.In return, if the settlement is approved, the plaintiffs will forfeit any future right to claim that Top Shot NFTs are securities, per Gharegozlou. “The settlement provides legal clarity and frees the Dapper Labs team up to focus on its core mission—delivering unparalleled experiences for its core users,” the executive said.Last February, a federal judge ruled—in a major setback for Dapper—that the lawsuit could proceed, given that Top Shot NFTs “plausibly” met the definition of a securities offering. Key to the judge’s finding was the fact that Top Shot NFTs live on Flow, a blockchain network originally developed by Dapper. The judge deemed Flow a “private” blockchain, in contrast with networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are not controlled by any one entity. Further, the judge found that statements made by Dapper and its representatives, including Gharegozlou, had implied the collectibles would increase in value over time. The company has insisted in the past—and Gharegozlou maintained today—that Flow is sufficiently decentralized and not under Dapper’s control, given that the network is maintained by the independent Flow Foundation.The Dapper co-founder added, however, that the class action suit’s plaintiffs demanded “certain business changes” at the company as a condition of the settlement. Those demands, which have been accepted by Dapper, include the company’s relinquishing of any FLOW tokens in its possession allocated for Ecosystem Reserve to the Flow Foundation.Other demands, such as that third party marketplaces besides Dapper be permitted to transact Top Shot NFTs, and that the company process withdrawals in a more timely manner, were already remedied years ago.When the suit was first filed in 2021—the heyday of the digital asset boom—it marked one of the first tests of the security status of NFTs. Since then, huge swathes of the crypto fungible token market have come under fire by American regulators. Except for sporadic circumstances featuring particular facts, NFTs appear to have—at least, for now—avoided such asset class-wide repudiation.Edited by Andrew Hayward. This article has been updated to clarify the demands of the plaintiffs.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Trump Conviction Barely Dents His Odds of Winning Election: Prediction Markets

On PredictIt, a more mainstream betting site where trades are placed in dollars rather than stablecoins, the Trump contract actually gained 1 cent following the guilty verdict, although at 51-48 his lead over Biden is narrower and closer to the polls than on Polymarket. Unlike Polymarket, which blocks U.S. users under a regulatory settlement but has traders around the world, PredictIt is open only to Americans.

'Bank to the Stars' Facing $770,000,000 Lawsuit for Allegedly Aiding Ponzi Scheme, Ignoring Glaring Red Flags: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A lender known as the “bank to the stars” is being sued for $770 million for allegedly aiding and abetting a Hollywood Ponzi scheme.
Plaintiffs for the lawsuit accuse the Los Angeles-based lender City National Bank (CNB) of enabling a fraudulent scheme that bilked hundreds of investors, reports the Los Angeles Times.










The lawsuit alleges CNB provided millions of dollars in loans to Zachary Horwitz, the mastermind of a film-licensing scheme that fleeced more than $690 million from friends, family and other investors.
In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Horwitz had been convicted of violating multiple securities laws for duping victims with claims that investors would see more than 35% returns from his business of selling movie rights to Netflix and HBO. But in reality, Horwitz never sold any movie rights to the streaming services and used the money to fund his luxurious lifestyle and satisfy earlier investors.
The lawsuit claims that between 2013 and 2019, the lender processed $1 billion in transactions for Hortwitz, issued $64.2 million in loans and gave him 456 credit extensions.
The bank also allegedly ignored “glaring red flags” and “bent the rules” for Horwitz throughout the years while substantially assisting him by “adding an air of legitimacy” to his Ponzi scheme. According to the lawsuit, City National Bank knew that Horwitz bragged about his relationship with the lender in the documents he shared with investors.
The plaintiffs are asking the court to order CNB to pay $770 million to victims of Horwitz’s scheme.
A spokesperson at the lender says the bank won’t comment on ongoing litigation.
City National Bank has more than $93.72 billion in assets with 70 locations across eight states.

Iggy Azalea Goes Full Solana With Mad Lads PFP as MOTHER Nears $90 Million Market Cap - Decrypt

Rapper Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER token on Solana saw a spark of trading demand over the weekend, surging to an all-time high price on Saturday—just days after it launched. And the musician, who has been broadly embraced by Crypto Twitter, continued her constant tweeting with a familiar-looking profile picture (PFP) in tow.Azalea started rocking a custom Mad Lads PFP on Friday, one day after the Solana project tweeted out a custom honorary avatar for her that was apparently based on a photo reference. Mad Lads is the most valuable Solana NFT collection by a wide margin, currently standing at over $10,300 worth of SOL on secondary marketplaces.One day after equipping the PFP, Azalea’s MOTHER token jumped to a new peak price of $0.08952, per data from CoinMarketCap, giving it a market cap of $88.7 million.The price fell by nearly half by Sunday night, but then rebounded again on Monday, nearly matching the previous peak before starting to dip again. As of this writing, MOTHER sits at a price above $0.72, giving it a market cap over $70 million. It’s up 34% on the day.The rapper’s crypto market entrance last week was marked by drama. She launched the token after controversial crypto promoter Sahil Arora—who had helped deploy Caitlin Jenner’s meme coin earlier in the week—teased an IGGY token and collected $380,000 worth of presale funds for a token that ultimately had nothing to do with her.Azalea said that ultimately she decided not to work with Arora, and tweeted at him publicly to “take your L and go already.” Azalea was widely praised by traders on Twitter for being so heavily engaged and admitting that she was learning as she went, promising that the meme coin wouldn’t be a simple cash grab or pump-and-dump.Nearly a week later, she’s still in the arena (of Crypto Twitter), spreading memes and rocking a custom PFP as her token again flirts with higher gains.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Dapper Labs Agrees to $4M Settlement in Class Action Securities Suit

“We are continuing to push for more overarching regulatory clarity to showcase that consumer NFTs are not financial products and, as such, should be regulated under well-established consumer protection regimes at the state level,” Gharegozlou said. “This includes pushing for legislation at the federal level that makes it clear that consumer product NFTs, such as NBA Top Shot, are not subject to federal financial regulation.”

XRP's $299M question: Are whales betting big on a rally? - AMBCrypto



XRP remains sluggish with a mixed derivatives market, waning trader interest, and declining social volume.
Whales remain very interested in XRP as they acquire $299million worth of tokens in 24 hours.

Ripple [XRP] has continued with its sluggish performance, making no moves over the past week. 
The crypto community and whales, in general, have always valued XRP, but as time goes on, it becomes increasingly difficult to see it being one of the top performers of this bull cycle.
XRP shows mixed signals
The XRP derivatives market is presenting a mixed but interesting picture. Despite the token’s somewhat stagnant price movement, the trading volume has surged dramatically, showing a spike in trader activity and interest. 
Source: Coinglass
However, this hasn’t translated into a similar rise in open interest. So, while transactions are frequent, they may not be resulting in new or sustained positions, possibly due to traders being quick to take profits or cut losses amid uncertainty.
Source: Coinglass
Moreover, data from Whale Alert revealed that whales are, as usual, stacking up on XRP. In just twenty-four hours, they acquired nearly $300m in XRP. 
XRP’s general trend shows a decline in social engagement, which might mirror the current lackluster performance.
 The crypto community’s waning interest, as reflected in declining social volumes, could be a response to its ongoing performance issues, indicating a cooling off in investor sentiment towards the Ripple token.
Source: Santiment
The XRP chart, however, shows us a clear bearish sentiment among traders. The price has recently been oscillating just below the significant moving average lines, which are converging around $0.5162, suggesting a potential area of resistance.
Source: TradingView
The RSI, currently hovering around 53.34, supports this bearish outlook, indicating a state of equilibrium where buying and selling pressures are somewhat balanced. 
Given the subdued trading volume, the token appears to be consolidating within a narrow range, awaiting either a catalyst to spark a breakout or a further breakdown.

Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2024-2025

For short-term traders, the key levels to watch would be the resistance at the moving averages and support around $0.5162. 
A decisive break below this support could confirm a bearish trajectory for XRP, whereas a push above the moving averages will signal a move toward a more bullish market sentiment.

Major Milestone: Hong Kong Regulator Approves 11 Crypto Exchanges To Operate In The City | Bitcoinist.com


								The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has recently granted initial approval to 11 cryptocurrency exchanges to continue operating in the city. 
This marks the first step towards issuing virtual asset trading platform (VATP) licenses since 2022. The move comes as Hong Kong aims to establish itself as a prominent crypto hub alongside global counterparts like Singapore and Dubai.
Hong Kong’s Crypto Exchange Scene Faces Regulatory Hurdles
According to a South China Morning Post report, among the approved exchanges, Crypto.com, originally founded in Hong Kong and now operating from Singapore, stands out as the largest exchange “deemed to be licensed.” 
Notably, it is the only exchange within the top 20 by 24-hour trading volume measured by CoinGecko, still seeking a license in Hong Kong. Bullish, incorporated in Gibraltar but also operating from Singapore and New York, is the next significant exchange deemed licensed.

Under the new regulations introduced last year, cryptocurrency exchanges must obtain approval for the deeming arrangement to continue operating while awaiting full licensing approval. 
The deadline for exchanges not seeking a license to cease operations was June 1. However, some exchanges have withdrawn their license applications due to complications arising from the regulatory changes.
Several exchanges that withdrew their applications had ties to mainland China, where they were originally founded but left following Beijing’s crackdown on digital tokens. Notable exchanges include local affiliates of major platforms such as OKX, Binance, HTX, KuCoin, Gate.io, and, most recently, Bybit. 
The Hong Kong government has emphasized compliance with regulations, including measures to prevent mainland Chinese residents from accessing crypto platforms and the recently approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) markets. 
Market Confidence Shaken? 
Per the report, the withdrawals have raised concerns about Hong Kong’s progress in attracting crypto-related businesses and developing a thriving Web3 ecosystem. The city began its efforts to become a crypto hub in late 2022. 
Legislative Council member Duncan Chiu, representing the information technology sector, expressed in an opinion piece that the withdrawals had shaken market confidence in local Web3 development. Despite hopes of accessing mainland Chinese customers, Beijing maintains a strict ban on commercial crypto activities on the mainland. 
The financial authority of Shenzhen, the city neighboring Hong Kong, recently issued a warning against cross-border cryptocurrency trading, emphasizing that such activities are “illegal and subject to criminal liabilities.” 
The notice also highlighted the dangers of crypto-related fraud and reiterated the illegality of providing internet services to mainland customers without approval.

Overall, Hong Kong’s granting of initial approval to exchanges represents a significant step in the city’s regulatory journey toward becoming an innovation hub. However, challenges remain, including withdrawing exchanges with mainland Chinese ties and Beijing’s strict commercial digital asset activity ban. 
The future of Hong Kong’s virtual asset market will depend on striking a balance between regulatory compliance, market confidence, and attracting businesses within the evolving global crypto landscape.

XRP Hasn’t Had A Bull Cycle Since 2017, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen When It Does


																The XRP price has been a constant point of worry for investors given that the altcoins seems to be frozen in time. The last time that the coin rallied was in the 2017-2018 bull and even though there has been another massive bull market since then, XRP failed to follow the rest of the market. While expectations for the altcoin have dropped dramatically, one analyst believes that the cryptocurrency could finally have its time in the spotlight, revealing targets for when this does happen.
Why XRP Could Be Gearing Up For A Bull Rally
Crypto analyst CryptoManiac101 took to the TradingView platform to share a rather interesting view of the XRP price going forward. The analyst pointed out a number of indicators that suggest that the altcoin may finally be getting ready to move. One of the major points in the analysis was the price levels and movements so far.

	Related Reading


The crypto analyst points out a convergence of three different moving averages in the year 2024. At the end of this is the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern outlined in the chart. Furthermore, the convergence, which is happening around $0.51, suggests that there is consolidation going on. Now, usually, consolidation will come with accumulation, which is often good for the price, and the analyst points out that interest is rising.
Going further, the crypto analyst points to the performance of XRP over the last 11 years. This begins from 2013 and moves to present time, showing how the performance of XRP has actually flattened during this time. “Significant historical price spikes, particularly in 2017 and 2018, are visible, which is what we are looking at for 2024 and 2025 years as we see some movement consistency between the two cycles,” the analyst stated.
Source: Tradingview.com
With interesting rising, these indicators could point toward an important breakout for the price. If this happens, the crypto analyst has outlined targets for how high the price could go.
How High Can The Price Go?
One major factor in the analyst’s prediction is the fact that such historical patterns have been previously bullish for XRP to have returned. The analyst points out that a rally usually breaks out when these patterns have seen a 75% completion. However, the current patterns have reached 88.93% completion, suggesting that a breakout is long overdue for the XRP price.

	Related Reading


In the event of a rally, the crypto analyst expects an at least 800% increase in price above $4. This future prediction is based on the potential of a breakout from the symmetrical triangle forming at the convergence of the three moving averages. In this case, the analyst expects a rally to $4.5 as a starting point.

Bitcoin's Next Leap:: Billionaire Points To $500,000 Per BTC-Here's When & How


								Chamath Palihapitiya, a well-known billionaire investor, has joined the dialogue about future Bitcoin Halving events and their implications for the asset in the long term.
According to the Billionaire, this notable event that occurs in the Bitcoin ecosystem every four years could propel Bitcoin’s value to as high as $500,000 in the upcoming years, and here’s how.

Post-Halving Price Movements: A Historical Insight
The premier cryptocurrency has historically shown significant price movements post-halving, with most substantial gains typically occurring 12 to 18 months after the event.
Palihapitiya points out that while the price tends to show modest increases initially, substantial surges have followed previous Halvings. For instance, the first Halving led to a more than tenfold increase six months later and 45.52x after 18 months.

Subsequent cycles also saw significant but slightly more moderate gains. For context, after 18 months of the second Halving, the Bitcoin price saw a 27.92x increase, and the third Halving rose nearly 8x.
Bitcoin has been consolidating in the current cycle, which Palihapitiya interprets as part of its usual growth trajectory. He suggests that if Bitcoin follows the patterns observed in the second and third cycles, there could be an exponential rise, potentially reaching as high as $500,000 by October 2025.

Bitcoin’s Path to $500K And The Dual Currency Future
Elaborating on the potential of BTC hitting $500,000, Palihapitiya added that this cycle is distinct due to the “commercialization” of BTC, highlighted by the introduction of spot ETF products in the US, which could influence the cryptocurrency’s valuation significantly.

Palihapitiya states that these financial products allow “Bitcoin to cross the chasm” and have its “central key moment.” He further explains the evolving global financial landscape, predicting a future in which many countries will adopt a “dual currency” system.
According to the Billionaire, countries will increasingly recognize the need for their local currency for everyday transactions and BTC for acquiring substantial assets with enduring digital value.

Palihapitiya concluded, emphasizing the “transformative” potential of BTC:
 I think that is a very powerful concept. If these things start to get to these levels of appreciation, it [BTC] is going to completely replace gold and start to become something that has transactional utility for hard assets. And I think if you marry that with the worry that some folks have for the dollar debasement, you start to see some really interesting opportunities.

$68K or $74K: How Bitcoin's next move depends on this key level - AMBCrypto



The 1-hour chart showed that BTC formed an asymmetric triangle, suggesting a breakout
If the price closes above the resistance, it could hit an all-time high soon.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] price seemed to have displayed two opposing signals. If one goes through, it could make way for a higher value. However, if the other comes first, holders of the coin would have to deal with a price decrease.
Analyst Ali Martinez made this known in two different posts on X. In his first post,  Martinez mentioned that Bitcoin had formed an asymmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, indicating that the price could jump to $74,400.
It’s a breakout or breakdown
But there was one condition attached to it. The prediction might only come to pass if Bitcoin closes above the $69,330 resistance.
An asymmetrical triangle occurs when two trendlines with opposing slopes converge. A close above the upper resistance in this instance brings about breakout.
Source: X
On the other hand, if the price dumps into the support, a notable correction could be next. At press time, Bitcoin changed hands at $69,031, meaning it was close to the resistance point.
However, the analyst’s second post focused on the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential. According to him, this indicator had flashed a sell signal which could send BTC down to $68,050.
Again, he mentioned that the next direction for the coin depends on the resistance as mentioned earlier. Beyond this technical data, it is also important to look at Bitcoin’s price action from an on-chain perspective.
One of the metrics AMBCrypto examined was the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD). This metric how far long-term coins are moving in large amounts.
HODLing continues as liquidity hunt begins
If the CDD is high, BTC might become extremely volatile, and selling pressure could cause a price decrease. This was the situation with Bitcoin on the 28th of May.
However, press time data showed that the CDD was down to 4.55 million. In this instance, long-term coins are not moving around as participants are sticking to holding.
Source: Glassnode
If this continues, then the bullish prediction of $74,400 might triumph over the potential decline to $68,050. To buttress this point, AMBCrypto also looked at the liquidation heatmap.
The heatmap can help traders identify high areas of liquidity. And if there is a magnetic area, the price can rise in that direction. At press time, there was a high level of liquidity at $70,300, suggesting that Bitcoin could hit the price.
Source: Hyblock

If attained, this could lead to a breakout to $74,500 where another magnetic zone existed. However, if the uptrend gets rejected, Bitcoin could slump as low as $65,050.
But by the look of things and metrics analyzed, BTC looks set to climb above $74,000.

JPMorgan Chase To Launch Biometric Payments Next Year, Enabling 'Pay With Your Face' Shopping: Report - The Daily Hodl


								JPMorgan Chase is reportedly preparing to launch a biometric payments system for the masses.
The banking giant is preparing a “broad rollout” of an authentication system that will allow retail shoppers to pay with their face or palm next year, reports American Banker.










The system is the result of two pilot projects with the California-based biometrics company PopID.
JPMorgan, which already provides point-of-sale solutions to merchants, says it ran pilot tests for the system at brick-and-mortar stores in the US as well as internally at an office cafeteria.
Jean-Marc Thienpont, head of omnichannel and biometric solutions at JPMorgan Payments, says the bank believes the system will reduce checkout time and boost security.
“At its heart, biometrics-based payments empowers our merchant clients to deliver a better customer payment experience. 
We are a trusted payments provider and financial institution worldwide, and fully equipped to manage the highly secure identification points that power biometrics solutions. The evolution of consumer technology has created new expectations for shoppers, and merchants need to be ready to adapt to these new expectations.”
A 2023 survey conducted by PYMNTS found 28% of consumers have used facial recognition for an online purchase in the last 30 days.
The business research firm Goode Intelligence projects 3 billion people will pay using biometrics by 2026, with global transactions hitting $5.765 trillion per year.

Fairshake Super PAC Gains $25 Million Boost from Coinbase


Coinbase, a popular crypto exchange in the US, announced an additional $25 million donation to Fairshake Super Political Action Committee (PAC) in a blog post. Coinbase stated that this fund aims to elect pro-crypto candidates and defend crypto users’ rights.
With this latest contribution, Fairshake and its affiliates have raised a total of $160 million this election cycle, making it one of the largest Super PACs.
Crypto Industry’s Influence Grows with Coinbase’s Donation

The donation reflects Coinbase’s strategy to expedite regulatory clarity through legislative and judicial means. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong emphasized the importance of electing pro-crypto candidates to overcome legislative gridlock and ensure the industry’s growth.

“For a bill to become law in the US, it must pass the House, Senate, and be signed into law by the President. And in our divided government, the default is that nothing will happen unless the cost of inaction is greater than doing the right thing. This leads us to an important conclusion: The best way to get regulatory clarity in democratic countries is to elect pro-crypto candidates on both sides of the aisle and to vote anti-crypto candidates out of office,” Armstrong said.

Before Coinbase, Ripple and venture capital firm a16z also donated to Fairshake. Other donors include Gemini’s Winklevoss twins, Jump Crypto, and Union Square Ventures. A report by Public Citizen found that digital asset-affiliated Super PACs, including Fairshake, raised the third-highest amount of all super PACs before the 2024 election.

List of Crypto Firms and Figures Who Donated to Fairshake Super PAC in 2023 – 2024. Source: OpenSecrets
In addition to contributing to Fairshake, Coinbase launched its nonprofit, Stand With Crypto, last August to advance pro-crypto legislation. Coinbase reported that, at the time of writing, StandWithCrypto.org boasts over 900,000 advocates nationwide. Remarkably, this reflects almost a doubling in its membership since May 10, when Stand With Crypto had nearly 500,000 members.

Crypto firms and key industry figures emphasize supporting pro-crypto candidates in the November elections. This move is crucial, given President Joe Biden’s administration’s stringent approach toward the crypto industry. Recently, Biden vetoed H.J. Res.109, a bill that would have overturned the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121).

“My Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors. Appropriate guardrails that protect consumers and investors are necessary to harness the potential benefits and opportunities of crypto-asset innovation,” Biden said on May 31.

SAB 121 requires financial institutions to list customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets. Critics argue this mandate creates substantial operational and financial burdens for firms handling cryptocurrencies and exposes customers’ assets to risks in bankruptcy situations.

Coinbase Donates To Super PAC, Aims To Influence Crypto Politics



	

Key Points:




Coinbase donates an additional $25 million to Fairshake SuperPAC.



Funds used for attack ads against anti-crypto candidates.



Coinbase’s total donation to Fairshake hits $49 million.




According to Bloomberg, Coinbase donates to Super PAC with an extra $25M, which supports pro-crypto candidates, taking total donation to $49M.



 



Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, has donated a further $25 million to the Fairshake SuperPAC. 



The news was shared by the company’s chief executive officer, Brian Armstrong, in a blog post. The donation aims at contributing to an increase in contributions meant to support the election of candidates who are pro-digital assets.



Coinbase Donates to Super PAC To Support Pro-Crypto Candidates



Fairshake SuperPAC, along with its affiliates, managed to gather $160 million in this election cycle, according to Armstrong. 




Andreessen Horowitz, a venture-capital firm whose co-founder Marc Andreessen serves on Coinbase’s board, made a matching donation last week. Crypto firm Ripple made the same donation of $25 million.



Fairshake used the funds to finance attack ads against Representative Katie Porter, a California Democrat known for being an anti-crypto. She had lost a Senate primary election in March. As of April month-end, Fairshake had already spent more than $40 million in this cycle, OpenSecrets reports.

Growing Political Influence of Crypto Industry in Upcoming Elections



In his blog post, Armstrong said crypto voters will not be taken seriously until they send a clear message that opposing crypto is a political liability. He stated that the aim is to support pro-crypto candidates from both parties and vote out anti-crypto ones.





Coinbase’s latest donation, which brings the company’s total donation to Fairshake to $49 million, underlines the growing political influence of the crypto industry during the upcoming presidential and congressional elections. 



The industry has often clashed with regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and has been advocating for new legislation to help crypto business in the US.

Bitcoin Sellers Running Out? Trader Realized Profit Dips 32%


								Data shows that Bitcoin short-term holders have seen a decrease in their realized profit, a sign that their appetite for harvesting gains may be diminishing.
Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Realizing Much Fewer Profits Now
As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC short-term holders have been realizing much lower amounts of profits recently. The “short-term holders” (STHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days.
Statistically, the longer an investor holds their coins, the less likely they become to sell them. As the STHs are the new entrants in the market, they are unlikely to hold for too long.

Because of this weak resolve, the investors of this cohort tend to easily panic sell whenever something notable happens in the sector, like a rally or crash.
Naturally, the recent run towards the all-time high (ATH) also saw these fickle-minded holders selling. The chart below shows the trend in the “Realized Profit and Loss” indicator for this group, which tells us about the net amount of profit or loss that they have been harvesting recently.

The value of the metric seems to have observed a decline in recent months | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X
As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin STH Realized Profit and Loss metric spiked to highly positive levels when the rally towards the ATH price occurred. More particularly, the indicator’s value hit the 42% mark at the peak of this profit-taking spree.
Since then, as the cryptocurrency price has struggled, the indicator’s value has dropped to just the 10%. As the analyst notes,
The realized profit of short-term holders has fallen by 32%, signaling a lack of investor desire to lock in profits at current levels, essentially anticipating further growth.
This development is potentially not the only positive one for Bitcoin recently. As Axel pointed out in another X post, the Realized Cap of the investors holding for less than a month has been on the rise.
The “Realized Cap” here basically refers to the total amount of capital that the investors have used to purchase the asset, as determined by data available on the blockchain.

As the chart below shows, this metric had earlier been declining for these young investors, even among the STHs, suggesting that fresh interest in the asset had been waning.

Looks like the value of the indicator has turned around in recent days | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X
The Realized Cap for this cohort has recently found a reversal, a potential sign that some new demand is now flowing into the cryptocurrency.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,200, down over 1% in the past seven days.

Solana-Based JTO, Oracle Network PYTH, and Synthetic Dollar ENA: 3 Cryptos to Watch in 2024


							

Cryptocurrency traders expect the market to rally significantly in 2024. 



Bitcoin and Ethereum show direction, while low-cap crypto surge.



JTO, PYTH, and ENA are showing signs of exceptional rallies.




Most cryptocurrency traders anticipate a significant market rally in 2024. Typically, established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum would lead the rally, while other lower market capitalization cryptos make the most significant moves to deliver exceptional profits.



From recent observations, JTO, PYTH, and ENA show potential to become the breakout stars of the upcoming bull run. Although they may be relatively unknown to many crypto users, their performances in the upcoming bull run may push them into the top echelon of the highly ranked altcoins. Let’s take a look at each of them.



Despite its relatively brief existence, Jito Network (JTO) has become one of the leading contributors in the Solana ecosystem. It is a staking protocol that allows users to exchange their SOL for JitoSOL, maintaining SOL’s liquidity and earning yield from staking.



JTO has had a bullish start in the crypto market, rallying over 270% in Q1 2024 before embarking on a slight retracement, according to TradingView’s data. Many crypto users expect the rally to continue, considering JTO’s connection with one of the most promising blockchains, Solana.



PYTH Network (PYTH) also caught the eyes of several crypto traders despite losing nearly all the gains it made earlier in the year. The first-party oracle network’s native token, PYTH, gained over 430% earlier in the year but has since retraced, losing 70% of the profit.



 
 




However, several users believe the newly launched crypto would rebound and reclaim the losses. That places PYTH as a crypto token that could offer significant gains in the upcoming bull run, especially if it climbs above its current all-time high to experience new price levels.



The Ethereum-based synthetic dollar, ENA, completes the list of three crypto tokens users are looking up to for significant rallies in the coming months. The newly launched token started with an impressive 413% rally in the first two weeks.



Early profit-taking saw ENA slump by 57% before finding support. The token’s low market capitalization positions it to rally significantly with increased adoption, considering its crypto-native solution for money that is not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure.

Kraken Sees Largest Bitcoin And Ethereum Outflows Since 2017, What's going On?


								Recent data shows that Kraken, one of the premier crypto exchanges in the market, has witnessed its largest outflows of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) since 2017. This signals a significant shift in digital asset holdings, which could have broad implications for the market.
Kraken’s Historic Outflows, What Is Going On?
Insights from Joao Wedson of Dominando Cripto shared on CryptoQuant’s quick-take platform highlight a startling trend at Kraken. The exchange recorded an outflow of 49,100 BTC, translating to approximately $3.33 billion.

This massive withdrawal marks the largest movement of funds from the exchange in dollar terms. Ethereum was not left behind, with roughly 572,100 ETH, valued at around $2.15 billion, also exiting the platform.
This substantial reduction has brought Kraken’s Bitcoin reserves down to levels last seen in 2018, holding about 122,300 BTC. Even more notably, Ethereum reserves have dipped below one million for the first time since early 2016.

While this news may initially seem alarming, Wedson reveals that address screenings indicate the asset movements were “synchronized and rapid,” suggesting these outflows might have been the strategic repositioning of reserves by Kraken itself, or part of an institutional strategy.
Anticipating A Supply Squeeze And Price Surge
Meanwhile, the timing of these movements is crucial, coming just as the market absorbs the impact of the SEC’s recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.
This regulatory nod has accelerated the reduction of ETH available on centralized exchanges, heightening anticipations of a possible supply squeeze that could positively influence Ethereum’s price.
The broader context involves a significant shift away from exchanges as the primary holders of crypto assets. Market analyst Ali noted a sharp decline in Ethereum held on exchanges, with about 777,000 ETH withdrawn post-ETF approval, hinting at an evolving market dynamic where major players might be moving towards greater self-custody amidst rising institutional involvement.

This trend is corroborated by a broader analysis of exchange balances, which shows a continuous decrease, suggesting a strengthening preference for holding cryptocurrencies outside exchange platforms.
Such movements are traditionally viewed as bullish indicators, implying reduced sell pressure and increased long-term holding behaviors among investors.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,777, following a peak of $3,850 in the last 24 hours. The current trading price represents a 0.7% increase in the past day despite a nearly 5% decline over the past week. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently priced at $69,253, having pulled back from a 24-hour high of $70,188.

Dogecoin vs Shiba Inu: Which memecoin will dominate June? - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin and Shiba Inu were pretty evenly matched across the metrics compared.
Shiba Inu was stuck in a range, while Dogecoin might pose risks to short-term holders.

The memecoin market has slumped over the past week following Bitcoin’s [BTC] hesitance to break past the $70k resistance.
CoinMarketCap data showed that only dogwifhat [WIF] had a positive price performance over the past week among the top five memecoins by market capitalization.
Dogecoin [DOGE] and Shiba Inu [SHIB] saw a similar price performance, but the latter was trading within a range. The former has been more volatile in May but has trended higher slightly more consistently.
Heading into June, which token is likely to see better returns?
Comparing the social metrics

The weighted sentiment gave an idea of whether the social media engagement was skewed bullish or bearish. The 3-day interval values for DOGE and SHIB were -0.72 and -0.74 respectively. This showed that engagement was similarly bearish for both coins.
However, looking at the trends, we can see Dogecoin has been consistently bearish since April. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu was more often positive over the past two months. This might be because Dogecoin witnessed more volatility.
The social dominance of DOGE was 0.927% compared to 0.339% for SHIB. This is also understandable since Dogecoin is the face of the meme coin sector and has been for years.
According to this metric, Dogecoin might witness more volatility soon

On the 30th of May, the dormant circulation of DOGE saw a massive spike. This indicated a flurry of tokens moving between wallets and is generally a sign of selling pressure.
DOGE prices have only slipped 3% since then, and at press time recovery was underway.
However, the potential wave of selling could be a concern.
On the other hand, Shiba Inu saw fewer tokens move on-chain in the past two months, highlighting a stronger HODL mentality.
Comparing the MVRV ratios, we see that DOGE was more negative over the past six weeks than SHIB. This meant DOGE holders faced greater losses, especially in early May.
At press time, it was the SHIB holders who were sitting on greater unrealized losses.

Realistic or not, here’s DOGE’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Overall, the social metrics were pretty similar. The MVRV ratios showed that DOGE holders were more willing to sell when the metric pushed above zero.
Combined with the dormant circulation spike, Dogecoin could see greater volatility than Shiba Inu.

This $3.5 Billion Deal Pushes Core Scientific Into AI


Core Scientific has announced a $3.5 billion, 12-year contract with the Nvidia-backed cloud service provider – CoreWeave. 
This significant partnership marks a strategic shift for Core Scientific as it ventures beyond Bitcoin mining into high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning. CoreWeave will also enhance Core Scientific’s existing infrastructure, making it apt for complex artificial intelligence (AI) applications.
Crypto Miners Diversify Into AI

This deal expands upon a pre-existing collaboration between the two firms. It aims to retrofit Core Scientific’s facilities into cutting-edge, application-specific data centers. These enhancements are crucial for advanced computing tasks that modern AI technologies demand.
Under the partnership’s financial terms, CoreWeave will handle all initial capital investments, including a significant $300 million allocated to infrastructure upgrades. These investments will be strategically recouped through hosting fees, providing financial relief and reducing risk exposure.
With estimated annual revenues of around $290 million from the contracts, Core Scientific anticipates a significant boost in earnings, enhancing shareholder value. Meanwhile, Core Scientific stock has been up by 40% year-to-date.
CEO Adam Sullivan highlighted the strategic foresight of this diversification. 


“Our expanding relationship with CoreWeave creates a pathway for Core Scientific to diversify our business model and balance our portfolio between Bitcoin mining and alternative compute hosting, positioning us to maximize cash flow and minimize risk while maintaining our significant exposure to Bitcoin’s upside potential,” Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan said.

The timing of this deal is pivotal, given Core Scientific’s recent emergence from bankruptcy prompted by the 2022 Bitcoin market collapse. Under Sullivan’s leadership, the company has navigated past financial challenges by restructuring debt and pivoting towards more sustainable business avenues.
Moreover, the agreement includes options for further expansion, allowing CoreWeave to increase its operational capacity at Core Scientific’s locations. These ongoing negotiations aim to secure additional contracts that would significantly boost Core Scientific’s capabilities.
The shift towards AI and HPC hosting is driven by the increasing demand for AI infrastructure, sparked by groundbreaking technologies such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. This surge has sparked a flurry of investments across the sector, with many companies, including Core Scientific’s peers such as Bit Digital, Iris Energy, and Hut 8, diversifying their revenue streams beyond traditional Bitcoin mining.

Industry experts affirm that AI operations require greater capital investment but also yield higher profits than Bitcoin mining. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, noted the strategic advantage for Bitcoin miners. 

“Bitcoin miners, often stationed in energy-secure and energy-intensive data centers, find these facilities ideal for AI operations as well,” Butterfill said.

Ethereum Whales Go on Buying Spree After SEC Greenlights Spot ETF


							

SEC approval of Ethereum Spot ETF leads to significant withdrawals of ETH from exchanges.



Analyst Burak Kesmeci suggests two reasons for the withdrawals.



This trend echoes similar occurrences observed after the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF.




The SEC’s approval of the Ethereum Spot ETF on May 24, 2024, has triggered increased movement of ETH holdings across crypto exchanges. As reported by Cryptoquant, approximately 800,000 ETH valued at $3 billion were withdrawn from exchanges within eight days. However, the identity of those responsible for these large-scale withdrawals remains unknown.



This trend echoes similar activity observed after the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF. Crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci offers two possible reasons for these massive withdrawals.



Kesmeci suggested that large market players, commonly called whales, may have anticipated a surge in Ethereum’s value following ETF approval. This outlook could have driven their decision to accumulate substantial holdings ahead of anticipated market movements.



The analyst also added that the heavy outflows could be caused by institutions positioning themselves for the launch of the ETH Spot ETF. As a result, these institutions may be bolstering their Ethereum reserves to meet investor demand upon the ETF’s launch.



Nonetheless, market experts expect the withdrawals to have a positive impact on Ethereum’s price trajectory in the medium term. The reduced circulation of ETH will likely exert upward price pressure, strengthening ETH’s bullish outlook in the coming months.



Insights from Intotheblock revealed heightened accumulation of Ethereum by whale investors. According to Intotheblock’s findings released on May 31st, 41% of crypto wallets now hold more than 1% of the total Ethereum. This figure represents a 36% increase from the first quarter of 2024. Moreover, the spike in ETH holdings indicates growing confidence among major stakeholders in Ethereum’s prospects.



Industry expert Michael Nadeau predicted a potential influx of institutional interest in Ethereum. Nadeau based his prediction on factors like the absence of structural selling pressures faced by Bitcoin miners, the Ethereum staking feature, and its pivotal role in the Web3 ecosystem.



Despite these promising developments, Ethereum was mostly flat on Monday. The cryptocurrency traded at $3,811, indicating a modest 0.89% increase over the past 24 hours.

AI And Bitcoin Mining: What Core Scientific's Unexpected Partnership With Nvidia-Backed AI Firm Coreweave Tells Us - Bitdeer Technologies (NASDAQ:BTDR) - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD miners are investing millions into artificial intelligence (AI) businesses, expecting billions in return as they diversify their operations.What Happened: According to a CNBC report on Monday, Core Scientific Inc. CORZ, a Bitcoin mining company, announced a 12-year deal with cloud provider CoreWeave to provide infrastructure for AI use cases. This agreement is expected to generate more than $3.5 billion in revenue over the contract period.CoreWeave, backed by AI chip giant Nvidia Corp. NVDA, rents out graphics processing units (GPUs), essential for training and running AI models. Core Scientific will provide about 200 megawatts of infrastructure to support CoreWeave’s operations.Core Scientific, which emerged from bankruptcy in January, has been mining a mix of digital assets since 2017. The company began diversifying into other services in 2019.Why It Matters: Core Scientific’s AI push follows similar move by another well-known Bitcoin mining firm, Bitdeer Technologies Group BTDR, which partnered with Nvidia to offer AI cloud computing servicesThe pivot towards AI by Bitcoin miners was triggered by the halving event in April, which halved the new issuance of Bitcoin. This event, designed to counter inflation, has historically preceded a significant surge in Bitcoin's price. Miners began turning to AI to mitigate the impact of the halving event.Other miners like Bit Digital, Hive, Hut 8, and TeraWulf are also looking to bolster their revenue streams after the Bitcoin halving in April cut rewards paid out to miners by 50%. Many are retrofitting their facilities to meet the needs of the AI market.According to CoinShares, Bit Digital derives 27% of its revenue from AI. Hut 8 generates 6% of sales from AI, and Hive, which has data centers in Canada and Sweden, gets 4% of its revenue from these services.Price Action: The shares of Core Scientific closed 2.53% higher at $4.87 during Monday’s regular trading session, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $69,192.81, up 1.32% in the last 24 hours.

Crypto Analyst PlanB: Bitcoin Set for $100,000 Surge, $500,000 Long-Term Target


							

PlanB analyzes the Bitcoin market using multiple indicators.



All of PlanB’s indicators suggest BTC is set to pump.



The analyst predicts Bitcoin would rally to $500,000 in the coming bull run.




Cryptocurrency analyst, PlanB has identified a developing trend in the Bitcoin cycle following the recent halving event. In a video upload, PlanB used multiple chart indicators, including his proprietary Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model (S2F), to compare BTC’s trend with past bull cycles.



Using the S2F model, PlanB demonstrated that Bitcoin is primed for the next leg of the bull run, having completed an initial phase shortly after last April’s halving event. Per the analysis, closing last month slightly above $67,000 confirms the start of the new cycle. The analyst predicts Bitcoin will surge similarly to the previous halving cycle, forecasting a $500,000 target for the flagship cryptocurrency in the upcoming bull cycle.



Meanwhile, PlanB shared details of the Bitcoin Market Cycle indicator, confirming the market has entered a bull cycle. However, he advised his followers to remain patient until the price begins to rise rapidly. Similarly, he noted a Relative Strength Index (RSI) increase that resembles the indicator’s performance ahead of the 2012 bull run. PlanB highlighted that the RSI signal is in an early stage and provides valuable information to traders.









Continuing his analysis, PlanB posted the Bitcoin 200 Week Moving Average (WMA), showing it is in a rising trend that he expects to continue. The analyst showed how the 200 WMA trend coincides with a bull market signal to confirm the potential Bitcoin surge. He believes that the signal is enough to push Bitcoin to $100,000 soon.



Using the Bitcoin Realized Price indicator, PlanB further supported his bullish prediction for Bitcoin. He compared the indicator’s trend with historical data, showing that its current level suggests the imminent start of a Bitcoin rally. He used the indicator’s behavior to predict Bitcoin would not drop below $64,000 before embarking on the expected price increase.

Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Says Bitcoin Could Rally to $150,000 Before Bull Market Ends - Here’s His Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes that Bitcoin (BTC) can soar to a high of $150,000 before the bull market comes to a close.
In a new blog post, Brandt says the timeline of each bull cycle has been more or less the same since 2012.










“The number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle (the low following a 75%-plus decline) to the halving dates has been almost equal to the number of weeks from the halving dates to the subsequent bull market highs.” 
If Bitcoin continues to follow the script, Brandt predicts that the current bull market will expire in August or September 2025.
As for his BTC price target, Brandt says the bull market highs since 2012 can be tracked using an inverted parabolic curve. The seasoned trader shares a chart suggesting that Bitcoin may rise to as high as $150,000 at his predicted bull market expiration date.
Source: Peter Brandt
But Brandt warns that his analysis is not foolproof. He also says that there’s a 25% chance that BTC has already printed the top for this cycle.
“Should Bitcoin fail to make a decisive new ATH (all-time high) and decline below $55,000 I will raise the probability of the Exponential Decay.” 
The trader defines exponential decay as BTC losing about 80% of its exponential energy after each successful bull market.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $69,083.

Edward Snowden Makes A Bold Statement On Bitcoin: Details


								On Monday, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden once again expressed his support for Bitcoin (BTC). Snowden’s statement came in the wake of a significant market disruption that saw Berkshire Hathaway shares plummet by 99% due to a technical glitch on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This incident has reignited discussions about the robustness and reliability of traditional financial systems versus decentralized alternatives.
Bitcoin Fixes This
A technical glitch on the NYSE triggered extreme price swings in several securities, causing a temporary suspension of trading. Approximately two hours after the NYSE halted trading, it was reported that all systems were operational again.
Among the affected securities, shares of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett‘s storied investment company, and Barrick Gold, a major mining group, experienced dramatic and erroneous declines of around 99% in value. Berkshire Hathaway shares, which typically trade at more than $622,000, dropped precipitously to just $185 due to the glitch. This erroneous pricing was later corrected.

The NYSE attributed the turmoil to “technical difficulties” with the limit-up/limit-down mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to curb unusually large price fluctuations during trading sessions. Introduced after the 2010 flash crash, where a selling wave triggered by computer algorithms wiped out a trillion dollars in market value within minutes, these mechanisms are critical in maintaining market stability. Intercontinental Exchange, the NYSE’s operator, reported no indications of a hacker attack.
In response to this event, Edward Snowden took to X, simply stating, “Bitcoin fixes this.” Snowden’s terse comment underscores his belief in the advantages of decentralized financial systems over traditional, centralized exchanges.


Bitcoin, as a decentralized digital currency, operates on a peer-to-peer network without a central authority. This structure contrasts sharply with traditional stock exchanges, where centralized control can lead to systemic risks, such as those demonstrated by the recent NYSE glitch. The design of Bitcoin aims to ensure transparency, immutability, and security, reducing the potential for such catastrophic failures due to technical issues or centralized errors.

Snowden’s endorsement of Bitcoin in this context highlights the cryptocurrency’s resilience against the vulnerabilities that can plague traditional financial systems. By pointing out that “Bitcoin fixes this,” Snowden implies that BTC’s decentralized nature could potentially prevent similar disruptions in the financial system, offering a more reliable alternative to traditional trading platforms.
Notably, Bitcoin boasts an uptime of 99.989% since its inception. This remarkable level of reliability is a testament to the robustness of its underlying blockchain technology. There have been only two incidents in BTC’s early days: the first in 2010, known as the “value overflow incident,” where a bug created billions of BTC out of thin air, and the second in 2013, involving a temporary blockchain fork caused by an incompatible software upgrade. Both incidents were swiftly addressed by the core developers, reinforcing Bitcoin’s resilience.
At press time, BTC traded at $69,047.

Statement on the Giant US Organization Announcing Bitcoin Investment: Will Acquisitions Continue? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Wisconsin's pension program will significantly increase its investments in Bitcoin ETFs, according to David Krause, a finance professor at Marquette University in the US.
The state's pension program added two spot Bitcoin ETFs to its portfolio in the first quarter, marking the beginning of its foray into cryptocurrency investments.


The Wisconsin State Investment Board (SWIB) purchased shares of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) worth $164 million as of March 31, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May. .
The move surprised the industry, as large institutions, especially pensions, generally do not invest in junior ETFs such as spot Bitcoin ETFs. But the state's investment board has a history of being ahead of the curve, Krause noted in an interview with PBS Wisconsin:






“Wisconsin's board of investments has always been innovative. It's a fully funded retirement fund, so in a sense they have the luxury of being able to invest for the long term. “They don't have to worry about liquidity as much as, say, the Illinois state pension fund, which is only 50% funded.”


As of the end of 2023, SWIB was managing roughly $156 billion in assets, meaning its holdings in Bitcoin ETFs were a negligible roughly 0.1% of its portfolio. However, Krause believes that this investment is just a “start” and expects SWIB to increase this amount and other pension funds to follow suit:

“I think it's just an entry point. “I think they're testing whether the public will be resistant to owning this and using it as an experiment because it won't really significantly impact the portfolio until it gets to maybe a 1% or 2% position.”

JPEX Scandal: Victims Fight to Reclaim $700,000 in Hong Kong Court


							

Two individuals have filed a lawsuit seeking recovery of $700K from JPEX.



Technology legal specialist Joshua Chu Kiu-wah represents the plaintiff.



Felix Chiu King-yin, general manager at exchange Coingaroo, has also been named.




Two individuals connected to the JPEX scandal have filed a lawsuit in Hong Kong courts seeking to recover HK$5.5 million (approximately $703,300).



The lawsuit names plaintiffs Herbert Lee Sung-him and Chan Wing-yan against JPEX Crypto Asset Platform, a firm accused of financial fraud totaling HK$1.6 billion, and its associated entity, Web 3.0 Technical Support.



The plaintiffs are also seeking to hold accountable “any persons who carried out or assisted in the scheme,” including three wallet address holders linked to the JPEX platform.



Felix Chiu King-yin, general manager at Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange Coingaroo, which reportedly has operational ties to JPEX, is also named as a defendant.



Chan alleges that she paid Chiu HK$1,850,000 (equivalent to $237,179), part of which he converted into 195,499 USDT (Tether) and deposited into a JPEX wallet. She also told police that she made several deposits totaling 247,498 USDT to two JPEX wallets in July and August of last year, only to find the assets transferred within five minutes of each deposit.









The plaintiffs claim that the deposited assets were moved to dozens of unknown wallets before they checked their accounts on September 14th of last year. They are also seeking to recover another 226,012 USDT, which they say was converted to other cryptocurrencies without authorization.



The plaintiffs are asking the court to trace the lost funds and issue an injunction to freeze the cryptocurrency held on various platforms. Technology legal specialist Joshua Chu Kiu-wah is representing the plaintiffs.

Binance Implements MiCA Stablecoin Rules in Europe, CZ Addresses Delisting Concerns


							

The MiCA stablecoin rules will come into effect across the EEA from June 30, 2024.



The new rules will implement restrictions on unregulated stablecoins while promoting regulated stablecoins.



Binance will allow the transition of unregulated stablecoins to regulated stablecoins over time.




Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is implementing new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) stablecoin rules across the European Economic Area (EEA). The MiCA rules, effective June 30, 2024, mark a significant shift in the stablecoin market, with new regulations designed to enhance market governance.



In a blog post, Binance detailed the impact of the new MiCA stablecoin rules on the EEA’s crypto ecosystem. The platform stated, “This marks a first step into the new regulatory framework and will significantly impact the stablecoin market in the EEA.”



While the MiCA rules are expected to restrict “unauthorized stablecoins” and foster “regulated stablecoins,” Binance has decided to allow the transition of unregulated stablecoins to regulated stablecoins over time. The exchange added:




“Our transitional approach has been designed to minimize any potential harmful impacts to the EEA and global crypto market that could arise from users rushing to swap their stablecoin holdings while limited exit avenues exist.”










Meanwhile, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao addressed a key concern regarding the platform’s strategies for the MiCA rules on X social platform stating, “Binance will not delist any unauthorized stablecoins from spot trading but will limit their availability for EEA users only on certain products.”







In related news, Binance France has undergone a significant restructuring. Following the imprisonment of its sole owner, Changpeng Zhao, for four months due to alleged money laundering violations, Yulong Yan and Lihua He have become the new shareholders, each with a 50% stake in Binance France. This strategic decision comes as the EEA prepares to embrace the new MiCA stablecoin rules.

Bitcoin ETF Wars: BlackRock, Fidelity Gain Ground on Vanguard as Grayscale Lags


							

26% of inflows in BlackRock and 56% in Fidelity came from BTC ETFs.



Vanguard remains the leader in total ETF inflows for 2024, at $102.8 billion.



IBIT has attracted $16.6 billion in inflows, while FBTC has seen $8.9 billion.




BlackRock’s and Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETFs are driving significant inflows for the firms, accounting for 26% and 56% of their respective year-to-date totals, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data cited by Eric Balchunas.



The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which launched in January, have attracted $16.6 billion and $8.9 billion in inflows, respectively, according to Farside Investor data.



Balchunas noted that the Bitcoin ETFs are “definitely having an impact on the leaderboard” due to these significant inflows.



However, Vanguard, which does not offer any Bitcoin ETFs, still leads in total ETF inflows for 2024 with $102.8 billion, far surpassing BlackRock’s $65.1 billion.



BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, manages 429 ETFs with a combined $2.8 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM). Fidelity manages 70 ETFs totaling $74 billion in AUM.









Another ETF issuer, Invesco, recorded $34.7 billion in ETF flows this year, with its Bitcoin ETF contributing only 0.9% to this total, or $317.3 million, in the first five months.

Shiba Inu Devs Warn of Treat Token Scams on Shibaswap


							

Deceptive tokens are falsely claiming association with Shiba developers and exploiting Shib.io address.



Shibarium developers stress that the Treat token has not been launched yet.



Shibaswap’s decentralized nature prevents banning fraudulent tokens, but developers strongly disapprove of these scams.




The Shibarium community is on high alert as reports surface of fraudulent tokens claiming false associations with Shiba Inu developers. These bad actors are exploiting Shibarium’s decentralized platform to promote their schemes, posing significant risks to investors. DaVinci, a prominent figure in the Shibarium community, has issued a stern warning to all members, urging them to exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough research before interacting with any new tokens.







Moreover, these scammers have shifted tactics, moving from misusing Ryoshi Research mediums to exploiting Shiba State and Canine Code. Alarmingly, they have even resorted to posting the shib.io address in their videos to lend false credibility to their schemes. This deliberate misuse aims to deceive community members into believing these fraudulent tokens have legitimate ties to the Shiba Inu ecosystem.



The developers have emphasized that the Treat token has not yet launched. Any tokens claiming association with Treat are unequivocally attempts to deceive and defraud the community. Despite the decentralized nature of Shibaswap, which prevents it from banning these tokens, the developers remain committed to voicing strong disapproval of such unethical practices.



 
 




Notably, the warning from the creators coincides with considerable price fluctuations for the SHIB cryptocurrency. With a trading volume of $480,822,87, Shiba Inu is currently priced at $0.000025, recording an increase of 0.82% in the last day. This increase in value highlights the need for caution because volatile markets may increase the public’s vulnerability to fraudulent schemes.



The developers’ advisory highlights the necessity for community members to remain vigilant and informed. By thoroughly researching and confirming the legitimacy of any tokens before interacting with them, investors can safeguard themselves against such scams. The community is advised to rely solely on official channels and reliable sources when seeking information about reputable advancements in the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

Bitcoin Mining Company Core Scientific Signed a $3.5 Billion Agreement with the Artificial Intelligence Company! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Core Scientific, North America's leading provider of Bitcoin mining and hosting services, today announced that it has signed a series of significant 12-year agreements with AI hyperscaler CoreWeave.
Core Scientific Signed a 12-Year Agreement with Artificial Intelligence Company
The Nasdaq-listed company anticipates these deals will generate an estimated $3.5 billion in total cumulative revenue over the life of the agreements, with annual revenue averaging $290 million.


Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan emphasized the strategic importance of this agreement and said:
“Our expanding relationship with CoreWeave creates a way for Core Scientific to diversify our business model and balance our portfolio between Bitcoin mining and alternative computing hosting.





“This gives us significant exposure to Bitcoin's upside potential while positioning us to maximize cash flow and minimize risk.”

Under the agreement, Core Scientific will provide 200 megawatts of infrastructure and renovate its existing sites to accommodate CoreWeave's operations.


The mining company aims to have these facilities operational by the first half of 2025. CoreWeave will fund all capital investments necessary to replace Core Scientific's existing infrastructure.
To offset these costs, CoreWeave plans to loan Core Scientific an estimated $300 million, which will be deducted gradually from monthly hosting fees.





Bitcoin mining companies, including Core Scientific, are exploring ways to expand their revenue streams following April's Bitcoin halving, which slashed miner rewards by 50%.
Other major mining companies such as Bit Digital and Hut 8 are also turning to artificial intelligence to increase their revenues.

Binance Faces User Backlash After $1 Million Hack Allegations


							

A Binance user lost about $1 million in a security breach while the hacker executed counter-trading techniques.



Binance asserts that the victim’s personal computer was hacked, and the platform cannot provide compensation.



The exchange also states that it processed the user’s request to freeze his account within 1 minute and 19 seconds.




In a recent X post, a Binance user, Nakamao identified himself as a “victim of an undercover agent,” claiming to have lost $1 million due to a security breach. The user alleged that the exploit was carried out by a malicious Chrome plugin that used counter-trading techniques to drain his account.



Nakamao shared his harrowing experience of the hack and expressed his despair at Binance’s alleged lack of response. He stated, “During the whole process, I did not receive any security reminders from Binance.”







However, in response to the user’s complaint, Binance asserted that the incident was likely the result of a hack on Nakamao’s computer. The platform also added that they processed the user’s request to freeze his account in 1 minute and 19 seconds.







Elaborating on the exploiter’s strategy, Binance stated that the hacker gained access to the user’s account login status and impersonated Nakamao to execute trades. The platform added, “Since the hacker could not withdraw the currency, they chose to use counter-trading to deplete your account assets.”



Furthermore, Binance asserted that the exchange has not identified any similar issues prior to this incident. While assuring to bolster its investigations, Binance stated that it cannot compensate for the losses as it was not their fault. The post read:




 “We sympathize with your experience, but according to the information we have learned so far, the reason for your asset loss is that your related devices were manipulated because of the installation of malicious plug-ins. Unfortunately, we have no way to compensate for such cases that have nothing to do with Binance.” 




On February 29, another Binance user shared his experience of losing almost $70,000. The user reported receiving notifications of orders being filled despite never having placed any. The user then witnessed their account holdings vanish.

Mt. Gox Bitcoin transfers of USD 9.2 billion rattle the market - Crypto Valley Journal

A summarizing review of what has been happening at the crypto markets. A look at trending sectors, liquidity, volatility, spreads and more. The weekly report in cooperation with market data provider Kaiko.Although we're still waiting for a spot ETH ETF launch date, a leveraged ETH ETF is set to debut on Tuesday. Elsewhere, US President Joe Biden vetoed the resolution to overturn the SAB 121 over the weekend, as expected. This week we explore:Mt. Gox Bitcoin transfers and the potential market impact from repayments.How trade volumes fare during the summer months.ETH's outperformance on ETF approval.Mt. Gox Bitcoin transfersLast Tuesday, wallets linked to the defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox initiated transfers of 140,000 BTC, valued at around $9.2 billion, as the bankruptcy estate prepares to repay creditors. This unexpected activity from dormant accounts triggered a wave of selling pressure in the market. A reliable indicator of such selling pressure is the cumulative volume delta (CVD), which for BTC recorded a total of negative $120 million between Sunday and Wednesday. This indicates a higher number of sellers than buyers.BTC CVD indicates net selling / Source: KaikoBreaking down the volume by hour shows that the amount of trading activity increased substantially on May 28, following the initial transfers from the Mt. Gox wallets. Hourly selling activity heavily outweighed buying between Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, leading to a large negative CVD for BTC.Mt. Gox will repay creditors in BTC, BCH, and fiat currency. The creditor's decision to sell their holdings is uncertain and will likely depend on the market's ability to absorb large orders. Fortunately, the market depth for BTC and BCH has improved by roughly 30%, reaching pre-FTX collapse levels, which may help mitigate potential price fluctuations if the sell-off occurs soon. However, looking at the dollar amount of available liquidity, the divergence between the two assets is striking.Bitcoin Cash has significantly lower liquidity than Bitcoin, with a daily average depth of only $9 million or 3.5% of Bitcoin's depth. Despite benefiting from the recent bull run and the launch of EDX, a Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel Securities-backed exchange last year, BCH underperformed in Kaiko's latest liquidity ranking.Currently, BCH's bid-side depth is just $4.8 million, meaning that sell orders of the same magnitude could cause a 1% decline in the BCH price. BCH's market depth is substantially lower than its level in September 2021 when prices were similar.This suggests that Mt Gox repayments could have a significant impact on BCH should creditors sell their assets.Bitcoin enters summer doldrumsAs we enter June, both crypto and traditional financial markets are experiencing the typical summer trading lull. Historically, Q3 has had the lowest volume by a significant margin, with cumulative BTC trade volume over 40% below the highest-volume quarter.This trend has been particularly pronounced for BTC-USD volumes, which reached a multi-year low of $44 billion in Q3 2023, despite BlackRock's spot ETF filing. Tightening regulations and worsening liquidity infrastructure following the US banking turmoil could be partly responsible.However, with the launch of 11 spot ETFs in the United States, which has been beneficial for BTC price discovery and liquidity already, there is hope that this summer's volumes will not be as low as in the past. Nevertheless, the increasing interconnectedness between cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets could pose risks and potentially exacerbate the trend of low-volume trading.As previously mentioned, daily Bitcoin liquidity has become more concentrated around US trading hours, with volumes spiking at the market open (14H UTC) and close (20H UTC). This trend is likely linked to Bitcoin ETFs, which calculate their net asset value (NAV) against dedicated benchmarks at the US close each weekday, encouraging arbitrage and price discovery.The share of cumulative trade volume between 19H and 20H UTC has increased to 7.2% this year, up from 5.7% during the 2021 bull run. In contrast, Bitcoin trading during Hong Kong and Sydney market closes has declined. This concentration of liquidity in a short time frame could potentially increase intra-day volatility, especially during periods of market stress.USD trade volume gains tractionThe share of USD crypto volume, relative to other fiat currencies, has surged from 30% in September 2023 to over 50% in early May, driven by rising institutional interest in spot BTC ETFs. As a result, the USD is outperforming other fiat currencies, such as the KRW and EUR.Meanwhile, KRW trade volume lost momentum in Q2, after briefly surpassing USD volumes in Q1. Interestingly, the Turkish Lira (TRY) has overtaken the EUR and is now the third-largest fiat currency in terms of volume, highlighting the growing adoption of crypto assets in emerging markets.ETH outperforms on ETF newsThe ETH to BTC ratio, which measures the relative performance of the two assets, had been trending downwards since March. However, following the SEC's approval of 19b-4 filings from multiple US exchanges, ETH outperformed BTC, with the ratio spiking above 0.055 that day.ETH's ETF nod has thus far proven to be bad news for SOL. The SOL to ETH ratio fell to its lowest point since April following the SEC's decision on May 23, despite SOL's increased network activity earlier in 2024.Bitcoin ETF inflows pick upThe nine new Bitcoin ETFs saw a reversal from April's negative trend, with positive inflows in May. Last month, major funds made 13F filings that revealed some impressive Bitcoin ETF statistics. For instance, BlackRock's IBIT attracted over 400 institutional investors, including hedge fund Millennium, and surpassed Grayscale's GBTC as the world's largest spot Bitcoin ETF last week. Although 13F filings only offer a glimpse of funds' portfolios as of March, the institutional demand has been viewed as an encouraging factor by most market participants.

Galaxy Digital's Loan: Tokenization of a 316-Year-Old Violin


Galaxy Digital Holdings, spearheaded by billionaire Michael Novogratz, has innovatively expanded its lending services. The company recently issued a multimillion-dollar loan secured by a 316-year-old Stradivarius violin.
Russian Empress Catherine the Great once owned the Stradivarius violin. Last year, Yat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, bought this historic instrument for over $9 million at an auction.
Galaxy Digital Pioneers Lending Funds Through Tokenized Assets

The loan collateral includes the Stradivarius violin and its digital representation as a non-fungible token (NFT). This dual-collateral strategy ensures robust security for Galaxy Digital while providing asset management flexibility. The physical violin will remain under custodianship in Hong Kong, with stringent requirements for its removal.
Tokenization, the process behind this innovative collateral, involves converting physical assets into digital tokens. Consequently, traders can trade and manage these tokens on blockchain platforms. In the digital economy, this method is becoming increasingly popular for managing various assets, from art to real estate.

Although immediate plans for fractional ownership of the violin are not set, Siu is interested in eventually enabling broader access to such unique assets. Thomas Cowan, vice president of tokenization at Galaxy Digital, highlighted the benefits. 

“Tokenizing physical assets like fine art or musical instruments allows us to lend potentially more for our clients than against more volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Today, it’s a violin, but tomorrow, it could be real estate,” Cowan said.


The interest in asset tokenization is also gaining traction among major financial institutions. For example, BlackRock has made a significant move by investing in Securitize, a company that specializes in the tokenization of real-world assets. This investment signifies a growing institutional interest in leveraging blockchain technology for more traditional financial practices.
BlackRock has also launched its first tokenized fund on Ethereum, marking a significant step towards integrating blockchain into mainstream asset management. This fund focuses on providing liquidity while maintaining stable value, distributing dividends as new tokens directly to investors’ wallets.
Read more: What is The Impact of Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization?
Moreover, the tokenization of real-world assets is not limited to private companies. El Salvador, for instance, has made strides with a tokenization initiative to finance a new hotel project. This effort is part of a broader move to harness blockchain technology for traditional sectors.

An In-Depth Look Into Mt. Gox's Recent $9.4 Billion Bitcoin Move: What Happens to the Crypto Market? ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Mt. Gox, a defunct crypto exchange, was spotted moving $9.62 billion worth of Bitcoin into a new wallet. This action has raised hopes among its creditors for potential repayments.



The transfer saw 141,686 Bitcoin transferred into the wallet “1Jbez” from various cold portfolios linked to the exchange. Moreover, it marks Mt. Gox’s first funds transfer in over five years, following its plans to reimburse creditors by the end of October 2024.



Anndy Lian, a blockchain expert and author of “NFT: From Zero to Hero,” noted that this significant transfer likely indicates Mt. Gox’s intention to repay its users. Lian emphasized that this movement is also part of the exchange’s strategy to reimburse creditors by the promised October 31, 2024 deadline.



Meanwhile, Mt. Gox rehabilitation trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi confirmed that the consolidation is part of the exchange’s repayment plans. In a May 28 announcement, Kobayashi stated that the Rehabilitation Trustee is preparing to repay the portion of cryptocurrency claims allocated for repayment. He also requested that creditors remain patient, hinting at potential delays beyond the initial deadline of September 2023.



Over the past ten years, creditors have been hoping for reimbursement of Mt. Gox’s outstanding debt amounting to $9.4 billion worth of BTC. The exchange was once a major cryptocurrency player, facilitating more than 70% of all trades in the early days of Bitcoin. However, Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 following a series of hacks.

Potential Market Impact of Mt. Gox Bitcoin Transfers Analyzed by CryptoQuant



Reacting to the development, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant analyzed its potential impact on the crypto market. CryptoQuant reported that the Mt. Gox Rehabilitation Trustee had moved 138,000 Bitcoin in seven transactions, ranging between 4,000 and 32,000. 



The internal transfers within Trustee-controlled addresses have not impacted the Bitcoin market. Nonetheless, the analytics firm noted that the eventual repayment to creditors, expected by October 31, 2024, could influence market dynamics.



Furthermore, CryptoQuant highlighted that the market impact will depend on these repayments’ timing, size, and manner. If the Trustee starts repaying creditors, it could introduce a significant amount of Bitcoin into the market, affecting liquidity and price stability. The firm concluded that there is no immediate selling pressure from these movements since the transfers have yet to hit the open market.

Base Ecosystem TVL Hits All-time High - The Defiant

Activity on Ethereum Layer 2 network Base is surging ahead of Coinbase’s smart wallet release.Base, Coinbase’s Layer 2 (L2) blockchain, has hit an all-time high in terms of total value locked (TVL) as investors look forward to Coinbase’s new smart wallet.Base’s growth over the last 90 days has significantly outpaced competitors such as Arbitrum and Optimism. In that time period, Base’s TVL increased by 465% from $1.3B to $7.41B, whereas Arbitrum’s TVL increased by just 13%, and Optimism’s declined by 12%.Activity and TVL on the chain began to increase dramatically after the implementation of EIP-4844 in March, which introduced proto-danksharding and reduced gas costs on L2s such as Base.Base 90d TVLAdoption via Account AbstractionCoinbase’s smart wallet aims to offer a seamless transition for users to move from their centralized exchange accounts to onchain dApps. It is a browser-based onchain wallet designed to eliminate friction points through account abstraction.Account abstraction allows users to transact on Ethereum or a Layer 2 without initiating a transaction themselves by delegating it to a third party. This enables an onchain experience that is user-friendly and opens up possibilities such as gasless transactions, preauthorized payments, passkey signatures, and one-click transactions.Investors and traders are speculating that the retail-friendly smart wallet will help onboard Coinbase’s user base into the world of DeFi. Jesse Pollak, a lead contributor to Base, posted on social media, “Prediction: by EOY, 90%+ of active onchain users will use smart wallets.

Binance to limit certain stablecoins to comply with EU crypto rules


Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is set to limit certain stablecoins in the European Union to comply with the new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). 



The regulation, which will be enforced at the end of June, is aimed at establishing robust oversight of stablecoins. 



Binance is transitioning its users from non-authorized to regulated stablecoins. 



This move highlights the increasing regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency market within the European Economic Area (EEA) and is poised to influence the future of stablecoin usage.

	
	
	
	


MiCA’s objective is to bolster investor protection and promote the Euro’s presence in crypto transactions, which is currently a minor portion of the market. 



Binance plans to implement a “sell-only” policy for non-compliant stablecoins, directing users towards Bitcoin, Ether, regulated stablecoins, or fiat currencies. The specific stablecoins to be restricted have not been disclosed, but Binance has indicated that only a select few meet the MiCA criteria.



The exchange’s proactive stance on compliance includes recent structural changes to align with French regulations and is indicative of the broader regulatory trend in Europe. 



The MiCA framework, together with the new anti-money laundering regulations (AMLR), will require crypto-asset service providers to conduct thorough due diligence and report any suspicious activities.

Dapper Labs settles NBA Top Shot NFT lawsuit for US$4 mln


Dapper Labs, the blockchain company behind the NBA Top Shot collectibles, has settled a class-action lawsuit for US$4 million, addressing allegations of securities law violations. 



Pending court approval, the settlement will compensate claimants and cover legal fees, providing Dapper Labs with a clearer legal framework to continue its operations. 



If approved plaintiffs can no longer claim that Dapper Labs’ NBA-themed NFTs are securities. 



“After discovery, it was understood and agreed that @Flow_blockchain is a decentralized public network and that digital collectibles like @NBATopShot are not securities in the same way trading cards are not securities,” said Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou in a statement on X.

	
	
	
	


“Today’s resolution lets us stay focused on what matters – building great experiences for our fans.”



The legal challenge, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, argued that NBA Top Shot Moments should be classified as unregistered securities, linking their value to the success of the platform. 



Plaintiffs also claimed that Dapper Labs manipulated the market and delayed withdrawals.



The case drew significant attention when a federal judge allowed it to proceed, indicating that Top Shot NFTs might meet the criteria for a securities offering. 

	
	
	

	


This was partly because the NFTs are hosted on the Flow blockchain, created by Dapper Labs, which the judge deemed less decentralized than networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum. 



As part of the agreement, Dapper Labs will implement business changes, including transferring FLOW tokens to the independent Flow Foundation and enabling third-party marketplaces to sell Top Shot NFTs. 



These measures, aimed at improving market fairness and withdrawal processes, were already in place before the settlement was reached.

PEPE traders take a step back: Is price the reason? - AMBCrypto



Open Interest and volume of PEPE plunged, indicating a dearth of new liquidity for the token.
Data revealed an increase in HODLing, suggesting a possible short-term recovery. 

AMBCrypto observed that the volume of contracts linked to Pepe [PEPE] in the market had decreased. According to Coinglass, the derivatives information portal, PEPE’s volume was down 5.10% ($764.63 million) in the last 24 hours.
To support the point, the Open Interest (OI) also dropped to $158.02 million. OI is the value of contract opened in market. When the OI increases, it means that market participants are increasing their net positions and new money is coming into the market.
Are sellers taking over?
When this happens, buyers are aggressive, and price could move higher.
However, a decline in OI means that traders are increasingly closing their positions and taking liquidity out. In this case, sellers are aggressive.
Source: Coinglass
PEPE’s decline in this regard could be linked to the memecoin’s price. Previously, the price of the token hit impressive highs, triggering traders to open positions and capitalize on the price movements.
However, the price of PEPE was down to $0.000014 – a 8.78% decrease in the last seven days.  Should the price continue to decrease, then interest in the token might continue to fall.
Holders may not grieve for long
On the other hand, a rebound for the token could spell a considerable increase in contracts opened. But will price bounce?
AMBCrypto evaluated the possibility by looking at the exchange inflow and outflow. According to data obtained from Santiment, PEPE’s exchange inflow was 5.28 billion.
This figure is the number of token sent into exchanges for possible sell-off within the past week. Conversely, the exchange outflow was 14.71 billion, suggesting that more participants leaned toward holding that letting go of the token for gains.
Source: Santiment
While PEPE’s price might see another decline, this difference could change things for the price. But that would only be the case if the outflow continues to outpace inflows.
Should this happen over the next few days or weeks, PEPE’s price could circle back to $0.000017. Despite the bullish potential, traders were not yet convinced about a possible recovery.
This was evident in thew Long/Short ratio. The Long/Short ratio is a measure of traders’ expectations. Values above 1 indicate the amount of long positions (bets on a price increase) is more than shorts (bets on a decrease).
On the other hand, a ratio below 1 indicates that traders are bearish. At press time, the 4-hour Long/Short ratio ratio was down to 0.69, reinforcing the notion that investors’ expectations was negative.
Source: Coinglass

Read Pepe’s [PEPE] Price Prediction 2024-2025

But this sentiment does not serve as confirmation of a price decline. In the past, when negative sentiment is extreme, it prepares PEPE for another leg-up.
As such, a notable upswing could be in the work for the token.

Investors FOMO Into Crypto: YTD Flows Hit New Highs - Details


								Cryptocurrency markets are defying historical patterns in 2024. Instead of a summertime slowdown, investors are injecting billions into crypto funds, shattering year-to-date records. This surge coincides with the long-awaited approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US, potentially marking a turning point in cryptocurrency regulation.

A Record-Breaking Year For Crypto Investment
CoinShares, a digital asset management firm, revealed that global crypto asset funds raked in a staggering $185 million last week. This pushed May’s total net inflows to a record-breaking $2 billion.
The data aligns with a steady rise in investments throughout 2024, culminating in a YTD inflow exceeding $15 billion for the first time ever. Bitcoin, the dominant force in the crypto landscape, unsurprisingly captured the lion’s share of these inflows. Its corresponding funds attracted nearly $150 million last week alone.
Source: CoinShares
Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, followed closely behind with $33.5 million. Notably, Ethereum inflows mark a significant two-week streak, potentially reversing a ten-week outflow trend. Analysts believe this shift is linked to the recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, even though these products haven’t begun trading yet.
ETF Approval Injects Confidence, Attracts New Investors
The approval of spot ETFs in the US is seen as a major boost for investor confidence in the crypto market. These ETFs provide a regulated and secure way to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, potentially attracting traditional investors who might have previously been hesitant due to regulatory uncertainty.

BTC market cap currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com
The arrival of spot ETFs is a significant development for the crypto market. These products offer a familiar and secure avenue for investors to participate, potentially expanding the investor base and fostering further growth.
Altcoins Experience Continued Interest
While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate crypto investment, altcoins like Solana and Chainlink are also experiencing a surge in interest. Solana funds secured nearly $6 million in net inflows last week, while Chainlink attracted close to $1 million.
This continued investment in altcoins suggests a diversified market where investors are looking beyond established players and exploring the potential of emerging blockchain technologies.

Looking Ahead: A New Era For Crypto?
The unprecedented bullish sentiment in the crypto market this year challenges the validity of historical seasonal trends. However, financial experts urge caution due to the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies.
The record-breaking inflows into crypto funds in 2024 paint a picture of a maturing market. The regulatory clarity provided by ETF approvals and the increasing adoption of blockchain technology are undoubtedly contributing to this growth.

If you bought SHIB with your $1,200 stimulus check in 2020 you’d now have this much


    About four years ago, the American government started issuing stimulus checks to help its citizens recover from the economic fallout of the COVID pandemic and related restrictions, and investing this money in various assets, including cryptocurrencies, was among the popular choices.



Indeed, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had issued the first round of the financial aid or Economic Impact Payments, under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Act (CARES Act), in the amount of $1,200 (as well as an additional $500 for every child) starting in mid-April 2020.



Investing stimulus in SHIB



For those who chose to invest their $1,200 stimulus check in like Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 2020, this would have been highly profitable, taking into account that the doge meme token came out in August 2020 and its price has risen a whopping 2.52 million percentage points since its launch.







SHIB price all-time price chart. Source: Finbold



Specifically, investing $1,200 in Shiba Inu at the time of its launch in 2020, when its price was practically next-to-nothing (or about $0.00000000017) would mean that today, it would be worth close to $30.24 million, providing massive profit for those who decide to sell it at its current price.



SHIB price analysis



Currently, the SHIB price at press time reflects a decline of 5.30% in the last 24 hours while also losing 3.67% across the previous seven days, and adding up to the 3.44% drop on its monthly chart, whereas it has gained 130.65% since the year’s turn, as per data on June 4.



Meanwhile, the SHIB burn rate has spiked by a massive 10,990%, burning more than 21 million SHIB tokens in one transaction, according to SHIB burn rate tracker Shibburn, possibly the result of increased activity in the ecosystem and SHIB burn initiatives by the community, signaling potential price gains.



SHIB burn rate 24-hour chart. Source: Shibburn



In conclusion, investing in this crypto when the US government started issuing the $1,200 stimulus checks in 2020 would have been highly lucrative as it has since risen to become the 11th-largest asset in the crypto sector by market capitalization, and certain indicators suggest it could continue to grow.

PEPE, WIF, SHIB Drop Hard as BTC Struggles to Maintain $69K (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price faced some enhanced volatility in the past 24 hours as it popped to $70,200 but was violently rejected there and pushed down to $69,000.
The altcoins are mostly in the red, while KAS skyrocketed by 19% and now trades close to $0.18
BTC Shaky at $69K
The primary cryptocurrency had a fluctuating end of the previous business week in which it attempted to overcome $69,000 but was stopped there by the bears. Moreover, the subsequent rejection saw the asset slump to $66,600, which became a multi-day low.
The bulls finally stepped up at this point and didn’t allow any further pain. Just the opposite, BTC bounced off and spent most of the weekend trading sideways at around $67,500.
It all started to change on Monday when bitcoin started a leg up that drove it to just over $70,200 for the first time in about a week. However, as it happened during the previous such attempt, BTC was stopped and it pulled back by nearly two grand.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Since then, the cryptocurrency has been shaky at around $69,000. Its market cap is just over $1.360 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has increased to 50.4% on CG.

Meme Coins in Retreat
Most of the larger-cap alts have turned red today, aside from TON, which has gained 4.5% and trades close to $7. ETH has slipped by 1.5% and is now close to breaking below $3,750, while SOL, XRP, ADA, TRX, MATIC, and UNI are with minor losses.
Shiba Inu, Avalanche, Chainlink, and NEAR have all dropped by 3-5%. More losses come from meme coins like Pepe (-7.5%) and WIF (-5%).
On the other hand, KAS has skyrocketed by 18% and now trades close to $0.18.
The total crypto market cap has shed samo value since yesterday but still remains north of $2.7 trillion on CG.

Positive Trend Continues in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs! Logins Happened for the 15th Consecutive Day! Here are the Figures - Bitcoin Sistemi


US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added $105.12 million on Monday, recording a 15th consecutive day of net inflows.
US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $105 Million Daily Inflows, Extending Positive Streak to 15 Days
This marks the second longest positive streak since their debut. There has been a total inflow of over $2.28 billion into 11 ETFs in the past 15 days.


Fidelity's FBTC led the way with net inflows of $77 million, according to SoSoValue data. Bitwise's BITB followed with $14 million, while Ark Invest and 21Shares' ARKB added $11 million.
The two largest spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock and Grayscale, reported no new flows on Monday.





VanEck and WisdomTree's spot ETFs saw minimal inflows, each reporting less than $2 million.

This consistent flow reflects growing investor confidence and interest in Bitcoin as a viable asset class.


However, total flow volume in US spot Bitcoin ETFs remains significantly lower than the peak observed in March.
Globally, crypto investment products have seen significant participation. According to CoinShares' latest report, these products attracted over $2 billion in interest last month, pushing year-to-date net inflows to over $15 billion.





Financial analysts attribute this steady inflow to several factors, including increasing market optimism and the increasing number of institutional investors looking to invest in Bitcoin through regulated financial instruments.

NodeMonkes leads NFT sales with over US$1 million in a day


NodeMonkes, a Bitcoin-based Ordinals collection topped CryptoSlam’s daily non-fungible tokens (NFT) sales chart on Monday with over US$1 million in sales.



NodeMonkes is the top Bitcoin collection with US$232.28 million in all-time sales, which ranks it 26th in the entire NFT market.



Guild of Guardians Avatars opened the week on the second spot after dominating last week’s sales charts.



The digital assets based on Immutable’s mobile role-playing game had US$927,430 million in sales, a slight dip from the previous day.

	
	
	
	


In third place, Bitcoin Puppets, also on the Bitcoin blockchain, generated US$906,427.



Ranked fourth was DMarket on the Mythos blockchain with US$685,469 in daily sales. Bored Ape Yacht Club, an Ethereum-based collection, ranked fifth with sales of US$420,713. 



NodeMonke’s lead pushed the Bitcoin network to the top of the daily blockchain rank for NFT sales. Bitcoin had US$5.3 million in sales on Monday, up from US$3.21 million on Sunday. 



Bitcoin’s surge comes after the global NFT market closed its worst monthly performance since October with US$604 million in sales. It’s the first time this year that the global market had less than US$1 billion in monthly sales.

Can Ripple's XRP Skyrocket by 63,000% If History Repeats? (Analysts)


																TL;DR

XRP’s price performance has been lagging behind the leading cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and SOL in the last 30 days.
Nonetheless, analysts remain optimistic that a rally is on the horizon based on the asset’s historical performance and some essential factors.


Is It Time for an XRP Bull Run?
Many of the leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), and more, witnessed significant price surges in the past month. However, this is not the case with Ripple’s XRP, whose valuation dipped by 2% for that time frame.

Meanwhile, numerous analysts believe the asset is poised for a rally as soon as this month. The X user JAVON MARKS claimed that XRP has been holding a certain resistance zone for several months, describing it as a “hidden bullish divergence setup.” The analyst reminded that in 2017, the same pattern was followed by a 63,000% price increase in less than a year. 
“If XRP hasn’t already made a name for itself, it sure looks as if it’s about to do so now,” the trader added.
Cryptoes and Mikybull Crypto chipped in, too. The former argued that XRP has been “respecting weekly support,” envisioning a “big move” in the short term. 
Mikybull Crypto maintained that the asset is currently at a similar level as that experienced in 2017 and 2020. In both cases, the consolidation was followed by a massive price resurgence.




Observing Other Important Factors
Several indicators related to XRP’s ecosystem can also hint at a possible bull run. One example is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and change of price movements and helps traders assess whether the token is overbought or oversold.
It ranges from 0 to 100 as a ratio above 70 suggests that XRP might be due for correction. Data shows RSI has been hovering below that level for the past two weeks.
One person who recently predicted that XRP is ready to head north based on that trend is the X user EGRAG CRYPTO.
Another major element that could trigger a price resurgence for the token is a possible resolution of the lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC. The legal battle is currently in its trial phase, with some industry participants seeing the company with the upper hand due to its three partial court victories secured throughout 2023.

Cardano vs. Bitcoin: A Deep Dive into Charles Hoskinson's Blockchain Project


							

Charles Hoskinson’s vision for Cardano focuses on security, scalability, and interoperability.



Cardano’s methodical development and partnerships highlight its potential despite its lower popularity than Bitcoin.



Cardano’s proof-of-stake mechanism and smart contracts offer energy-efficient, decentralized applications.




A newly released YouTube video explores the journey and vision of Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, who created Cardano to address the limitations of existing blockchain systems.



After dropping out of college, Hoskinson mined Bitcoin in 2013 and founded the Bitcoin Education Project, educating thousands about cryptocurrency. However, the challenges of modifying blockchain code post-launch inspired him to conceive a new blockchain.



Hoskinson’s vision solidified at the 2014 North American Bitcoin Conference, where he met Vitalik Buterin, leading to Ethereum’s creation. However, their differing visions on a for-profit model led to Hoskinson’s departure and the formation of Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) with Jeremy Wood. Together, they began developing Cardano, named after historical thinkers.



Cardano prioritizes security, scalability, and interoperability. It was an early adopter of proof-of-stake, aiming for energy efficiency. With a capped supply of 45 billion tokens, Cardano emphasizes a balanced approach to growth. Its treasury system and methodical development have fostered partnerships with African universities, governments, and organizations.



Cardano’s development spans several eras, each with distinct goals. Currently, in the Basho era, it focuses on performance through sidechains. The upcoming Voltaire era will emphasize governance and decentralization. This structured progression underpins Cardano’s steady growth. The market cap reached nearly $100 billion during the last bull run, with a token price peaking at $3.



Comparing Cardano to Bitcoin reveals key differences. Cardano’s proof-of-stake consensus consumes less energy than Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mechanism. Additionally, Cardano’s smart contract functionality enables decentralized applications. Despite its lower popularity and value compared to Bitcoin, Cardano shows promise, and enthusiasts remain optimistic about its future.









The current price of Cardano stands at $0.456957, reflecting a 0.64% increase over the past 24 hours. Its trading volume reached $303,807,565, with a market cap of $16,316,680,096. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price is $68,947.05, down 0.26% in the same period, boasting a market cap of $1,358,773,794,405.



Cardano’s circulating supply is 35,707,291,318 ADA coins, with a maximum supply of 45,000,000,000 ADA coins. Bitcoin, in contrast, has a circulating supply of 19,707,496 BTC coins and a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins.

Pi Network Popularity And Rumor Reality Check


                                As The Pi Network Mainnet Launch Date Getting Closer, The Rumors Spike                                Pi Network is a recently created cryptocurrency project that was started in 2019 by Nicolas Kokkalis and Chengdiao Fan from Stanford University. Thus, with its innovative approach to mobile mining, Pi Network enables users to mine Pi Coins on their smartphones which has made it a popular project. As the community awaits the network’s mainnet launch is scheduled for 28th June 2024. Pi Network recently doubled its mainnet migration speed through essential optimizations. These upgrades involve changes in algorithms, processes, and interactions, making the migration workflow more seamless and efficient. This improvement means that tasks on the network will now be completed in seconds instead of minutes, allowing Pi Network to handle migration requests more rapidly. This significant boost in efficiency is expected to help the network surpass its previous monthly user addition records.Rumors Circulating in the MarketDespite the positive news, the Pi Network community has been rife with rumors and speculation. One of the most significant concerns revolves around the sudden disappearance of Pi Network's founder, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis. His extended absence and recent resignation have fueled various theories from personal issues to strategic moves similar to Bitcoin's mysterious founder Satoshi Nakamoto. This uncertainty has left users anxious about the future of the project.Impact of Rumors on the Crypto MarketThese rumors have significantly impacted the perception of Pi Coin in the cryptocurrency market. Some investors are wary, fearing that the project might be a scam. This skepticism is heightened by the increasing number of fraud cases involving Pi Coin. The pandemic has been accompanied by so much hype that scammers have been able to develop fake websites and social media accounts to con people. These incidents have brought a lot of negative sentiments and doubts into the project, making many people doubt the credibility of Pi Network.Crypto specialists have stated that the growing number of scams and fraudulent activities linked to Pi Coin may negatively impact the perception of the crypto market in general. The users are most at risk of being scammed into high returns for Pi Coin transactions that can only be traded once the mainnet is fully functional.The popularity of the Pi Network Leads to Scams Although Pi Network is still relatively new, it has gained immense popularity and as a result, it has become the target of scammers.  There is also a lot of fraud associated with the popularity of Pi Coin. There are also fake sites and profiles on social networks where people are being scammed. These scams have targeted many people and those who have invested their efforts in mining Pi Coins have been defrauded. This is because the holders of Pi Coins have not been able to trade their tokens before the mainnet and thus they are willing to do anything to be able to sell the coins, making them easy victims of fraudsters.How to Protect Yourself from Scams Pi Network users should remember that Pi Coins cannot be traded until the mainnet is live. Here are some key precautions:Do Not Engage in Pi Coin Transactions:  Until the mainnet is launched, any promise of Pi Coin transactions is likely a scam.Use Official Channels:  Only use the official Pi Network app and website for information and updates.Beware of Social Media Scams:  Avoid interacting with posts or messages on social media that offer to buy or sell Pi Coins.Stay Informed:  Keep up to date with official announcements from the Pi Network team to avoid falling for false information.What CoinGabbar Concluded?The way to the Pi Network mainnet launch is full of opportunities and threats. On the one hand, technical progress and an increasing number of users provide hope on the other hand, rumors and scammers are the threats. Now that the community is waiting for the mainnet to be launched, it is important to remain both informed and careful. Thus, it is possible to note that the potential of Pi Network is still high, especially regarding mobile mining and the overall crypto space. However, users have to be careful about the current environment.Also Read: News for PI Users: Pi Network Doubles Mainnet Migration Speed

AI sets XRP price for June 30, 2024


    Although the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency market have recorded modest growth or at least consolidation of their previous gains in recent weeks, XRP (XRP) has been stuck in a relentlessly negative price trend, and machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are not optimistic.



As it happens, the price of XRP has declined over 15% since the year’s turn, as well as recording continuous declines in past days and weeks, and only recently managing to slightly turn the tide and start the day in the green price zone in what seems to be a late reaction to the rest of the market’s moves.



XRP/Ripple price prediction



Meanwhile, in terms of its future price action, the advanced machine learning algorithm over at the crypto analytics and forecasting platform PricePredictions has projected that XRP would continue to drop, hitting the price of $0.448403 on June 30, 2024, according to the data obtained on June 4.

Indeed, should the algorithm’s predictions, which draw upon technical analysis (TA) indicators like relative strength index (RSI), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and others, come true, they would reflect a decline of 13.83% from XRP’s current situation.



XRP price analysis



At press time, XRP price stood at $0.52035, suggesting an increase of 0.10% on the day while dipping 1.51% across the past week and recording a loss of 1.59% in the last month, as per the most recent chart data retrieved by Finbold on June 4.

So, why is XRP dropping? Notably, the reason behind XRP’s poor price action in recent days and weeks could be the bearish sentiment from the possibility of Ripple selling 400 million XRP in June, which would represent the largest drop in seven years and potentially shake XRP’s market dynamics.



On the other hand, a renowned pseudonymous crypto trading expert EGRAG CRYPTO has recently observed the possibility of a major move upwards for XRP based on two key chart patterns – the White Channel and the White Triangle – which could lead its market capitalization toward a whopping $3 trillion.

Adding the current optimism regarding Ripple’s courtroom battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into the mix, the crypto industry analyst’s exceedingly bullish predictions regarding XRP’s market value in the next year could, indeed, come true.



All things considered, XRP might indeed follow the path predicted by the machine learning algorithm, although the above expert has differing views, illustrating the importance of doing one’s own research when investing in any asset, crypto or otherwise.

Ethereum weekly inflows hit $34 million - Are ETFs the reason? - AMBCrypto



Year-to-date inflows into crypto products have surpassed $15 billion.
Ethereum recorded its second week of inflows.

Digital asset investment products recorded inflows totaling $185 million last week, marking the fourth consecutive week of inflows, digital asset investment firm CoinShares found in its new report.
Although this marked an 82% decline from the $1.05 billion recorded in inflows the previous week, it still pushed May’s inflows to $2 billion. Also, it brought the year-to-date (YTD) inflows into cryptocurrency funds above the $15 billion mark.
According to the digital asset investment firm, trading volumes declined during the week under review. They totaled $8 billion, a 38% drop from the $13 billion registered the previous week. 
At the end of the week, as observed by CoinShares, the total assets under management (AUM) for crypto-based investment products were above $97 billion. This was a 1.3% decline from the $98.43 billion recorded the previous week. 
Regionally, most of last week’s flows into crypto funds came from the U.S. According to CoinShares:
“The majority of inflows were from the US, seeing a net US$130m, although incumbent ETF issuer outflows rose to US$260m. Switzerland saw its second largest week on inflows this year at US$36m, while Canada saw a turnaround with inflows of US$25m despite seeing a net outflow in May totaling US$39m.”
Luck smiles on Ethereum
Since the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first set of applications for spot Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from Grayscale, Bitwise, iShares, VanEck, Ark Invest, Invesco, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton on 22nd May, ETH-based products have recorded significant inflows. 
The week under review was the same. According to CoinShares’ report, Ethereum-backed products recorded their second week of inflows, which amounted to $34 million.
This represented 18% of all inflows recorded during that period. Also, last week’s liquidity flows into Ethereum pushed the altcoin’s YTD inflows to $11 million.

CoinShares said:
“This represents a turnaround in investor sentiment in an asset that had seen a 10-week run of outflows prior, totaling US$200m.”
CoinShares found that last week’s inflows in Ethereum impacted Solana [SOL] due to the statistically positive correlation between them. 
“This positive news for Ethereum has also had an impact on Solana, which saw a further US$5.8m inflow last week.”

Can The XRP Ledger Be Hacked? Ripple CTO Gives Insides


								In a recent interview with The Defiant, David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer at Ripple, shed light on the security mechanisms of the XRP Ledger and the theoretical attack strategies it could face. Schwartz explained that unlike Proof-of-Work systems like Bitcoin, the XRP Ledger relies on a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism called the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RCPΑ) for security.
How The XRP Ledger Could Theoretically Be Attacked
Here’s how Schwartz describes it: “The only problem you can’t fix [with every node enforcing every rule] is the double spend problem […] the only way that you could sort of attack the XRP Ledger was to stop the global ordering from working and that would just cause the whole the whole network to halt.”
This “global ordering” refers to validators agreeing on a specific sequence for transactions, preventing them from being spent twice. Disrupting this order would indeed halt the network. Schwartz acknowledges the possibility of an attack, but downplays its feasibility.

“Really the only plausible attack on the XRP Ledger is just to stop it,” he said. However, he reasons that such an attack would be difficult to monetize and would quickly lose effectiveness “as soon as somebody caused the XRP Ledger to halt people would just stop listening to them.”
Schwartz also acknowledges a potential motive for a disruption attack. “The one reason I imagine people would want to attack the system is if they were short XRP […] you’d imagine XRP might fall in value if the network stops.” However, he argues that the knowledge of this potential attack would make it difficult to borrow XRP for shorting to a risky degree.
Launching such an attack would require accumulating trust through proof-of-association within the network. Schwartz argues that validators chosen for their trustworthiness would be unlikely to collude in an attack.
“When you choose the participants that you’re willing to work with to come to a consensus your sole criteria is they’re not going to collude to break the network […] if you’re specifically choosing people by their unlikelihood to collude to break the network and nevertheless they still collude to break the network, you’re like the worst at choosing possible.”

Schwartz compares this attacker difficulty to Proof-of-Work systems: “Whoever has the most [power] can launch that exact same type of attack […] being forced to trust the party that has the most money is somehow a better model.”
Schwartz downplays the practicality of the attack, highlighting the difficulty and limited window for disruption. “In practice it’s an extremely difficult attack to launch and you would only be able to halt the network once for a fairly short period of time,” he said. He compares it to the double-spend attack in Bitcoin, something users should be aware of but not overly worried about: “I would say this is kind of in the same category.”
The interview concluded with Schwartz mentioning the current network size. “I think last I checked, there were about 600 nodes of which a little over a hundred of them were actually participating in the validation process,” he stated. This structure is similar to the distinction between full nodes and mining nodes in the Bitcoin network.
The XRP Ledger’s design prioritizes security through its consensus mechanism. While a disruption attack is theoretically possible, Schwartz emphasizes the difficulty and limited impact of such an attempt. However, as with any system, security remains an ongoing conversation, and Ripple’s approach has its own considerations, such as the reliance on trusted validators.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.52.

Toncoin (TON) is setting the pace for whale transaction count as the market seeks to maintain a balance between coins with a bearish trend and those sustaining their bullish momentum. Toncoin falls on the latter side of the aisle, building on the momentum it has registered since the start of this year.According to an update from top market analyst Ali Martinez, Toncoin whale transactions soared by more than 237% in a single day. By definition, IntoTheBlock noted that whale transactions are those valued at $100,000 or more. As observed on the charts shared by Martinez, the Toncoin whale transaction soared from a low of five transactions over the past week to 27 as of June 3. Whale transactions have a way of shifting the narrative around the price of a particular digital currency. With more accumulation, the supply of the cryptocurrency in circulation is reduced, forcing a major crunch which, when matched with sustained demand, can drive the price of the coin higher.At the time of writing, TON, the native token of Toncoin, is up by 2.76% in the past 24 hours to $6.79. One intriguing trend was observed in the Toncoin ecosystem that further underscored the role of TON whales in fueling the price surge. The daily trading volume is down by more than 58% to $208,461,709.One major factor driving the TON whale transaction is the market action around Notcoin (NOT), the sensational token that launched on The Open Network in May. Notcoin is trying to carve a niche for itself as both a meme coin and a play-2-earn (P2E) game, one that has made it see a surge to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.02896 atop 201% growth in the trailing seven-day period.Toncoin remains in the top 10 list of most capitalized coins joining the altcoins, keeping Shiba Inu (SHIB) out of the top 10.

Binance, the largest crypto exchange globally, has seen a sudden drop in XRP holdings as a total of 25.23 million XRP, or about $13.16 million, has been withdrawn from the exchange. The transfer was made to an undisclosed address, according to Whale Alert.Historically, withdrawals from exchanges have been seen as a positive sign. It is often thought that big investors are buying digital assets on these platforms and then moving them to their own wallets for safe storage. Further investigation into the transaction details shows that a specific address, "rDAE53," initiated the transfer of millions of XRP to another wallet, labeled "rfQ9." This destination address, which currently holds 4.167 million XRP, has been linked to withdrawals from Binance earlier this year.XRP price outlookMoreover, the timing of this substantial XRP withdrawal coincides with notable price action for the cryptocurrency.XRP to USD by CoinMarketCapFollowing a decline since May 21, XRP appears to have stabilized around $0.51 per token, a crucial support level historically associated with price upswings. It has been observed that maintaining this price level has historically led to price growth, whereas breaching it resulted in significant declines.XRP enthusiasts should watch closely to see if this withdrawal is a sign of accumulating investors betting on a future price surge, or if it could precede another downward trend for the popular cryptocurrency.

Ripple CTO Reveals XRP Ledger's Achilles' Heel, Downplays Attack Risk


							

Ripple CTO says XRPL is highly secure and only vulnerable to attacks that halt the network.



David Schwartz claims such an attack is difficult to monetize, making it unlikely.



Schwartz noted potential risk scenarios where an attacker might open a large short position on XRP.




In a recent podcast, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz discussed the robust security of the XRP Ledger, identifying only one feasible attack vector on the network.



Schwartz explained that the XRP Ledger utilizes a Proof-of-Association (PoA) consensus mechanism, which ensures integrity by prioritizing the first transaction received, thus preventing double-spending.



The Ripple CTO confidently stated that the XRP Ledger’s design renders it impervious to attacks that would alter digital asset ownership. He said, “There is nothing you can tell my software that will result in it making your XRP somebody else’s XRP.”



Schwartz also noted that the network has only been subjected to generic attacks and has yet to face sophisticated threats. However, he pointed out that the only plausible method of attack would be to disrupt the global sequence of transactions, which would effectively halt the network’s operations. The Ripple CTO added that there is no incentive to halt the XRPL network, as it is difficult to envision a way to profit from such an action.



 
 




Despite the robust security, Schwartz acknowledged a potential risk scenario where an attacker might open a large short position on XRP and then attempt to attack the network to manipulate its price downward.



However, he downplayed such an attack as unlikely due to theoretical and practical safeguards. He pointed out that those offering XRP short positions would be vigilant against such attacks. Moreover, the network’s design only allows for a one-time, short-duration attack, minimizing any potential impact.



Notably, during his conversation, Schwartz also touched upon various other topics during the podcast, including the distribution of XRP, its use cases, the potential for smart contracts, and Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. SEC.

VanEck CEO Says Bitcoin To Become at Least Half the Market Cap of Gold - Here’s His Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								The chief executive of the financial giant VanEck believes that Bitcoin’s (BTC) market cap will eventually soar to at least half of gold’s market cap.
In a new interview with Scott Melker, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck says that it could take up to a decade for traditional finance (TradFi) to help drive Bitcoin’s market cap to $7.85 trillion.










The current gold market cap is at approximately $15.7 trillion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s market cap is about $1.36 trillion.
“I say [Bitcoin will] eventually become at least half the market cap of gold. So I think that takes another five or 10 years. Our TradFi clients are still very confused by Bitcoin, and they don’t want to talk about it, but their clients make them talk about it. So we have a long ways to go. And also buying activities is not helpful. They want to buy it at the tops and then it’s going to go to zero at the bottom. And so they’re bad at allocating… 
In the United States, there are a lot of firms, obviously in Europe as well, that allocate people’s portfolios for them. And so my hope is those allocators will be open-minded enough to consider gold or Bitcoin at the right time in the cycle and disciplined to take advantage of those trends for their clients, because I kind of give up that the end clients will get it.” 
He also believes there is an increasing appetite by investors outside of the United States to own Bitcoin because it is not under the purview of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).
“Investors outside the United States increasingly don’t want to be tied into SWIFT, in the US financial system and the political control that comes with it.”
Bitcoin is trading for $69,020 at time of writing, up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

This Company Will Buy $12 Million In Floki


DWF Labs has committed a substantial $12 million investment in FLOKI tokens, signaling strong support for the Floki Ecosystem. 
This investment by the crypto market maker marks a significant milestone for the project.
Why DWF Labs Supports Floki Ecosystem

DWF Labs will split the purchase between tokens bought from the open market and those acquired directly from the Floki treasury. 

“This strategic purchase is aimed at further strengthening Floki’s position in the industry, especially in what is poised to be one of Floki’s most pivotal years ever due to the impending release of several key products,” Floki said.

Previously known as Floki Inu, Floki has rebranded and is now intensifying its focus on projects focusing on use cases. Among the most awaited releases this year is the mainnet launch of the Valhalla metaverse game, Floki’s flagship utility product. 
Additionally, Floki plans to unveil various other utility offerings. These include the Floki trading bot and the Floki decentralized domain name and website service, which are expected to enhance its functionality and integration across diverse platforms. Despite the DWF Labs investment announcement, the price of Floki is still down by 5.31% in the past 24 hours.

This latest financial commitment from DWF Labs follows a previous $10 million investment in February 2024 and a $5 million investment in May 2023. These prior contributions have significantly elevated Floki’s market presence and facilitated broader adoption.
The partnership between DWF Labs and Floki was initiated in May 2023. Since then, they have successfully enhanced the token’s visibility through strategic exchange listings and key industry partnerships. The crypto market maker’s continued support has been crucial in promoting Floki’s milestones and accomplishments.

Donald Trump: betting on Polymarket for the elections begins

Despite the recent conviction of guilt for Donald Trump, the traders of Polymarket continue to bet on his victory in the 2024 elections. Not only that, for 75% of the bets it seems that Trump will not go to prison.

Donald Trump and the traders on Polymarket: increasing bets on his victory as President of the USA
At the end of May, Donald Trump was declared guilty of as many as 34 charges by the Manhattan court. Despite the conviction, the candidate for the Presidency of the United States still seems to be the favorite winner, at least for the traders of Polymarket. 
Polymarket is a platform where users buy and sell shares using crypto, betting on the probability of future events occurring. 
And indeed, Polymarket itself shared on X the betting situation on the “winner of the 2024 Presidential elections” with Donald Trump leading with 54% of the votes. 

“Winner of the 2024 presidential elections: Donald Trump 54% (+16); Joe Biden 38%; Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 2%.”
At the moment, then, the situation has also changed. The bets on Donald Trump as the new President of the USA have risen to 56%, while on Joe Biden they have fallen to 37%.
Donald Trump and the bets on Polymarket: for traders, he will not go to prison
Another bet on Polymarket also reveals that the majority of traders bet that Donald Trump will not go to prison. 
Specifically, 75% of traders have bet that Trump will not go to prison, while 18% have bet on the range of 1-11 months of prison. Then, 3% of traders have bet that Trump will go to prison for over 48 months. 
A similar bet, also on Polymarket, instead concerned the case of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), founder and former CEO of the failed crypto-exchange FTX. Even SBF, during the week of waiting for the verdict on his sentence, was the protagonist of bets on the number of years of prison he would receive.
With hindsight, only 28% of traders would have won, betting on the 20-30 year prison range, given that the sentence for SBF was 25 years in prison. 
The situation on crypto regulation in the USA?
The conviction of Trump could also concern the crypto world, given that in this year of electoral campaign and voting, the candidate for the Presidency of the USA is showing support for the sector.
In the month of May, in fact, it emerged that Trump’s election campaign has started to accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other crypto. 
Not only that, Trump has also promised that if he is elected President of the USA, he will proceed with the liberation of Ross Ulbricht, founder of Silk Road, sentenced to two life sentences plus 40 years in prison. As is well known, Ulbricht has become a sort of martyr for many, even in the crypto community.

Pepe Whale Investor Becomes Millionaire In Less Than 6 Months, Makes 10x Profit - Benzinga

A whale investor struck gold by selling their Pepe Coin PEPE/USD at 976% profit after holding for nearly six months.What Happened: According to on-chain tracking platform Lookonchain, the wealthy trader transferred a staggering 365.96 billion PEPE tokens, worth $5.3 million, to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance on Monday.  The investor had withdrawn this amount in December last year when the total stash was worth $494,000. This means that he profited by nearly $4.8 million in less than six months, representing a massive 10X return.Why It Matters: This profit-taking occurs as the frog-themed token continues to make strong advances in the year. Pepe exploded more than 14X on a year-to-date basis. The Ethereum ETH/USD-based memecoin was also one of the best market performers in the last month, with gains of more than 62%.However, of late, the cryptocurrency has been witnessing corrective action. In the last 24 hours, PEPE's large transactions volume plunged 27%, according to data from intoTheBlock. That said, the balance in long-term holders' addresses rose by 0.09%, signaling that market participants were accumulating and bullish on the coin's near-term prospects.Price Action: At the time of writing, PEPE  was exchanging hands at $0.00001421, sinking 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: NBA NFT Creator Dapper Labs Settles Securities Violation Lawsuit For $4M: ‘Pleased With The Results’Photo via ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

These Altcoins Reached New All-Time Highs Against Bitcoin


Altcoins often take their cues from Bitcoin, getting caught in the crosshairs of industry trends and market developments.
After the FTX exchange collapsed in November 2022, the crypto market dipped, and only a few tokens have fully recovered.
Altcoins That Were Able to Recover From the FTX Crash
The fall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire whiplashed the market, causing billions of dollars to go down the drain. In the aftermath, several altcoins plunged to lows never seen before. Now, data shows that only eight tokens have managed to post new peaks against BTC since the FTX saga.
Render (RNDR)
Benefitting from the 2024 AI narrative and steered by positive Nvidia reports, the Render (RNDR) price has cleared its peak price above the 0.0001100 threshold.
Altcoin’s price has consistently made higher lows and remains above the rising trendline, indicating the potential for an increase. The higher lows of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) support this outlook, suggesting continued bullish momentum in the RNDR market.
Read more: Render Token (RNDR): A Guide to What It Is and How It Works
RNDR/BTC 1W Chart. Source: TradingView
The bears must manage a candlestick close below the 0.0001013 support level to invalidate this bullish outlook. A stable close below this threshold would signify a lower low relative to the previous correction, indicating a change in market structure.
SingularityNET (AGIX)
Another AI token that has managed to record a new peak post-FTX collapse is AGIX. While it remains below its 2023 peak of 0.00002886, it’s holding above the 2022 high of 0.00000693.
From a technical standpoint, the AGIX price is primed for a bullish move as it consolidates within a falling wedge pattern. This bullish reversal technical formation could provide a good entry upon a breakout above the upper trend line.
The profit target of this falling wedge is a 273% climb to 0.00005000, measured by adding the maximum distance between the upper and lower trend lines to the breakout point.

AGIX/BTC 1W Chart. Source: TradingView
However, the bullish thesis would be invalidated if seller momentum increases below the 0.00000500 psychological level.
As a side note, the recent ASI token merger, which brought the AGIX, Fetch.ai (FET), and Ocean Protocol(OCEAN) ecosystems together, signals a significant shift in the decentralized artificial intelligence market.
Injective (INJ)
The Injective token, a Cosmos-based blockchain that combines AI elements with decentralized finance (DeFi), is also on the list. After the 2022 low of 0.0001518, INJ climbed nearly 590% before topping at 0.00102.
However, in the hands of the bears, the altcoin has since lost some ground covered and is trading for 0.00036 at the time of writing. Based on the RSI outlook, the Injective price could extend the slump below the 0.00033 support level before a possible recovery.
The RSI is resisting further downside, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histograms pale out from a previous red shade, suggesting growing bullish momentum. While a candlestick close above 0.00051 would entice more buy orders, INJ would only be attractive to buy once it takes back the 0.00102 range high.

INJ/BTC 1W Chart. Source: TradingView
On the other hand, a breakdown of the 0.00033 support level would trigger panic selling, potentially reinvigorating the downward momentum.
Tellor (TRB)
The Tellor to BTC price soared to a peak of 0.014 in December 2023 after descending to the depths of 0.00022 in the immediate aftermath of the FTX collapse. However, the peak was rejected shortly after, and now the TRB price is back below pre-FTX collapse levels.
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator hints at a possible buy signal, which would be executed if the MACD crosses above the orange band or the signal line. The prospective crossover suggests that the short-term momentum is strengthening, and buying pressure is increasing.
Nevertheless, the Tellor price would only be out of the woods after a candlestick close above the 50% Fibonacci placeholder of 0.00746.

TRB/BTC 1W Chart. Source: TradingView
Conversely, if bearish momentum pushes the Tellor price below the 0.0006659 level, the bullish outlook will be negated.

Astar (ASTR)
Astar soared to an all-time high of 0.00000700 in December, clearing the 2022 highs of 0.00000322. However, the breakout proved premature as the Astar price corrected soon after.
The altcoin looks primed for more losses amid falling momentum, as shown by the nose-diving Relative Strength Index (RSI). The Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator is also in negative territory, reinforcing the bearish outlook.

ASTR/BTC 1W Chart. Source: TradingView
Amid a predominant downtrend, the bearish thesis for the Astar price would only be reversed after a stable close above the 0.00000500 psychological level.
ssv.network (SSV)
ssv.network bulls are pushing for more gains, with the SSV/BTC trading pair consolidating within an ascending parallel channel. The higher lows of the RSI support this outlook, with SSV price likely to record more gains as bullish momentum prevails.
Traders looking to take new long positions on ssv.network should wait for the RSI to make a stable close above the mean level of 50 and the SSV price to flip into the area above the channel’s centerline.

On the other hand, a break below the channel’s lower trendline would send the ssv.network price to the bears, with the altcoin likely to roll over to the depths of 0.000500 or, in a dire case, a leg lower to the 0.0001251 all-time low.
Trust Wallet Token (TWT)
Despite the FTX debacle in November 2022, the Trust Wallet Token price against BTC soared nearly 200% to a peak of 0.000166. The surge in TWT was likely attributed to FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), as investors moved their holdings to wallet storage as the FTX exchange imploded.
Nevertheless, the TWT price remains in the thicket, with the RSI and the MACD signaling a lull market devoid of bullish momentum.

Binance Coin (BNB)
Like TWT, Binance Coin’s price soared to a peak of 0.019700 on the back of the FTX implosion. However, in 2023, regulatory pressure in the US caused the BNB price to drop to 0.005193.
With growing bullish sentiment, as shown by the RSI climbing and the MACD in positive territory, the Binance Coin could continue the uptrend. On the one-week timeframe below, however, BNB would only be attractive to buy once the Binance Coin price escapes the Fibonacci Golden Zone between 61.8% and 38.2% at 0.010735 and 0.014158, respectively.
The higher lows on the BNB price, flanked by the climbing RSI, suggest growing bullish momentum and sentiment by extension.

Conversely, with the MACD hinting at a possible crossover below the signal line, the BNB price could pull back. A lower low below the bottom of the market range at the 0.005193 threshold on the weekly timeframe would invalidate the bullish outlook.

Tech magnate Elon Musk, an active X platform user (and its owner), has shared a few comments on the recent glitch that made the A-class share price of Warren Buffett’s company crash. He also mentioned AI.One of the tweets that Musk shared in connection with this was a jokingly created screenshot of Buffett’s tweet, which stated “hodl.”Berkshire Hathaway stock "crashes," Musk commentsMusk shared a tweet by the @TrungTPhan account, which stated that “Buffett just posted on this platform for the first time in 9 years to clear up this Berkshire Hathaway issue.”What the legendary stock investor allegedly posted to persuade the company’s shareholders not to sell BRYN was “hodl” – a meme that originated in the misspelling of the word “hold” and then turned into a popular acronym in the crypto community, standing for “hold on for dear life.”Musk responded with a “face with tears of joy” emoji. The crypto community appreciated Musk’s reaction and the repost he made, getting excited and beginning to jest about Warren Buffett and the technical issue that Berkshire Hathaway became a victim of. Many stated that this screenshot with “hodl” on it was a fake and began to discuss the situation with Buffett’s company. Musk also reposted a tweet by the Zerohedge news outlet, which also commented on the situation with the tech glitch on the Bloomberg Terminal, stating, “What can possibly go wrong when you have AI reporting on every market move.” The screenshot of the display showed that Berkshire Hathaway A-Class stocks suddenly plunged from $624,400 to $185.10 per share.The humorous reaction of the crypto community was caused by the fact that Warren Buffett is a rigorous Bitcoin hater. Here's what really happenedThe above-mentioned tech glitch took place on Monday, and it caused the A-class shares of Berkshire Hathaway to look like they collapsed by 100% on the New York Stock Exchange for most of the morning.Trading was then paused for those shares. The glitch also hit the share price of Barrick Gold and Nuscale Power, among 40 assets. According to the NYSE, the technical difficulties were caused by price-bands published by the Consolidated Tape Association – a popular tool provided by this organization and used by many large market trading venues.

Consolidation Phase Over? Crypto Market Is Poised to Move North (Bitfinex)


																Bitfinex analysts have identified on-chain dynamics that suggest the crypto market’s correction phase is over, and investors have entered a re-accumulation phase, which precedes rallies.
According to the latest Bitfinex Alpha report, crypto investors are buying bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) at an increasingly consistent pace. The market shift from consolidation to re-accumulation is evident in the behavior of BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the average transaction size on Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Consolidation Phase is Over
Following bitcoin’s rally to its all-time high of $73,700 in mid-March, long-term holders began to sell off their stash to realize profits. These moves led to an increase in BTC supply on the open market and a period of price correction that saw the cryptocurrency fall as low as $57,500.
During the consolidation period, which lasted several weeks from April, Bitcoin ETFs witnessed large outflows averaging $148 million per day. Analysts said the outflows marked a form of micro-capitulation period; however, they soon reversed.
With BTC sellers getting exhausted, buying has increased. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a resurgent buy-side demand, with daily net inflows averaging $136 million in the last two weeks. Despite Grayscale’s GBTC seeing substantial outflows, the funds have been on a 15-day inflow streak, buying more than four times the daily supply of Bitcoin miners.




BTC Exchange Reserves Plunge
Crypto investors’ pivot to re-accumulation is also seen in the increase in new accumulation addresses and the average transaction size of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
“Examining the accumulation addresses on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, we see that, despite recent stable prices and modest growth for both assets, compared to previous months, there has been a noticeable increase in new accumulation addresses over the past month,” Bitfinex said.
The exchange’s analysts explained that the trend indicates that investor sentiment remains bullish despite stability in the prices of crypto assets. In addition, the estimated leverage ratio’s stability on these networks highlights a balanced market with minimal extreme risks.
Meanwhile, there has been a decrease in the Bitcoin exchange reserve, which tracks the amount of BTC held in exchange wallets. Crypto analysts consider a plunge in this metric bullish as it reduces the available supply of BTC, whereas a rise indicates more of the asset is available for sale. The decline began in February and has intensified recently as investors expect another price rally.

Santiment's Data-Driven Look at Crypto Sentiment: What's Hot, What's Not


							

Santiment’s sentiment analysis reveals Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin’s varying optimism levels, impacting market trends.



Ethereum’s positive sentiment surged post-ETF approval, signaling potential market tops.



Binance Coin shows high positive sentiment but limited attention, reflecting views on Binance overall.




Market intelligence platform Santiment analyzes varying levels of optimism and pessimism within the crypto community. In a recent report, Santiment examines sentiment trends for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin, providing insights into how market sentiment impacts price movements.







Bitcoin (BTC) currently has a positive-to-negative comment ratio of 1.59:1. The conversation around Bitcoin has been predominantly positive since its recent halving on April 19th. However, sentiment was notably neutral around its March 14th all-time high.







Source: Santiment



The positive sentiment spike in mid-May was a precursor to a market top. This indicates that surges in positive commentary can signal impending market corrections. As of press time, Bitcoin’s price is $68,736.05, showcasing a 0.56% drop in the past 24 hours.



Ethereum (ETH) displays a higher positive-to-negative comment ratio of 2.16:1. The SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETFs has driven this surge in positive sentiment. Traders’ excitement led to a price rally, nearly pushing ETH above $4,000, a level unseen since its March peak. 







Source: Santiment



However, this overwhelmingly positive sentiment should be approached cautiously, as it could suggest a market top is near. ETH is currently priced at $3,759.56, falling 1.64% in the last day.









Binance Coin (BNB) boasts the highest positive-to-negative comment ratio among the top assets, standing at 2.94:1. This week, BNB saw a minor price surge, breaking above $630 for the first time in three months. Despite this, BNB hasn’t garnered much attention, with most comments being positive. This trend reflects traders’ general views on Binance rather than on BNB. As per the latest update, BNB is valued at $629.35 and has been up 0.36% in the last 24 hours. 







Source: Santiment



Besides sentiment ratios, Santiment also uses metrics like the Weighted Sentiment Ratio, which considers the overall social volume. The Top Trending Coins Dashboard shows which tokens are experiencing a rise in discussions, indicating bullish or bearish trends. The Funding Rate reveals perpetual contract funding rates, offering insights into market sentiment. 



Additionally, Social Volume tracks the total mentions of a token, signaling potential price reversals when discussions spike during price trends. Santiment’s algorithms classify comments as bullish or bearish, offering a detailed view of market sentiment. High positive to negative comment ratios often signal sentiment-driven price tops, while low ratios may indicate sentiment-driven bottoms.

ROAR Explodes Over 300% After Kitty's GME Move


																The echoes of 2021’s meme stock saga reverberated through financial markets this morning, as the obscure ROAR meme coin and video game retailer GameStop experienced a meteoric rise fueled by social media nostalgia. The catalyst? The return of a familiar face – Keith Gill, better known by his online moniker “Roaring Kitty.”

	Related Reading


Kitty Claws Back In
Retail investors were sent scrambling after Gill, a superstar among the online investment community on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, posted a cryptic message hinting at a significant stake in GameStop.
The post, featuring an image of the “Uno Reverse” card, sent speculation into overdrive. Shortly after, Gill confirmed his bullish stance by revealing a massive holding of 5 million GameStop shares, valued at roughly $116 million based on Friday’s closing price.

In the 20 minutes that followed Gill’s post, GameStop’s stock price on Robinhood’s overnight markets shot up by 20% to $27.50. This increase followed the stock’s Friday closing price of $23.14. This year, the shares have increased by almost 40%, presumably as a result of Gill’s sudden comeback.
This disclosure sent shockwaves through the market. GameStop’s stock, infamous for its volatility during the meme stock frenzy of 2021, surged over 100% at its peak in pre-market trading on Monday.

While the price eventually settled to an impressive 88% increase, the roar from retail investors was undeniable. The ROAR meme coin, seemingly named in homage to Gill’s online persona, mirrored the GameStop price surge of over 300%, reaching a high of $0.001643.

A Meme Stock Revival? 
The sudden rise of both ROAR and GameStop has reignited the debate surrounding meme stocks. These assets, often characterized by high volatility and driven more by online hype than traditional financial metrics, captured the imagination of retail investors in 2021. Gill, who played a pivotal role in the initial GameStop saga, appears to be a key player in this potential revival.

However, analysts remain cautious. GameStop itself is in a precarious position, having recently sold a massive chunk of shares to bolster its finances while facing continued net losses and projected sales declines. The company’s long-term prospects remain uncertain, raising questions about whether this is a genuine resurgence or simply a nostalgic echo of 2021.

Weighing Hype Against Reality
The recent surge in ROAR and GameStop presents a classic risk-reward scenario for investors. Early participants who bought in at lower prices stand to reap significant profits. However, the inherent volatility of meme stocks poses a significant danger of substantial losses.

Thai SEC approves its first Bitcoin ETF with limited access to institutional investors - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Thailand has endorsed One Asset Management (ONEAM) as the first firm to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the country.The fund, named ONE Bitcoin ETF Fund of Funds Unhedged and not for Retail Investors (ONE-BTCETFOF-UI), is scheduled for distribution between May 31 and June 6, with an investment risk level of eight.According to a report from Bangkok Post, the ONE-BTCETFOF-UI is limited to wealthy and institutional investors and has a policy to invest in 11 leading global funds to ensure liquidity and safety. The fund stores coins using international standards and has been reviewed by regulatory agencies in the US and Hong Kong.Pote Harinasuta, chief executive of ONEAM, stated that digital assets are an alternative asset class with low correlation to other financial assets, making them suitable for diversifying investment risks.The approval of the fund follows the growing international recognition of Bitcoin ETFs, with the US SEC and Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission allowing the creation of funds that invest directly in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum.Despite the limited supply of Bitcoin at 21 million, demand is rising as it gains popularity, leading ONEAM to see high growth potential for the cryptocurrency. Over the past 11 years, Bitcoin has generated an average return of 124% per year, albeit with high average annual volatility of 83%.ONEAM recommends investors allocate only 5% of their portfolio to Bitcoin to obtain a return of 8.90% per year, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.71 and a maximum drawdown of -22.4%. In comparison, a portfolio without Bitcoin generates a return of 5.80% per year, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.48 and a maximum drawdown of -20.4%.“Although the supply of Bitcoin is limited at 21 million, demand is rising as it gains popularity. We see high growth potential for Bitcoin,” Pote notes.Pote emphasized the importance of coin storage security in Bitcoin ETFs, as investing directly through various platforms carries risks such as data loss or stolen digital assets. By investing through ETFs, unitholders’ data or coins will be distributed through custodians, offering the same standard used by institutional investors, which involves storing coins offline for enhanced security.Meanwhile, MFC Asset Management continues to await SEC approval for its own Bitcoin ETF, which is also restricted to wealthy and institutional investors.

Bitcoin miner Core Scientific signs major deal with Nvidia-backed firm CoreWeave, targets $3.5B in revenue - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Core Scientific, a prominent provider of blockchain infrastructure, as well as one of the largest digital asset miners in North America, announced Monday it signed a 12-year agreement to provide 200 MW of data center space to CoreWeave, a GPU cloud provider backed by Nvidia. The mining firm expects to generate more than $3.5 billion in total cumulative revenue over the duration of the contract.With the latest deal, Core Scientific has expanded its business beyond Bitcoin mining into the high-growth AI data center space. The company assures investors they’ll maintain their Bitcoin mining capacity while venturing into HPC hosting.“As demand for ready, high-power sites continues to outpace supply, we believe Core Scientific is well positioned to meet customer needs with a much shorter time to power than greenfield data center projects,” said Adam Sullivan, CEO of Core Scientific, in a press release.“Our expanding relationship with CoreWeave creates a pathway for Core Scientific to diversify our business model and balance our portfolio between bitcoin mining and alternative compute hosting, positioning us to maximize cash flow and minimize risk while maintaining our significant exposure to bitcoin’s upside potential,” he noted.According to Sullivan, Core Scientific is poised to commence modifications to its existing sites to support CoreWeave’s NVIDIA GPU operations, with the project slated to begin in the latter half of 2024 and become operational in early 2025.As part of the deal, Core Scientific will modify existing facilities to host CoreWeave’s high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This will take place in the second half of 2024 and be operational by the first half of 2025.Core Scientific claims that since it has a total of 1.2 GW of contracted power it can allocate nearly 500 MW of power for HPC workloads. Additionally, the firm plans to redeploy some Bitcoin mining capacity to make space for HPC.As noted in the press release, this agreement has been built on successful prior collaborations between the two entities. Core Scientific previously provided hosting services for CoreWeave from 2019 to 2022. Earlier in March, the two firms extended their partnership, with Core Scientific delivering HPC hosting capacity ahead of schedule.The news comes almost five months after Core Scientific won court approval to exit bankruptcy, according to Bloomberg.The firm faced major financial challenges due to the decline in crypto prices and escalating energy costs, which prompted it to reduce the value of its assets and cut 10% of its workforce in August 2022. Later in December, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing insufficiency in meeting debt repayments on leased equipment.

What The Ethereum ETF Means For Altcoins And Meme Coins - Benzinga

The much-anticipated launch of a spot Ethereum ETF has analysts divided about its impact on altcoins, meme coins and competing Layer-1 (L1) blockchains.A Double-Edged Sword For Altcoins:The potential influx of new investors drawn by the funds could lead to a “rising tide lifting all boats” scenario, according to analysts.Established altcoins with strong utility functions, like Cardano ADA/USD and Polkadot DOT/USD, which power smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), could experience significant price increases. These projects offer real-world solutions and have established developer communities, making them attractive options for investors seeking exposure to the broader blockchain ecosystem beyond just Ethereum.However, analysts also warn of a potential “flight to quality.” New investors, unfamiliar with the intricacies of the crypto space, might prioritize the perceived stability of Ethereum over riskier altcoins. This could lead to a temporary decline in the prices of smaller altcoins, especially those struggling with scalability or unclear project roadmaps.Will Meme Coins Benefit?Meme coins, the internet’s darlings like Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, are a unique case. Platforms like Binance Square anticipate a meme coin frenzy fueled by increased interest in the crypto space.This could lead to short-term price spikes for these highly volatile assets.However, other analysts believe this might be a short-lived phenomenon. Meme coins often lack strong utility and rely heavily on social media hype. As the market matures, investors might prioritize projects with long-term value propositions and proven technologies. A “meme coin top” could be on the horizon, with only the strongest meme coins with real-world applications or unique features surviving the long haul.Also Read: Roaring Kitty Return Yields Investor $300K Unrealized Profit On Ethereum-Based GME Meme CoinWill Ethereum Outperform Solana?The rivalry between Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD for dominance in the smart contracts space continues to be a focal point. The immediate impact of the Ethereum ETF could see the price of ETH surpass all time highs due to increased investor interest.However, the playing field might level out in the long term if a Solana ETF receives regulatory approval.Ultimately, the success of both platforms hinges on their ability to address scalability issues. Ethereum’s upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 promises significant improvements in transaction speeds and fees. Solana, on the other hand, boasts impressive speed and low fees but faces challenges regarding network congestion and potential centralization. Only the platform that can provide a balance of speed, security, and scalability will truly dominate the smart contracts space.Layer-1 Blockchains: A Potential Resurgence?The recent struggles of Layer-1 blockchains like Avalanche AVAX/USD and Cardano have raised concerns about their future.While the ETH ETF might initially divert attention away from these projects, a broader market surge could benefit established L1s with unique functionalities.For example, Avalanche offers high transaction speeds and low fees, while Cardano boasts a strong focus on security and a research-driven approach. These projects need to attract developers and build robust decentralized ecosystems to thrive. L1s that can carve out a niche within the blockchain landscape, offering genuine alternatives to Ethereum, are more likely to experience a comeback.The Takeaway: Navigating A Dynamic MarketThe arrival of the ETH ETF marks a significant shift in the cryptocurrency market, with potential benefits and drawbacks for different sectors. Focus should be placed on the specific use cases, technological advancements, development roadmaps, and community engagement of different projects.Beyond the immediate impact of the ETF, staying informed about regulatory developments and technological innovations is crucial for navigating the Web3 space. While meme coins might offer a fleeting thrill, established altcoins and L1s with strong development teams and clear value propositions could be better bets for long-term gains.These issues and a lot more will be discussed at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 19.Read Next: MicroStrategy And Michael Saylor Settle $40 Million Tax Fraud LawsuitImage: Shutterstock

Bitcoin Spot ETFs On 15-Day Inflow Streak As Wisconsin Starts Buying Bitcoin - Benzinga

Spot Bitcoin BTC/USD exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued their streak of net inflows, adding another $105 million on June 3,  bringing the total net inflow for the period to over $2.28 billion.What Happened: According to data from SoSoValue, the Grayscale ETF GBTC recorded no net outflow, maintaining its position, while the Fidelity ETF FBTC saw an inflow of $77.0482 million.Additionally, the Bitwise ETF BITB attracted $14.3145 million in inflows.This marked the 15th consecutive day of positive inflows, underscoring growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency investments.Also Read: MicroStrategy And Michael Saylor Settle $40 Million Tax Fraud LawsuitWhy It Matters: The Wisconsin State Investment Board (SWIB) made headlines by adding two spot Bitcoin ETFs—BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT and GBTC—to its portfolio in the first quarter of this year.This move, valued at $164 million as of March 31, signifies a significant shift as major institutions, including pension funds, begin to explore crypto assets.David Krause, a finance professor at Marquette University, commented on this development, highlighting Wisconsin’s innovative approach, according to Coindesk."Wisconsin's investment board has always been innovative. This is a fully funded pension fund so in a way, they have the luxury of being able to invest for the long term," Krause said in an interview with PBS Wisconsin. He noted that while the current holdings represent just 0.1% of SWIB’s $156 billion in assets, this investment could pave the way for larger allocations in the future.Krause suggested that the SWIB’s initial investment is likely a “toe in the water,” anticipating that the board will increase its crypto holdings and that other pension funds may follow suit. "I think it's just an entry point. They're using it as a trial run, because it really is not going to impact the portfolio substantially until you get to maybe a 1% or 2% positioning," he explained.This trend is mirrored across the institutional landscape, with nearly 500 institutional investors revealing allocations into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter. The largest investor, hedge fund Millennium Management, disclosed $2 billion in holdings across various Bitcoin ETFs, representing roughly 3% of its total assets under management.What’s Next: For further insights into the evolving digital assets landscape, industry experts will gather at the Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Roaring Kitty Return Yields Investor $300K Unrealized Profit On Ethereum-Based GME Meme CoinImage: Shutterstock

Terraform Labs Settles SEC Fraud Charges, LUNA Price Surges


							

MetaLawMan thinks the reported settlement between the SEC Do Kwon is good news.



LUNA surged 80% in one week following the tentative agreement report.



TerraUSD’s collapse in 2022 marked a dark moment in the cryptocurrency market.




Cryptocurrency advocate James “MetaLawMan” Murphy believes the reported settlement between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Terraform co-founder Do Kwon is a positive development.



According to Murphy, the proposed settlement would mean that either the Ripple or the Coinbase case will be the first to reach the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to address the legal status of crypto assets.







Meanwhile, the legal expert highlighted the report of an agreement in principle following the SEC’s case against Do Kwon and Terraform. The report claimed that the commission had reached a tentative agreement with the defendants over the suit alleging they misled cryptocurrency investors before the 2022 collapse of the stablecoin TerraUSD.



While Murphy’s comment focused on the legal implication of the report and its potential regulatory gains for the crypto industry, the LUNA community reacted positively to the news. The report’s impact was reflected in a stellar surge for the Terra LUNA ecosystem’s native token, LUNA.



Notably, LUNA began a rally shortly after the report surfaced and has continued to climb for the past week. The altcoin, which had endured a year of bearish pressure, surged significantly, breaking above notable resistance, and has gained over 80% in the past seven days.



 
 




TradingView data shows that LUNA traded for $0.000053 at the time of writing, with a price action that suggests residual bullish momentum. 



The TerraUSD collapse in 2022 was a dark moment in the cryptocurrency market and added pressure to the overall bear trend. The SEC estimated investors lost over $40 billion in the collapse of TerraUSD and LUNA. However, the reported settlement agreement offers renewed hope to the LUNA community as reflected in the token’s resurging prices.

In a recent development that underscores the growing optimism on the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading has seen a marked increase in activity, driven by a shift in market sentiment toward bullishness. Matrixport, a prominent player in the digital asset space, highlighted the trend in a tweet, noting that Bitcoin’s funding rate had been positive during the last few weeks, as sentiment had shifted more toward bullishness.They mentioned that futures trading positioning had also increased in the last 24 hours, signaling that fast traders (futures traders) were expecting Bitcoin to continue to rally. The positive funding rate for Bitcoin futures is a critical indicator of market sentiment. A positive funding rate means that traders holding long positions (betting on a price increase) are paying a fee to those holding short positions (betting on a price decrease). This scenario typically reflects bullish market sentiment, as it suggests that the majority of traders are confident that the price of Bitcoin will rise.The increase in futures trading positioning within the last 24 hours is another significant signal. It suggests that futures traders, who are often known for their quick reactions to market movements, are positioning themselves for a continued rally in Bitcoin's price. This behavior indicates a strong belief in the upward momentum of Bitcoin, bolstering the overall bullish sentiment on the market.Current market performanceDespite the bullish sentiment and increased futures trading activity, the current price of Bitcoin stands at $68,883, reflecting a slight decrease of 0.32% in the last 24 hours. However, it is important to note that Bitcoin's price has surged by 8.63% over the past 30 days, showcasing a robust performance amid fluctuating market conditions. The 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin also provides a lens into the heightened market activity.Currently, the trading volume is up by 20.70%, standing at $29.3 billion. This substantial increase in trading volume is indicative of heightened market participation and interest in Bitcoin, further reinforcing the bullish sentiment observed on the futures market. The current trends in Bitcoin futures trading and market sentiment have several implications for the future trajectory of Bitcoin. The sustained positive funding rate and the increased positioning by futures traders suggest that market participants are expecting continued price appreciation.

Another US University Announced That It Will Accept Bitcoin! - Bitcoin Sistemi

As Bitcoin adoption continues to skyrocket, it has begun to find its way into institutional funds. At this point, the University of Austin (UATX), a new private institution located in the US state of Texas, aims to revolutionize the education sector by accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment.
According to Bloomberg, Austin University will accept the donations it will collect in Bitcoin and will create a $ 5 million Bitcoin fund with these donations and has partnered with Unchained, a cryptocurrency platform, for this.


The Bitcoin fund created by the University of Austin, which is expected to enroll its first group of students this fall, will hold BTCs for the long term.
Thomas Hogan, an associate professor at the University of Austin, said in his statement:






“By incorporating Bitcoin into its endowment, the University of Austin is setting a precedent for other academic institutions to explore alternative and potentially more resilient financial models.
“Bitcoin provides a unique opportunity to further UATX's commitment to developing the next generation of leaders and innovators.”

A spokesperson for the University of Austin said it will keep Bitcoin in the fund for at least five years. He noted that among the reasons why the university chose BTC was that many of its supporters asked whether it would accept donations in cryptocurrency.
Unchained CEO and co-founder Joseph Kelly said in his statement: “I'm passionate about what UATX is building in Austin. By choosing Unchained as a partner, the university understands what Bitcoin is: That's why I will continue to champion Bitcoin as 'a technology for freedom.'” said.


The university plans to enroll 100 students this fall and will provide free education for the first group.

Solana beats Ethereum: Time to ditch ETH for SOL? - AMBCrypto



Solana and Ethereum saw varying volumes of daily active addresses.
The ETH TVL has remained ahead of SOL’s by considerable volume.

According to a recent report, Solana [SOL] had more activity than Ethereum [ETH] in the past 24 hours. Additionally, this increase in activity led to Solana experiencing higher trading volume than Ethereum.
Data showed that Solana had a busy 24 hours, with impressive numbers in some key metrics. Solana had more active addresses than Ethereum and Bitcoin combined, the two largest networks. 
A deeper analysis of both platforms revealed a significant divergence in their active addresses over the past few days.
Comparing Solana and Ethereum 
An analysis of Solana’s active addresses on its scanner revealed an interesting trend. The chart showed that in the past few weeks, the network’s lowest number of active addresses remained above 800,000.
The chart indicated that the number of active addresses had surpassed 1 million at the time of this writing. This suggests that the network has been experiencing increased activity recently.

However, the analysis of Ethereum’s active addresses showed a decline over the past few weeks. The chart revealed that the number of active addresses remained below 500,000 throughout the previous month. 
It gradually decreased to the 400,000 range and has not risen above this level in recent days. According to data from Santiment, the number of active addresses was approximately 141,000 at the time of this writing.

Top 5 Trending Meme Coins to Watch This Month


																The meme coin sector keeps making waves thanks to numerous tokens of that type charting double-digit price spikes quite frequently.
The cohort’s market capitalization currently stands at almost $65 billion, and in the following lines, we will touch upon five assets that may be among the best performers this month.

TRUMP
This meme coin related to America’s former president – Donald Trump – might experience severe volatility in June since it is heavily affected by some news surrounding the billionaire. 
MAGA (TRUMP) soared substantially in mid-May following reports that Trump (who will challenge the current political leader, Joe Biden, in the upcoming presidential elections) leads in five out of six swing states, such as Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Georgia, and Nevada.




The token witnessed severe ups and downs toward the end of the month when the American was found guilty in a hush-money trial involving the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels.
In the following days, it overcame the turbulence, hitting a new all-time high of over $17 on June 1. Shortly after, though, it headed south and is currently trading at around $13.20 (per CoinGecko’s data).

TRUMP Price, Source: CoinGecko
Trump and Biden agreed to participate in a debate on June 27, while the former president’s sentencing on the trial above is set for next month. Both factors can contribute to enhanced volatility for TRUMP’s price.
BODEN
This meme coin related to America’s current president, Joe Biden, saw the light of day in March and rallied to an ATH of almost $1 a month later. Since then, though, BODEN has been on a downfall, briefly spiking on several occasions. 
For reasons similar to the above, BODEN is likely to be subject to increased speculation and, therefore, volatility. It’s worth keeping a closer eye on meme coins of this kind because they tend to go through tremendous price changes during periods of this type.
Currently, the asset is worth around $0.25, but its price may fluctuate significantly this month following the upcoming debate and other news surrounding Biden.

BRETT
The frog-themed Brett (BRETT) has been one of the best performers in the meme coin realm lately, with its valuation skyrocketing by 180% on a monthly scale. 
The asset made the headlines today (June 4), defying the market trends with a 30% price rally. Its market capitalization crossed the $1 billion mark, making BRETT the seventh-biggest token in its cohort.

BRETT Price, Source: CoinGecko
It will be interesting to see whether the bull run can continue this month and whether the meme coin can flip leaders like Bonk Inu (BONK) and Floki Inu (FLOKI).
POPCAT
Cat-themed meme coins have also risen in popularity, with POPCAT being one of the largest of that type. It entered the market in December last year but started progressing in March 2024. 
POPCAT’s peak occurred at the beginning of May when its price reached almost $0.65 whereas the market cap pumped above $600 million.
It currently trades at approximately $0.45. Endorsements from popular figures, marketing trends, rising adoption, and more can trigger a new resurgence. As such, it will be interesting to see what June has to offer.
SHIB
Last but not least, we will touch upon the second-biggest meme coin – Shiba Inu (SHIB). Despite its unsatisfactory price performance in the past month, it remains one of the hottest topics in the crypto industry due to the substantial number of investors. 
SHIB’s potential rally in the short term may be propelled by several elements, including its burning mechanism and the advancement of the layer-2 blockchain solution – Shibarium.
The burn rate went through the roof today (June 4), exploding by over 10,000% and resulting in 21.4 million tokens sent to a null address.
For its part, Shibarium has achieved countless milestones since its launch in August last year. As CryptoPotato reported, the total number of blocks processed on the network exceeded 5 million, while total transactions are inching toward 420 million.
Shibarium is designed to foster the advancement of the Shiba Inu ecosystem by improving speed, lowering transaction fees, encouraging community participation, and enhancing scalability. Those curious to learn more about the L2 blockchain solution, please check our dedicated video below:

Iggy Azalea's MOTHER Meme Coin Makes Dramatic Comeback After Launch Controversy - Benzinga

Popular rapper Iggy Azalea‘s foray into cryptocurrency with the MOTHER MOTHER/USD token has been a rollercoaster ride.What Happened: Launched just a few days ago on the Solana SOL/USD blockchain, the meme coin quickly grabbed attention but also faced accusations of insider trading.Reports surfaced that over 20% of the total MOTHER supply was bought by insiders, leading to concerns that early investors were being taken advantage of. Azalea herself was caught in the crossfire, with some claiming she sold a significant amount of tokens soon after launch.However, Azalea swiftly moved to address the controversy. She emphasized her commitment to the project’s success and the well-being of those who invested in MOTHER.

Dogecoin's DOGE/USD recent price rally has prompted significant buying activity from Dogecoin whales and bullish trader predictions for the apex meme coin.What Happened: Crypto technical analyst Ali Martinez noted in his latest tweet that Dogecoin whales purchased an additional 200 million DOGE since May 30. The post attracted several reactions from the crypto community with many expressing that the whale movement has not led to any price increase. To this, Ali responded, "The ones who wait are always rewarded."When asked about the optimal entry point for the Dogecoin trade, Ali stated it was yesterday (June 3). Crypto news provider DeFi Planet tweeted:Crypto trader Kevin shared insights on an imminent breakout for Dogecoin. He highlighted the two-month Bollinger Bands Breakout indicator, suggesting a major movement is on the horizon. He added that this indicator is signaling a breakout for the first time since November 2020 and noted the approaching 2-month LMACD bullish cross, another indicator pointing to significant price action.In response to his tweet reactions, Kevin noted that "people are over-trading and over-emotional."

Traders often use technical indicators like the Bollinger Bands and LMACD to predict price movements.The last time these indicators aligned, Dogecoin experienced a substantial increase in value, making this prediction particularly intriguing for traders and investors.IntoTheBlock data noted a 35.4% increase in Dogecoin’s large transaction volume, while daily active addresses increased by 1.3%. Transactions greater than more than doubled from 141 transactions on June 2 to 297 transactions on June 3 .

Joe Biden's veto of cryptocurrency bill angers crypto industry

President Joe Biden  vetoed a resolution late Friday that passed through both the House and Senate and was widely supported by the cryptocurrency industry. And it’s just the latest move from a president who’s put himself firmly in the crosshairs of powerful crypto forces who are dumping millions of dollars into ousting Biden in the upcoming 2024 presidential election.Google leak shows it might be lying about its Search algorithmThe resolution would have repealed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which sought to force financial institutions that are holding crypto to keep the digital assets on their own balance sheets, as Coindesk recently explained. Biden called the effort to repeal the SEC decision a “Republican-led  resolution,” though there were also Democrats who voted in favor. The president went on to say that the resolution would “inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to set  forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues” and risked undercutting  the SEC’s broader authority around various accounting practices.  “My Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the  well-being of consumers and investors,” Biden said in an announcement posted online by the White House.  “Appropriate guardrails that  protect consumers and investors are necessary to harness the potential  benefits and opportunities of crypto-asset innovation. The veto angered plenty of crypto boosters online, including BowTieBill, a crypto newsletter.“Biden Veto tells you everything you need to know about your friends ‘in crypto,’” the account wrote.  “If they vote for Biden they have no money invested and are lying about how much they have in the space.   Vote Trump or Risk More political clown-politics.”That sentiment was shared by plenty of other accounts on X, which all seemed to paint Democrats as an existential threat to the survival of cryptocurrencies.“President Biden position on crypto will cost him more than he realizes,” another prominent bitcoin booster, Jason Williams, wrote on Friday. “It was a really bad decision to veto that bill.   Especially at this critical time.  Especially with Trump going all out crypto.    Gg.”The Block reported as recently as last week that Biden’s administration was doing outreach in the crypto industry in what was characterized as a “tone shift,” around crypto. But the bitcoin bros aren’t just focused on the presidential race in the upcoming elections. Crypto super PACs are also planning to dump millions into U.S. Senate races in at least two states, Ohio and Michigan, according to recent reporting from the New York Times. The super PAC Fairshake already reportedly spent $10 million in the California primary earlier this year to ensure progressive Democrat Katie Porter lost over her skepticism around crypto issues. The California primary only allows two candidates in the final election, regardless of party, and Porter lost out in the second spot to a largely unknown Republican after attack ads were aimed squarely against her. Democrat Adam Schiff, who’s been friendly to crypto, won the top spot in the primary.Two other crypto super PACs, Protect Progress and Defend American Jobs, have also spent money on congressional races during this cycle. Protect Progress spent about $1.7 million to promote Democratic candidate Shomari Figures in one of Alabama’s seats for the U.S. House, according to the New York Times.Donald Trump, the convicted felon and presumed Republican candidate for president this November, has come out in favor of cryptocurrencies, despite expressing skepticism about the fake money years ago. Trump and Biden are neck-and-neck in the national polls, with a national average maintained by FiveThirtyEight showing Trump at 40.9% and Biden at 39.8%. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is polling at 9.7% in the national average.Biden stressed in his veto announcement that he was in favor of sensible regulation by the SEC, a clear signal that he’s not trying to make enemies of the crypto industry, no matter how it looks to crypto power players.“My  Administration is eager to work with the Congress to ensure a  comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets,  building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible  development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce  United States leadership in the global financial system,” the Biden administration wrote.A version of this article originally appeared on Gizmodo.

Exclusive: XRP Failed To Keep Pace With Bitcoin, Ethereum In The 2024 Bull Market - Experts Explain Why - Benzinga

The cryptocurrency market recovered strongly in 2024, following a protracted bear market that halted capital investments in the sector. Spurred by soaring institutional interest in spot ETFs, bellwethers like Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD have both surged more than 60% year-to-date, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Additionally, the total cryptocurrency market cap has grown by 55% since the year began,However, amid the upsurge, XRP XRP/USD, one of the most popular and largest cryptocurrencies, has fallen significantly behind. The coin associated with Ripple Labs and the XRP Ledger has tumbled 16% year-to-date, making it one of the few large-cap cryptocurrencies to experience negative price action this year. Benzinga talked to experts to understand the factors dragging down the payment-focused cryptocurrency in what seems to be a bull market.The Legal Tangle:Gracy Chen, CEO of crypto exchange Bitget, cited the ongoing legal tussle with the SEC as a significant factor preventing XRP's ascension. She said legal challenges and regulatory uncertainties surrounding XRP may have created a level of caution among investors."XRP has faced criticism and skepticism within the cryptocurrency community due to its centralized nature, pre-mined supply, and association with Ripple Labs. This negative perception may have dampened the demand for XRP and limited its price appreciation compared to other more decentralized and community-driven cryptocurrencies," Chen added.Recall that Ripple secured a partial win last year after the Judge ruled that XRP is a security when sold to institutional investors but not the general public. Ripple's Token SaleAnother factor highlighted by Chen was the selling pressure the coin routinely faces due to the actions of Ripple Labs. "Ripple periodically sells XRP tokens to fund its operations and invest in new projects. This consistent selling pressure from Ripple’s token holdings could be putting downward pressure on XRP’s price, limiting its ability to rally significantly," Chen stated. Note that Ripple is the largest XRP holder. A recent report suggested that Ripple could execute its largest token dump of 400 million XRP, worth $207 million, in June. The Approval Of Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFsInterestingly, Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of blockchain platform Komodo, noted the recent approval of spot Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs as a reason for XRP’s declining relevance.He stated, "Ether ETF approval brought a lot of legitimacy to ETH. Previously, XRP was labeled as a cryptocurrency for institutions. Now, it appears that Bitcoin and Ethereum are gaining significantly more momentum in that large sector of the market."Benzinga reached out to Ripple Labs to respond on the arguments made above. What Are The Chances Of An XRP Bull Run?Gracy Chen said that the prospects of XRP's upside look uncertain. Its inability to break through key price levels and sustain the uptrend has kept investors cautious.Kadan Stadelmann believed that the biggest bullish catalyst for the market would be if the SEC makes a 180-degree pivot."If the SEC decides to approve XRP ETFs, that would revitalize the project's hopes of institutional adoption. Due to the ongoing court case, this scenario probably won't happen until at least 2025," he argued. At the time of writing, XRP was exchanging hands at $0.5196, down 0.13% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Photo Courtesy: Michaela Jilkova On Shutterstock.comThese insights set the stage for deeper discussions at the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: EXCLUSIVE: Will Trump’s Possible Return To Power Make Bitcoin, Ethereum Go Boom Or Bust?

New $67 Million Cryptocurrency Case from the US Department of Justice: One Person Arrested! - Bitcoin Sistemi

A new one has been added to the cryptocurrency cases in the USA.
At this point, the US Department of Justice alleged that Bill Guan, CFO of the New York-based media publication Epoch Times, committed $67 million in money laundering using cryptocurrencies.


The DOJ alleged in the lawsuit that Guan led a team called “Make Money Online (MMO)” that was accused of purchasing proceeds of crime with cryptocurrencies to benefit the media company.
Allegedly, the funds were then transferred to bank accounts associated with Epoch Times by MMO members and other participants who opened various accounts using the stolen personal information.





These operations continued from 2020 until April 2024.
Damian Williams, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, stated in his statement that Bill Guan was arrested and said:



“Allegedly, Bill Guan, Chief Financial Officer of a global newspaper and media company, conspired with others to benefit himself, his media company, and its affiliates by laundering tens of millions of dollars in fraudulently obtained unemployment insurance benefits and other criminal proceeds,
“Today's charges reflect the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General's ongoing commitment to vigorously enforce the law against those who facilitate fraud through money laundering and to protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system.”

Regarding Guan's actions, Williams said: “Under Guan's direction, Team MMO members and others were involved in extorting tens of millions of dollars of criminal proceeds, including proceeds from fraudulently obtained unemployment insurance benefits, loaded onto tens of thousands of prepaid debit cards.” The proceeds of the crime were often purchased for cryptocurrency by scheme participants, including MMO Team members and others working with them, using a specific cryptocurrency platform, at discounted rates of approximately 70 to 80 cents on the dollar. ” said.

The growth of NOT coin was exceptional, but apart from it, the TON coin is also gaining some serious traction on the market, with 8% growth in the last 24 hours, which makes it one of the strongest contenders on the market. But why is everyone so interested in TON?With its strong performance, TON is comparatively independent and does not depend on the trends of the global market. For investors seeking resilience and stability in the erratic cryptocurrency market, this is an important consideration. TON/USDT Chart by TradingViewWith its consistent upward trajectory, TON has demonstrated its resilience and potential for long-term growth in contrast to many other coins that experience wild fluctuations based on general market trends. The integration of TON with Telegram, one of the biggest messaging apps in the world that has been gaining traction steadily, is another important factor in TON's appeal.The large user base of Telegram offers TON a ready market increasing its usefulness and uptake. Since TON is designed for such a popular platform, it has an inherent advantage in terms of adoption and usage, which is fueling interest in it on the market. A key sign of a network's inherent growth is the presence of an active development community, which TON is witnessing.In addition to representing constant innovation and improvement, a thriving development community also demonstrates confidence in and dedication to the project. To sustain and grow user engagement and confidence in the coin's future, this continuous development work is essential. Week-opening interest in TON is also significantly higher following additional price increases and increased trader activity. Its recent performance and the aforementioned factors most likely pushed positions of TON higher than many investors anticipated.

Bitcoin holders return to buying coins on the market

The long-term Bitcoin holders, especially those with unspent transaction output (UTXO) portions older than 1 and 2 years, have returned to buying supply on the market, highlighting the development of a re-accumulation phase before another bull rally of the crypto. 
It is worth noting how a similar condition had not been seen since December 2023, just before Bitcoin took off and went to attack its historical highs.
In the meantime, the ETFs of Wall Street continue to buy coins, contributing to the reduction of possible selling pressure, with the inflows marking the 15th consecutive day of positive outcome yesterday.
The bull are coming back more charged than ever.
Let’s see everything in detail below.
The long-term holders of Bitcoin are buying again: accumulation in progress
After Bitcoin marked a new all-time high at $73,777 on March 14, we witnessed a phase of correction and price consolidation that lasted approximately 45 days, driven by long-term holders who sold significant amounts of coins.
Now, however, it seems that the retracement is over and that the so-called “long term holders” (LTH) are back to buying, highlighting the beginning of a re-accumulation period, with on-chain conditions that have not been observed since December 2023.
In particular, we can see in the following chart provided by Crypto Quant, how the balance of all long-term holders has started to grow again in the month of May, justifying the rebound in Bitcoin prices from 56,500 dollars to above 71,000 dollars.
Generally, these entities with more years of coins behind them liquidate significant portions of BTC during bullish phases, only to reemerge at the peak of bearish phases with new purchases: this model has worked very well for the bull markets of 2017 and 2021. This trend reflects the long-term bullish sentiment among asset holders, motivated to accumulate as much as possible during market dips.

Going into more detail and zooming in, we can notice how the holders who hold portions of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) between 1 and 2 years are reversing the trend that characterized the months of March and April, returning to purchase supply in the last few weeks.
This type of condition is more visible in holders of 1.5-2 years, with the beginning of the month of May marking the right moment to come back to the forefront after a phase of boring distribution.
In particular, in just one month they have repurchased about 350,000 coins sold in the previous three months.
Source: https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/network-indicator/utxo-age-bands
Another fundamental parameter to consider in order to perform a momentum analysis is the amount of reserve coins held by centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitget, Okx, Bybit, etc.
As shown in the Coinglass chart, since February these kinds of reserves have decreased drastically, eliminating potential selling pressure and contributing to the rally that pushed Bitcoin above new all-time highs in mid-March.
The trend of declining reserves has intensified in recent days with investors who seem determined to push the cryptocurrency above new price levels, reducing the supply further, approaching a situation of “supply shock”.
Source: https://www.coinglass.com/Balance
To all this, the emergence of new accumulation addresses is added, which are buying Bitcoin (and also Ethereum) in anticipation of the next general price increase.
Let’s see in this regard how, despite the recent stable prices and modest growth for both assets, compared to previous months, there are significant increases in new accumulation addresses, supporting the thesis that we are in a pre-pump phase.
At this rate, the 100,000 dollars are no longer a mirage and could be reached by the end of 2024.
Source: https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/6659bf8d2295b967a3400a29-Growth-Surge-in-Bitcoin-and-Ethereum-Accumulation-Addresses-What-It-Means-for-th?amp;utm_medium=sns&amp;utm_campaign=quicktake&amp;utm_content=crazzyblockk
The Bitcoin spot ETFs continue to remove supply from the market thanks to positive inflows.
In addition to the data related to the behaviors of long-term holders and the data of exchange reserves, in order to provide a complete on-chain overview, we examine the latest results regarding the inflows of spot Bitcoin ETFs.
We carefully notice how the accumulation by the holders who supported the price rise of the currency in the month of May, was accompanied by inflows that were clearly positive for ETFs on Wall Street in the last two weeks, with data that exceeded 136 million dollars per day on average.
The net inflows have exceeded the production of new coins by the network’s miners by about 4 times, highlighting a deflationary situation where more coins are “burned” than are produced.
Note how the ETFs have recorded positive inflows for 15 consecutive days starting from May 13, when Bitcoin had just begun to recover from the dips at $61,400.
Very important in this regard is what happened last Friday, when despite the heavy outflow of GBTC with 124 million dollars sold, additional shares were purchased on the other side, bringing the net inflow to a positive state at 48.8 million dollars by the end of the day.
Now it seems as if the micro-capitulation phase that characterized the second half of March and the entire month of April has now faded to make way for an accumulation phase.
In total now the Bitcoin USA ETFs hold a Total Net Asset of 59.42 billion dollars.
Source: https://sosovalue.xyz/assets/etf/us-btc-spot
It is worth noting that on May 29, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (iBIT) ETF by BlackRock surpassed the Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) by Grayscale in terms of Bitcoin holdings, with iBIT reaching 288,670 BTC held (AUM $19.6 billion), compared to GBTC’s 287,450 (AUM $19.26 billion)
iBIT has also recorded an average daily trading volume of 303.4 million dollars in the last month, surpassing the 291 million dollars of GBTC. This increase in trading volume reflects the growth of investors’ confidence in BlackRock’s ETF product
This type of competition between the top two regulated investment products in America on Bitcoin offers an advantage within the market with narrower bid-ask spread quotes, greater liquidity and higher trading volumes, reducing transaction costs and making trades more immediate, secure, and efficient than they have ever been.
The third ETF by AUM is that of Fidelity with 164,158 BTC on the balance sheet.
Source: https://timechainindex.com/
Now it will be interesting to observe the data of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in Australia, whose trading was opened for the first time today.
The worldwide public acceptance of Bitcoin as a financially recognized asset, with the expansion of new ETFs and new trading venues, will certainly lead to a phase of new adoption among institutional investors, with the price of the crypto likely to see new highs in the coming months.

$500K Bitcoin forecast: Analyst maps out BTC's bull run timeline - AMBCrypto



PlanB uses the Stock-to-Flow model to predict Bitcoin’s surge to $500,000.
Recent Bitcoin consolidation near $70,000 sets the stage for a bullish trend, according to PlanB’s analysis.

Bitcoin [BTC]  continues to hold the spotlight, especially following the recent market consolidations. 
Despite its current trade slightly below the $70,000 mark, with minimal fluctuations in the past week, renowned crypto analyst PlanB has shared insights that might herald a significant uptick for the cryptocurrency.
PlanB, a seasoned analyst known for his precise predictions, outlined a potential surge in Bitcoin’s price post the latest halving event. 
In a detailed analysis, he utilized his proprietary Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model (S2F), alongside other chart indicators, to draw parallels with previous bull cycles, suggesting a burgeoning bull run is on the horizon.
Understanding the S2F model and market cycles
The Stock-to-Flow model, which measures the current stock of a commodity against its flow of production, indicates that Bitcoin is gearing up for an exponential rise. 
According to PlanB’s latest analysis, the close of last month above $67,000 signals the dawn of a new cycle, potentially mirroring the post-halving surges seen in previous years. 
The analyst’s projections put Bitcoin at a staggering $500,000 in the upcoming cycle, emphasizing the pattern followed in past bull runs. 
This prediction is supported by PlanB’s examination of the Bitcoin Market Cycle indicator, which corroborates the entrance into a bull market phase. 
However, the analyst advises patience, suggesting that the real momentum will commence once a rapid price ascent begins. 
This was further affirmed by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings, which currently resemble those seen before the 2012 bull run, indicating early stages of a bullish trend.
Adding to the bullish outlook, PlanB discussed the Bitcoin 200 Week Moving Average (WMA), which is trending upwards—a sign traditionally viewed as a precursor to a bull market.
 The 200 WMA’s alignment with current market signals suggests that Bitcoin could soon breach the $100,000 mark.
Moreover, the Bitcoin Realized Price indicator, which assesses the profit ratio of coins moved on-chain, aligns with historical data to further support the bullish scenario. 
PlanB expects that Bitcoin’s price will not fall below $64,000 before it embarks on the anticipated rally.
Tracing PlanB’s Bitcoin predictions 
PlanB is not new to making bold forecasts in the cryptocurrency space. 
With a history of accurate predictions, the analyst gained recognition for his foresight in 2020 when, despite widespread skepticism and a market flooded with fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), he predicted Bitcoin would reach $55,000. 
True to his projection, by 2021, Bitcoin not only hit that mark but soared past it.
However, financial markets are inherently uncertain, and not all of PlanB’s predictions have materialized as expected. For instance, he has long maintained that Bitcoin would reach the $100k milestone. 
Although he forecasted this achievement for 2021, Bitcoin fell short of this target. Despite not reaching the anticipated $100k, Bitcoin still achieved a significant milestone by surpassing $69,000 for the first time that year.
As PlanB revisits his $100,000 Bitcoin forecast, it’s crucial to examine the underlying fundamentals. Market data from Santiment shows a declining trend in Bitcoin’s 7-day active addresses, suggesting a possible decrease in market participation or trading activity. 
 
Source: Santiment
Concurrently, the Gini index of BTC stands at 0.985, indicating a high concentration of wealth among holders, which could impact price volatility and trading behavior.
On a more positive note, Bitcoin’s open interest—a measure of the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled—has shown significant growth. 
Over the past 24 hours alone, this metric increased by 1.36%, with the total valuation rising to $35.83 billion.
Source: Coinglass

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

This increase, along with a nearly 25% surge in open interest value during the same period, points to a bullish sentiment among traders.
Supporting this optimistic outlook, AMBCrypto reported that Bitcoin has formed an asymmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, a formation that typically precedes a significant price movement, potentially propelling BTC to as high as $74,400.

From Dusty Wallets to Digital Gold, 11-Year-Old Bitcoin N...


                                Dormant Bitcoin Whale Awakens, Moving $13.87M Worth of Vintage Coins                                A particularly interesting event that has recently attracted much attention among the users of cryptocurrencies. A BTC whale that has not been active for more than 10 years has recently come back to life. On 3rd June 2024, an entity with eight wallets that registered in 2013 transferred 200 BTC which is equivalent to approximately $13.87 Million, revealing a new Bitcoin whale from the early days of the digital currency.What's the Story?Blockchain analysis data reveals that the 200 BTC were purchased in a period of mid-February and late March 2013 when the price of Bitcoin was between $25 to $35 per coin. This means that the initial investment of these coins was worth about $7,000 at the highest BTC prices during that period.Looking at the returns of these coins today, investors are richer by 197,785% of their money against the US dollar, a testimony to the growth potential of Bitcoin in the last decade. The transactions included eight traditional P2PKH old-style accounts and 2 P2SH accounts where the first one received more than 25 BTC or $1.7 Million at current exchange rates.Further analysis of the blockchain data revealed that this same entity is likely responsible for eight distinct 2013 transactions that occurred on March 13, 2024, as those transactions were also present in the forwarding wallet. Additionally, the entity followed a similar pattern of acquiring and transferring around 200 BTC on multiple occasions in January, February, and March of 2024.Unveiling a Vintage Bitcoin Whale Based on the repeated spending patterns and heuristics, it has become evident that the entity behind these transactions possesses a much larger stash of vintage coins from the early days of Bitcoin. From the activity in just two wallets, it is estimated that the entity had or still controls 1,000 BTC worth a staggering $69.2 million, most of which originated from BTC collected in 2013.This revelation places the entity in the exclusive category of Bitcoin whales, defined as individuals or entities holding 1,000 BTC or more. The brief on-chain analysis has unveiled a significant holder of vintage coins find that is both intriguing and rare in the cryptocurrency world.ConclusionThe Interesting Facts and Findings by CoinGabbar reveal that the activity of this dormant Bitcoin whale after such a long time has prompted the members of the crypto community to pay attention to the situation. It is an ode to those who believed in Bitcoin in its infancy and did not sell their Bitcoins when the price was low, instead, they held on for the ride of their lives.Due to the unknown identity of this whale, the cryptosphere continues to watch with bated breath for more activity and a possible explanation of the intent of these holders of the old coins. This event also reveals that bitcoin is not just a fad that fades away but also the possibility of getting huge profits for those who decided to invest in the digital currency at its early stages.Also Read: Pi Network Excitement Grows Amid Mainnet Launch and Rumors

It is up 40% month-over-month.Also Read: Floki Up 11% And ‘The Most Interesting Meme Coin,’ Says Millionaire Trader Who Holds Only 1 Out Of Dogecoin And Shiba InuWhy It Matters: Crypto analyst Jelle reacted to the DWF Labs investment by stating that the investment is leading to buying pressure on Floki "as it consolidates below all-time highs."Crypto trader Javon Marks noted that the meme coin recently saw a significant rise, climbing back above $0.000306, marking an 81% increase. He further suggested that Floki could be on the verge of breaking a crucial resistance level at $0.0002761498.Marks emphasized that if Floki Inu manages to break and hold above this key level, it could potentially see another substantial rise, with prices possibly climbing nearly 100% to reach $0.00054673.What’s Next: The influence of meme coins and Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Floki Soars As Holders Buoyed By Proposal to Remove 15.24B Tokens Out Of Circulation: The Burn Is RealImage: Shutterstock

Iggy Azalea’s meme cryptocurrency, MOTHER, continues to take the crypto world by storm, jumping 30% in value to hit $0.1 per token today. This epic surge has pushed MOTHER’s market capitalization to a whopping $100 million, just a week after it launched on the Solana blockchain.As a reminder, the launch of MOTHER faced some rough waters from the start. Soon after the launch, reports surfaced that insiders had purchased over 20% of the total supply, leading to the sale of more than $2 million worth of coins right from the start of trading. This stirred up accusations of insider trading and raised concerns that the artist might have unloaded a significant portion of the tokens on its followers. In the face of these allegations, Azalea took action. She allegedly hired a development team, set up a token burning system to reduce supply and spent a lot of time interacting directly with the crypto community to address their concerns and build trust.Source: DEX ScreenerThese efforts seem to have paid off, as investor confidence in MOTHER has surged along with its price. The token’s rapid rise indicates growing interest and positive attention among crypto enthusiasts, despite initial skepticism and controversy.But MOTHER’s story is also a reminder: be careful with new cryptocurrencies, especially those launched by celebrities. It is essential to do your homework and be cautious, as many of these tokens can be a short-lived scam.

Why Bitcoin Is Stuck In A Range And What Could Change That: 10x Research - Benzinga

Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD recent price stagnation has some investors questioning whether a breakout is imminent.A new report by 10x Research delves into on-chain data, exploring both bullish and bearish signals that could determine Bitcoin’s next move.“While Bitcoin sits tantalizingly close to all-time highs,” says Markus Thielen, author of the report, “key indicators reveal a complex interplay between investor sentiment and macro factors.”Whales Accumulate, Miners Sell: A Tale of Two TrendsThe report highlights a fascinating trend: Mega whales (holders with over 10,000 BTC) are accumulating Bitcoin at an unprecedented rate, adding a staggering 164,000 BTC in May alone. This bullish signal is further bolstered by the movement of large amounts of Bitcoin off exchanges, potentially indicating anticipation of higher prices.However, the report also identifies a countervailing force. Bitcoin miners, facing reduced block rewards after the April halving event, are increasingly selling their holdings to cover operational costs.Also Read: Bitcoin Spot ETFs On 15-Day Inflow Streak As Wisconsin Starts Buying BitcoinStablecoins: A Double-Edged SwordThe report sheds light on the role of stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar. While the issuance of nearly $140 billion in stablecoins signifies significant investor interest, the recent decrease in holdings by large investors raises questions.“Whales’ stablecoin holdings peaked in late April,” writes Thielen, “potentially signaling a shift towards converting these assets into Bitcoin or fiat currency.”Fed Policy And Inflation: The Looming Wildcards10x Research underscores the importance of macroeconomic factors in driving Bitcoin's price. The upcoming meetings and data releases, particularly the June 12 U.S. inflation print, are seen as pivotal. “The market either needs rate cuts by the Fed or a lower inflation print for Bitcoin to rally,” they stated, emphasizing the potential catalysts for breaking Bitcoin out of its current range between $60,000 and $73,000.With so many variables at play, navigating the current crypto market climate can be challenging.

According to Analysis Firm CryptoQuant Data, Bitcoin Owners Continue to Hodl! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


On-chain data from analytics firm CryptoQuant showed that more than 50% of Bitcoin supply is inactive.
BTC Holders Continue to Hold Their Bitcoins
This means that the Bitcoins in question have not been moved or exchanged in the tracked wallets, which is a sign of strong long-term belief among holders.


This data supports the idea that Bitcoin may see further price gains due to unwavering belief in its future value.
Mt. Gox hack and the DMM hack last week, sentiment around Bitcoin remains bullish.






Singapore-based QCP Capital noted that there was an increase in trading activities and an optimistic outlook was maintained. “Despite the negative headlines, the market remains stubbornly higher,” QCP Capital said in a message late Monday.
Among larger tokens with market caps exceeding $1 billion, dog-themed floki (FLOKI) and synthetic dollar project Ethena's ENA tokens both gained more than 10%.


While the market awaits further developments, particularly the potential approval of additional cryptocurrency ETFs, overall sentiment remains bullish, pointing to the potential for continued growth in Bitcoin and other major digital assets.

Astar surges amid proposal to burn 350M ASTR tokens - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Astar Network (ASTR) price jumped nearly 5% after the Astar Foundation published a proposal to burn 350 million ASTR tokens.
ASTR price reached higs of $0.09.

 Astar Network (ASTR) price flipped positive and surged nearly 5% on Tuesday following a new proposal seeking to burn millions of the tokens.
While ASTR continues to struggle with the bearish pressure seen since price hit highs near $0.17 in March, its gains over the last 24 hours have pushed it above $0.09 and could open up a bullish run to $0.1.
Astar Foundation proposes 350 million ASTR token burn
ASTR’s sudden price surge followed a new announcement from the Astar Foundation. On Tuesday, the Astar Network team outlined a proposal that seeks to burn 350 million ASTR tokens.
As often happens across the market, prices reacted higher amid reaction to the proposal. If adopted in coming weeks, the proposal will see Astar remove tokens worth $31 million from circulation.
The burn would account for 5% of the genesis allocation, the foundation noted in its proposal. Astar Network founder Sota Watanabe shared this news on X.
In particular, the tokens to be burned are from the project’s parachain auction reserve. The platform set these tokens aside during Astar Network’s genesis deployment.
When is the Astar Network community vote?
Astar is looking to take this action ahead of the Polkadot’s ‘Agile Coretime’ upgrade, which is set to phase out DOT’s crowdloan mechanism.
According to the proposal, burning these reserve tokens may boost ASTR holders through a reduction in total staked supply. It would mean increased rewards for stakers. Also likely to come out of this is the potential for decreased supply to impact ASTR’s future price.
Astar Foundation says the proposal will go through a three-week community discussion phase before it goes to a vote.
“If there is a consensus, the foundation will proceed to burn the reserve. If not, alternative solutions will be considered for further discussion and voting,” the team wrote.

Core Scientific inks $3.5B AI deal with CoreWeave to diversify beyond bitcoin mining

Core Scientific has entered into a significant 12-year agreement with CoreWeave, an AI hyperscaler backed by Nvidia, to provide approximately 200 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure for high-performance computing (HPC) services. This strategic move is expected to generate over $3.5 billion in total cumulative revenue for Core Scientific during the initial contract term, with an estimated average annual revenue of around $290 million.The agreement marks a pivotal shift for Core Scientific, traditionally known for its bitcoin mining operations, as it diversifies into the rapidly growing AI data center space. Core Scientific will modify multiple existing sites to host CoreWeave’s NVIDIA GPUs, with site modifications commencing in the second half of 2024 and operations expected to begin in the first half of 2025. CoreWeave will fund all capital investments required for these modifications, estimated at $300 million, which will be credited against hosting payments until fully repaid.Adam Sullivan, CEO of Core Scientific, emphasized the strategic benefits of this partnership, noting that the demand for high-power sites continues to outpace supply. He highlighted that Core Scientific’s ability to deliver power more quickly than greenfield data center projects positions the company to meet customer needs effectively. The partnership with CoreWeave allows Core Scientific to balance its portfolio between Bitcoin mining and alternative compute hosting, thereby maximizing cash flow and minimizing risk while maintaining significant exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside.The agreement also includes options for CoreWeave to expand its hosting footprint with Core Scientific at additional sites over the next 60 to 90 days. This expansion is part of Core Scientific’s broader strategy to capitalize on its extensive high-power digital infrastructure portfolio, which includes 1.2 gigawatts of contracted power, with nearly 500 MW allocated for HPC workloads.This deal builds on a history of successful collaboration between Core Scientific and CoreWeave, dating back to 2019. Earlier this year, Core Scientific delivered 16 MW of HPC hosting capacity to CoreWeave ahead of schedule at its new Austin data center. The partnership is expected to enhance Core Scientific’s earnings power and drive shareholder value by increasing exposure to contracted, dollar-denominated revenue streams.The announcement comes nearly five months after Core Scientific received court approval to exit bankruptcy, a move necessitated by financial challenges stemming from the decline in crypto prices and rising energy costs. Under Sullivan’s leadership, the company has restructured its debt and pivoted towards more sustainable business avenues, including this strategic shift into AI and HPC hosting.Per Core Scientific, this diversification aligns with broader industry trends, as other crypto miners like Bit Digital, Iris Energy, and Hut 8 also explore AI infrastructure to boost profitability. The increasing demand for AI operations, driven by advancements such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, emphasizes the potential for higher returns compared to traditional Bitcoin mining alone.As Core Scientific continues to expand its HPC hosting capabilities, it aims to deliver significant, resilient, and sustainable value for its shareholders, leveraging its extensive infrastructure and strategic partnerships to navigate the evolving digital landscape.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Mayweather Faces KO Punch From Crypto Watchdog Over Alleged Scam Token


								Floyd Mayweather, the undefeated boxing champion, seems to be facing a different kind of knockout in the cryptocurrency arena. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT has landed a flurry of accusations, calling Mayweather out for promoting yet another suspicious token project.

Pump And Dump Suspicions
This comes after a string of controversies. Mayweather has been entangled in lawsuits and settlements for failing to disclose payments to promote unregistered cryptocurrency ventures.
These promotions, according to critics, reek of “pump and dump” schemes, where celebrities artificially inflate prices before cashing out, leaving fans holding worthless digital bags.
Mayweather’s latest offense? The “FLOYD” token. After hyping it on social media, Mayweather abruptly deleted his promotional posts, sparking fears of another potential rug pull – a scenario where developers vanish with investor funds, leaving their tokens valueless.


Controversy Shadows Mayweather
This isn’t Mayweather’s first dance with crypto controversy. Investors who followed his lead into ventures like EthereumMax and Bored Bunny NFTs have reportedly suffered significant losses after these projects fizzled out.
2024 is shaping up to be a year of cautious optimism. Experts predict continued growth, particularly in areas like GameFi (gaming with NFTs) and the use of NFTs in the metaverse economy.
Major companies are taking notice, potentially bringing stability and wider adoption. However, challenges remain. The industry still lacks clear regulations, and scams like the one suspected with Mayweather highlight the need for investor caution. Technical hurdles like scalability and interoperability also need to be addressed for widespread metaverse adoption.





BTC is currently trading at $68,901. Chart: TradingView
Crypto Hype Man In Trouble

The hits keep coming for Mayweather’s crypto reputation, going from landing punches in the ring to facing a different kind of jab – a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) right hook. In 2022, the SEC alleged Mayweather failed to disclose payments he received for promoting risky investments called Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).




Like a flashy pre-fight hype man, Mayweather reportedly used his social media platform to urge fans to buy digital tokens before they supposedly vanished. Back in 2018, he took a financial blow after being fined over $600,000 for similar ICO promotion blunders.

It seems Mayweather might be facing a different kind of fight – one where his punches pack little power against the jabs of regulators and disappointed fans. The message for investors is clear: don’t get hypnotized by celebrity endorsements in the wild west of cryptocurrency. Always conduct your own research before investing, because in the crypto ring, knockouts can come from unexpected corners.

Interest for 'Onchain' term on Google hits record high in May


    Interest in the term “onchain” surged to an all-time high, according to Google Trends data. This spike underscores the growing engagement and curiosity surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrency developments.



Over the past five years, global search interest in “onchain” has mostly remained under 25 on a scale of 100, with a brief peak of around 30 in March. 



However, between May 26 and June 1, search interest skyrocketed to 100, marking a record high. This represents the highest level of interest ever recorded by Google for the term.











Global search trends



Data from Google Trends reveals that Singapore exhibited the highest search interest in “onchain” over the past 30 days, followed by Nigeria, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and Luxembourg.

Users searching for “onchain” on Google also frequently explored related terms such as “onchain token,” “onchain coin,” “onchain crypto,” “onchain data,” “onchain analysis,” and “onchain monkey.”



Why the surge in interest now?



Several factors might explain the recent increase in search interest for “onchain.” The growing adoption of blockchain technology, significant developments within the ecosystem, and impactful marketing campaigns like Coinbase’s “Onchain Summer” have likely contributed to the spike.



Furthermore, the rising popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has driven more people to explore onchain solutions, pushing the term into the spotlight.



Key developments driving interest in the term “Onchain”



In late April, the BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund became the largest treasury fund to be tokenized on a blockchain. 



The fund’s assets under management reached $459.9 million, surpassing Franklin Templeton’s $357.7 million. This milestone highlights the increasing integration of traditional finance with blockchain technology, offering enhanced transparency and liquidity.



Similarly, in May, the Ethereum (ETH)  layer-2 blockchain Starknet, in collaboration with AI firm Giza, announced plans to incorporate AI agents on its blockchain. These AI agents will autonomously perform onchain activities, such as optimizing yield and reallocating portfolios, bringing a new level of efficiency and automation to blockchain operations.



Another factor contributing to the surge is the buzz around Bitcoin-based NFTs, particularly with the recently-launched Ordinals protocol. 



One prominent example is the OnChain Monkey NFT collection. This collection of 10,000 Ethereum NFT profile pictures (PFPs) minted in 2021 used Ordinals to “inscribe” all its existing artwork on Bitcoin.



Additionally, onchain metrics have become essential tools for predicting Bitcoin’s (BTC) future trajectory.



Conclusion



The record-high interest in the term “onchain” on Google is a clear indication of the growing attention and engagement within the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. 



As blockchain technology continues to evolve and integrate with traditional finance, and as new applications like AI and NFTs expand their reach, the interest in onchain solutions is likely to keep growing.



This trend reflects not just a passing curiosity but a broader shift towards decentralized and transparent financial systems.

Dogecoin price prediction as whales add 1 billion DOGE in a week


    Dogecoin (DOGE) whales have shown increased interest in the leading meme coin, accumulating the cryptocurrency in the past few days. In a week, these highly capitalized investors added over 1 billion DOGE to their stack, worth $157 million.



Finbold retrieved this data from Santiment on June 4, filtering Dogecoin addresses holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE. Notably, the chart shows these whales currently hold 31.15 billion DOGE at $0.157 per Dogecoin.



However, on May 27, the number was 30.10 billion, resulting in the bullish accumulation of 1.05 billion coins.







Dogecoin whales – Addresses between 100M and 1B DOGE. Source: Santiment / Finbold (Vini Barbosa)



Interestingly, a known cryptocurrency trader and on-chain analyst, Ali Martinez, spotted a similar behavior in the past few days. Martinez previously reported a 700 million DOGE accumulation from May 28 to May 31, worth $110 million. Later, the on-chain analyst reported a 200 million Dogecoin whale accumulation from May 30 to June 4.







Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction amid whales’ accumulation



DOGE has nearly doubled its price since February, when it was trading at around $0.085. At that time, Dogecoin had a similar trading and transaction volume to what it currently has, of around $864 million and $64 million, respectively. 



The gradual fall of these two metrics led to a period of accumulation, followed by the remarkable nearly 100% surge. Therefore, if this pattern plays out, the leading meme coin could experience another similar price action above $0.22—reached in March.



Dogecoin whales – Addresses between 100M and 1B DOGE. Source: Santiment / Finbold (Vini Barbosa)



Furthermore, Ali Martinez addressed the 47% price drop from these highs to Dogecoin’s price in May. On May 1, the analyst posted a thread showing DOGE broke out from the descending triangle formed in this period.



According to Martinez, this suggests another pattern previously seen in 2017 and 2021. Particularly, drops of 40% and 56% foreshadowed two massive pumps of 982% and 12,197% in each bull market, respectively.



The trader believes this could propel DOGE to a first level at $1 and further to $6. Nevertheless, these prices would mean $144 billion and $864 billion capitalization to Dogecoin, respectively, which are relatively high market caps.







In summary, Dogecoin whales have been signaling bullish intentions, accumulating 1 billion coins in the last week. Additionally, technical analysis projects DOGE above $1 per coin, but economic fundamentals may impose challenges to reach that mark.

Crypto trader turns $500K into $5.3 million in six months


    A crypto trader has realized nearly $5 million in profits from a six-month position trade with the meme coin PEPE. The position had a dollar-cost average of around $500,000 and an approximate valuation of $5.3 million on sale.



Essentially, the address ‘0x42C8‘ withdrew a total of 365.96 billion PEPE from the crypto exchange MEXC in three days. At that time, from December 13 to 16, 2023, this stack was worth approximately $496,000, as reported by Lookonchain.



Six months later, on June 4 at 03:26 am UTC, the crypto trader deposited all the tokens to Binance. Interestingly, this usually means selling intention and suggests the trader has closed the six-month PEPE position with realized profits.







PEPE was trading at $0.00001452 by the time of the Lookonchain post on X, resulting in a $5.3 million sell-off. Moreover, this sell-off represents 0.6% of the cryptocurrency‘s 24-hour trading volume and less than 0.01% of its capitalization.

Meme coins and the greater fool theory



Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile and experimental assets from an economic perspective.



Meme coins, such as PEPE, often lack fundamental value, while the hype and social media buzz drive their price action. Crypto traders who buy these coins are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy them at a higher price.



This mentality aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests that profits can be made by buying overvalued assets and selling them to a “greater fool.”



The ‘0x42C8’ whale could profit in this six-month position trade due to an increased retail demand for PEPE.



However, this theory also highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down and demand dwindles, traders can remain holding worthless assets, leading to substantial financial losses.

Investors wait with bated breath as Solana-based Piggy Bankster (PIGS) launches today - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Piggy Bankster (PIGS) launches today on Solana with a 100,000,000 token supply.
PIGS will employ a fair launch strategy that ensures open price discovery, starting at $0.00012 per token.
Piggy Bankster’s unique crime-themed narrative aims to build strong community engagement.

The emergence of new tokens in the cryptocurrencies continues to captivate both seasoned investors and newcomers.
Today, the spotlight shines on Piggy Bankster (PIGS), a unique Solana-based meme coin that promises to bring a blend of crime-themed narrative and engaging community interactions to the blockchain.
As Piggy Bankster makes its grand debut, the crypto community is abuzz with anticipation.
What is Piggy Bankster (PIG)?
Piggy Bankster isn’t just another meme coin; it embodies a distinctive persona that sets it apart in the crowded crypto market where the trending meme coins are cat, dog, and frog-themed.
The token is built on the Solana network, known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, making it an attractive platform for new projects.
Piggy Bankster’s narrative revolves around a gangster pig, dubbed Piggy Bankster, who has clawed his way up from the slums of Swine City to become a feared and respected crime boss.
Donning a pin-striped suit, Piggy Bankster exudes both crime and class characters, taking on rivals with ruthless efficiency. He values loyalty above all and rewards those who stand by him, while mercilessly dealing with those who betray his trust.
The story of Piggy Bankster is not merely a gimmick. It reflects a deeper engagement strategy aimed at building a strong community around the token.
With catchphrases like “All I have in this world is my word and my snout. And I don’t break ‘em for nobody,” and “When you mess with the best, you get turned into bacon,” the token’s creators are crafting an immersive experience that appeals to a wide audience.
Piggy Bankster tokenomics at launch
Piggy Bankster is launching with a fully circulating supply of 100,000,000 $PIGS tokens.
The launch is characterized by a fair launch strategy, ensuring that price discovery occurs in an open and transparent manner.
The initial liquidity provided for the token is $12,000, setting the starting price at $0.00012 per $PIGS.
This approach aims to avoid the pitfalls of pre-mined tokens and promises a level playing field for all investors.
The launch event is expected to draw significant interest from the crypto community, eager to see how Piggy Bankster performs in its initial phase.
Piggy Bankster set to compete against popular meme coins
Piggy Bankster enters the market at a time when meme coins are experiencing renewed interest and volatility.
Recently, other meme coins like TRUMP, BODEN, BRETT, POPCAT, and SHIB have shown significant price movements, driven by a mix of community engagement and market speculation.
Super Trump (TRUMP), linked to former U.S. President Donald Trump, has seen substantial volatility influenced by political news as presidential campaigns in the U.S. gain momentum. Its price peaked at over $17 before settling around $13.20, and upcoming political events could trigger further TRUMP price fluctuations.
Jeo Boden (BODEN), associated with current U.S. President Joe Biden, has also experienced a rollercoaster of price changes, currently valued at $0.25. Similarly, political debates and news are expected to continue influencing its price.
BRETT, a frog-themed meme coin, has seen its price surge by 180% over the past month, achieving a market cap of over $1 billion and making it standout in the meme coin space.
POPCAT, a cat-themed token saw its price soar to $0.65 in early May although it has since corrected to $0.50 following endorsements and market trends.
Last but not least, Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the meme coin pioneers remains a significant player, with its burn rate recently increasing dramatically. The development of its layer-2 solution, Shibarium, continues to advance, promising improved speed and lower fees.
What set’s Piggy Bankster apart?
Amid the stiff competition from already established meme coins, the success of Piggy Bankster will largely depend on its community engagement and the ability to maintain interest beyond the initial launch hype.
However, PIG’s unique narrative and the immersive world it creates offer a strong foundation for building a dedicated community and the developers’ commitment to fair launch principles and transparent tokenomics also adds credibility to the project.
With its strong narrative, community focus, and strategic use of the Solana network, Piggy Bankster has the potential to be a standout player in the world of meme coins.

ChatGPT-4o predicts XRP price after Ripple vs. SEC case verdict


    As the cryptocurrency community awaits the final ruling in the courtroom battle between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and blockchain company Ripple, the revolutionary generative artificial intelligence (AI) platform has weighed in on the price of XRP (XRP) after it arrives.



Specifically, after Judge Analisa Torres last year ruled that XRP sales to retail traders did not constitute securities sales but that selling to institutional sales did, the two sides are now in the process of discussing the potential punitive damages that Ripple has to pay for the sales deemed contrary to securities laws.



ChatGPT’s XRP/Ripple price prediction



In this context, the fourth model of OpenAI invention ChatGPThas offered its prediction for XRP after the final ruling in the Ripple v. SEC standoff, considering “market sentiment, historical price behavior in response to legal updates, and expert predictions tied to the potential outcomes of the ruling.”







With all these factors in mind, ChatGPT-4o has observed that “a significantly lower penalty than proposed by the SEC could lead to a positive market reaction, thereby boosting the price of XRP,” with favorable ruling acting “as a catalyst for a price increase.”



More specifically, the AI platform has set the price of XRP in such a case within a range of $0.55 to $1.00 “shortly after a favorable ruling or settlement” in the Ripple case, whereas a negative scenario might push the price down to “around $0.50 or lower,” albeit stressing that actual market reactions might be different.



XRP price analysis



For now, XRP is changing hands at the price of $0.52495, up 0.68% on the day while losing 1.68% in the past week and accumulating a decline of 0.55% on its monthly chart, as well as dipping 15.19% this year, according to the latest data retrieved by Finbold on June 4.

Earlier, in late May, pseudonymous crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO suggested that XRP’s performance at the time indicated that its next target lay in the $1.20-$1.50 range, identifying the $0.70 – $0.75 zone as a critical breakout point, as per his X post on May 27.



On the other hand, CoinsKid predicts XRP to hit the low price of $0.40 before the currently seventh-largest asset in the crypto sector by market capitalization could move upward toward the optimistic price levels projected by his peer.

All things considered, XRP might reach the price targets set by the AI model, but its predictions should not act as the main guide, and investors should do their own research and keep up with any XRP or Ripple news, Ripple SEC lawsuit updates, and Ripple SEC settlement when making decisions.

In a positive development for Australia, Monochrome Asset Management has launched a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) on the Cboe Australia exchange. Notably, the Monochrome spot Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) represents Australia’s first and only ETF holding Bitcoin (BTC) directly.Why IBTC stands outPer an earlier report from U.Today, analysts anticipate the new spot Bitcoin ETF in Australia to generate inflows of about $1 billion. Samson Mow, the CEO of Bitcoin technology company JAN3, highlighted IBTC’s unique position on the ETF market. First, he noted that the Monochrome spot Bitcoin ETF offers global investors direct in-kind creation or redemption.This feature allows them to directly exchange their Bitcoin for units of the ETF (IBTC) and vice versa, globally. This is quite different from other Bitcoin ETFs, especially those offered in the U.S. and Hong Kong, where investors typically deal with Authorized Participants (APs), who act as intermediaries. Mow added that Monochrome also partnered with lending institutions in Australia to make its Bitcoin ETF an eligible security for sophisticated investors. As a result, they will be permitted to borrow money against their ETF holdings, using IBTC as collateral.Benefits of IBTC for borrowers and Bitcoin minersCompared to borrowing through pure coin loans, Mow emphasized that using IBTC as collateral offers potential advantages as it is considered a more established financial product. According to him, borrowing through IBTC might come with a better loan-to-value ratio (LVR) and lower interest rates than traditional pure coin loans. In addition, Bitcoin holdings of the ETF would not need to leave cold storage, even when borrowed against. This eliminates the risk of investors losing their Bitcoin holdings due to hacks or other security issues.For Bitcoin miners, this feature could be a game-changer to help expand their operations. Bitcoin miners might use the IBTC borrowing option to access capital without selling their Bitcoin holdings.

Thailand Embraces Bitcoin: First ETF Approved for Wealthy Investors


							

Thai SEC approves ONEAM to launch Thailand’s first Bitcoin ETF, restricted to wealthy and institutional investors.



ONEAM’s Bitcoin ETF invests in 11 global funds, reviewed by US and Hong Kong regulators for safety and liquidity.



ONEAM advises investors to allocate 5% to Bitcoin, with expected returns of 8.90% per year and improved portfolio Sharpe ratio.




Wu Blockchain reported on X that the Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand, approved One Asset Management (ONEAM) to launch Thailand’s first Bitcoin ETF. This exchange-traded fund (ETF) targets wealthy and institutional investors, marking a significant step toward integrating digital assets into Thailand’s financial system.







According to the Bangkok Post, the fund will invest in eleven top global funds to ensure safety and liquidity. International regulatory bodies in Hong Kong and the US have reviewed this ETF to ensure compliance with international standards.



The ETF will be distributed between May 31 and June 6, with an investment risk level classified as eight. This endorsement marks a significant step in Thailand’s financial market, reflecting a growing trend of integrating digital assets into traditional investment portfolios. Pote Harinasuta, the chief executive of ONEAM, stated that digital assets like Bitcoin offer low correlation with other financial assets, making them suitable for diversifying investment risks.



 
 




MFC Asset Management, another Thai asset management company, is awaiting SEC approval for its own Bitcoin ETF, which will also be available only to wealthy and institutional investors.



Regulatory organizations worldwide are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting the potential of these products in the global financial system. The Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong has approved ETFs that invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlighting a trend that the U.S. SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has supported.



ONEAM suggests that investors allocate 5% of their portfolio to Bitcoin for an annual return of 8.90%. The maximum downside for a portfolio containing Bitcoin is -22.4%, and the Sharpe ratio, which measures return relative to risk, is 0.71. Conversely, a portfolio without Bitcoin has a maximum drawdown of -20.4% and yields a 5.80% annual return with a Sharpe ratio of 0.48. It appears that even with a slight increase in total volatility, using Bitcoin can improve the expected return and Sharpe ratio.

StarkWare Is Raising $1 Million to Scale Bitcoin With Zero-Knowledge Proofs - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsStarkWare, the Israeli-based company behind the popular Ethereum layer-2 network StarkNet and scalability engine StarkEx, has announced a plan to harness zero-knowledge rollups to massively increase the capabilities of Bitcoin as well. As part of its commitment to this vision, the company announced on Tuesday a $1 million research and development fund to make it happen.“Bitcoin today is mighty, but still a fraction of what it can be—I want to see the full works," StarkWare CEO and co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson said in a prepared statement. “Scale Bitcoin and we unleash blockchain’s power to transform the world.”The foundation of the Bitcoin- and Ethereum-scaling solution will be StarkNet, already established as a permissionless, decentralized rollup for Ethereum. Rollups bundle hundreds of thousands of transactions together off-chain and then verify them on-chain for a fraction of the cost.Key to moving forward is a pending proposal to restore a Bitcoin blockchain command known as OP_CAT, which would allow developers to set conditions under which Bitcoin can later be spent—leading to solutions for automated payments, reversible transactions, and other features that are available via smart contracts on other blockchains.“We’re supporting OP_CAT because we believe Bitcoin should play a more central role in society and we believe that the OP_CAT Bitcoin soft fork is the safest path for Bitcoin to scale, notably enabling STARK and rollups,” Ben-Sasson said.With that capability in place, he says the same mass scalability of Ethereum can be brought to the world's most established blockchain, while still retaining the spirit of its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.“The STARK cryptography we are proposing can deliver everything Satoshi envisioned, including the cheap everyday micro-payments discussed in the Bitcoin White Paper,” Ben-Sasson said. “This must happen in a manner that is loyal to Satoshi’s original vision, and the only way to get there is with cryptography that upholds all of Satoshi’s values—trustlesness, decentralization and more.”StarkNet, which touts an $8 billion valuation from its most recent investment round, announced that it began testing zero-knowledge proofs on Bitcoin last March, after committing to making its technology available under an open-source licenseAlthough StarkWare has historically focused on Ethereum, Ben-Sasson says they are chain agnostic.“StarkWare is often mistaken for being an Ethereum maxi, though actually we are scaling maxis,” Ben-Sasson said.StarkWare notes that Ben-Sasson presented so-called STARK scaling at a Bitcoin conference in 2013—before founding StarkWare, or even the emergence of the term STARK, which stands for Scalable Transparent ARgument of Knowledge.At the time, the company said, Bitcoin couldn't support STARKs, but Ethereum could. Now, between the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade in 2021 and the OP_CAT proposal, “Bitcoin is now primed for scaling.”“Applications for anything and everything will be deployable over Bitcoin, something that is impossible today,” Ben-Sasson said.In addition to the $1 million grant fund and aligning behind the OP_CAT proposal, StarkWare says it will prepare “ready-to-roll practical plans for deploying STARK scaling on Bitcoin,” based on the established success of its Ethereum implementation. There will also be a public repository of OP_CAT-based code, demonstrating its possible uses.Ben-Sasson said crypto is “a source of good,” and that by committing to Bitcoin scaling, StarkNet can deliver “far more than the bandwidth needed” to reach and help everyone.“I left academia because I’m convinced that crypto can clean up the digital world and finance,” Ben-Sasson wrote in Tuesday's announcement. “It can deliver integrity to money and rebalance power in our society, taking it away from big tech and restoring it to sovereign individuals.”“To me, no such vision is complete without scaling the chain that started this great project,” he continued. “Scale Bitcoin and we unleash blockchain’s power to transform the world.”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

D8X protocol brings novel futures exchange to Arbitrum - Blockworks


The perpetual futures exchange landscape is undeniably crowded at this stage, with literally hundreds of offerings available.
Many offer similar user experiences and features, and only the top 20 or so have attracted a meaningful amount of trader capital or volume. Fewer still can compete with centralized exchanges in terms of order execution and liquidity.
Newcomer D8X, which is now available on Arbitrum, has several features that its founders hope will let it stand out from the crowd.
It’s a full-fledged on-chain perp DEX protocol using an automated market-making (AMM) approach with no centralized order book.
The protocol is designed to be a white label product, with an open-source front-end kit available to third party operators, similar to the model pioneered by Liquity, according to co-founder Caspar Sauter. 
Read more: Liquity aims to build on safety record with V2 using staked ether
“We built a system from the ground up in a way that every component is as decentralized as possible,” Sauter told Blockworks.
The first such frontend was Octofi.io, with Freely Perps as a close second. Freely Perps is a frontend affiliated with Freely Finance, which also runs one for Liquity.
One of the biggest problems for all derivatives DEXs is bootstrapping a minimum viable amount of liquidity to make the trading experience pleasant. In D8X’s case, all frontends have the option to share liquidity via the protocol, making it easier for developers to get started without having to focus on infrastructure or bringing market makers to the platform.
This should appeal to spot DEXs, for instance, which can add perps easily within their existing brands. It’s also a solid option for smaller niche trading venues, like ones launched by KOL traders with their own brand.
“For them, it’s mainly interesting because if you’re either an alpha group or a KOL, you have a simple place to market and expand your brand where your users can still trade,” Sauter said.
D8X even includes a referral system out of the box. The protocol charges a white label partner fee of a few basis points.
Neither the frontends nor the protocol itself are subject to Swiss financial market laws, Sauter said.
Read more: Crypto needs to be a ‘hole’ lot more Swiss
“From a Swiss point of view, our Swiss law firm assessed what it would mean to host a frontend in Switzerland. And essentially, given [that] the whole exchange stack is completely decentralized, what you’re doing is providing a gateway to a decentralized exchange,” he said.
‘Ethena on-chain’
DeFi composability is front and center with the Arbitrum launch.
The new deployment uses Angle Protocol’s staked USDA (stUSD) as collateral for bitcoin trading, meaning traders earn a yield on deposited capital. Other derivatives DEXs like Aevo have offered this before but D8X’s is more generalized.
“The trade engine allows for ERC20-specific collateral pools which gives us — from a product perspective — quite some unique features,” Sauter explained.
The first example is the integration with EtherFi’s wrapped restaked ether (weETH) as collateral for the ETH/USD pair. This allows for what amounts to an “Ethena on-chain” strategy — shorting ether futures against weETH holdings to eliminate Ethena’s counterparty risk associated with its use of centralized futures exchanges.
The protocol also prices perps differently than, for instance, the popular Arbitrum perp DEX GMX, which applies a borrowing fee to both sides of a trade.
Sauter calls D8X’s funding model “classical perpetuals” in the sense that one side pays funding rate [and] the other side receives the funding rate depending on demand and supply,” thus making hedging cheaper.
The use of bespoke collateral can be extended to any ERC20, subject to custom risk parameters. For example, Arbitrum’s governance token ARB could be offered as a collateral option. D8X deployments on OKX’s X Layer already does this with its OKB token.
Read more: OKX turns on its L2 mainnet, joining the exchange chain club
Using volatile collateral may be risky, but Sauter says there’s demand to add utility to a variety of crypto assets.
“The volatility of the collateral doesn’t matter too much if you pay attention [to] the leverage that you’re accepting,” he said, noting that “there are large holders in the OKB ecosystem that are interested [in doing] stuff with their OKB.” He thinks that “from an LP perspective, it’s a no-brainer.”
Risk management is a key concern, he added, and traders have to be careful. But the protocol is designed for this.
“We always take live oracle feeds for all the prices we have, including collateral currencies, to be able to accurately price what happens,” Sauter said. “So even in the case of, for example, a de-pegging event of a stablecoin, that wouldn’t be a problem for the system itself.”
D8X uses Pyth oracles with AMM DEX pool oracles as a fallback mechanism.
Sauter describe their Polygon zkEVM and X Layer (which uses the Polygon CDK) deployments as “a growth bet.” Both chains have yet to scale and can’t share liquidity, although in the future this will be possible using the Polygon AggLayer.
Arbitrum, by contrast, is a DeFi powerhouse today, Sauter said.
“If you build on a new chain, you have many difficulties that you do not have when compared to the case where you build on an established mature ecosystem — from RPC infrastructure to verification of contracts, things that simply work because [they’ve] been there awhile.”
He regards the rollups’ execution costs as “negligible” and notes their performance is sufficient for their target market, though not suitable for high-speed trading.
“We like to be where we think we can move the needle when it comes to on-chain trading, and Arbitrum is clearly such a place,” Sauter said.

Ark Labs Announces New Payment Network for Bitcoin! - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to The Block, Ark Labs has started developing the new Bitcoin Layer 2 payment network based on the Ark protocol.
Accordingly, Ark aims to offer a more simplified, self-custodial Bitcoin Layer 2 solution without the need to manage nodes, payment channels and liquidity.


First proposed in 2023, the Ark protocol aims to provide a Bitcoin Layer 2 scaling solution that works with the Lightning Network and aims to provide a more simplified user experience while maintaining its own custody.
Ark Labs CEO Marco Argentieri made the following statement:






“With the launch of Ark Labs, we are finally making Ark a reality, so users can immediately start reaping the benefits of seamless, scalable operations.”

What is Arc Protocol?
In the Ark protocol, unlike the Lightning Network, users do not need to manage payment channels or incoming/outgoing liquidity to make payments.
Ark consists of a network of Ark Service Providers (ASPs) to which users can connect via Ark-compatible wallets.


The Ark team said the ASP is a trustless server that provides the user with “virtual transactions” at the time of deposit, which can then be transferred at low cost between users of the same ASP, sent over Lightning to users of different ASPs, or used on-chain at any time.
Ark Labs is funded by a donation from bitcoin-native financial services company Vulpem Ventures and is led by a team of experienced Bitcoin developers.

Thailand SEC Approves Country’s First Bitcoin ETF, Which Is Targeting Wealthy and Institutional Investors | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a landmark move for the Thai financial market, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given the green light to One Asset Management (ONEAM) to launch the country’s first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The ONE Bitcoin ETF Fund of Funds Unhedged and not for Retail Investors (ONE-BTCETFOF-UI) is set to be distributed between May 31 and June 6, with an investment risk level of eight.



According to a report published earlier today by Bangkok Post, the fund, which is limited to wealthy and institutional investors, aims to invest in 11 leading global funds to ensure liquidity and safety. ONEAM has emphasized the importance of storing coins using international standards and has undergone reviews by international regulatory agencies in the United States and Hong Kong.



Per the report, Pote Harinasuta, chief executive of ONEAM, believes that digital assets, such as Bitcoin, offer investors an alternative asset class with low correlation to other financial assets, thereby helping to diversify investment risks. The approval of ONEAM’s Bitcoin ETF comes amidst a growing international recognition of these funds, particularly after the US SEC allowed the creation of funds that invest directly in spot Bitcoin through ETFs earlier this year. Additionally, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission permitted the establishment of ETFs investing in both Bitcoin and Ethereum in April.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Despite the limited supply of Bitcoin, capped at 21 million, demand for the cryptocurrency is on the rise as it gains popularity. Harinasuta sees high growth potential for Bitcoin, citing its average return of 124% per year over the past 11 years. However, he also acknowledges the high volatility associated with the asset, which averages 83% annually.



One of the key features of Bitcoin ETFs is the security of coin storage. Harinasuta points out that investing in Bitcoin directly through various platforms can be risky, with past issues including data loss or stolen digital assets via online systems. By investing through ETFs, unitholders’ data and coins are distributed through custodians, employing the same standards used by institutional investors. This involves storing coins offline, which he says is considered highly secure.



Interestingly, today also marked the start of trading for Australia-based Monochrome Asset Management’s Monochrome spot Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) on the Cboe Australia exchange. As CoinDesk reported yesterday, before the introduction of IBTC, Australian investors could only invest in ETFs that held Bitcoin indirectly or through offshore Bitcoin products. These options did not provide the investor protection afforded by the directly held crypto asset under the Australian Financial Services Licensing (AFSL) regime, according to the announcement.

Miners' Bitcoin (BTC) Stash Dwindles to Levels Unseen Since Satoshi Era


																The supply of bitcoin held by miners has dwindled to levels not seen in over 14 years.
This massive decline in miner reserves comes at a time when the broader cryptocurrency market is witnessing a surge in institutional interest and growing mainstream adoption.
Bitcoin Miner Reserves Hit 14-Year Low
According to on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant’s latest analysis, the last time miner reserves were this low, bitcoin was still in its infancy. Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto was actively working on the project, and the concept of altcoins had yet to emerge.
It was a time when Barack Obama occupied the White House, and the idea of corporations like MicroStrategy embracing BTC as a legitimate investment asset seemed like a distant dream.
The diminishing miner reserves can be attributed to several factors, one of them being the increasing cost of mining operations and the demand for selling mined bitcoins at profitable prices.




As the mining difficulty continues to rise, miners are incentivized to offload a portion of their holdings to sustain their operations and subsequently reinvest in more efficient mining hardware.
“Companies and investors with foresight enough to understand the long-term implications of supply will do extremely well. Slowly.. then all at once.”
‘Stubbornly Bullish’ Market
Bitcoin dipped to $69,200 on Tuesday as investors took profits after the leading cryptocurrency briefly surpassed the $70,000 mark late Monday. Price movements across major cryptocurrencies were mixed.
According to a report released by crypto exchange Bitfinex on Monday, the decline in bitcoin’s value since March was likely driven by long-term holders selling their stash. However, blockchain data indicates that this trend has stalled, and investors have again switched to accumulation mode.
An earlier report by CryptoQuant stated that 50% of the long-term bitcoin supply was “inactive,” meaning there were no movements or changes in holdings across tracked wallets. This lack of activity can be considered as a sign of strong long-term conviction, which may signal further price increases.
Further validating the positive sentiment surrounding bitcoin’s continued growth, Singapore-based QCP Capital said that the market remains “stubbornly bullish” while observing an uptick in trading activity.

Here Are The Major News And Events Affecting The Bitcoin Price | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin rose to as high as $70,000 on June 3, signaling a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. This price surge is believed to be due to some recent developments that are positive for the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
Interest Rate Cuts Could Come In September
Data from The CME FedWatch Tool shows that the probability of the Fed cutting interest rates to a 25-basis point has increased to 51.3%. Meanwhile, the probability of interest rates remaining at 50-basis point is at 40.1%. This heightened expectations about an interest rate cut has come despite recent inflation giving mixed feelings about the US economy. 

The US S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, rose to 51.3 in May from 50.0 in April, indicating a most improvement. However, the ISM Manufacturing PMI fell from 49.2 to 48.7. Investors are still confident that interest rates will be cut by September. An interest rate cut is positive for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market as it will boost investors’ confidence to invest in these risk assets.
Meanwhile, another positive development for Bitcoin is the fact that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are again recording impressive net inflows. These funds recorded a weekly total net inflows of $170.9 million last week. These Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also began this new week on the right foot, recording $105.1 in net inflows on June 3. 
This development is significant, considering that these funds were instrumental in sending Bitcoin to a new all-time high (ATH) back in March. As such, they could once again serve as the catalyst as the flagship crypto looks to successfully break out from the $70,000 range and rise above its current ATH of $73,750. 
Moreover, the increased demand for these funds is coming at a time when the Spot Ethereum ETFs are about to begin trading. These developments paint an ultra-bullish picture for not just Bitcoin but the entire crypto market. 
Bitcoin Still Far From The Market Top
Crypto analyst Crypto Con noted in a recent X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin is still far from its market top. He made this remark while alluding to the Logarithmic Market Value to Realized Value, which showed that “there is still good room for growth to the cycle top mark.” The crypto analyst however added that this cycle may be way progressed than “it would appear on the surface.”  

Crypto analyst Tarekonchain also shared a similar sentiment, stating that Bitcoin has yet to reach its fair market value with its MVRV around 2.3. He further revealed that Bitcoin’s price peaked in previous cycles when the MVRV indicator reached a value of 3.5 or above, meaning that the bull run is still far from over.

How often does the SEC lose crypto lawsuits?


Whether the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is doing a good or bad job enforcing the law over the crypto industry is a matter of perspective.
On the one hand, crypto fans will point to the industry’s victories against the regulator as proof that it’s negligent, vague, and ineffectual.
On the other, the space’s critics rejoice every time the SEC comes out on top, using such cases as proof that coin promoters are being held accountable for their failures.
But when it comes to such legal battles, cases that have gone to court, and punishments handed out to unscrupulous or incompetent coin promoters, what’s the score? Is the SEC winning or is it, as some have claimed, powerless to adequately police the seemingly unending tide of coins flooding the market?

Read more: Explained: Crypto assets deemed as securities by the SEC
SEC versus crypto in Congress: Undefeated
First, regarding legislative battles in Congress, there have been no major bills that have limited the SEC’s authority over the crypto industry.
President Joe Biden vetoed H.J. 109, the most advanced bill that would have overturned a single crypto rule, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121. Therefore, the SEC prevailed in that particular Congressional battle.
Otherwise, there are various bills that exist or have passed one chamber of Congress, but no President has signed any law that has meaningfully limited the SEC’s authority over the crypto industry. That leaves the SEC as virtually undefeated in Congress.
SEC versus crypto in court: The numbers
Next, we turned to US civil courts. Since 2019, the SEC has publicly filed 116 crypto lawsuits in federal courts, naming over 260 crypto companies and promoters as defendants. 
(Note: When corporate defendants shared similar names, such as in the case of the separately-named defendants IPro Solutions LLC and IPro Network LLC, we collapsed similarly-named entities to a single approximation so as to be more conservative.)
According to our research, the SEC has successfully settled or won 95 of these lawsuits. Protos was unable to determine the outcome of 21 cases, most of which are either unresolvable or still ongoing. For example, the SEC sued John McAfee in 2010, but he died in 2021, so the outcome of that lawsuit is unresolvable. 
Similarly, the SEC has sued many crypto promoters who either live abroad or who have fled the US, so Commissioners cannot finalize those lawsuits without the cooperation of foreign sovereigns.
Generally speaking, the SEC has an overwhelming track record of successful litigation against crypto promoters. Its losses are rare yet attract significant media attention.
For example, the regulator categorically lost its complaints against the crypto defendant Debt Box. The SEC also lost two of its three complaints against Ripple: programmatic secondary market sales of XRP, and related aiding and abetting complaints against Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse.
The SEC also lost its legal battle with Grayscale, in which it was a defendant (not plaintiff). The powerful US District of Columbia Court of Appeals forced the SEC to either approve a spot bitcoin ETF or explain its denial in a non-arbitrary and capricious manner. Ultimately, commissioners decided to relent to Grayscale.

Read more: Everything wrong with ShapeShift’s SEC settlement
When counting its win/loss ratio against its 260 defendants, however, its win rate is far above 95%. If counting each individual complaint separately — distinguishing each civil enforcement action within each lawsuit as a separate legal battle, which might be the proper method of tallying — then its win rate would exceed 99%.
Note on methodology: Protos hasn’t researched SEC lawsuits prior to January 2019, nor have we tallied the SEC’s win rate as a defendant. The SEC is usually almost always a plaintiff in civil courts. However, a few crypto companies as plaintiffs have sued the SEC, such as Coinbase, Consensys, and the Blockchain Association. Most lawsuits naming the SEC as a defendant are still in active litigation.

StarkWare Reveals Ambitious Plan To Scale Bitcoin Through Controversial Upgrade - The Defiant

The move comes with a $1 million fund for researchers.StarkWare, the team that pioneered zero-knowledge-based rollups in 2018 and has been instrumental to scaling Ethereum through its Layer 2 Starknet, has unveiled an ambitious plan to now scale Bitcoin.“We want to seize the moment,” StarkWare’s Co-founder and CEO Eli Ben-Sasson told The Defiant. “In the time since the Taproot upgrade, research has helped us to appreciate that it has unlocked pathways to new possibilities over BTC.”Taproot, which was implemented November 2021, was the latest and largest of Bitcoin’s upgrades. It seeks to boost smart contracts and privacy to Layer 1 transactions, a much-needed feature for the network. But according to a dashboard by Bitcoin core contributor Luke Dash Jr., barely 12% of Bitcoin nodes are running an upgraded Taproot version of the software.Nonetheless, Ben-Sasson is gearing to make the most of the latest improvement.The team has allocated a $1 million fund for research and development to make StarkWare’s Bitcoin scaling plan possible. Funds will go to researchers specifically dedicated to gaining a deeper understanding of OP_CAT, a Satoshi-era script of Bitcoin that has now resurfaced.A Controversial RevivalOP_CAT, short for “Operation Concatenate,” is an opcode that was initially proposed by Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The opcode allows for the combination of two pieces of data into a single piece of data during the execution of a Bitcoin transaction.Essentially, OP_CAT enables specific features that can limit or expand how bitcoin can be transacted in the future. Use-cases include secure vaults that would allow reversible transactions, automated recurring payments, or time-locked transfers for inheritance schemes.But Satoshi Nakamoto actually removed OP_CAT in 2011, citing concerns that it would expose the network to security issues, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks if used in conjunction with other similar scripts.According to Ben-Sasson, the probability of OP_CAT being adopted is high, which places StarkWare’s plan in an exciting position. “It will retain all Bitcoin values unchanged,” he explained, “while providing a bare bones framework that is just enough to bring STARK scaling to Bitcoin.Reactivating OP_CAT has its defenders along with detractors.Udi Wertheimer, well-known Bitcoin troll and Co-founder of the Taproot Wizards, has been touting the script since it was introduced back in October 2022. He has claimed that OP_CAT will allow scaling without changing the core fundamentals of Bitcoin–a sentiment shared by Ben-Sasson.Others aren’t so sure about that.Detractors Call It An AttackRobin Linus, the creator of BitVM, a proposed system that allows complex computations and smart contracts to be executed on the Bitcoin network, previously said that OP_CAT “fundamentally changes Bitcoin's nature, introducing a new attack surface that nobody fully comprehends.”Notably, Ben-Sasson told The Defiant that one of the teams they were working with to get StarkWare’s ambitious plan off the ground is BitVM.Others agree with Linus, although in slightly different fashion.As Matt Corrallo, a Bitcoin core contributor explained in an April 16 post titled “Stop Calling It MEV,” systems that have arbitrarily expressible smart contracts are likely to have the potential for advanced MEV extraction similar to what we see on Ethereum today.Implementing OP_CAT opens the door to that possibility.Corrallo didn’t explicitly state he was against OP_CAT, but his points were taken by bitcoiners that are against the upgrade. Others also called out the inability of OP_CAT defenders to voice risks that come with reviving and reimplementing the script.The pseudonymous technical editor for Bitcoin Magazine Shinobi wrote on X on March 14 that the “If we don’t know the limits of what this can do or the potential effects it could have, adding it into Bitcoin sounds like a horrible idea, imo.”An Ambitious PlanThat said, Ben-Sasson’s team isn’t shying away from its plan. He also outlined his general vision early this Tuesday morning in a video post.StarkWare is the team behind StarkNet, one of the top scaling solutions for Ethereum which currently holds $294 million in Total Value Locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. The team is now intent on taking that success, and replicating it on Bitcoin.To scale Ethereum–and now hopefully Bitcoin–StarkWare uses zero-knowledge rollups. These use the minimal amount of information needed to verify a transaction, reducing the data load on the network.Rollups have been largely touted by the teams developing them as the answer to scaling woes suffered by blockchains. They do not trade off security, but rather inherit the protections of Layer 1s, while allowing for faster and more transactions to happen off chain.These could be the right answer for the Bitcoin ecosystem, well known for its slow transaction throughput and high fees when congested. However, the solution delivered here with OP_CAT is a contentious option, and one that might get pushback from the overall Bitcoin community.As OP_CAT continues to get tested on Bitcoin’s testnet–it was launched in early April 2024–the task at hand will be to see if the overall community is up for reviving its ten lines of code.

In a recent reaction to an X post, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has provided a thought-provoking response to a poll concerning the security sustainability of the Cardano network. The poll's results have sparked a discussion on the economic model that underpins the security of blockchain networks.Rick McCracken Digi, a Cardano SPO, launched a poll on X that asks the ADA community what they would rather rely on to sustain the future security of Cardano. Respondents had two major choices.The first choice was the 2% inflation of ADA rewards, like other blockchains such as Ethereum, Dogecoin and Solana. The second was "20% of the inflation-generated revenue from staking other or partner chains." Twenty percent of respondents went for the first option, while 35.3% of respondents chose the second option. Meanwhile, a larger percentage of respondents (44.8%) were indecisive and went for the option "show results."In reaction to the poll, Hoskinson pointed out a compelling statistic from the Bitcoin network, noting that 75% of the revenue generated from mining Bitcoin blocks is derived from transaction fees rather than block inflation.Looking at Cardano, the founder's reaction suggests a similar trajectory for the network. With millions of transactions expected to be processed using Cardano, the implication is that these transactions will fund the block producers, ensuring the network's security and sustainability.This model aligns with the broader shift in the crypto industry toward transaction fee-based revenue models, which are seen as more sustainable in the long term compared to reliance on block rewards.In response, McCracken, the Cardano community member who initiated the poll, agreed with Hoskinson's point of view, adding that one issue that needed to be addressed was the throughput and number of users required to achieve sustainability.

Whale scooped $26.7M in ETH after $76.6M profit amid market surge


    Ethereum (ETH) is making significant strides towards reaching the $4,000 mark, spurred by recent developments involving the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 



Speculation is rife that Ethereum might replicate Bitcoin’s (BTC) price movement, which saw a notable rally following the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 



The introduction of new Ether ETFs has been a catalyst for significant whale activity, further boosting Ethereum’s ascent







On June 3, the analytics platform SpotOnChain shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) indicating that a whale transferred 7,000 ETH, worth approximately $26.7 million, to Binance when Ethereum was trading at $3,814. 







This whale, known for withdrawing ETH during bear markets and reinvesting during price surges, currently holds 36,785 ETH valued at around $141 million. The trading activities have generated an estimated $76.6 million profit, reflecting a growth rate of 57.9%.



Ethereum exchange reserves decline



Since the approval of spot Ether ETFs in the United States on May 23, over $3 billion worth of Ether has been withdrawn from centralized crypto exchanges, signaling a potential supply squeeze.



According to CryptoQuant data, Ether reserves on exchanges dropped by approximately 797,000 between May 23 and June 2, equating to $3.02 billion.



 This reduction in exchange reserves suggests that fewer coins are available for sale as investors move their holdings to self-custody for long-term purposes rather than immediate selling.



Increase in large ETH holdings



The activity of Ethereum’s largest whales is intensifying the bullish sentiment. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a significant increase in large ETH holdings, with wallets possessing over 1% of the total ETH supply, rising from 36% to 41% this year.



Finbold retrieved data from Santiment on June 4, showing similar trends. Notably, there has been substantial accumulation among entities holding between 10 million and 100 million ETH since May 20, coinciding with rumors of the SEC reconsidering its stance on spot Ether ETFs. 



This accumulation has persisted following the official approval of such ETFs on May 23.

Conversely, whales holding between 1 million and 10 million ETH appear to be taking profits, while exchange reserves have significantly declined.



This suggests that investors are moving their holdings off exchanges, indicating a long-term bullish sentiment (hodling) that could potentially drive Ether above the $4,000 mark.



Ethereum price analysis amid massive whale accumulation



By press time, Ethereum was trading at $3,751. On the monthly chart, ETH has rallied by over 20%.

The recent surge in Ethereum’s price, spurred by whale activity and the approval of spot Ether ETFs, shows strong bullish sentiment in the market. 



The significant withdrawal of Ether from exchanges and accumulation by major holders suggest a promising future price trajectory. 



The ETF approval is expected to attract institutional investors, motivating ETH bulls to maintain the price above $3,500

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire Praised Brasil Crypto Industry


Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, announced new partnerships with industry giants during his visit to Brazil.
Allaire noted that the adoption of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins is still in its early stages.
Circle Officially Enters Brazil, BTG Pactual Will Issue USDC
During his visit to Brazil, Circle’s chairman signed a partnership with BTG Pactual. This means one of Latin America’s largest investment banks will now offer USDC to the market through the local banking system.


“BTG will be our direct liquidity partner for the minting [registration within the blockchain] of USDC 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This means that on a retail and institutional level, companies and investors will be able to almost instantly issue and receive USDC in Brazil using the real in the local banking system,” Allaire said.

The executive with over two decades of experience stated that the partnership with BTG “represents a tremendous milestone.”

“We are still in the early stages and at the beginning of the wider use of digital dollars, we are at the beginning of the wider use of blockchain in the financial system,” he stated.

Allaire told a small group of journalists in São Paulo that he is certainly excited to see wider adoption by end users. He expressed enthusiasm about the growing number of financial institutions, fintechs, and payment companies gaining access to this infrastructure in Brazil. While these partnerships are important, he noted that Brazil has a much larger overall number of financial institutions and fintechs.

“We want to grow this and I think now we have the real infrastructure, the financial infrastructure, we have the key partners that can really grow this. I think it’s really the beginning and it’s about enabling, you enable thousands of institutions here in Brazil to be able to use this infrastructure,” Circle CEO commented.


BTG CEO Roberto Sallouti stated during the Circle meeting that blockchain is likely the future path for the institutional and financial systems. Jeremy Allaire echoed this sentiment in his discussion with reporters. The CEO highlighted the success of the Central Bank’s PIX system, which now has over 160 million users. He noted that Brazil, with leaders like Roberto Campos Neto, has a progressive approach to advancing financial technology and initiatives like Drex.

“We are committed to making a positive impact on the Brazilian market and partnering with key stakeholders to enable companies to participate in the global economy more easily and efficiently. There are many powerful opportunities on the horizon when Brazil’s advanced fintech ecosystem converges with the world’s most accessible dollar platform,” Circle co-founder said.

Brazil Will Become a Major Crypto Player
Jeremy Allaire explained that Circle initially launched USDC in Singapore due to strong Asian demand. Nevertheless, he now sees Brazil as a major global player.

“People know that Asia is a huge hub for this activity, but when we look at other markets, we look at Brazil,” he stated.

According to Allaire, the proactive stance of Brazilian regulators, such as the Central Bank, has attracted Circle’s attention. Besides partnering with BTG, Circle has also teamed up with Nubank and Mercado Bitcoin.

When asked if the United States lags behind Brazil in digital currency adoption, Jeremy Allaire noted that the US has the largest financial system in the world and the most to lose from inaction. However, he also mentioned that the US government might prefer to wait “until things are more developed before taking the next steps.”

“This is a slow-moving trend. But at the same time, there has been a particular environment around fintech innovation. And I consider Circle to be one of them. They were built under an American regulatory regime, and so there has been a lot of progress,” Allaire noted.


Regarding the US presidential race, Jeremy Allaire mentioned Donald Trump, noting that the Republican candidate often supports cryptocurrencies. Circle CEO also pointed out that Trump opposes the digital dollar (CBDC).

“Regardless of who wins the presidential election in the United States, we’re going to see more constructive, bipartisan work to regulate the sector. There may be some differences of opinion here or there, but I think the general direction is, regardless, towards good regulation,” he concluded.

New Economic Data To Decide Bitcoin’s Next Direction, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen - The Daily Hodl


								A top crypto analyst thinks this week will offer some critical hints about the future direction of Bitcoin (BTC).
In a new YouTube video, Benjamin Cowen tells his 802,000 subscribers that the labor market data, which will become public this week, could suggest a possible trajectory for BTC.










The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes reports on the first Friday of every month that include metrics like average hourly earnings, non-farm employment change and the unemployment rate.
The crypto analyst notes that Bitcoin price hesitation leading up to a new month is a “common thing.”
“You get that labor market data and then you decide the short-term direction.”
Cowen also thinks it’s likely that the European Central Bank (ECB) will cut interest rates this week.
The analyst notes that Bitcoin’s 20-week simple moving average (SMA) is currently at $61,793 and its 21-week exponential moving average (EMA) is at $60,478. Taken together, those metrics form what Cowen refers to as the “bull market support band,” an indicator used to determine whether the price of an asset is in bullish or bearish territory.
“It is decision time in the cryptoverse to figure out [whether] we get another move higher into the summer like 2019, or [whether] we’re already there.”
Bitcoin is trading at $69,242 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours.

What’s Happening in DeFi? dYdX, 3Jane, MakerDAO, and More


The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector continues to evolve, with several significant launches and updates making waves. BeInCrypto has examined the latest happenings, providing a comprehensive overview of the most noteworthy developments in the DeFi space.
From the launch of dYdX’s Android app to 3Jane’s derivatives yield layer, the sector is brimming with innovation and progress.
Term Structure’s Mainnet Launch
Term Structure has now launched its mainnet on Ethereum (ETH). This marks the debut of the first market-driven, institutional-grade fixed-income protocol. It is changing how lenders and borrowers manage liquidity in DeFi.
This platform lets users borrow tokens at fixed rates and terms using their liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs). They can also earn points and staking rewards. The auction mechanism in the primary markets facilitates borrowing and lending.
Additionally, the secondary markets offer a real-time order book. This feature enhances liquidity by supporting the trading of fixed-income tokens.

With this launch, Term Structure aims to set new global standards in liquidity management. It enables users to lock in a fixed cost of funds. This move is crucial for leveraging opportunities to possibly earn higher floating annual percentage yields (APYs) or capitalize on token price appreciation.

“Our mainnet, designed to cater to institutional clients, traders, and retail investors, marks a pivotal development in DeFi. It allows users to leverage their digital assets with fixed rates and terms,” Jerry Li, Term Structure CEO, said.

Term Structure is a fixed-rate lending and borrowing protocol powered by a customized zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup, zkTrue-up. The Taiwanese DeFi platform specializes in non-custodial fixed-income protocols for peer-to-peer borrowing and lending.
dYdX Android App Launch and Chain Upgrade
On another front, dYdX, a perpetual trading decentralized exchange (DEX), now offers its app on Android. The app contains all the current features of the dYdX chain.

“dYdX Chain for Android includes some of your favorite features like 24/7/365 markets, 20x leverage, 65 Markets and counting, low gas fees, and so much more,” the dYdX team noted.

Additionally, dYdX revealed its upgrade to dYdX Chain v5.0. This software upgrade was scheduled for block 17,560,000 around June 6 at 15:16 UTC.

This decision followed a dYdX community vote, with 90% supporting the upgrade to version 5.0 and 98.5% voting in favor. The upgrade introduces several improvements: Isolated Markets, Batch order cancellation, Protocol-enshrined liquidity provider (LP) Vault, Slinky Sidecar/Vote Extension, Performance Enhancements, Soft Open Interest Cap, and Full Node Streaming. As per DefiLlama data, dYdX Chain’s total value locked (TVL) stands at $146.28 million as of this writing.

3Jane Revolutionizes Restaking with Derivatives Yield on EigenLayer
3Jane, a derivatives yield protocol, is live on EigenLayer. It unlocks a novel derivatives yield layer by enabling the collateralization of restaked ETH in derivatives contracts.
Chudnov Glavniy, founder of 3Jane, announced the protocol launch. According to Glavniy, the protocol unlocks a new derivatives yield layer for restakers by enabling the collateralization of restaked ETH in derivatives contracts, specifically call options.

“3Jane is the first ETH yield source for all EigenLayer assets and the first step towards ‘financializing’ EigenLayer by sourcing yield not just from [Actively Validated Services] AVS security but also from financial derivatives,” Glavniy explained.

The protocol enables collateralizing all exotic yield-bearing ETH and Bitcoin (BTC) variants across EigenLayer, Babylon Chain, and Ethena in options contracts. Users can wrap natively restaked ETH, restaked LSTs, ether.fi Staked ETH (eETH), Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH), Ethena Staked USDe (sUSDe), and Savings DAI (sDAI) on 3Jane to earn additional options premium yield. 3Jane Vaults sell deep out-of-the-money options and accrue premiums to wrapped deposits.
Everclear: Connext’s Rebranding and Clearing Layer Introduction
Interoperability protocol Everclear has introduced the first “Clearing Layer” after rebranding from Connext. These layers coordinate transactions between chains, netting fund flows before settling them on the underlying chains and bridges. The live test net begins today.
The Chain Abstraction stack aims to solve fragmentation by eliminating the need for users to care about the chain they are on. However, it faces challenges in rebalancing and settling liquidity between chains.
Everclear addresses this issue by creating Clearing Layers. These layers coordinate market actors to net funds flows between chains before settling with underlying chains and bridges. They form the foundation of the Chain Abstraction stack, enabling seamless liquidity and permissionless chain expansion for protocols built on them.
Everclear reduces the cost and complexity of rebalancing by up to 10 times. The system is built as an Arbitrum Orbit rollup (via Gelato RaaS) and connects to other chains using Hyperlane with an Eigenlayer Interchain Security Module (ISM).
On average, about 80% of daily cross-chain capital flows are nettable. For every $1 bridged into a chain, $0.80 is bridged out. If solvers, market makers, and centralized exchanges coordinated, they could reduce bridging fees by more than five times.
TrueFi’s Deployment on Arbitrum
TrueFi is now live on Arbitrum, marking a significant expansion in partnership with Cicada Credit to bring on-chain credit to Arbitrum with market-neutral borrowers. The TrueFi team explained several reasons they chose Arbitrum.

“Arbitrum is the largest Layer 2 by TVL, number of DeFi protocols, and balance of stablecoins. According to L2beat, Arbitrum is the furthest along the path of decentralization. They are investing significant funds from their treasury into [real-world assets] RWAs, as seen in their recent STEP program, where we have also applied with Adapt3r Digital,” the team outlined.


In the coming days and weeks, TrueFi will share more about the pools’ specific configuration and details on each of the borrowers. The first two pools will be with Gravity Team and AlphaNonce, and many more will come.
Nostra’s NSTR Tokenomics and Launch Events
Nostra revealed their tokenomics for NSTR, featuring a total supply of 100 million tokens unlocked entirely at launch. NSTR will serve as the governance token for the Nostra ecosystem.
They plan to distribute 11% to the community through an airdrop. Launch events include an upcoming Snapshot, a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) running from June 10 to 13, and the Token Generation Event (TGE) on June 17.

Nostra claims NSTR will be the fairest launch in DeFi. The Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) pre-listing event aims to fund DEX liquidity.
They will airdrop tokens to the most active users and community members. All proceeds will go towards Treasury-owned DEX liquidity.
Solv Protocol Integrates Ethena for Yield Vault
Solv Protocol, a platform for optimizing yield and liquidity across major assets, has integrated Ethena to introduce the first yield vault for SolvBTC. This vault will enable users to earn yields from Ethena’s strategies while retaining exposure to Bitcoin.
Users can earn attractive yields with SolvBTC through two methods. Firstly, by utilizing Solv’s Yield Vaults, users can deposit their SolvBTC into these vaults to access premium yield sources such as BTC staking, restaking, and delta-neutral trading strategies.

Secondly, users can explore DeFi opportunities using SolvBTC across diverse DeFi protocols. This allows access to various yield-generating options, maximizing earnings within the vibrant DeFi ecosystem.
The ‘SolvBTC Yield Vault – Ethena’ is the first of many planned collaborations by Solv Protocol. These partnerships aim to introduce new yield sources and strategies to the expanding SolvBTC ecosystem.
MakerDAO’s New Proposal: Etherfi’s weETH into SparkLend
MakerDAO has opened a new proposal to onboard Etherfi’s weETH into SparkLend. weETH is the largest Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) on the market. It is also the only large LRT with fully enabled withdrawals, ensuring stable liquidity and a strong peg to ETH.
Phoenix Labs has proposed listing weETH to increase DAI borrowing on SparkLend, given the low competition for borrowing USD stablecoins using LRT collateral. The initial parameters and risk assessment are based on current market and liquidity conditions for weETH:



Liquidation Threshold: 73%



“If approved, this change will be part of an upcoming Executive Vote in SparkLend,” the MakerDAO team said.

These advancements emphasize the evolution of the DeFi sector, showcasing the relentless innovation and progress that are propelling the industry forward. With projects like dYdX, 3Jane, and MakerDAO continually breaking new ground, the future of decentralized finance appears exceptionally promising.

Onchain Gaias Explained: Base's Fun AI Play | Bankless


The Base NFT scene is still wide open. It’s a ripe time for an NFT collection to rise up and become the L2’s dominant profile picture (PFP) project. The collection with the best prospects for this ascendancy over the next six months? In my opinion, it’s Onchain Gaias. Onchain Gaias isn’t just a plain old PFP project—it’s already got the makings of a cult following, and it’s working at the crossroads of AI, games, and Farcaster in a way the crypto space hasn’t seen before. As the collection’s art reveal is nearing and with its AI efforts ramping up, it’s an interesting time to take a closer look at these uber-PFPs. Here’s everything you need to know about these promising Base NFTs! 👇 via https://x.com/onchaingaias/status/1768740859678212560What Are Onchain Gaias?Spearheaded by Ciniz and artist Anton Marrast, Onchain Gaias launched via Warpcast in March 2024 as a free mint of 5,556 passes dubbed “Degen’s Golden Tickets.”The plan? These passes will be redeemed 1:1 for Onchain Gaias PFPs when the art is finalized, which is coming soon.Initially, people were mainly excited about the prospects of a new premier Base collection, but anticipation grew fast as the creators started teasing gaming developments early on. One month after launching, the Gaias floor price peaked at 1.25 ETH right after the team published its initial whitepaper, confirming gaming plans and an ambitious decentralized AI training system centered around games. via https://nftpricefloor.com/onchain-gaiasThe collection has cooled off some amid a pre-reveal lull and in the wake of Base’s mini NFT bullrun this spring. Nevertheless, so far it boasts the most all-time volume of any NFT collection on Base, with +4k ETH worth of trades facilitated and counting, and it remains one of the top traded projects on the L2. How Onchain Gaias Worksvia https://zora.co/collect/base:0x3a56ed006593740eb90e0dc9c45005933d27c8a2/2While Onchain Gaias is still early on in its development, the project has already published two whitepapers that illuminate its plans going forward. The first whitepaper, published in April 2024, introduced the foundational concepts of Onchain Gaias and outlined the project's core vision and mechanisms, centered around General Artificial Intelligence Agents (GAIAs) and their role in decentralizing AI development.In short, the paper proposed a network where AI models could be trained through gaming, leveraging blockchain tech for transparency and security. It also outlined the basics of a modular gaming engine system and a marketplace for AI models. via https://zora.co/collect/base:0x3a56ed006593740eb90e0dc9c45005933d27c8a2/2The second whitepaper, published in May 2024, built upon these initial concepts and introduced more detailed plans and innovations like the Onchain General Intelligence Network plus the Armory Marketplace (Intelligence-as-a-Service) and Foundry Marketplace (Transfer Learning as a Service) platforms. The second paper also explained incentives and governance plans and clarified that only Onchain Gaias NFT holders would be able to create and earn from cloning AI agents within this new ecosystem.What Is the 1st Onchain Gaias Game?via https://x.com/jsgraff/status/1793678660597420312Currently, the Onchain Gaias team is in the initial “experiment and see what works” phase of its gaming ecosystem. Toward that end, it has already rolled out its first initial training title in Henlo Kart.Deployed entirely within a Farcaster Frame on Warpcast, Henlo Kart is a racing game designed to train primitive AI agents onchain through user interactions. via https://warpcast.com/ciniz/0xa1c9207bSimply put, players place wagers, gain experience points (XP), and earn levels, all of which help improve the capabilities of AI agents beneath the surface. Additionally, players are set to receive an allocation of a presently undisclosed token upon its future release. As the Onchain Gaias team continues to iterate, expect more optimized versions of Henlo Kart to roll out, plus more sophisticated and community-built games to emerge, further expanding the capabilities and possibilities around GAIAs.What to Watch Going Forward?Onchain Gaias is a one-of-a-kind project right now, but it’s also just beginning to dig into its ambitious development plans, so there’s lots of work left to do for the project to actualize its full vision. That said, if you’re interested in tracking the team’s progress, some big outstanding questions will be worth monitoring going forward. 10 of the main ones that come to mind presently are as follows:How will the community and market react to the final art reveal of the Onchain Gaias PFPs?How effective will Henlo Kart and subsequent games be in engaging players and training AI agents?What other projects might integrate GAIAs once there are many trained and more sophisticated agents?Is the upcoming unnamed token that has been hinted at a new fungible utility token for the wider Onchain Gaias ecosystem?How will any added tokenomics influence player participation, agent training, and overall market dynamics?How will continued advances around Farcaster tooling impact the overall growth and innovation around the platform?Will the planned reward mechanisms be sufficient to maintain long-term engagement and participation?How will the Armory and Foundry Marketplaces develop, and what kinds of AI models will gain the most prominence?Will Onchain Gaias release its own Layer 3 (L3) on top of Base as its onchain infra demands increase?Can Onchain Gaias achieve or surpass the training efficiency and intelligence levels of well-known AI agents in the public domain?Why Onchain Gaias MattersOnchain Gaias has the potential to become the most dominant PFP project on Base for the foreseeable future, yet its prospects are bigger than vanilla PFP projects. The fusion of AI, Farcaster, and gaming creates a unique value proposition that extends beyond plain digital collectibles.Long story short, by enabling everyday users to participate in AI training through engaging games, Onchain Gaias is not just building a collection of digital art but fostering a community-driven platform that could have a big influence on the crossroads of AI and blockchain tech. If you’re hunting for Base projects to explore, this is certainly one for your shortlist!

                            Former CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo and his former chief innovation officer Daniel Gorfine say the US is falling behind in the crypto race, but could use stablecoins—and a CBDC—to protect its interests.

In this episode, Laura Shin speaks with former CFTC chairman Chris Giancarlo and former CFTC chief innovation officer Daniel Gorfine on the pressing need for the U.S. to safeguard the dollar. They explain why they believe the future of regulation is the government operating nodes on blockchains rather than regulating intermediaries, why even private USD stablecoins will want a USD central bank digital currency, and how China might export the technology behind the digital yuan—and its surveillance capabilities—to other countries. They also touch on how the upcoming U.S. elections could influence crypto policy, why stablecoins are more than just trading instruments, and what the U.S. must do to maintain its financial leadership.
Show highlights:

How governments should embrace blockchain technology to become better at its job, according to Chris
How the financial system needs to change for the younger generations
Whether the U.S. is losing ground in terms of innovation
Why Daniel thinks stablecoins are much more than a trading instrument for crypto
Why Daniel believes that the U.S. is making the regulation of stablecoins “far more complicated than it needs to be”
How Singapore is already giving licenses to USD stablecoin issuers
Whether the dollar should be trademarked to protect it
How Tether has become one of the most profitable companies per employee in history without being under U.S. jurisdiction
Who should be the next chair of the SEC and the need to regulate DeFi in order for it to become mainstream
Why Daniel thinks that some of the criticism of the FIT21 bill “doesn’t hold water”
Why Chris believes that China is lying about not intending to export the technology behind the digital yuan
Whether algorithmic stablecoins should be banned, as proposed in the Lummis-Gillibrand bill

FTX Might Settle Its $24 Billion IRS Tax Bill for $200 Million - Decrypt

Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX might be able to settle a $24 million claim from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for $200 million. This settlement is still pending court approval, but would resolve one of the thornier disputes and bigger claims amounting to billions of dollars.FTX, once a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following a dramatic collapse. The company faced a liquidity crisis triggered by a surge in customer withdrawals and revelations of financial mismanagement. At its peak, FTX was the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, but the fallout exposed a substantial financial black hole, leading to its downfall and subsequent legal challenges.The IRS had initially filed claims against FTX exceeding $44 billion, later adjusted to $24 billion. The proposed settlement significantly reduces these claims, with the IRS set to receive a $200 million priority claim and a $685 million junior subordinated claim. These claims will be addressed as part of FTX's proposed reorganization plan, which is scheduled for a court hearing on June 25.In a June 3 court filing, John J. Ray III, the CEO overseeing FTX's restructuring, emphasized that the settlement represents a crucial step towards resolving the bankruptcy efficiently. “Together, starting in the most challenging financial disaster I have seen, the debtors and their creditors have created enormous value from a situation that easily could have been a near-total loss for customers,” Ray stated.The reorganization plan aims to repay creditors and customers as swiftly as possible, with the expectation that over 90% of assets could be returned by mid-2024. This settlement not only mitigates extensive litigation costs but also provides a clear path forward for FTX's numerous creditors.The fallout from FTX's collapse has been extensive, impacting numerous stakeholders and triggering broader regulatory scrutiny across the cryptocurrency industry. The company's founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found guilty of fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering charges in connection with the exchange's demise.Editor’s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

According to CoinGlass, the volume of derivatives trading on the popular cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA) has increased by 28.9% over the past 24 hours. Thus, as the data reports, perpetual futures on the Cardano token reached $362.30 million over the past 24 hours. Moreover, according to CoinMarketCap, the volume of ADA trading on spot markets among all exchanges amounted to $306.29 million during the period under review. Thus, the total trading volume of Cardano token on spot and derivatives markets amounted to $668 million over the past day. It is interesting to note that unlike the futures market for the Cardano token, the volume on the spot market did not increase over the 24-hour period but actually decreased slightly. This suggests that ADA trading was mainly on the open futures market and was more speculative than investing in nature. Cardano (ADA) price outlookAnd there is plenty of room for speculation with Cardano. Looking at the price chart of ADA, we can see that first, the price of the token increased today, and second, it reached the key level of $0.46, which unfortunately it could not overcome. ADA to USD by CoinMarketCapThis zone represents a strong price ceiling for the popular cryptocurrency, which it has not been able to break for a long time. Against this backdrop, jokes even began to appear that ADA is a stablecoin that costs $0.45. If Cardano is able to break through this mark, or rather ADA buyers bring the token to the zone above, the jokes would quickly end.

Indian Election Result Sends Equity Market Crashing With Uncertain Implications for Crypto Legislation

While Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies are poised to return to power, they didn’t hit the supermajority mark of 370 plus seats in India’s 543-seat lower house of parliament, which they predicted. In fact, the BJP alone did not hit the halfway mark of 272, which it had comfortably crossed in the 2019 election. The result hands kingmaking power to his allies, and the opposition led by the Indian National Congress could attempt to lure them away.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) was subjected to a major downtrend as market investors failed to hang onto the hype within the ecosystem on updates from lead developer Shytoshi Kusama. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is changing hands for $0.00002401, down by 4.89% in the past 24 hours.As Shiba Inu struggles to find its feet, three major on-chain metrics are worth watching closely.Shiba Inu reboot missionWhile some investors focus primarily on price trends, a lot of other key ecosystem stakeholders focus on network actions, which generally determine the potential for long-term upsurges.One of these is the profitability of SHIB. Per data from IntoTheBlock, a little more than 60% of addresses on the network accounting for 806,850 SHIB wallets are in profit at the moment.With only 36.36%, or 475,260, Addresses out of the money, long-term investors are optimistic that SHIB remains in a bullish spot, with its more than 129% growth in the year-to-date (YTD) factored in. Besides this, the Shiba Inu correlation with Bitcoin (BTC) is also a major factor to note.As long as Bitcoin remains in good terrain owing to the accumulation of spot BTC ETF products, Shiba Inu may also maintain a fairly strong resilience. Lastly, Shiba Inu holders' composition time speaks volumes about the emancipation of the digital currency.Per the IntoTheBlock data, over 76% of current Shiba Inu holders have held it for more than one year. Those holding for 1-12 months are worth 21%, while those holding for less than one month are about 3%. With this composition, should short-term holders choose to liquidate their holders, the impact may not weigh the token down very much.Shiba Inu fundamentals Besides the technical validation that is showing SHIB's retention, the trend on Shibarium and the expectations of network growth have helped sustain the optimism for the token overall.From the Shibarium hardfork to the many listings of the Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens, the question of SHIB's rebound is a matter of if and not when.

Donald Trump Claims Profit From 'Crazy New Currencies' - Here's A Look At The Cryptos He Own - Benzinga

In 2021, former president Donald Trump called crypto a "disaster waiting to happen" and declared he was "not a fan." However, Trump's stance on crypto has reversed in the years since. In 2024, he has repeatedly spoken about crypto more positively. "The Democrats are very much against it [crypto]. And I say this, a lot of people are very much for it … and I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid … but I’m good with it. If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, you better vote for Trump," Trump said at an NFT event at Mar-a-Lago in May. Don't Miss:Additionally, Trump appeared on CNBC in March to discuss his views on crypto, stating, "I make money with it, I have fun with it too. Crazy new currencies, that's what I call them. They’re crazy new currencies, whether it’s Bitcoin or others." Trump has been making money from crypto over the past few years through various projects. Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics company, discovered Trump's wallet address by cross-referencing on-chain data with his financial filings.Many of his crypto holdings come from multiple NFT projects that have used his name, image, and likeness to market and sell NFTs. These NFTs, called Trump Digital Trading Cards, are priced at $99 each and have sold over 90,000 in total. Trump has received over 1,900 ETH from these projects. However, in December 2023, he sold 1,075 ETH for proceeds of $2.4 million. He currently holds nearly 850 ETH, worth around $3.1 million.However, the largest holdings in Trump's portfolio are memecoins. A growing trend has been to send a large portion of the total supply of a token to a celebrity. Shiba Inu first popularized this idea by sending half of the token supply to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. The idea has since taken off, with Trump benefiting in the tens of millions. Trending: Holding 0.001 Bitcoin could make you a multimillionaire, according to Fidelity director — but for how long?Trump's largest memecoin position is MAGA Coin (TRUMP). When the project launched, the founders sent Trump 580,000 tokens, worth just a few thousand dollars at the time. However, the position has since ballooned to nearly $8.5 million, as TRUMP has risen from less than $0.01 to over $17.50 in less than a year.Additionally, Trump owns half the supply of TROG, a frog-themed memecoin. Though the project is relatively small, owning half the supply means Trump holds over $7 million in TROG. Trump holds over 50 other memecoins in his portfolio, but none of the tokens amount to anything significant. In total, Trump holds over $20 million in crypto assets. Read Next:

Four Satoshi Era Bitcoin Miner Wallets Revive to Make This Suprising Move

In a remarkable turn of events, four Bitcoin miner addresses, dormant for more than a decade, have suddenly sprung to life. This activity coincided with Bitcoin's price surge past the $70,000 mark in Monday's trading session.On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain reported that "After the Bitcoin price broke through $70,000, 4 miner addresses that had been dormant for 11 years transferred 100 $BTC ($7 million) out."Bitcoin temporarily surpassed $70,000, reaching a high of $70,295 on June 3, as crypto investment products saw inflows for the fourth straight week amid the recent GameStop frenzy. Crypto asset inflows totaled $185 million in the week ending May 31, according to a recent CoinShares report. In May, investors invested $2 billion in digital asset investment products, including in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.Traders believe that the rise in GameStop shares caused by the Reddit account behind the 2021 meme-stock craze may have also helped the BTC price increase.According to Lookonchain, these four miner addresses, which had been inactive since 2013, transferred out a total of 100 BTC, valued at approximately $7 million. Each address had previously earned 25 BTC through mining activities in 2013, a time when the digital currency was still in its infancy and the mining rewards were substantially higher.The timing of the 25 BTC transfer by each of the wallet addresses is particularly noteworthy. Lookonchain highlighted that one of the miner addresses made its move on March 13, transferring 100 BTC right after Bitcoin breached the $70,000 threshold, suggesting a strategic decision to capitalize on the price peak.At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 0.83% in the last 24 hours to $69,812, having stopped short of the $70,000 mark in today's trading session. The lead cryptocurrency attained highs of $69,997 on Coinbase, just a hair's breadth away from the golden $70,000 mark.

Dogecoin Whales Signal Bullish Sentiment, Stack Up 200 Million DOGE


																Despite the renewed hype surrounding meme coins, the OG Dogecoin’s price action has remained relatively dull. But whales appear to be bullish on the asset’s price trajectory as they continue to rake in tokens.
According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, large holders or whales have been actively accumulating Dogecoin over the past five days. Martinez stated that such entities have added a staggering 200 million DOGE to their holdings, signaling a significant accumulation phase since May 30.
Dogecoin has been consolidating within a tight range during this period. After briefly touching highs of $0.174 on May 26, the meme coin declined and has been trading near the $0.16 level.
While a trend reversal is less likely to occur, this hasn’t fazed DOGE whales to amass tokens.
In fact, large investors have been accumulating DOGE for quite some time now. Specifically, during the period from May 29th to May 31st, these entities purchased over 700 million DOGE tokens. Based on the current market price of Dogecoin, the total value of this acquired DOGE stash is approximately $112 million.




But not everyone is a fan of the meme coin. At the Consensus 2024 conference, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse voiced strong criticisms against Dogecoin, raising doubts about the token’s contributions to the cryptocurrency industry.
Garlinghouse stressed that cryptocurrencies should strive to address real-world problems, which he believes Dogecoin fails to achieve.
According to the exec, Dogecoin’s appeal stems more from speculative fervor than practical use cases. A similar stance was echoed by several market experts who believe that this cohort of tokens dwarfs the efforts of teams focused on developing legitimate products that could potentially drive progress in the industry.

Brad Garlinghouse Says Crypto Regulatory Progress More Likely To Happen After 2024 Elections - The Daily Hodl


								Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse is “a little bit skeptical” that landmark crypto legislation will be passed in the US before the presidential election in November.
In a new interview with CNBC, Garlinghouse acknowledges that the Biden Administration has been “softening” its rhetoric against crypto, but he still thinks real regulatory developments probably won’t happen until 2025.










“As we all have seen, the wheels of legislative progress move slowly and carefully. I’m thrilled by the progress that we’ve made, even in the last three weeks, and I think it may have been the most important two or three weeks in the US crypto evolution ever, but I still think getting the legislation passed may require [waiting until] after the election, maybe before the end of the year. More likely the first half of next year.”
Last week, President Joe Biden followed through on a promise to veto a piece of crypto legislation that recently passed the House and Senate.
The bill would have reversed guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that says certain companies should label crypto assets as liabilities on their balance sheet, even if the firms are holding the assets on behalf of customers.
The Republican-led legislation passed the House in a 228 to 182 vote, with 21 Democrats voting for it. The bill then passed the Senate 60 to 38, with 11 Democrats joining forces with Republicans.

These 3 Interesting Stocks are Seeing Heavy Short Interest in June 2024 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Following the GameStop (NYSE: GME) short squeeze extravaganza over the last month, traders are looking into similar candidates for stock volatility. Conditions creating these events are now more pressing. At the end of May, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported the lowest seasonal demand level for diesel since 1998.



Given diesel’s prolific usage in trucks and trains, this suggests an economic slowdown, aligning with slower GDP growth and slower consumer spending. Conversely, an economic downturn is poised to have a greater effect on companies with weaker fundamentals. Ahead of this, short sellers would bet on their stock prices to fall.



With the potential for market pessimism getting higher, triggering more volatility, which stocks have highest short interest in the short term?



SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) – 88.66% float shorted



In March, a hailstorm devastated Fort Bend County farm’s thousands of solar panels. This was just one recent instance showcasing the fragility and unreliability of solar power on a mass scale.



In turn, the narrative is shifting towards nuclear power as the cleanest and densest form of energy. Even Larry Fink of BlackRock, having pushed the ESG framework for years, warned that “the world is going to be short power…you need dispatchable power” in the age of growing data centers for generative AI.



These trends point to de-prioritizing SunPower’s business model, centered around residential solar solutions. The company is scheduled to report its earnings tomorrow, on June 5th. In the last Q4 ‘23 report in February, SunPower exited the year with a net loss of $247 million, depleting its cash reserves to $87.4 million from $123.7 million in a year-ago quarter.



Presently, SPWR stock is holding at $2.97, under its 52-week average of $5.30 per share. This price aligns with the Nasdaq average target of $3.07 per share. Over the last month, SPWR shares are up 27%.





Arbor Realty Trust (NASDAQ: ABR) – 43.56% float shorted



Normally, a real estate investment trust (REIT) would be a good bet for steady dividend income, owing to the requirement to pay out at least 90% of taxable profits in dividends. Arbor has a dividend yield of 12.22% at $1.72 annual payout per share.



However, if the market downturn is on the horizon, this would translate to a higher unemployment rate, decreased housing demand, increased loan defaults, and ultimately, the fall of housing prices. This would negatively affect Arbor Realty’s bottom line as a multifamily and single-family rental.



Moreover, as of May 28th, 2024, investigative firm Viceroy Research issued another dire report on Arbor’s financial status. This includes extended financing to delinquent customers at the firm’s expense. Owing to impairments and delinquency risks, the report concluded with the following warning.




“There is no rate cut large enough, no rate caps cheap enough, and no investors dumb enough to save Arbor.”




However, given that Viceroy Research is a short seller, it may paint such a picture for its own benefit. Over the last month, ABR stock has been up 6.3%. At the present price of $13.83, ABR shares are not far from their 52-week average of $14.11. Nasdaq’s forecasting data puts the average ABR price target in the present range at $13.45 per share.







ImmunityBio (NASDAQ: IBRX) – 38.02% float shorted



As one of many penny biotech stocks, ImmunityBio received positive news in April following the FDA’s approval of Anktiva for treating non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). This is in combination with the company’s Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.



In other words, ImmunityBio’s short  interest is more related to its borderline penny stock status, and accompanying volatility, rather than on weak fundamentals. From the last in-depth coverage of ImmunityBio earlier in May, IBRX stock is down 32%, from $8.12 to present $6.15 per share.



Placed into context, IBRX stock is up 62% over the last six months, while down 32% over the last month. Nasdaq’s average IBRX price target is now in sync with the price, at $6 per share.

Andrew Left of Citron Research gets torched by GME… again


Andrew Left, the man synonymous with short-selling outfit Citron Research, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to complain about the ongoing antics of Keith Gill (aka RoaringKitty/DeepFuckingValue).
Left, who successfully shorted Chinese frauds and called out Evergrande years before its eventual collapse, has earned the ire of retail investors since he attempted to short-sell GameStop in 2021 and walked away with a near 100% loss.
In the wake of the 2021 run-up in the price of GameStop stock and the failed attempt to short it, Left — once colloquially known as the ‘Bounty Hunter of Wall Street’ — claimed that his firm would no longer be short-selling, choosing instead to “focus on giving long side multibagger opportunities for individual investors.” It appears as though he’s since abandoned this focus on the long side.

Read more: Opinion: Roaring Kitty looks to have returned as a pump-and-dumper
The definition of insanity
After Left got torched on his GME short in 2021, few expected him to come back to announce another short position on the exact same company this year after it rallied from $10 to $65.
Left announced a short position on May 16 when GameStop was trading around $27. Providing he wasn’t margin called when GME briefly rose to $40, it could turn out that he’s once again in profit. However, considering the tone of Citron Research’s tweets, it seems unlikely.
Left has claimed that Gill likely received outside funding for his huge long position and call options purchases, but has also recently admitted that he doesn’t “think anything [Roaring Kitty] did was illegal.”
Gill’s return has left both GameStop advocates and skeptics scratching their respective heads and many have suggested he’s sold his accounts — albeit without any evidence to prove it. However, it seems more likely that it’s Gill posting and making millions of dollars on longing the same stock he did three years ago.

Binance Users Lose Millions After Accounts Hacked, Billionaire Investor Chamath Palihapitiya Issues $500K per BTC Prediction: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


U.Today has prepared the top three news stories over the past day.Binance users lose millions after accounts hackedWu Blockchain, an X account devoted to covering crypto news mainly in Asia, has recently reported several cases of account hacks, the victims of which were Binance users. As a result of these hacks, users lost millions of dollars. The first case tells the story of a Chinese user, Nakamao, who downloaded a KOL-promoted Google plugin titled Aggr; after doing that, his account fell short of $1 million. The attack took place on May 24 and was facilitated through cross-trading, a technique where hackers exploit hijacked cookies to bypass password and two-factor authentication verification. Another Binance user was robbed of his funds on March 1, with hackers using the same method of hijacked cookies. After the incident, Nakamao conducted an investigation with a security company and found out several alarming details that raised concerns about Binance's security measures. For example, Binance allegedly knew about the hacker and the compromised plugin for weeks, but chose not to act right away, which resulted in further financial losses. The news gained significant attention from the crypto community, with many questioning Binance's ability to safeguard their assets.Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya makes case for Bitcoin to $500KIt has been several weeks since the fourth Bitcoin halving event took place, but industry leaders have not stopped speculating about the potential future price trajectory for the asset. Among those deciding to share his opinion on what the future holds for Bitcoin is billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya. In a video shared by Altcoin Daily, Palihapitiya drew attention to the fact that BTC usually records major growth about 12 to 18 months after the halving event. The first halving cycle scored its first most significant upsurge after six months, with over 10.67x growth. The second and third halving cycles also recorded growth but more mildly, with 1.34x and 1.79x surges, respectively. The first halving's growth trend persisted, but roughly 18 months following the halving event, the second and third halvings experienced the largest surges of 27.92x and 7.80x, respectively. Considering all that, per Palihapitiya's analysis (which, according to his words, does not constitute financial advice), if Bitcoin's price follows the pattern exhibited by cycles two and three, it could top $500,000 by October 2025.SHIB burn rate skyrockets 348% as price strives to break outAs the SHIB army is continuing incinerating meme tokens, the SHIB price keeps making attempts to break out. According to data provided by the Shibburn platform, a total of 21,508,945 SHIB was sent to dead-end wallets over the past day, which helped increase the Shiba Inu burn rate by more than 348%. The biggest amount of SHIB tokens was destroyed by an anonymous crypto whale; in a single transaction, he burned an enormous 21,315,658 SHIB. The second largest transaction carried only 100,000 meme coins. When it comes to Shiba Inu's price, it managed to go up by 3.79% yesterday, rising from $0.00002430 to the $0.00002511 price mark. However, at the moment of writing, SHIB lost most of its gains and is currently changing hands at $0.00002423, down by 2.40% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin ETFs See $2.4 Billion Inflows in Last 3 Weeks


Bitcoin ETFs are gaining momentum, with reports indicating up to $105 million in positive flows on Monday. This brings the cumulative inflows to nearly $2.40 billion in the last three weeks.
Experts ascribe the inflows to increased global liquidity, which can boost the Bitcoin price by improving market sentiment.
Bitcoin ETFs Demand Returns with $105 Million Inflows on Monday
Bitcoin ETFs market rebound continues to strengthen, with reports showing $105 million inflows on June 3. This marks 15 consecutive trading days (three weeks) of positive flows and brings the cumulative inflows to $2.40 billion, as the on-chain data platform SpotOnChain shows.
Fidelity took the day with its Bitcoin ETF, FBTC, recording up to $77 million (over 1,110 BTC) in inflows on Monday.  Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC and BlackRock’s IBIT recorded zero net flows the same day. Bitwise ETF, BITB, recorded $14 million in inflows, while Ark21Shares’ ARKB ETF saw up to $10 million in positive flows.

The spike in inflows coincides with an increase in global liquidity. Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo highlights that the relationship between BTC price and M2 expansion reflects broader market sentiment and economic conditions.

A high M2 expansion indicates a loose monetary policy and increased money supply. In response, Bitcoin’s price often rises as investors seek alternative assets for potential returns.
Notably, Bitcoin’s price usually reacts positively to increases in the money supply and inflation concerns. This happens as investors see BTC as a hedge against traditional fiat currencies such as the US dollar, which could depreciate because of inflation.
BTC Price is in the Accumulation Phase
Bitfinex analysts noted in a Monday market update that Bitcoin ETF inflows for the last two weeks have averaged $136M [million] per day. “This is 4x the $32M daily sell pressure from miners,” they said, observing that Bitcoin is in an accumulation period. 
The analysts also highlighted that the correction phase could be nearing its end. They ascribed the recent drop from $73,777 to selling activity among long-term holders. The report indicates that long-term holders have started to re-accumulate BTC for the first time since December 2023. 
Investor confidence has risen since the April 20 Bitcoin halving, reinforcing the bullish thesis. This can be seen in the surge in Bitcoin’s realized capitalization, approaching $600 billion.

The BTC Realized Cap metric shows Bitcoin’s true value based on the price at which coins last moved. It provides a unique perspective on market dynamics, investor behavior, and historical trends within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Bitcoin Dynamics Outlook Amid Shifting Investor Sentiment
The Bitcoin price has continued to consolidate along an ascending trend line since May 1, with a series of higher lows. Standing 22% above the range low of $56,552, BTC looks primed for more gains as it attempts to break consolidation.
Tailwinds sprout from a buy signal executed when the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crosses above the signal line (yellow band). Traders heeding this call could see Bitcoin’s price head north. The Awesome Oscillator’s position in positive territory reveals bullish sentiment, adding credence to the bullish thesis.
On the flip side, the volume profile shows that while there is a lot of bullish activity (orange nodes) waiting to interact with Bitcoin price at current levels, there is even more bearish activity (grey nodes). With this, the bulls must haul BTC above the $72,149 threshold for Bitcoin price to escape the thicket.

A drop below $67,594 could trigger panic selling, potentially pushing the price down to $65,000. If that level doesn’t hold, Bitcoin could revisit the $61,169 support level, presenting a potential buying opportunity for investors.

In a dire case where bearish momentum abounds, a candlestick close below $56,000 would invalidate the bullish outlook. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price is trading at $69,429.

You May Not Like It, but Casey Rodarmor Proves Bitcoin Is Permissionless

That said, Rodarmor readily acknowledged that Runes, his latest project, launched to coincide with the Bitcoin halving event on April 19, 2024, is decidedly less important than Bitcoin itself. He referred to the protocol, which enables the creation of tradable assets on Bitcoin similar to tokens on Ethereum, as a “sideshow.”

FTX and IRS reach settlement for approximately $885M - Blockworks


The FTX estate and the Internal Revenue Service proposed a settlement that would see the bankrupt exchange’s estate pay the government nearly $1 billion. 
The sum, which totals $885 million, is a far cry from the $24 billion originally sought by the IRS. 
As part of the proposed plan, the debtors will pay the IRS $200 million within 60 days of confirmation. The other $685 million will be paid “to the extent of funds available in accordance with the settlement.”
Meaning that the claim is on the lower priority list, and other claims will be paid out first. 
There’ll be a hearing on the motion held on June 25 before Judge John Dorsey, the judge overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings. 
The FTX debtors pushed back against the $24 billion claim by the government tax agency last December, warning that FTX — while operational — “never earned anything anywhere near amounts that could support the IRS claims for $24 billion in taxes.”
Read more: FTX bankruptcy almost across the finish line
And that number was actually cut in half by the agency itself, which originally alleged that it was owed nearly $44 billion in taxes. 
The proposed settlement clears yet another hurdle in FTX’s path to winding down its bankruptcy. 
Later this month, a hearing will be held to cover the estate’s proposed reorganization plan. 
The estate announced in early May that it cobbled together between $14.5 and $16 billion to pay back creditors. But the plan has drawn mixed reviews from critics.
Some creditors are unhappy that their claims will only be paid out according to November 2022 prices. An aspect of the plan that was challenged at the beginning of the year, though Judge Dorsey said that the code is “very clear.”

Bitcoin Boom In Bangkok: Ultra-Rich Get Exclusive Access To New ETF


								Thailand has taken its first tentative steps into the world of Bitcoin with the launch of a unique exchange-traded fund (ETF) aimed at high net-worth individuals and institutions. This comes amidst a global surge in interest in cryptocurrencies, but with Thai regulators taking a cautious approach, prioritizing security and controlled access for beginners.

Limited Access For The Privileged Few
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given its nod to the ONE Bitcoin ETF Fund of Funds Unhedged, offered by One Asset Management (ONEAM), Thailand-headquartered daily Bangkok Post disclosed, Tuesday. Unlike traditional ETFs accessible to the general public, this one comes with a hefty entry barrier.
Only accredited investors, a category encompassing institutions and wealthy individuals, can participate. This restricted access reflects a common theme in Asia, where regulators are taking a measured approach to Bitcoin. While China has cracked down heavily, others like South Korea and Japan have implemented stricter know-your-customer (KYC) regulations and listing requirements for crypto exchanges.
Security First: Bitcoin Wrapped In A Safety Net
The ONEAM ETF offers a twist on the typical investment model. Instead of directly holding the top crypto, the fund invests in a basket of 11 well-established global Bitcoin funds. This “fund-of-funds” structure aims to mitigate risks associated with individual trading platforms, which have faced issues like data breaches and stolen digital assets in the past.

BTCUSD trading at $68,940 on the 24-hour chart: TradingView.com
Furthermore, the ETF emphasizes secure storage practices, employing international standards and custodians used by institutional investors. These custodians store Bitcoin offline, significantly reducing the vulnerability to online attacks.
A Diversification Play
For accredited investors, the allure of Bitcoin lies in its potential to diversify their portfolios. The coin’s price movements tend to have a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This means that including a small allocation of BTC can help reduce overall portfolio volatility.
Despite its potential benefits, the SEC acknowledges the inherent risks of investing in crypto. Bitcoin’s history is marked by high volatility, with significant price swings. To manage this risk, ONEAM recommends a cautious approach, suggesting investors allocate only 5% of their portfolio to Bitcoin.

A Measured Step Forward For Thailand
Thailand’s foray into Bitcoin ETFs represents a calculated move by regulators. It acknowledges the growing interest in cryptocurrency but prioritizes protecting less sophisticated investors. The limited access and focus on secure storage reflect this cautious approach.
This stands in contrast to some other Asian markets, like Hong Kong, which recently approved ETFs that directly invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially opening the doors to a wider range of investors.

Popcat Meme Coin Nears New All-Time High - Is Sealana The Next Crypto To Explode?


This article was paid for*
Meme coin Popcat is back to its bullish ways and gearing up to hit a new all-time high. 
According to the data from CoinGecko, the POPCAT price has surged to trade at $0.505, up 13% over the past 24 hours. The meme coin’s market capitalization is hovering just under the $500 million mark. 

This third-largest cat-themed meme coin is also seeing impressive daily volume, which currently stands at $48 million. 
With large-cap cryptocurrencies displaying consolidatory price action, investors are eyeing mid-caps such as Popcat for profitable returns. 
New low-cap Solana meme coins are also in significant demand. For instance, Sealana has raised over $3 million in its presale and is being viewed as the next 100x meme coin by experts. 
Is a New All-Time High Imminent for Popcat?
Popcat’s current all-time high stands at $0.71, which it had reached last month on May 4th. 
Experts believe that the meme coin could push towards new highs over the coming days. 
In a recent X post, crypto analyst RookieXBT claims that a big month is ahead for Popcat. He reveals that $0.55 is the key resistance for the token that is standing between it and a new all-time high. 

RookieXBT further claims that Popcat could display a similar explosive price action to Dogwifhat post-breakout. Indeed, Wif rallied from $0.45 to $5 in just 35 days. 
He is not the only one drawing comparisons between the two meme coins. Experts continue to highlight that the Popcat price chart looks “extremely bullish” and the token could see a significant repricing in the coming days. 

The bulls would hope for additional support from Solana. Indeed, Solana meme coins receive a major boost from SOL’s bullish strength, often acting as a leveraged bet on the native token. 
Solana looks poised for its next upside move. SOL has shown enough bullish strength to successfully retest the $160 support and is now bouncing back up as a result.
The SOL/ETH trading pair is also showing strength and could result in Solana rallying, at least until the spot Ethereum ETFs start to trade. 

Is Sealana The Next To Explode?
Popcat is not the only Solana meme coin that experts are bullish on. Sealana ($SEAL) has already gained favourable footing amongst smart-money traders during its ongoing presale, many of whom believe it to be the next 100x meme coin.

VIDEO

The Sealana presale has already raised over $3 million in the first few weeks, a sign of its high upside potential. 
Similar to Dogwifhat, $SEAL has attracted the attention of meme coin investors through its mascot. Notably, crypto whales believe that meme coins that can make investors laugh will likely deliver outsized returns. It is worth remembering that several hedge funds invested in Wif because “the dog had a hat”.
Therefore, one look at the Sealana X account is enough to understand the strong demand for the new meme coin. In one post, its mascot – a chubby and patriotic seal – is throwing a raging frat party. In another, he is helping Donald Trump build his wall. 

Aside from its crowd-favourite mascot, Sealana’s simplified presale model is another plus for the meme coin. Interested buyers simply need to send $SOL tokens from their wallets and receive $SEAL as an airdrop after the conclusion of the presale. 
The Sealana wallet address is 3LeVizuW3YoCnjfMfuQ22rSFQLDLdo9jXLKjyqfBU3w5.

Much-Talked about Dogecoin (DOGE) Statement from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghosue! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghosue, who has made critical comments about Dogecoin before, made new statements about DOGE.

Speaking at the Consensus 2024 conference, Garlinghouse said that Dogecoin, the largest memecoin, has no practical use and does not help the cryptocurrency industry.


Despite its significant market cap of $23.22 billion, Garlinghouse stated that DOGE has no real value but only encourages and thrives on speculation in the crypto sector.
Stating that there is no regulatory clarity for crypto in the USA at this point, Ripple CEO said that the way forward for crypto should focus on solving real problems:






“We have to be more than speculation. This sounds like a bunch of nonsense, but I'm going to say it anyway.
I don't think Dogecoin is a good thing for the industry.
I'm not anti-Dogecoin, but I don't know what the use case is. It is not even clear whether it has real value.
I see real benefit in many different chains like DOGE, and I think that's what's critical.
“Memecoins, such as Dogecoin, developed through speculation, are becoming a serious obstacle to the development of the sector.”

DOGE continues to trade at $0.159 at the time of writing.

AI sets Chainlink (LINK) price for June 30, 2024


    Chainlink (LINK), a decentralized blockchain oracle network, has been gaining traction recently due to innovative developments within its ecosystem. This momentum recently translated into a notable price increase, with LINK reaching a six-week high of nearly $18.



However, LINK recently faced a setback after encountering resistance. Currently trading 23% below its yearly high of $22.85 reached in March, analysts are debating whether this is a correction or the beginning of a new upward trend



To shed light on this, Finbold consulted artificial intelligence (AI) that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict LINK’s potential valuation at the end of the month.







AI predictions and market sentiments



LINK  price prediction. Source: CoinCodex



AI algorithms predict a bullish future for LINK’s short-term prospects. CoinCodex forecasts a potential 15% increase in Chainlink‘s price to $20.50 by June 30th, despite a Greed Index of 73 indicating a potentially overheated market.



Fueling this bullish atmosphere further, discussions and positive sentiment surrounding Chainlink are trending on Reddit.



Analysts see long-term potential



Crypto analyst Poppe also sees bullish potential for LINK. His analysis suggests a possible 300% increase against Bitcoin (BTC) by 2025, with a key breakout point after LINK/BTC surpasses $0.000447.







Additionally, Poppe predicts LINK could reach $25 or even $30 in the near future, although it may face resistance at $21 first.



As of press time, LINK was trading at $17.84, with a 24-hour decrease of almost 0.97%. Over the past month, the cryptocurrency has gained about 30%.



Overall, with bullish sentiments dominating LINK, the token’s bulls must sustain the price above the $17 support to realize steady upward momentum.



However, given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, conditions can change rapidly. It is crucial for investors to perform comprehensive research and consider all factors before making any investment decisions.

ChatGPT Down After OpenAI Expands GPT-4o Access to Free Users - Decrypt

The world's most popular AI chatbot has decided to take a break today, leaving users in a lurch. ChatGPT has been offline for a several hours, with the outage beginning early Tuesday at 00:21 PDT.The issue appears to be most prominent on mobile devices, with the ChatGPT app on Android getting stuck at the login screen, indicating that this is not a platform-wide problem.According to DownDetector, the most reported issues are with ChatGPT itself, rather than its website or app. While some users have managed to access the service, the majority are facing difficulties. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has acknowledged the issue on its status page and is currently investigating the cause.This outage comes on the heels of ChatGPT's recent expansion of GPT-4o access to free users, granting them the same capabilities as paid users. This move may have led to an influx of users, potentially overwhelming the servers. Traffic analytics site Semrush reports that ChatGPT's popularity has surged, making it the 17th most visited website globally in March, with a whopping 2.76 billion visits.Server overloads and outages are not uncommon in the world of AI tools. To mitigate this, platforms like Claude and ChatGPT often limit the number of interactions users can have with their tools. As users eagerly await the return of the leading AI assistant, it's the perfect time to try other options.Alternatives to ChatGPTFor those who absolutely need GPT-4o’s capabilities, Microsoft Copilot, which also uses GPT-4o, is currently operational and available on Windows devices. It is also integrated into Microsoft’s Edge browser, or via its standalone website, and even via a mobile app available for iOS and Android.Those willing to test other waters may want to try Claude, which offers a comparable model in terms of text generation and coding capabilities. Also, Mistral AI’s LeChat provides a robust language model for free, generating high-quality text.Another contender may be Reka AI's multimodal chatbot, which can understand visual inputs, code, and is capable of generating text with proficiency.Meta AI's multimodal large language model (LLM) is another free option, although it doesn't generate large amounts of text. It leverages the power of Llama3, the most powerful open-source LLM to date. It is also capable of generating images on the spot, which no other model or chatbot can.Those willing to get their hands dirty may want to visit Nat.dev and experiment with a bunch of models online. For those who prefer not to send their data to corporate servers, open-source models that can be run on personal computers are worth considering.Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Predicts June Stock Market Rally, Says Institutional Adoption To Propel Bitcoin to $150,000 - The Daily Hodl


								The Managing Partner and the Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors says stocks will be on the rise this month and that institutional investors will push Bitcoin (BTC) to new heights.
In a new interview with CNBC, Tom Lee says he’s targeting the $5,500 level for the S&P500 by the end of the month – about a 4.1% move from current prices.










“Inflation is coming in softer than expected and I think the job market is cooling, but not weakening dramatically. And I think that’s a good situation for equities. The sell-off in April actually hasn’t really been fully recovered. That’s why we expected a rebound in May, but I think that carries over into June. 
There’s still $6 trillion of cash on the sidelines and margin debt is still way below where it was in October of 2021, so we know investors really aren’t that long yet. So I think that comes together this month, with a pretty surprisingly robust move higher.”
Later in the interview, Lee was asked if he was willing to double down on his forecast that BTC could hit $150,000 before the end of the year.
“Yes. We’re still constructive on Bitcoin. There’s the tailwinds that are associated with having that [recent event] just take place. We also know, because of the Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund), and there have been tremendous inflows, but institutional adoption and infrastructure being built around Bitcoin is only beginning. And that makes crypto and especially Bitcoin a bona fide asset class. 
And I think that sort of widening ownership is going to be propelling Bitcoin to $150,000. And again, surprise – maybe surprising or not surprising, Bitcoin still follows math. More than 87% of the movement in Bitcoin still follows just the number of wallets and the activity per wallet and both are moving higher.”
BTC is worth $70,525 at time of writing, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin could trigger a stock market boom similar to the 1980s, says veteran trader


    Legendary trader Peter Brandt believes Bitcoin (BTC) might be on the brink of a major breakout, drawing parallels to a significant stock market surge in the mid-1980s.



According to Brandt, BTC mirrors historical patterns that preceded a prolonged bull market, suggesting Bitcoin could follow a similar trajectory.



In an X post (formerly Twitter), renowned trader Peter Brandt highlighted a striking similarity between a current Bitcoin chart and a pattern observed in the stock market during the mid-1980s, a period marked by a significant breakout. 











Brandt focuses on the Bitcoin versus M1 money supply chart (BTC/WM1NS), which compares Bitcoin’s value against the total money supply in the US economy. 



According to Brandt, the BTC/WM1NS chart mirrors a pattern seen about four decades ago when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) ignited a bull market, ending the stagflation era of the 1970s.



The bullish pattern: Inverted head and shoulders



Brandt highlights that the BTC/WM1NS chart exhibits an inverted head and shoulders pattern. This bullish formation indicates that buyers are no longer waiting for the price to revisit lows before entering the market. 



If the BTC/WM1NS chart witnesses a breakout, it would suggest that Bitcoin’s value is significantly outpacing the growing amount of US dollars.



During the 1970s, the DJIA exhibited a pattern that Brandt believes is now mirrored in Bitcoin’s performance against the increasing supply of US dollars.



The similarities in chart structure to the DJIA during the 1970s are striking, and the continuation of this inverted head and shoulders pattern could signal an impending major breakout for Bitcoin.



TechDev’s supporting analysis



Adding to the bullish sentiment, a crypto strategist TechDev, believes that BTC is gearing up for a significant price explosion. TechDev notes that Bitcoin’s trading range on the five-day chart is at its tightest level in eight years. 







The narrowing trading range suggests that an ensuing breakout will likely lead to steep and rapid rallies. He also highlights the BTC versus M1 money supply chart, recently witnessed a “textbook breakout.”



This breakout, TechDev asserts, could ignite a parabolic surge, potentially ending this cycle with a blow-off top similar to those seen during the 2017, 2015, and 2013 bull markets.



BTC price analysis



At press time, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $70,784, showing a 24-hour increase of 2.5%.

With patterns reminiscent of historical market breakouts and technical indicators suggesting bullish momentum, Bitcoin could be on the verge of a significant surge. 



The next few months will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin will meet these optimistic predictions and potentially reshape the financial landscape.

Ukraine police raid criminal crypto call center ring


Ukraine National Police have raided a criminal call center network that promised phony crypto investments to unsuspecting victims, seizing luxury cars and arresting an individual with links to a so-called ‘thief in law.’ 
According to a translated announcement from Ukrainian police on Monday, authorities detained 14 suspects accused of defrauding victims across Ukraine, Moldova, Kazakhstan, and the European Union. 
Following 40 searches across Ukraine, authorities seized 12 luxury cars, 136 units of computer equipment, 951 SIM cards, and funds totaling $64,500.
As part of the operation, scammers called victims pretending to be employees at a stock exchange and, using ‘psychological techniques,’ persuaded them to invest personal funds into crypto. They then transferred the stolen funds to criminally controlled digital wallets and bank cards.

Footage shared by Ukraine police of the raids against members of the crypto scam call centre.

Two detained suspects, a 49-year-old and a 51-year-old, are believed to have organized the network of call centers and hired the 12 other members. 
Each accomplice is said to have had their patch entrusted to them and been given responsibility for planning the fraud, hiring personnel, and gathering information on their ‘clients.’ They additionally distributed funds among their group with police claiming that some decided to replenish the ‘criminal community.’
Authorities claim an organizer of the Ukraine crypto call center worked as a confidant for a so-called ‘thief in law’ nicknamed ‘Khmyelo.’ The term thief in law is taken from the Russian ‘Vory v Zakone,’ and is a slang term for a senior member of a criminal organization.

Top Altcoins Traders Are Bullish on Despite Price Stagnation


Despite recent price stagnation, crypto traders remain bullish on several prominent altcoins. Analysis from Santiment, a leading crypto market intelligence platform, reveals intriguing sentiment trends. 
According to Brian Quinlivan, Lead Analyst at Santiment, the data measures positive and negative commentary ratios, providing valuable insights into market sentiment.
Altcoins Traders Remain Bullish
Solana, for instance, exhibits a remarkably high bullish sentiment with a 3.03:1 positive-to-negative comment ratio. This optimism persists even as Ethereum, its primary competitor, gains more attention. 

Crypto traders continue to express confidence in Solana’s potential for another significant rally despite its recent lackluster price performance.

Similarly, XRP has shown a “lukewarm sentiment” with a 1.62:1 positive-to-negative ratio. This indicates that traders have grown somewhat impatient with its performance, much like with Cardano. 
Although this ratio was lower earlier in the year, Quinlivan maintains that the reduced volume of discussions points to waning interest over time.

Meanwhile, Dogecoin, the largest meme coin by market cap, maintains a 2.06:1 positive-to-negative ratio. Known for its volatility, Dogecoin’s sentiment often mirrors general attitudes towards meme coins rather than its own fundamentals. 

Despite minor price climbs, the overall positive sentiment suggests continued altcoin trader interest.

In the case of Shiba Inu, trailing Dogecoin as the second-largest meme coin, there is a 2.09:1 positive-to-negative ratio. This sustained positive sentiment over seven weeks is notable, given the coin’s lack of price rebound since early March. 
The recent passing of the real-life Shiba Inu, which inspired the coin, might have temporarily boosted sentiment.

Cardano presents another interesting case with a high bullish sentiment despite being one of the underperformers in 2024. With a 3.42:1 positive-to-negative ratio, traders remain hopeful about Cardano’s prospects, displaying what might be considered false optimism. 
According to Quinlivan, this discrepancy between sentiment and performance raises questions about future price movements.

Quinlivan emphasizes the importance of monitoring these sentiment trends, as they can signal potential price tops or bottoms. High ratios of positive to negative comments often precede sentiment-driven price tops, while lower ratios can indicate bottoms. 

“The higher the ratio between positive and negative comments, the more likely we are about to see a sentiment-driven price top. And on the other end, a low ratio can cause a sentiment-driven bottom,” Quinlivan said. 

In conclusion, despite price stagnation, traders remain optimistic about several altcoins. Solana, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, in particular, exhibit strong positive sentiment, while XRP and Cardano show more tempered yet still bullish outlooks.

Bitcoin Ready To Takeoff? Analyst Eyes $85,000 as Fundamentals Align


																Bitcoin prices are hovering near $70,000, bouncing from a critical dynamic support line, evident in the daily chart. Even though bulls have yet to breach $72,000 and break above March 2024 highs, traders are optimistic about what lies ahead.
Bitcoin Bulls In Charge: Analyst Targets $85,000
Taking to X, one analyst believes the world’s most valuable coin is preparing for a decisive breakout above the local resistance levels and all-time highs at around $74,000. In a post, the analyst notes that Bitcoin has been consolidating, moving sideways and even lower for the past three months since mid-March.

If buyers succeed, the near 100-day consolidation could set the base for prices to spike, ushering a “next leg higher” that would likely take BTC to $85,000. Still, even amid the optimism, traders should be cautious.

Technically, the upside momentum has been fizzling. Even with gains on June 3, buyers’ failure to confirm the gains of May 20 is slowing down the uptrend. So far, the $72,000 level on the upper hand must be conquered for any hopes of further gains. On the lower end, support lies at $66,000.

Even so, the dynamic 20-day moving average is emerging as a worthy support. Any breakout in either direction, most preferably in alignment with Q1 2024 gains, would be fundamentally driven.
Inflation, Spot BTC ETF Inflows Fanning Demand
Looking at fundamental data streaming from the United States, the stage is being set for optimistic buyers. Cooling inflation and the uptick in M2 money supply could hint that buyers are getting ready.
The United States Federal Reserve has closely monitored inflation, among other metrics. With inflation dropping, the Fed may decide to slash interest rates, fueling a bull run like it did in 2021. 

	Related Reading


Other key drivers would include the encouraging flow into spot Bitcoin ETFs. As BTC soared to register March 2024 highs, inflow spiked, driven chiefly by institutional demand. After prices broke higher on May 20, inflows have picked up momentum. 
On June 3, Lookonchain data revealed that spot BTC ETF issuers in the United States added 2,413 BTC. Grayscale’s GBTC reduced just 12 BTC.

Launching the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) in Australia and a similar product in Hong Kong and globally will only increase the demand for BTC. The newly launched IBTC spot ETF in Australia will directly hold BTC, which will be under the custody of Coinbase.

Can Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Recover From This Failure?


Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price is dropping despite the rest of the meme coins experiencing growth these past few days.
The meme coin is facing selling from its whales and very low investor participation, which might be a bane for DOGE.
Dogecoin Investors Pass

Dogecoin’s price has already failed a potential bullish outcome and could now continue slipping down that path. This is because the whale addresses are opting to sell their holdings to secure whatever profit they have and minimize their losses.
The addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE have sold off over 300 million in the past week. This supply worth nearly $50 million has brought their total holdings down to 17.36 billion DOGE.

But in addition to the whales selling, the retail investors also see little incentive in the asset. This is visible in their participation, or more accurately, in the lack thereof. 

The active addresses ratio is calculated as the active addresses divided by the addresses holding any balance. This shows that of the total investors with DOGE, what percentage is actively conducting a transaction on the network?
Currently, this ratio sits at less than 1% at 0.89%. This shows that not only are investors unsure of their profits, they are certain of the losses, keeping their participation at bay.

DOGE Price Prediction: After the Fail
Dogecoin’s price recently failed the ascending triangle pattern. This bullish continuation pattern suggested a potential 22% rally as the target, but DOGE fell even before crossing $0.190. 

The meme coin is currently changing hands at $0.159, holding above the critical support of $0.151. While this is a good sign for DOGE, the broader market bearishness might affect its ability to persist.

This could send the meme coin trickling down to $0.142 or lower.
But if the bounce-off is successful and Dogecoin’s price reclaims $0.168 as support, it could rise to $0.182. Breaching this resistance would invalidate the bearish thesis, sending DOGE towards $0.190 and higher.

Bitcoin metrics indicate return of speculative activity in crypto - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bitcoin’s market dynamics are showing early indications of renewed speculation in the crypto market, as reported by Glassnode. Long-Term Holders (LTH) are currently sitting on unrealized profits, with only a minuscule 0.03% in losses, signaling the onset of a potential bull market’s euphoric phase. Image: GlassnodeOver the past two months, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio for both Long and Short-Term Holders has balanced out, suggesting that the market has absorbed the expected profit and loss within the current price range, setting the stage for possible significant volatility ahead.A notable shift has occurred with the spending of long-dormant coins, which has led to spikes in metrics such as Realized Cap, Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), and Coindays Destroyed. However, by using an entity-adjusted variant of the Realized Cap, Glassnode filtered the actual capital inflows in Bitcoin, which currently stands at an all-time high (ATH) valuation of $580 billion.Image: GlassnodeThe “Realized Cap HODL Waves” metric reveals that 41% of network wealth is held by coins younger than three months, indicating a wealth transfer to new demand. This pattern is consistent with previous cycles, where new demand eventually accounts for over 70% of network wealth. Despite a slowdown in liquidity and speculative activity, the recent reclaiming of the $68,000 level has brought most Short-Term Holders back into profit.Moreover, the market’s consolidation just below Bitcoin’s all-time high has created a significant cluster of Short-Term Holder coins around the current spot price, highlighting substantial investment in this range and introducing the risk of heightened investor sensitivity to price fluctuations.The recent pullback to $58,000 marked a 21% correction, the largest since the FTX collapse, pushing 56% of the Short-Term Holder supply into a loss. Yet, the magnitude of unrealized loss aligns with typical bull market corrections, suggesting stabilization is on the horizon.Long-Term Holders continue to exhibit confidence, with only 4.900 BTC held at a loss, representing a mere 0.03% of their supply. This contrasts with the Short-Term Holders, who bear the brunt of market losses, especially near peak prices.Image: GlassnodeThe market is also anticipating the Mt.Gox distribution event, with the Trustee’s recent wallet consolidation signaling preparations for the return of 141,000 BTC to creditors by October. Mark Karpeles, the former CEO of Mt.Gox, confirmed the wallet movements were part of this process.

Settlement in FTX's $24 Billion Case in the US: FTT Price Sees Volatility - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX made a $24 billion agreement with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The settlement amount is a very small fraction of the original demand, paving the way for significant customer recovery.
As part of the settlement, the IRS will receive $200 million in damages in FTX's bankruptcy. This amount will be paid within 60 days from the date of entry into force of the company's proposed restructuring plan. In addition, the IRS will receive a lower priority request of $685 million. That claim is “settleable on a subordinate basis to customers and other creditors” and will be paid “to the extent funds are available,” according to a filing filed Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.


The deal resolves a key hurdle in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, potentially avoiding lengthy and unpredictable litigation between the struggling company and its largest creditor. FTX had previously argued that if a judge approved the IRS's request, it could block payments to customers.

The settlement “provides much-needed certainty as to the size of IRS Claims and allows these Chapter 11 Cases to move quickly toward resolution, allowing for expedited distribution to the Debtors' other creditors and customers,” FTX said in its filing Monday.





FTX assured its customers that it would refund them in full. While the company has disputed the $24 billion claim, it has acknowledged potential significant tax liability to the IRS and noted that the agency's allegations raise new legal questions.
The deal will go into effect after it is approved by a bankruptcy judge and the broader restructuring plan is implemented.


FTT price responded positively to the development:

Bitcoin Price Hits $71,000 as Meme Coins ORDI, DOG, and PUPS Surge - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe leading cryptocurrency is on the rise again, as Bitcoin hit its highest price in two weeks and nearing the highest point seen since April’s quadrennial halving event. It comes as Bitcoin-based fungible tokens like ORDI and DOG are surging in price, reflecting growing interest in BTC meme coins.Bitcoin rose above the $71,000 mark on Tuesday, according to Coinbase, popping as high as $71,042. At a current price of $70,885, per CoinGecko, it’s up more than 2% on the day, pushing its 30-day rise to 10%.But some of the biggest fungible tokens minted on the Bitcoin blockchain via the BRC-20 and Runes token standards are seeing much larger gains of late—including ORDI, a token that had cooled off in recent months.ORDI, which was the first token minted last year via the BRC-20 standard on Bitcoin, is up nearly 16% on the day to a current price just below $54. That’s the highest price recorded since early April, back when BRC-20 assets were broadly cooling off in anticipation of the new Runes token protocol launching alongside the April 19 halving.Now ORDI has marked a 33% jump in the last week alone, reaffirming its status as the largest Bitcoin-based fungible token by market cap at $1.13 billion. It’s the 92nd largest cryptocurrency overall by that mark, per CoinGecko.Other BRC-20 tokens are up much larger this week as well, including PUPS (up 121%) and Bitcoin Wizards (WZRD, up 136%). Meanwhile, the top Runes token has posted similar gains—and could be gunning for ORDI’s spot as the leading Bitcoin meme coin.That newcomer is DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, aka DOG, which is by far the biggest token minted on the Runes protocol so far. It was airdropped free to holders of Runestones—an NFT-like Ordinals inscription that itself was airdropped free to early Ordinals collectors—and has since grown by leaps and bounds as it challenges dog-themed meme coins on other chains.DOG is now up 11% on the day, and has more than doubled in price over the last week, up by 120% in seven days. At a current price above $0.0095, DOG has a $960 million market cap. It’s down about 2% from an all-time high price set earlier Tuesday, but doesn’t appear to have lost momentum as the price is rising once more.The token accounts for a sizable portion of the broader Runes protocol market cap, which sits at just above $2.4 billion per data from GeniiData. Runes had an explosive launch in April, but then cooled off for weeks. However, in just the last two weeks alone, we’ve seen Runes tokens collectively hit and then surpass a $1 billion market cap for the first time.None of the larger dog-themed meme coins by market cap have fared nearly as well of late. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down nearly 2% on the week, the Ethereum-based Shiba Inu (SHIB) has fallen by 6% during that span, and Solana’s BONK has plunged by 21% over the last week.DisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Trader Says Rapid, Vertical Growth Could Be Coming to Dogecoin (DOGE) Amid ‘Meme Super Cycle’ - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst predicts that Dogecoin (DOGE) will suddenly go parabolic as other memecoins are putting up massive gains.
Pseudonymous trader Kaleo tells his 641,400 followers on the social media platform X that DOGE could soar more than 220% from its current value against Bitcoin (DOGE/BTC).










“The secret about Dogecoin is, it moves sideways for extended periods, followed by rapid, vertical growth. As bullish as I am on Bitcoin, I have an insanely high conviction DOGE will outpace it. We’re in a meme super cycle. The king of memes won’t be left behind.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at his four-hour chart, the trader suggests DOGE will rally to 0.000008 BTC worth $0.55. At time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.159.
Next up, the trader says that Coq Inu (COQ), a memecoin running on the Avalanche (AVAX) network, is about to confirm a bullish reversal and print massive gains against Wrapped AVAX (COQ/WAVAX).
“Alright bros, I think it’s AVAX’s turn to have a run again on the memes. Calling a bottom here on COQ. This is a $1 billion-plus meme with a $200 million market cap. Send it with haste.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he suggests COQ/WAVAX could soon surge past its diagonal resistance. At time of writing, COQ is worth $0.000003.
Lastly, the trader predicts Bitcoin will soon hit six figures, a gain of more than 44% from its current value.
“Bitcoin: it’s time for round two. $100,000 is a magnet.”

Bitcoin Indicator Flips Bullish As Potential US Banking Crisis Looms, According to Analyst Jamie Coutts - The Daily Hodl


								Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts says a key Bitcoin (BTC) indicator is suddenly flashing bullish amid fears of another US banking crisis.
The former Bloomberg analyst tells his 18,200 followers on the social media platform X that macro conditions could soon send Bitcoin soaring.










“The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has reported that 63 US banks are on the brink of insolvent collapse. This is due to banks sitting on $517 billion in unrealized losses. Meanwhile, after some nice coiling pricing action since March, my boring Bitcoin Trend model triggers. DXY down, Yields and Corp Spreads lower. Can you smell that, son? That’s the smell of central bank liquidity in the air.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
The analyst appears to be using a combination of moving averages, the profit and loss metric, and the Slope indicator.
Coutts suggests that the banking industry’s weakness may cause the Fed to inject liquidity into the markets, which he believes would be bullish for Bitcoin.
In the May 29th Quarterly Banking Profile report, the FDIC said banks are saddled with more than half a trillion dollars in paper losses on their balance sheets, due largely to exposure to the residential real estate market.
Unrealized losses represent the difference between the price banks paid for securities and the current market value of those assets. Unrealized losses can become an extreme liability when banks need liquidity.
The FDIC said that the health of the US banking system is at no imminent risk, but warned persistent inflation, volatile market rates and geopolitical concerns continue to put pressure on the industry.
Bitcoin is trading for $70,889 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours.

Telegram's Pavel Durov Promotes Notcoin, NOT Price Rises 10%


Telegram founder Pavel Durov recently celebrated the success of Notcoin, further fueling the ongoing NOT price rally.
Durov revealed that NOT tokens donated by Notcoin’s developers grew in value four times within two weeks. The assets in his account, initially worth $6.8 million, have now surged to almost $25 million.
Durov Pumps Notcoin Once Again

Notcoin is a notorious Web3 game based on The Open Network (TON), functioning as a mini-app within Telegram. In just a few months, the project attracted over 35 million users. On May 16, it launched the long-awaited NOT token, and the asset’s market cap has already exceeded $2.5 billion.
On June 3, Notcoin achieved a significant milestone when the daily trading volume of NOT reached a record $4 billion. This surge propelled the coin into the top five most traded cryptocurrencies. Pavel Durov expressed his admiration for the project’s success.

“A month ago, Notcoin was the largest cryptocurrency community in the history of social media. Today, the Notcoin community is rivaled only by projects it inspired — similar mini apps on Telegram that are allowing tens of millions of users to benefit,” Durov wrote.

Earlier, the Notcoin team donated over 1 billion NOT tokens to Durov, valued at $6.8 million. At the current rate, these coins are now worth more than $24 million. However, Durov noted he is planning to wait to sell them, as he promised to hold the assets until their value increases x100.
Durov’s latest post triggered a 10% jump in NOT price. According to BeInCrypto data, the asset is trading at $0.024 at the time of writing.

Over the past week, the Notcoin price skyrocketed over 300%. This impressive growth was triggered by several factors, including the launch of the staking function, support from major cryptocurrency exchanges, and the developers’ plans to burn NOT tokens.
The Notcoin team fosters community enthusiasm, contributing to NOT’s rally. Recently, they announced a contest with a prize of 20 million tokens. To participate, users must submit their project vision in any format. The campaign will last until June 24.

Bitcoin: The Road to $100k - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, has outpaced every other asset class – by a lot. Bitcoin is up a mind-boggling 17,355.7% while the S&P 500 Index ETF SPY is up 223.3%. Though the run may seem long in the tooth to amateur investors, the data points to much higher prices.Bitcoin's Supply & Demand: The Perfect StormThe Halving (Supply)Earlier this year, the highly-anticipated Bitcoin halving event occurred. This is built into Bitcoin's monetary policy, increasing scarcity (supply) by reducing the number of new Bitcoin entering the market and reducing the reward for Bitcoin miners like Riot Platforms RIOT and Marathon Digital MARA. Historically, Bitcoin investors reap rewards post halving. Halving events occurred in November 2012, July 2016, and May 2020. One year later, Bitcoin's price more than doubled each time (and much more).Bitcoin ETFs Spur DemandWhile supply will be more constrained, demand for Bitcoin is near-insatiable after the launch of several spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. BlackRock BLK, the world's largest asset manager, achieved $10 billion in assets under management in it's iSHares Bitcoin ETF IBIT far faster than any ETF launch in history – a sign of immense demand.(crypto exchange giant Coinbase COIN is the custodial exchange)Governments, Companies Adopt Bitcoin Governments, States Move Toward Bitcoin HoldingsNayil Bukele, the young president of the Latin American nation El Salvador took the bold step of buying Bitcoin for his country and making it legal tender.

As a result, Bukele was victorious in attaining another presidential term.El Salvador's success is influencing asset allocators in the U.S. Last month, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board purchased $99 million worth of the IBIT ETF.Public Companies Move to "Bitcoin Standard"In late 2020, software firm MicroStrategy MSTR became the first publicly traded company to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

MSTR shares are up more than 1,000% over the past five years.Bitcoin: Hedge on Reckless Government Spending Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the support for foreign wars like the War in Ukraine, government spending has exploded over the past decade. Why is increased government spending bullish for Bitcoin? Many investors see Bitcoin as a hedge against reckless spending and inflation because of its fixed supply and built-in monetary policy.Bitcoin's Big BaseBitcoin is emerging from a multi-year base structure. Earlier this year, the Gold ETF GLD emerged from a similar base structure and trended strongly to the upside. As the Old Wall Street adage goes, "the longer the base, the higher in space."Trump & Biden Court Crypto Voters Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the leading candidates to be the next president of the United States, have not always been pro crypto. However, each candidate has pivoted their message to a more pro crypto stance in an effort to court young crypto enthusiasts. Friendlier regulation and a more open-minded view toward the crypto industry should be a bullish catalyst.Bottom LineBitcoin is the top performing asset over that past decade and has gone on a meteoric run. Nevertheless, several data points suggest Bitcoin will eclipse $100,000 by year-end.To read this article on Zacks.com click here.

GameStop Sinks After Wild Swing-Will Roaring Kitty Cash In? - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsGameStop shares fell slightly Tuesday as traders mulled new posts from Keith Gill, a meme stock influencer better known online as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue.As of this writing, GameStop shares traded nearly 4% lower on Tuesday at $27 even. The retreat followed a 30% drop on Monday after a Reddit post from Gill garnered widespread attention on Superstonk, a go-to community for people to discuss shares in the video game retailer.Reminiscent of the “GME YOLO update[s]” that Gill penned during GameStop’s meteoric run-up in 2021, the meme stock influencer posted his purported positions Sunday. Under his Reddit account DeepFuckingValue, Gill signaled he held $210 million in GameStop stock and call options.A subsequent post Monday calmed fears that Gill may have sold his GameStop positions amid a short-lived spike in the firm’s shares. Though GameStop immediately dipped from a pre-market trading price of $39.69, the value of Gill’s holdings grew by millions of dollars, according to his Reddit post.GameStop options held by Gill that anticipate the stock’s price will be above $20 by June 21 increased in value by $54.3 million that day. Based on his previous update, the influencer was nurturing a loss of $65,000 on the call options the day before, which are now worth $120 million.Gill’s GameStop shares were valued at $140 million, according to his post on Monday, netting the influencer over $33 million in total gains on paper. Showing a 31% increase relative to when Gill bought them, the influencer owns 5 million GameStop shares.Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that E*Trade is considering dropping Gill from its platform. The firm is concerned about stock manipulation in light of Gill’s recent purchases and renewed penchant for online posts, according to “people familiar with the matter.”A modern character of financial folklore, Gill’s online return reignited interest in trading GameStop shares last month when he started posting to Twitter (aka X) again after a years-long hiatus. In 2021, he became the face of a retail-led movement to bet big against Wall Street short sellers through pumping the price of GameStop, which contributed to a historic short squeeze.This time around, GameStop shares haven’t surged as high alongside Gill’s posts. Still, the price of GameStop has increased 68% over the past month from $16.31.“Someone got picked off bad, who bought GameStop at $47.50,” Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC's “Mad Money,” said on Twitter, referring to GameStop’s relative drop on Monday. The high price had been momentarily reached during intraday trading early Monday morning.Though Gill’s online return came first on Twitter, where the influencer posted a string of cryptic videos centered around movie references, his activity on the platform has trailed off since mid-May. On Sunday, however, Gill posted a photo there of a green reverse Uno card.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Mike Novogratz Predicts Bitcoin To $100K By The End Of 2024 - Benzinga

Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz has reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin, predicting a price of $100,000 by the end of 2024.In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Novogratz pointed to several catalysts driving his optimism. Regulatory Tailwinds And Increased Institutional AdoptionNovogratz sees positive developments in the regulatory landscape as a key factor. “D.C. has finally agreed in principle that crypto legislation has to happen,” he stated, highlighting the shift towards bipartisan support.He also emphasizes the growing interest from institutional investors like pension funds, suggesting a limited supply of sellers and increased buying pressure.“We’re getting skewed to the upside,” he said.Breaking $73,000: A Stepping Stone To Six Figures?Novogratz believes surpassing the current resistance level of $73,000 will be a critical step for Bitcoin BTC/USD.“If we take out $73,000 in the next week or so, we’re going to end the year at $100,000 or even higher,” he predicted. He sees this move as a natural market extension, building on the previous range of $40,000 to $70,000.Also Read: Why Bitcoin Is Stuck In A Range And What Could Change That: 10x ResearchRegulation And Infrastructure: The Next Catalysts?When pressed about potential triggers for further price increases, Novogratz pointed to two key areas: further regulatory clarity and increased involvement from traditional financial institutions.“We’re getting the regulatory clarity,” he stated, referencing recent legislative developments like the potential overturning of the S.121 bill. This, he believes, would pave the way for major banks like State Street and Bank of New York to enter the crypto custody market.The Future Of Digital Assets: Navigating A Bullish MarketWith Bitcoin seemingly poised for continued growth, staying informed remains crucial for investors. The upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event, scheduled for Nov. 19 offers a valuable platform to do just that.Read Next: Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER Meme Coin Makes Dramatic Comeback After Launch ControversyImage: Shutterstock

Ordinals and Runes are proof of Bitcoin's permissionless nature â Casey Rodarmor - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Casey Rodarmor, the creator of the controversial Ordinals and Runes protocols on Bitcoin, recently discussed his motivations and the impact of his work on the Bitcoin network at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas.Rodarmor claims that the objective of his work with Ordinals and Runes is to ensure that Bitcoin remains secure and that its applications are also secure, allowing individuals to transact and use the network as they see fit, outside of state authority and censorship.“I think the only thing that’s interesting about any sort of blockchain is the extent to which it can assist the government,” Rodarmor said.Rodarmor’s protocols have faced both enthusiasm and criticism from the Bitcoin community. Ordinals enable the creation of trackable satoshis similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain, while Runes, launched to coincide with the Bitcoin halving event on April 19, 2024, allows for the creation of tradable assets similar to tokens on Ethereum.Despite the controversy, Rodarmor maintains that his work is proof of Bitcoin’s permissionless nature, demonstrating that it is possible to build applications on the network that are as resistant to censorship as Bitcoin transactions themselves.He acknowledged that while Runes may be less important than Bitcoin itself, it provides a “niche, fun, degenerate thing” that crypto traders seem to desire, while also contributing to Bitcoin’s fee economy. Rodarmor also addressed Bitcoin’s “anarchic” governance structure, describing it as “dysfunctional” but likely the best form of governance for the network.He notes that the lack of formal governance makes some people uncomfortable, but it is this very lack of centralized control that allows for the development of protocols like Ordinals and Runes, which may not have been permitted otherwise.“What makes people uncomfortable about Bitcoin governance is that there is no formal governance, […] we actually want it to be an anarchic, messy process,” Rodarmor claimed.The historic halving event in April 2024 saw the highest fees ever paid for a Bitcoin block, at over $2.4 million in BTC. Although transaction fees have since normalized, they remain higher than the sub-dollar prices seen throughout much of 2022 and 2023.Rodarmor believes that his work contributes to the security and robustness of the Bitcoin network by attracting users and generating transaction fees, which will become increasingly important as the mining subsidy decreases over time.Despite criticism from some prominent figures in the Bitcoin community, including Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr, Rodarmor remains committed to his work as a self-described “enthusiast” developing these protocols without grants or funding. He believes that his projects give people a preview of Bitcoin’s destiny and the potential for a sustainable fee economy.

This Altcoin Is Saying Goodbye After Binance's Announcement: Users Given Deadline Until August 30th - Bitcoin Sistemi


Lugh, a European stablecoin provider, announced that it has stopped the issuance of its Euro-pegged stablecoin EURL due to the coming into force of the European Union's Crypto Asset Markets Directive (MiCA).
According to the statement made on its website, the company guarantees the repurchase of existing EURLs until August 30, 2024.


This development comes after Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, announced that it would soon limit the availability of “unregulated” stablecoins in the EU. While Binance has not specifically mentioned major stablecoins such as Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, there are growing concerns that European citizens may face restrictions on accessing these popular tokens due to MiCA.

Lugh's Euro-pegged EURL token has experienced a significant decline in circulation in recent months. Data from DefiLlama shows that EURL's circulation has dropped from around $2.8 million in March to around $32,000 as of today, suggesting that most holders may have already returned their tokens for cash.





Lugh has offered a refund option for token holders on its website. The company argued that it assured its users that “all EURLs are and will continue to be guaranteed 1:1 by our reserve account opened at Société Générale and audited monthly by Deloitte.”

Robotic Third Thumb Users Formed ‘Strong Bonds’ With Their Extra Digit - Decrypt

A robotic third thumb, strapped onto your hand and controlled by your big toe, could be surprisingly useful, a team of researchers in the UK discovered. A new video of the third thumb in action makes clear that the additional opposable digit could become an almost natural extension of the hand.That was the goal of the project, lead designer Danielle Clode told Decrypt.“As an upper-limb prosthetics designer, I wanted to understand the unique relationship between a person and a prosthetic,” she said. “It’s a relationship unlike any other product, and I wanted to explore that.”Clode said the third thumb was part of her master's degree program at the Royal College of Art in London.“The third thumb is a flexible 3D-printed thumb extension for your hand, controlled by your toes,” she explained. ”It is operated wirelessly with pressure sensors and affords proportional control over two degrees of freedom.”The third thumb uses two motors mounted on a wrist strap, powered by an external battery pack worn on the wearer’s upper arm. Sensors attached to the user's big toes, in turn powered by batteries attached around the ankles, control the thumb's movement. When pressure is applied to either of the big toes, the thumb moves forward and back and opens and closes, respectively, based on the pressure applied.The Cambridge video shows a variety of applications, many allowing the execution of tasks that would normally require two hands, from opening a soda bottle to holding a paintbrush and painting with the same hand. The Third Thumb is also seen holding an egg while cracking another, and sliding playing cards out of a full hand.According to Plasticity Lab, over 596 participants ranging from three to 96 have tried out the Third Thumb with most taking to the technology quickly, sometimes within a minute of putting on the device.“So after training, people report that the third thumb feels more like a part of them—we have also had people form strong bonds with the thumb,” Clode said. “Some of our participants needed a little bit of time to say goodbye to the thumb after the study ended, or reported feeling like they were missing something after the training had finished.”Image: Cambridge University/YouTubeEven so, the sensation of separation was not quite “phantom limb syndrome,” Clode said, as participants were only using the device for a few minutes at a time and to assess first-time usage. Phantom limb syndrome refers to a condition in which patients experience sensations in a limb that does not exist.Clode did acknowledge that participants in longer studies, five to seven days, were observed to have an increased “embodiment” on the third thumb, but said none of the participants reported feeling any phantom limb pain after the device was removed.“This is likely because we believe phantom pain to be driven by physiological mechanisms that wearing the thumb doesn’t interact with,” she added.Clode said she was initially looking to explore what it was like to control something extra attached to her body, which led her to prosthetics. When she started posting about her experiments online, Cambridge University-based Plasticity Lab reached out to her.“They were already exploring augmentation in the brain,” Clode said. “We started collaborating on this research shortly after, and I now work as an in-house designer with the Plasticity Lab, collaborating on augmentation neuroscience research.”Image: Cambridge University/YouTubeWork that began in 2021 has since drawn support from several institutions: the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, the WIN Centre at the University of Oxford, and the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London.Augmentation neuroscience research is a field that investigates how the brain adapts to and interacts with augmentative technologies, such as robotic body parts. It also explores the neural processes involved in learning to control external devices and how they become integrated into the body.The most widely known company in the augmentation neuroscience field is Neuralink, the neurotechnology company founded by Elon Musk in 2016. Neuralink uses augmentation neuroscience research to design its brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. In January, Neuralink implanted its first chip in a human test subject.The recipient of the BCI chip was an Arizona-based quadriplegic man, Noland Arbaugh, who in March revealed his involvement with the project and his experience with it, including electrodes detaching from the implanted chip but also setting a new brain control world record using the Neuralink chip.“With any wearable device - or even electronic device, the challenge is always size and weight versus strength versus battery life,” Clode said. “It’s tough to make very lightweight and small yet strong electronics that last before needing to be charged.”Clode said the third thumb study aims to demonstrate the technology's feasibility and ease of use, which is a major step toward commercialization. But she acknowledged that it's not quite ready for the masses.The development roadmap includes scaling up testing, working with patient groups in the medical space, and preparing for regulatory processes, she said.“We are currently in the R&D phase with a working prototype that has been extensively tested,” Clode said. “Our focus remains on refining the technology and ensuring it meets the highest standards of functionality, safety, and user adaptability, as well as using it as a model to explore augmentation in the neuroscience research space.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Crypto Money Laundering Scandal: Epoch Times CFO Bill Guan Indicted by US DOJ | Bitcoinist.com


								In a significant development, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has indicted Bill Guan, the Chief Financial Officer of Epoch Times, a global newspaper and media company, on allegations of participating in a scheme to launder approximately $67 million using crypto. 
The indictment accuses Guan of being involved in a “transnational money laundering conspiracy,” benefiting himself, the media company, and its affiliates.
Multi-Million Crypto Money Laundering Scheme
According to US Attorney Damian Williams, Guan allegedly conspired with others to launder “tens of millions of dollars” obtained through “fraudulent unemployment insurance benefits” and other illicit activities. 
The indictment further alleges that Guan, as the CFO of Epoch Times, played a central role in the sprawling money laundering scheme from 2020 until May 2024. 

Under his management, the company’s “Make Money Online” team (MMO Team) utilized crypto to purchase tens of millions of dollars in crime proceeds, including fraudulently obtained unemployment insurance benefits loaded onto prepaid debit cards.
Participants in the scheme, including the MMO Team and others, purchased the proceeds of the crime at discounted rates using a specific but undisclosed digital asset platform. 
Stolen personal identification information was then used to open accounts, including prepaid debit card accounts, cryptocurrency accounts, and bank accounts, to transfer the illicit funds to the Media Entities associated with Epoch Times. 
The crime proceeds were subsequently laundered through various bank accounts held by the Media Entities, Guan’s personal bank accounts, and his cryptocurrency accounts.
Decades In Prison?
During the period coinciding with the money laundering activities, the DOJ alleges that Epoch Times’ internal financial accounting showed a staggering 410% increase in annual revenue compared to the previous year, reaching approximately $62 million. 
When questioned by banks regarding the sudden surge in transactions, Guan allegedly lied, claiming that the funds originated from donations. However, in 2022, Guan wrote a letter falsely stating that donations constituted an insignificant portion of the company’s overall revenue.
Guan, residing in Secaucus, New Jersey, faces charges of conspiring to commit money laundering, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and two counts of bank fraud, each carrying a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. 

The investigation involved collaboration between several law enforcement agencies. Jonathan Mellone, the Special Agent of the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG), emphasized their mission to investigate fraud allegations related to the US Department of Labor’s unemployment insurance program. 
The charges against the defendant are allegations, and the judge will determine any sentencing after trial.

A New Memecoin Spawns in Donald Trump's Altcoin Portfolio - What Happens If He Sells? - Bitcoin Sistemi

There are interesting developments in the cryptocurrency wallet of Donald Trump, the former president of the United States and also a candidate in the new presidential race.
As it is known, Donald Trump has his own NFT collection and the income he earns from it is transferred to his wallet as Ethereum.


At the time this article was written, Trump's cryptocurrency wallet contained $1.79 million worth of ETH. All of Trump's assets other than ETH, whose total portfolio is approximately $25 million, are tokens airdropped by altcoin developers against his will.
Until recently, the largest asset in Trump's cryptocurrency wallet was the TRUMP token, whose value has soared as politically themed altcoins gained popularity. However, recently, another altcoin has started to rise in Trump's portfolio, and there has been a significant increase in Trump's total assets.





Trump's memecoin holdings have nearly doubled in recent days, climbing above $20 million.

The name of the altcoin in question is TROG, and Trump currently has $12.61 million worth of tokens from this altcoin in his portfolio. Approximately half of TROG's total supply was airdropped to Trump by developers in the initial token distribution.


However, it does not seem possible for Trump to sell the TROG altcoins in question because Trump probably does not even know about this altcoin, in addition, it is unlikely that Trump, who owns half of the total supply, will sell these tokens at market value.

Looking at the largest digital asset, bitcoin topped $71,000 for the first time since May 20 before paring gains and reversing to the low $70,000s. A fresh set of U.S. manufacturing data Monday hinted at a cooling economy, potentially putting interest rate cuts back on the Federal Reserve's view later this year to loosen financial conditions.

Can Theta Network Beat Netflix, YouTube?


Theta Network is emerging as a revolutionary alternative to traditional platforms like Netflix and YouTube. But the critical question remains whether it can truly compete with these established giants.
In an exclusive interview with BeInCrypto, Jieyi Long, CTO at Theta Labs, explained how the Web3 firm aims to disrupt video delivery through decentralization, enhanced security, and novel incentives for content creators and viewers.
A Decentralized Video Streaming Network
According to Long, Theta Network, developed by Theta Labs, offers a fundamentally different approach to video streaming. 


“Theta Network consists of three main components: the Theta protocol, which enables decentralized video delivery; the Theta blockchain, which records and validates transactions; and the Theta token, which incentivizes users to contribute their resources,” Long told BeInCrypto. 

This decentralized model contrasts sharply with the centralized servers used by Netflix and YouTube. By leveraging a peer-to-peer network where users share their excess bandwidth and computing power, Theta reduces dependency on centralized servers. 
Such a setup enhances network reliability and decreases buffering times, improving video quality.

“The decentralized nature of Theta’s platform ensures increased reliability and eliminates the dependence on a single server,” Long emphasized.

Security is a critical concern for any digital platform. Theta Network addresses this with a hybrid consensus mechanism combining proof-of-stake (PoS) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). Validators stake their tokens to secure the network, which discourages malicious activities and ensures transaction validity. 

“By utilizing end-to-end encryption and advanced cryptographic techniques, user privacy is protected, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches,” Long said. 


This heightened security can appeal to users wary of data breaches and privacy issues plaguing other platforms.
The Unique Selling Point: THETA and TFUEL
Another distinguishing factor is Theta’s incentive structure. Users earn THETA tokens by sharing their excess bandwidth and computational resources, fostering active participation. This system contrasts with the ad-based revenue models of Netflix and YouTube. Indeed, they primarily rely on subscription fees and advertising revenue. 
The ability for users to earn tokens just by participating could attract a significant user base seeking more value from their viewing experience. Likewise, users can earn Theta Fuel (TFUEL) simply by watching content, providing a tangible benefit for their engagement. 
The model incentivizes viewership and fosters a more interactive and rewarding ecosystem for users. Unlike YouTube and TikTok, where algorithms largely determine revenue distribution, Theta allows for direct viewer-to-creator transactions. This system ensures that creators receive a larger portion of their earnings. 

“Theta’s model enables users to reward content they genuinely appreciate. By embracing blockchain technology, Theta provides a solution that empowers content creators with more control over their monetization strategies,” Long pointed out.

Theta Network also addresses reliability concerns through its decentralized nature, eliminating single points of failure and enhancing the system’s overall resilience. The network employs off-chain micropayment channels to facilitate fast, inexpensive transactions, addressing scalability issues typical of blockchain systems. 
The multi-level node architecture, including edge nodes and caching nodes, efficiently distributes processing loads, resulting in faster content delivery and reduced latency. This approach ensures a smoother and more reliable viewing experience, which could attract users dissatisfied with the occasional buffering and latency issues on traditional platforms.

“The design is aimed to achieve a good balance between transaction throughput, consistency, and level of decentralization. Validator and Guardian nodes stake THETA and participate in block production and transaction processing. In return, they earn TFUEL, which powers bandwidth/video relaying,” Binance Research wrote.

However, the road to overtaking Netflix and YouTube is not easy. Theta’s blockchain integration can introduce processing delays, a significant concern for real-time video experiences. Additionally, every node participating in the network needs sufficient bandwidth to handle data transfer without delays, which can be a hurdle in achieving widespread adoption.
While challenges remain, particularly in scalability and real-time processing, Theta’s user-centric incentives suggest it has the potential to disrupt the traditional video streaming industry. The question of whether it can beat Netflix and YouTube ultimately hinges on its ability to scale effectively and attract a critical mass of users and creators.

Ethereum ETFs Could Draw $4 Billion In First Five Months: K33 Research - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsEthereum spot ETFs will perform much like their Bitcoin-based predecessors, hauling $4 billion of inflows within five months after launch, according to K33 Research.“This estimate is based on the relative global ETH assets under management (AUM) market share compared to BTC of 28%,” wrote the crypto brokerage firm in a Tuesday report. Similarly, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)’s ETH open interest is currently 23% of Bitcoin, reflecting a similar market share in another institutionally focused market.As of June 3, US Bitcoin ETFs had absorbed $13.9 billion since their January launch. Across the world, Bitcoin ETFs now control over 1 million BTC, comprising over 5% of the circulating BTC supply.By contrast, institutional funds currently control 3.3% of the circulating ETH supply. Using this as a benchmark, K33 said it expects anywhere from $3.1 billion to $4.8 billion worth of ETH ETF flows after launch. This comprises between 750,000 and 1 million ETH, or 0.65 to 0.85% of ETH’s circulating supply.It’s a big promise when compared to the Ethereum futures ETF debut last year, which hauled peanuts in AUM next to the launch of the first Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021. K33 believes this lackluster launch was an outlier given the poor timing with which Ethereum ETFs hit the market, and is not representative of ETH’s true investment demand.For example, the firm notes, ETH CME futures—currently sitting at 22.9% of Bitcoin’s size—have averaged a 35% share of the market since inception. Furthermore, Between September 29 and December 26, ETH futures ETFs experienced 34.6% of the inflows of their Bitcoin-based equivalents.“In Canada and Europe, ETH ETPs hold roughly 1/3 of the AUM held by BTC ETPs,” wrote K33. “U.S. futures-based ETH ETFs are pulling the global ETH dominance lower.”Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has previously predicted that the Ethereum ETFs will haul between 10% and 20% of what the Bitcoin spot ETFs did. “Grabbing 20% of what they got would be a huge win/successful launch by normal ETF standards,” he tweeted on Wednesday.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

What Will Ethereum ETFs Do to ETH Price? Research Firm Shares - Bitcoin Sistemi

ETH-based ETFs that can directly hold Ethereum (ETH) will soon launch in the US, with inflows of $4 billion expected in the first five months, according to a report by cryptocurrency analysis firm K33 Research.
The firm's estimate is based on a comparison of assets managed in existing ETH-based ETFs worldwide to similar Bitcoin (BTC) products and open interest (OI) in futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the preferred market for institutional investors.


Currently, Ethereum's OI on the CME accounts for 23% of the size of BTC futures, but has seen an average share of 35% of BTC futures since ETH futures began trading on the CME in 2021. This indicates that there is significant institutional demand for ETH in the US, according to K33.
Applying these rates to the approximately $14 billion in inflows into spot BTC ETFs so far, K33 estimates ETH ETF inflows will be between $3 billion and $4.8 billion in the first five months. That estimate is slightly higher than JPMorgan's $3 billion estimate for this year.





According to the report, based on current prices, this would equal 800,000 to 1.26 million ETH accumulated in ETFs, or roughly 0.7% to 1.05% of the total token supply, creating a supply squeeze for the asset. Unlike futures-based products, issuers of spot ETFs will be required to purchase tokens on the spot market as investors purchase ETF shares.

“As seen with BTC, this massive supply absorption shock should lead to a price increase in ETH,” said Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research.


Bitcoin rose to record highs after an initial correction in late January, with a nearly 60% increase following the launch of US spot ETFs. K33 analysts predicted that with the launch of ETH ETFs, the ETH price will begin to outperform BTC after the ETH-BTC pair's almost two-and-a-half-year downtrend.
According to the K33 report, market observers expect the ETFs to begin trading around the end of June or early July, once the required documentation is completed.

Ethereum (ETH) Set For ‘Glorious Year,’ Analyst Eyes $10K Target


																Ethereum (ETH) saw a significant upswing at the end of May due to the rumors of a spot ETH ETF (Exchange-Traded Funds) approval in the US. This bullish momentum propelled the token’s price from the $3,000 price range to the $3,900 mark.

	Related Reading


After the approval, the second-largest cryptocurrency has shown a strong performance, consolidating between the $3,700 and $3,800 levels. Some crypto analysts believe ETH is preparing for a crucial test and eye bullish targets above the $10,000 price range soon.
ETH’s “Glorious Year” Depends On This Level
According to crypto analyst Jelle, a community sector is currently driven by a negative sentiment towards Ethereum. The bearish sentiment, seemingly fueled by Ethereum’s failure to regain the $4,000 resistance level, has made “lots of people overcomplicate things here.”
As a result, Jelle urged investors not to panic, arguing there’s no reason to “flip bearish.” The crypto analyst highlighted the key movements the King of Altcoins has seen in the past two weeks.
Due to the spot ETH ETF approval, Ethereum broke out of a multi-moth falling wedge pattern. At the time, ETH successfully regained the $3,600 price range and briefly tested the $3,900 price range.

After reclaiming this key support level, ETH has been consolidating above it, hovering between the $3,700 and $3,800 price range since May 28. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency is “reclaiming the range lows of a 3-year-long reaccumulation range.”
Per Jelle’s chart, ETH is regaining the lowest range of the previous bull run, which could lead to an expansion period. If the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization holds above this key level, Ethereum “will have a glorious year.”
Additionally, the analyst considers that ETH’s last hurdle to overcome this cycle is the $4,000 resistance level. Once “it breaks $4,000, it’s clear skies ahead” to potentially reach the price target of $10,000.
Similarly, known crypto analyst Il Capo of Crypto noted that his main scenario is a bullish continuation. Per Il Capo, Ethereum is “looking good” above the $3,650 range. This performance seemingly sets the cryptocurrency for a “bullish continuation” towards the previous cycle’s all-time high (ATH).
Ethereum ETFs, The Catalyst For New ATH?
Despite the doubts, Ethereum’s recent performance resembles Bitcoin’s (BTC) in previous cycles. According to crypto trader Ash, ETH is following the path of the flagship cryptocurrency in 2018-2021. If it continues this track, “$10,000+ ETH is programmed.”
As the crypto market awaits the listing of the spot ETF, some analysts consider it the catalyst for an “explosive” alt season this year.
Similarly, Ali Martinez noted that over 777,000 ETH, worth around $3 billion, have been withdrawn from exchanges since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the investment products. Due to a supply squeeze, this development could propel ETH’s price to higher levels.
However, Lookonchain recently revealed that two participants of Ethereum’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) deposited around 4.5% of their holdings on a crypto exchange. Per the post, the ICO participants received 200,000 ETH, worth around $767 million, at Ethereum’s Genesis.

The holders deposited 9,518 ETH, or $36.33 million, into Kraken on Monday, which has alarmed investors. Despite the fear of a possible dump, some community members think this movement could suggest that these long-term holders believe ETH’s price will reach unprecedented highs soon.

SocialFi Slump | Bankless


Network defects. SocialFi applications have managed to garner widespread excitement among crypto natives at numerous points throughout the past year, but its buzziest brands seem to be fading into obscurity. Will crypto ever get a sustainable SocialFi application?The first major wave of SocialFi excitement this cycle was captured by friend.tech, a crypto-enabled private chat room on the Base Layer 2. By offering users a clear pathway to qualify for a future airdrop through one of the earliest implementations of a points program and directly incentivizing influencers to shill the platform via a 5% token swap fee paid out in ETH, friend.tech succeeded in fostering impressive amounts of initial adoption.Unfortunately, the platform’s hype peaked in mid-September. Many metrics never re-obtained their highs from this period and not even the arrival of its FRIEND airdrop or V2 refresh could revive any semblance of momentum. Daily active users have approached the lower bound, and on Monday, friend.tech recorded a meager 611 transactions, the lowest on record and a far cry from its 540k daily transaction all-time high.
 In late April, the Blast-native crypto influencer trading card game “fantasy.top” came to prominence in the Crypto Twitter lexicon after its mainnet launched into widespread acclaim from influencers who had cards on the platform.Similar to friend.tech, fantasy.top directly incentivizes its influencers to promote the platform, offering them a 3% fee take on all individual card sales and 10% of the revenue generated from initial card pack sales.Although alignment between fantasy.top and its influencers resulted in public support that caused users to FOMO in, as demonstrated with friend.tech, it can be difficult to sustain this momentum over the longer term as activity wanes.Daily active users peaked on the first day of fantasy.top’s mainnet launch and have only trended downward since, causing the platform to produce little more than a couple of ETH in revenue during the past week and drastically reducing the payouts it can award to influencers.Source: FlipsideIronically, while activity has almost entirely dissipated for the more speculative variety of SocialFi applications, usage metrics for decentralized social platforms for Farcaster and Lens have been gaining traction in recent months!Crypto natives have demonstrated clear demand for crypto-enabled social applications and the benefits they provide, such as easy access to on-chain interactions and robust censorship resistance.Financialized social applications have struggled to achieve the sustainable revenues required to yield long-term adoption; in the absence of this factor, each concept has faced declining usage and falling asset prices, driving users to increasingly abandon these platforms.While the continued adoption of Farcaster and Lens assets lends credence to the possibility crypto could receive a sustainable variation of a more gamified concept, the immense struggles endured by early applications indicate that this will be a difficult balance to achieve.

‘Notcoin’ Is Giving $1 Million to Telegram Game’s Pre-Market Traders - Decrypt

Telegram-based game Notcoin has been responsible for this year’s biggest gaming token launch—and the price has only surged since then, more than tripling in value recently as The Open Network-based NOT token gains steam. Now the team has rewarded the earliest traders who made a bet on Notcoin’s future performance.Back in March, before the NOT token launched and Notcoin was purely playing with in-game coins, developer Open Builders launched a novel “pre-market vouchers” model. Players who had mined at least 10 million in-game coins could swap them for a tradeable NFT that could be redeemed for the eventual on-chain token.Given the hype around Notcoin and the fact that the Telegram clicker game had amassed tens of millions of players, traders anticipated a potentially sizable return on the tokens. And when the first vouchers hit the open market—available for some Notcoin players at first, but not all—the limited supply helped drive up the price... which eventually fell sharply.For example, some of the initial vouchers that represented 10 million in-game coins—which would later be redeemable for 10,000 NOT tokens—sold for about $230 worth of Toncoin (TON) on the open market at first. In time, the price settled below $100 worth of TON.All of this happened on a peer-to-peer market, and the whole point of pre-market trading was to let people speculate on the eventual price of Notcoin. Interestingly, that initial high price is roughly where the actual token price sits right now—10,000 NOT is worth about $240 as of writing.But given the disparity at the time, and a sense that some early traders had overpaid for the vouchers amid limited liquidity before the feature was opened up to all players, the Notcoin team said in March that it had taken a snapshot of the early holders and that it would provide a “meaningful bonus” to those wallets in the future.“The reason is simple: Once the queue is open for everyone, the amount of vouchers will increase dramatically, so we want to support those who bought [at a] higher price,” the team wrote in March.On Tuesday, Open Builders made good on that promise, saying that it would drop a total of 40 million NOT—approximately $1 million worth—to the holders of the first 5,867 Notcoin vouchers purchased or held “before the pre-market was open for everyone.”Each eligible user will receive 6,900 NOT, or about $170 worth, per voucher. That’s free crypto, particularly for any users who either held their vouchers or redeemed them and then held onto the NOT tokens, given their recent price jump. The tokens will be sent to eligible wallets today, according to the post.Notcoin has seen a massive surge in price over the last couple weeks, now up 167% over the past seven days to a current price above $0.024. NOT now has a market cap of $2.5 billion, making it the 54th most valuable cryptocurrency on the market, per CoinGecko. It spiked above $0.028 on Sunday to set a new all-time high price.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Ethereum Layer-2 Networks Are Raking in Millions-With Base Leading the Way - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBase, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network launched by top U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, generated more than $6 million in on-chain profits in May, making it the most profitable layer-2 network while topping the likes of Blast and Optimism in the process.Base’s surging profits have been fueled by a rapid increase in total value locked (TVL), according to L2BEAT, in turn driven by Ethereum’s implementation of EIP-4844 and proto-danksharding via the anticipated Dencun upgrade in March.According to blockchain analytics platform GrowThePie, Base generated the most on-chain profit of any layer-2 chain with $6.1 million in May, followed by $1.5 million for Blast and $1.4 million for Optimism. While Base is far ahead of these rivals in the profitability wars, its monthly tally has declined sharply after spiking with Dencun upgrade in March.On the other hand, Blast, the rising layer-2 network from the makers of NFT marketplace Blur, has recently gained recognition for its unique native yield for ETH and stablecoins, as well as projects like Pacmoon and Fantasy Top that are doling out ample incentives to users.Blast’s share of all layer-2 profits increased from 5.3% in April to 15.2% in May. It’s still well behind Base, however, which enjoyed 56.8% of all layer-2 profits last month.On-chain profitability for layer-2 networks refers to the balance between costs to interact with the layer-1 network (Ethereum) and revenues generated via fees, token issuance, and other means. It does not include any off-chain expenses, and thus should not be considered a complete picture of how these networks are run from top to bottom.A Dune dashboard maintained by pseudonymous on-chain analyst Kofi also put Base on top, but with just shy of $7 million in profit in May. The variance may be due to differences in how each data curator measures revenue and expenses. Dune’s dashboard excludes Blast data, however, so it’s an incomplete picture of how leading layer-2s stack up in that regard.Per GrowThePie, Base has been the most profitable L2 each month since March 2024. In the last three months, its TVL nearly sextupled, from $1.3 billion to $7.6 billion, a historical high for the chain. As Optimism’s TVL has remained roughly flat in the last month, Base may be poised to overtake OP Mainnet.Both Base and OP Mainnet are built on the OP Stack and are part of the Optimism “superchain” ecosystem, though they’re considered to be distinct L2s within that ecosystem. In terms of TVL, Base still remains far behind industry leader Arbitrum, which has $19.1 billion in TVL.Besides the upgrades made possible by the Dencun fork, Base’s appeal within the crypto community has grown since Coinbase announced its new Smart Wallet, which is expected to improve accessibility of on-chain transactions to new adopters.Coinbase’s Smart Wallet will make use of account abstraction, a way to facilitate easy on-chain transactions for those unfamiliar with the details of DeFi. Base has also benefited from the profile of Coinbase and the added exposure therein, along with promotional pushes like the latest “On-Chain Summer” rewards campaign that kicked off this week.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Says Crypto Climate in Washington ‘Smells Like Alpha’ - Here’s What He Means - The Daily Hodl


								Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says people are underestimating a political shift on crypto currently unfolding in Washington, D.C.
In a new memo, Hougan says crypto has successfully built “political muscle” in recent years, including one of the top political action committees in D.C.










Hougan says that if everyone truly understood the significance of the recent shift in Washington, crypto markets would already be at all-time highs.
“The reason this smells like alpha to me is that, outside of the crypto bubble, no one cares.
I’ve been on the road speaking at conferences for the past few weeks and, try though I might, I cannot get this story to resonate with people. I talk about the votes, and Warren’s anti-crypto army, and the surprise progress on Ethereum ETFs, and people’s eyes glaze over.
The story is too complex, and the impact too far removed. After all, no policies have actually changed in Washington yet. SAB 121’s repeal was vetoed; FIT21 is unlikely to make it through the Senate before the elections; and the Ethereum ETFs haven’t actually launched.
The tide has changed, but the water hasn’t come in yet. Wake me up when the action happens.
But here’s the thing: If people understood the ramifications of the shift in D.C., the crypto market would be at new all-time highs.”
According to the investor, a sizeable chunk of the $20 trillion currently being managed by financial advisors will likely flow into digital assets once the tension between politicians and the industry wears off.
“If you think BlackRock’s move into the crypto space positively impacted the market, imagine if all of Wall Street accepted crypto as a normal part of the market. Talk about mainstream.
The market will wake up to the fact that we are in a new era for crypto, and when it does, I suspect it will move the industry towards all-time highs. But until it does, there may just be some alpha laying around.”

Crypto CEO Reveals The Factors That Will Drive XRP Price To $10,000 | Bitcoinist.com


								Simon McLoughlin, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Uphold, a cloud-based financial services platform, has expressed optimism about the XRP price outlook despite the cryptocurrency’s stagnant price. McLoughlin predicts that the XRP price could surge as high as $10,000, surpassing the value of the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. 
XRP Price To Reach $10,000
A crypto analyst identified as ‘Crypto Sensei’ on X (formerly Twitter) has unveiled a bullish prediction for XRP, as articulated by McLoughlin. McLoughlin has outlined several factors that could propel XRP’s rise to new all-time highs. 

Offering a glimpse into XRP’s future outlook, the Uphold CEO indicated that XRP’s integration into the traditional financial service sector would facilitate global recognition and adoption, leading to significant growth in the cryptocurrency’s market value. He projected that every country will adopt XRP, and this growth will fuel a massive price surge to $10,000. 
McLoughlin based his bullish predictions on XRP’s tokenization and cross-border payment capabilities. He stressed the transformative potential of tokenization in the finance industry, predicting an influx of capital and a shift involving digitizing real-world assets such as stocks, real estate, bonds, and others, thereby enhancing accessibility and liquidity. 
As a technology which can be used for asset tokenization, XRP stands out for its advanced use cases and its capacity for swift and cost-effective cross-border transactions. 
Sharing McLoughlin’s positive sentiments regarding the XRP price future outlook, Crypto Sensei has asserted XRP’s superiority over Bitcoin in both tokenization and international payment systems. Notably, he highlighted XRP’s high transaction speed, which settles hundreds of transactions within seconds, as compared to Bitcoin, which takes minutes to process and complete transactions.  
Is XRP’s Rise To $10,000 Farfetched?
In considering McLoughlin’s $10,000 price forecast for the XRP price, it is important to note that the XRP price has been on a downward trend for years. This decline can be attributed to the backlash from its ongoing legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which started more than three years ago. 
XRP has been continually consolidating around the $0.5 price mark, making a year-long decline of $0.45%. The cryptocurrency saw a slight rebound around March, exceeding the $0.6 threshold, but eventually witnessed a price correction and began trading around $0.5 again. 

To many XRP investors, a price increase to $10,000 may be a long shot, given that XRP has only recorded a highest price of $3.84. 
Crypto Sensei has also acknowledged the uncertainty of this ambitious price target, disclosing that it would take years before XRP can reach $10,000. During these years, XRP will need to gain widespread adoption and recognition, thereby boosting its demand among users in different markets, and potentially catalyzing a price surge. 
An XRP supporter, identified as ‘JackTheRippler’ has also revealed in a recent X post that XRP has been successfully tested by over 11,000 banks on the old system “SWIFT.” He predicted that Ripple could potentially become a household name, with XRP acting as its backbone.

Dogecoin: Can whale accumulation offset DOGE's price decline? - AMBCrypto



Large wallets cop more DOGE as price declined.
The overall trend remained negative despite a slight increase.

Over the past few days, Dogecoin [DOGE] has experienced price downtrends, concluding the previous month with a decline and continuing the same trend into the new month. 
Despite this negative price movement, notable accumulation has been observed in certain wallets.
Dogecoin needs more positive momentum
Analysis of the Dogecoin daily timeframe chart revealed that out of the last seven days, DOGE experienced positive price trends for only three days. 
Despite these brief upticks, there has been an overall decline in the past week, as the positive trends were insufficient to offset the downward movement. 
Source: TradingView
As of this writing, DOGE was trading at around $0.158, an increase of less than 1%. It was also trading above its short Moving Average (yellow line) for now. This suggests that the price trend remains positive at the moment despite the overall downtrend.
Additionally, an analysis of its Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated a shift from the bull trend. However, as of this writing, its bear trend remained weak, with the RSI just below the neutral line. 
For DOGE to revert to a bull trend, it must sustain a more positive price momentum.
Whale Dogecoin wallets accumulate more
Analysis of the Dogecoin wallet activity revealed that despite the price decline, certain wallets have accumulated more of the memecoin. 
According to the supply distribution chart on Santiment, between the end of May and the present, over 200 million DOGE has been accumulated by these addresses. 
Specifically, wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE tokens have increased their holdings. 
Source: Santiment
Additionally, an analysis of wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million DOGE showed a similar increase in accumulation.
DOGE holders remain the same 
Despite the evident accumulation in Dogecoin, the number of holders did not see an increase. Analysis of the number of holders on Santiment revealed a flat trend over the past few weeks. 
As of the current writing, the number of holders stood at around 6.6 million, consistent with the figures observed in May. This meant that the accumulation was by existing wallets.

AI Beauty Pageant Entrants Unveiled-With AI Influencer Judges - Decrypt

The world's first known beauty contest was held in 1825 in Balatonfüred, Hungary. But a lot has changed since then. Almost 200 years later, the world is witnessing a new kind of beauty pageant: “Miss AI,” pitched as the first official and formal beauty contest for AI models.Fanvue, a social media platform dedicated to AI models, announced the contest in April in collaboration with the World AI Creator Awards (WAICA). The panel of judges consists of two AI-generated influencers, Aitana Lopez and Emily Pellegrini, and two human judges, Andrew Bloch and Sally-Ann Fawcett.Lopez is an AI-generated influencer based in Barcelona, Spain, who has over 300,000 followers on Instagram and reportedly earns around $10,000 per month. Pellegrini, meanwhile, was created in January 2024 and has quickly gained popularity, said to be earning $10,000 per week.Bloch is an entrepreneur and PR advisor, and Fawcett is a beauty pageant expert and author.Although distinguished by its formal organization, “Miss AI” is hardly the first AI model contest—nor contest featuring AI judges. There have been small contests—mostly informal—to generate the most beautiful AI model, and in 2016, the Beauty.AI 2.0 competition used AI judges to evaluate over 6,000 human user-submitted selfies—women and men—to pick the most beautiful ones. The judging was based on youthfulness, skin quality, symmetry, and appearance relative to databases of models and actors.Winners of the Beauty.AI competition. Image: Beauty.AIThe adoption of AI models is certainly controversial, especially given the entrenched health and beauty industry and its own biases and struggles with unrealistic standards and diversity. A UK study last year found 60% of consumers don’t feel represented in health and beauty ads—79% among those over age 55—with 43% preferring ads that show real users.Some prominent beauty brands have expressly rejected AI models.“As we transition into an era where 90% of content is predicted to be AI-generated by 2025, our message still stands: keep beauty real,” declared Dove, a brand under global firm Unilever. “1 in 3 women feel pressure to alter their appearance because of what they see online, even when they know the images are fake or AI-generated.“The rise of AI poses one of the greatest threats to real beauty in the last 20 years, meaning representation is more important than ever,“ the company wrote.Nonetheless, the popularity of AI influencers and models in fashion and media seems to be a trend that will explode over time. The 2024 Influencer Marketing Report revealed that nearly half of GenZ are likely to be interested in a brand that has an AI influencer."Meet the contestantsHere are the candidates for the first “Miss AI” beauty contest.Olivia C, a travel-focused influencer with over 10,600 followers, told the Daily Mirror it was "an honor" to be a part of the tech world's “Oscars” and hopes to "[pave] the way for a future where technology fosters connection."Image: @oliviaislivinghigh/InstagramKenza Layli, a Morocco-based family blogger with 192,000 followers, shares a lot of pictures related to middle eastern culture.Image: @kenza.layli/InstagramAnne Kerdi from France has almost 10,000 followers and presents Brittany (a region in northwestern France) in various aspects.

Spain extends Worldcoin ban until 2024-end

Spain has extended its ban on Worldcoin’s operations, a project led by Tools for Humanity Corporation, until the end of the year or until the Bavarian Data Protection Authority (BayLDA) reaches a final decision.The extension follows a precautionary measure imposed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) in March, which ordered Worldcoin to cease collecting and processing personal data in Spain.Worldcoin Foundation and Tools for Humanity have not made a public statement regarding the extension.BayLDA decisionThe AEPD’s order was made under Article 66.1 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which aims to safeguard individuals’ rights and freedoms.The Spanish National Court recently upheld the ban and rejected Worldcoin’s appeal, prioritizing the protection of personal data over the company’s interests.Worldcoin’s legally binding commitment ensures that its operations will remain halted until the BayLDA completes its investigation. The Bavarian authority, where Worldcoin’s main European office is located, is expected to conclude its investigation in the coming weeks.The agreement does not limit the AEPD or BayLDA’s authority to implement further supervisory measures if necessary. The collaboration between the two data protection authorities continues, with AEPD as an interested party under the GDPR framework.Regulatory challengesWorldcoin has faced scrutiny and controversy since its inception. Launched to create a global identification system via iris scans, the project has been criticized for privacy concerns and the potential misuse of biometric data.The project’s founders, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, envisioned Worldcoin as a way to use blockchain technology to ensure universal basic income and financial inclusion. However, the collection and storage of biometric data have alarmed privacy advocates and regulatory bodies worldwide.Worldcoin is facing regulatory challenges in other jurisdictions, including a ban on its operations in Hong Kong and Kenya — the latter of which said its activities amount to espionage.The outcome of the BayLDA’s decision will be crucial in determining the future of Worldcoin’s operations in Spain and potentially across Europe as the company navigates the stringent data protection regulations.The case also sets a precedent for how emerging technologies involving biometric data are regulated and managed in the EU.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Memecoin Whale's Patience Ended: Months Later, He Disposed of It All With 976 Percent Profit - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the cryptocurrency market is in a general upward wave today, it was noteworthy that a whale made a large amount of profit from a popular memecoin.
According to Onchain data, a giant PEPE whale deposited a large amount of PEPE tokens to Binance. Although it is not possible to determine with certainty whether the deposit is for sale or not, considering that the whale has been storing its tokens in a cold wallet for a long time, it is highly likely that this transaction is for sale.


The PEPE whale in question purchased 365.96 billion tokens on the cryptocurrency exchange MEXC on December 13 and 16, 2023, which corresponded to 494 thousand dollars at that time.

Balina wallet transferred the same amount of PEPE tokens to Binance in its deposit today. This time the value of the tokens was $5.3 million. In other words, the whale wallet turned 494 thousand dollars into 5.3 million dollars in less than 6 months.





The total profit amount of Balina wallet was 4.82 million dollars and the profit rate was 976%.
Although the PEPE price has fallen by approximately 8% in the last week, it has seen an impressive rise of 65% in the last month.

Roaring Kitty In Hot Water With Regulators Amid GameStop Revival: Reports - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA securities regulator for the U.S. state of Massachusetts is reportedly probing Keith Gill, the meme stock influencer better known online as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue.Synonymous with the retail-led short squeeze that sent shares of GameStop soaring in 2021, Gill’s online return has reignited interest in the video game retailer. After posting to Twitter for the first time in years, the meme stock influencer has recently shifted his activity over to Reddit.The existence of an investigation in Massachusetts was confirmed by Reuters after it was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The latter publication on Monday also detailed a separate review of GameStop options trading activity by the Securities and Exchange Commission.The Secretary of the Commonwealth for the Massachusetts Securities Division did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Though Gill’s reemergence began with curated clips of movies that didn’t mention GameStop directly, the influencer hasn’t been beating around the bush on Reddit. On Sunday, he posted a screenshot of an ETrade account holding $210 million in GameStop shares and call options.A subsequent post on Monday showed the purported holdings had increased by millions of dollars.As of this writing, around 12,000 Reddit users were present in the r/Superstonk Reddit community where Gill had publicized his holdings. His most recent post on Reddit had garnered over 65,000 upvotes, many from GameStop fanatics.Market manipulation concerns are among the main reasons why ETrade is currently considering dropping Gill from its retail trading platform, according to the Wall Street Journal. But on Twitter, some financial-market participants jumped to Gill’s defense.Bobby Goodlatte, co-founder of the venture capital firm Form Capital, said that targeting Gill would be unfair. Though Gill’s actions feel like market manipulation, Goodlatte said Gill’s GameStop rhetoric isn’t far from Jim Cramer recommending a stock on CNBC’s “Mad Money.”“The SEC should either allow all of it, or none of it,” he said, adding that the situation was also reminiscent of a hedge fund talking up the value of its investments on Twitter.Notably, Gill’s behavior has raised regulatory eyebrows in the Bay State before. He was registered as a broker with a subsidiary of MassMutual, and the insurer agreed to pay a $4 million fine in 2021 to settle an inquiry over supervising Gill’s trading and social-media activity.After surging this weekend on the back of Gill’s Reddit post, GameStop shares slumped 5% Tuesday to $26.50, following a 30% drop on Monday. Still, GameStop’s stock price has risen 62% over the past month from $16.31 amid renewed interest from retail traders.Cramer himself has waded into the conversation around Gill’s online posts, positing on Twitter that there’s “nothing illegal if [he] buy[s] calls and shows them.” In a followup he said that regulators are looking out for an eventual sale and that anyone “can get long and loud.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Solana's Celebrity Memecoin Sideshow | Bankless


Celebrities have once again returned to crypto, and this time, they're embracing a more fungible path forward, slapping their names on tickers and pumping up the memecoin fever.Minor and major celebrities are no strangers to the crypto world, but there haven't been quite as many around since FTX's blowup. So, what's bringing them back? The promise of memecoin riches on Solana.⭐️ Solana Celebrities The latest tokens from public figures like Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, SoundCloud rapper Trippie Redd, and former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner have made a big splash across Crypto Twitter over the past week. And while the industry has been embroiled in a nuanced debate over whether thee new crop of launches offer any positives for the space, it's hard to argue that the individuals launching one-click tokens bearing their names have much more than profits on their mind.
Celebrity coin pump-and-dumps often come at the market's frothiest moments, as the promises of easy money by dumping on fans proves too irresistible and the threat of reputational damage seems too minimal. Why Solana?While past celebrity crypto promotional efforts have typically centered around shilling existing projects or launching NFT projects or tokens to the Ethereum network, this most recent crop of memes is unique due to its Solana origins. Unlike the past cycle, there is a compelling argument to be made that Solana is the premier onchain speculation destination – particularly with respect to memecoin trading. Solana subscribes to a monolithic version for the future of blockchains, meaning that all liquidity is concentrated at a single layer, a beneficial feature that increases the amount of capital available to purchase tokens compared to Ethereum’s more fragmented L2s. Further, Solana’s commitment to scaling through hardware upgrades allows the network to enjoy transaction speeds that simply cannot be replicated on the Ethereum L1.The rise of nuanced memecoin subcultures from within Solana is not a new development, but celebrity-promoted tokens mark the first time this phenomenon is actually likely to onboard new people and capital into the crypto industry.
Reputational Damage?Despite the hopes that increasing celebrity crypto adoption indicates a deeper mainstream willingness to adopt the technology, the concern remains that an eventual collapse of this mania will burn bridges with those whose first onchain interactions were purchasing these same celebrity memecoins.There aren't a lot of reasons to expect this latest crop of celebrities to play a long-term game, making it highly probable that their tokens will eventually become worthless. Unfortunately, the disgruntled investors and inevitable securities violations that this trend is likely to produce will only serve to generate negative coverage on the industry.
Although some previous iterations of celebrity-promoted crypto tokens had focused on providing utility for holders, the memes gaining traction over the past week have been entirely useless, resulting from low-effort launches through one-click token deployers and coming with zero benefits other than a litany of promotional tweets from their associated celebrity.Insider activity is abundantly clear for many of these tokens, and while Solana degens may be aping tickers with aspirations to sell at a profit to a celebrity’s fans in the near future, they first have to accept that they are being dumped on by the celebrity and other associated insiders and consider if they’re comfortable becoming the “community members” of a worthless project.

Bitcoin to Reach $150,000 by the End of 2024: CNBC Research Analyst ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin is set to reach as high as $150,000 by the end of this year, according to one CNBC research analyst, Tom Lee. Lee, who holds a full-time position as the Head of Research at financial analysis company FS Insights, gave this opinion during a CNBC piece earlier today. Lee is known for his pro-Bitcoin views, but he is by no means limited to just crypto, and he has made a name for himself in the financial world. 



Why is Bitcoin Headed to $150k in the next 7 Months?



According to Lee, the primary reason Bitcoin is racing to $150k by the end of the current calendar year is widening ownership statistics. The new ownership demographic includes institutional and retail investors, Lee says, and this cemented its position as a genuine asset class. 



Bitcoin has already risen 3% since Lee made this prediction and went above $70k after languishing below the key level for the last 2-3 months.



Is $150k Bitcoin a Realistic Prediction?



Bitcoin needs to gain 114% in the next 7 months from its current price level to reach Tom Lee’s $150k price target. This is a realistic price increase for the premier digital currency, considering we are in the middle of a major bull market.



However, due to the complicated economic situation prevailing, the coveted $150k price level can go either side of the December 31, 2024 target date. The bulls will fancy their chances, and if they are successful, this could mean a longer bull market and a possible rise to $200,000 or even further above during this cycle.

Bitcoin is currently trading just north of the $70k price support level at press time. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is on a roll and has managed to recover most of the losses of the last 2-3 months.

However, the index feels uneasy above the $70k resistance and may take some time to overcome. The long-term bull market is expected to resume when the digital currency rises to a new All-Time High (ATH) above $73.5k in the coming months. Failure to do so will put unnecessary pressure on the upward market forces and negatively impact sentiment.

The Promises and Perils of Private Asset Tokenization

Blockchain's transparent and immutable ledger allows token holders to access real-time information about their investments, fostering greater transparency in traditionally opaque markets. This visibility is a game-changer for monitoring cash flows and performance of credit portfolios, although tokenization does not alter the underlying characteristics of the instruments. Whether on-chain or off-chain, assets’ underlying risks, and the importance of due diligence, remain the same.

House Appropriation budget aims to prevent SEC from implementing SAB 121

An upcoming House Appropriation budget could prevent the US SEC from implementing its controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121).FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, who reported the news on June 4, said the bill will prohibit the SEC from using appropriated funds to implement the rule. Appropriations allow agencies to incur obligations and make payments from the US Treasury for set purposes.One policy rider in the budget states:“Prohibits the SEC from implementing or enforcing Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, which implements harmful digital asset requirements.”It is unclear whether the budget will succeed in its current form. The House, which currently has a Republican majority, will likely pass the appropriation bill in a June 5 hearing. However, the Senate, which has a Democratic and Independent majority, will need to negotiate its own appropriation bill against the House’s.According to Terret, Democratic support for an earlier resolution with the same goal — H.J. Res. 109 — means that the Senate may leave the rider in the budget.The bill otherwise aims to provide the SEC with $2 billion in total funding in 2025 as opposed to the $2.59 billion requested by SEC chair Gary Gensler.Commissioner Uyeda supports overturningTerret also reported that SEC commissioner Mark Uyeda favors withdrawing SAB 121 and that it was “unfortunate” that US President Joe Biden vetoed H.J. Res. 109.Uyeda added that the SEC’s decision to introduce SAB 121 through a regulatory edict bypassed rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), thereby “undercut[ting] our system of checks and balances against an overreaching administrative state.”Uyeda’s complaint echoes earlier criticism from fellow SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, who said in 2022 that a bulletin was not the “appropriate vehicle” for relevant change.Uyeda and Peirce objected to procedural shortcomings rather than SAB 121’s exact content. Peirce said that the decision itself “may be appropriate.”Attempts to overturn failedSAB 121 requires financial institutions and other firms that safeguard customers’ digital assets to record the assets on their balance sheets. The approach to accounting and disclosure arguably imposes high capital and liquidity costs on those companies.The US House and Senate voted to pass H.J. Res. 109 and overturn the bulletin, concluding with the Senate passing the resolution on May 16.However, on May 31, Biden vetoed the resolution over concerns that it would undermine the SEC and put consumers and investors at risk.Biden’s veto received pushback, as House lawmakers, the American Bankers Association, and other groups urged Biden to sign the resolution into law.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Can Shiba Inu delete another zero and surpass its ATH? - AMBCrypto



 In a highly bullish case, SHIB may rally to $0.00038 but resistance at $0.000027 might invalidate the run.
Shiba Inu’s network was undervalued, suggesting that the price could recover.

Deleting one more zero from its price means Shiba Inu [SHIB] would surpass its all-time high. Can it achieve it? This is one question that holders of the token have been asking themselves.
At press time, SHIB’s price was $0.000023.— 73.02% down from $0.000088 which was the peak it hit in October 2021. Furthermore, this decrease was a 3.20% fall in the last 30 days.
However, SHIB KNIGHT, an analyst who has been very bullish on the token opined that the price can hit $0.0001. According to his post on X, he mentioned that Shiba Inu could reach the target within a short period.
Bears are not giving up
The last time SHIB erased a zero from its price was in February. At that time, AMBCrypto reported how the price moved from $0.0000095 on the 22nd.
By the last day of the month, SHIB’s price had hit $0.000012 before its incredible surge to $0.000035 within the first 10 days in March.
However, it is important to note that the market condition was extremely bullish during that period. Recently, the euphoria has been non -existent, suggesting that it could be challenging for SHIB to reach such heights.
AMBCrypto found a metric that supported the invalidation of the thesis. This was the Bulls and Bears indicator provided by IntoTheBlock.
Source: IntoTheBlock
As of this writing, the difference between Bulls and Bear was 4 (in favor of bears). This indicator is important to Shiba Inu’s price because it tracks the number of addresses that have bought or sold 1% of the token’s trading volume.
When bulls overcome in this regard, it suggests a possible price increase for the token. But since bears dominated with selling pressure of 1% volume, it implies that SHIB could experience another decline.
Beyond that, it is also necessary to analyze the price potential from a technical perspective. On the daily chart, the SHIB was without a clear direction as the price kept trading in a tight range.
Is a 64% increase possible?
First, AMBCrypto identified a support at $0.000022 which bulls have been defending. However, SHIB’s price could be on the verge of slipping below the price.
If that happens, the price of the token might find itself trading at $0.000018. Should this happen, then the token might lose 23.92% of its press time value.
Source: TradingView
To the upside, there was resistance at $0.000027. A bounce to this level and breakout could lead SHIB to $0.000038 (a 64.01% increase).
In addition, the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio was 153.65. This was a low reading from the period SHIB went on its month-long rally. High values of the NVT ratio indicate that a network is overvalued relative to the transactions.

Thus, the low NVT ratio suggest that Shiba Inu’s network was undervalued when compared with transactions.
Concerning the price, this ratio could validate the predicted increase in the mid-term. However, the price of the token might keep swinging sideways in the short term, and $0.0001 might be an option anytime soon.

Bitcoin Hashrate Just Saw Its Biggest Crash Since China Ban


								On-chain data shows the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate has just witnessed its largest plunge since the China ban back in 2021.
Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Just Observed The Sharpest Drop In 3 Years
The “mining hashrate” refers to a measure of the total amount of computing power that the miners have connected to the Bitcoin network. This indicator may be used as a direct representation of the situation of the BTC miners.
When this metric’s value increases, the old miners expand, and new ones join in. Such a trend implies that these chain validators find the chain attractive.

On the other hand, a decline in the indicator suggests that some miners have decided to disconnect from the network, potentially because they are finding BTC mining unprofitable.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate over the past year:

The 7-day average value of the metric appears to have seen a sharp drawdown in recent days | Source: Blockchain.com
As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate had set a new all-time high (ATH) on the 27th of May, but since then, the metric has gone through a steep decline.
At the ATH, the indicator had a value of around 657.2 terahashes per second (TH/s), but now it has fallen to 566.8 TH/s, which corresponds to a plunge of almost 14%.
Back in April, the Bitcoin network witnessed its fourth Halving event. Halvings are periodic events occurring approximately every four years that permanently slash the asset’s block rewards in half.
The block rewards, which the miners receive as compensation for adding the next block to the network, serve as the majority of revenue for this cohort, so Halvings can significantly damage their finances.
As would be expected, the Hashrate declined following the latest Halving, as miners who were already under stress went underwater. However, the drawdown didn’t last too long, as after bottoming out in mid-May, the metric found a reversal to a strong upside.
Some thought that this rise to a new ATH signaled that the miner capitulation induced by the Halving had ended. The latest crash would suggest that this increase may have just been a temporary deviation, as the Hashrate is now back in line with its prior decline.
To put the plunge in the metric into perspective, analyst James Van Straten has posted a chart showing the percentage changes in the indicator over the past few years.

Looks like the value of the metric has just witnessed a huge negative spike | Source: @jvs_btc on X
As is visible, this negative movement in the Bitcoin Hashrate is the largest since the one witnessed in mid-2021. This past crash, which was of an even larger scale, had occurred due to China’s ban on BTC mining in the country.
Back then, China held a significant share of the global Hashrate, so the ban took a large amount of BTC computing power offline. The metric didn’t recover until the miners could finish their relocation to other nations.

However, while that earlier crash was larger in scale than the recent drawdown, it’s hard to say if the current miner capitulation has even ended. The metric may continue to decline shortly and eventually surpass the scale of the Hashrate decline from 2021.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,800, up more than 3% over the past week.

RoaringKitty’s GameStop Position Surges by $78.6 Million in a Single Day | Cryptoglobe


                                
Keith Gill, known on X as RoaringKitty and DFV on Reddit, is a popular retail trader known for inadvertently being behind the meme stock trading frenzy that started in 2021 and has now kickstarted a new round, with his position on GameStop ($GME) having surged by $78.6 million in just a day.



That’s according to data from Lookonchain, which pointed out that a day after RoaringKitty shared his current GameStop position on Reddit, its value rose by more than $78 million while the price of GameStop surged.



On Reddit, RoaringKitty shared that he owns 5 million GME shares and 120,000 $20 call options expiring on June 21, for a total position of over $210 million.



That position quickly grew after he revealed it in public, with the price of GME surging from around $22 to a high of $40 before moving back down to now trade at $27.7 per share.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

It’s worth noting that the recent meme stock trading frenzy started after RoaringKitty returned to social media from a three-year hiatus that ended after his testimony in Congress.



AMC Entertainment (NYSE; AMC), a movie theater chain, also experienced a significant uplift, as did various lesser-known cryptocurrencies associated with Roaring Kitty and GameStop.



The sharp increase in GameStop’s stock price has resulted in iniitial significant losses for short sellers, who had previously bet on a decline. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of S3 Partners, told the New York Times that GameStop shorts, which had accumulated $392 million in profits earlier this year, faced losses amounting to $852 million within days of the trader’s return to social media.



The New York Times has also quoted Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, as saying investors have been buying a significant number of GameStop call options, betting on continued price increases.

This Frog-Themed Meme Coin Eyes a New ATH After a 30% Daily Surge: Details


																TL;DR

One frog-themed meme coin that has been rising in popularity experienced a 30% spike on 24-hour scale, nearing a new all-time high price.
However, PEPE remains the biggest asset of that type, with a market cap of over $6 billion.


The Rise of PEPE’s Competitor
The meme coin sector continues spewing new tokens, with some of them turning into real sensations in a short period of time. One example is the frog-themed Brett (BRETT) which saw the light of day three months ago but started making waves towards the end of March due to its exponential price increase.
In the past few weeks, the asset has been one of crypto’s rock stars, with its value hitting an all-time high of over $0.12 on June 2 and its market capitalization surpassing the staggering $1.2 billion.
Despite a brief plunge on June 3, BRETT is well in the green today (June 4), recording a 30% price increase. Its rally defies the ongoing trend in the meme coin realm, where leading assets like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk Inu (BONK), and many more are bleeding today.
BRETT Price, Source: CoinGecko
Somewhat expectedly, BRETT’s bull run in the past month has caught the eye of numerous industry participants with some admitting they have entered its ecosystem as investors and others outlining optimistic predictions.




The popular X user Crash recently claimed that the meme coin could explode to the $3-$8 range and become one of the top 20 cryptocurrencies. They also forecasted that it will flip leading altcoins such as Polkadot (DOT), Arbitrum (ARB), dogwifhat (WIF), Optimism (OP), and more. Currently, BRETT is the 86th biggest digital asset and the 7th largest in its cohort.
PEPE Holds Its Ground
Despite BRETT’s impressive ascent, Pepe (PEPE) remains the leading frog-themed meme coin with a market capitalization of more than $6 billion. It tapped an all-time high at the end of last month, while its market cap soared above $7 billion. Thus, it briefly surpassed Polygon (MATIC) and Litecoin (LTC).
Even though there has been a slight pullback in the past few days, PEPE holders remain predominantly in the green. As of the moment, almost 90% of those invested in the token are sitting on paper profits. 
Its latest price jump enabled savvy traders to turn substantial gains. One such investor, who hopped on the bandwagon in December 2023, recently cashed out approximately $2.5 million.
However, dealing with PEPE and meme coins in general is also quite dangerous due to the infamous volatility of the asset class. If you are about to join the ecosystem, please check our dedicated video below to protect yourself from some common mistakes:

Crypto Trader Says Artificial Intelligence (AI) Altcoins Will Rally in Coming Months - Here Are His Top Picks - The Daily Hodl


								A popular crypto trader thinks artificial intelligence (AI) altcoins are primed to do well in the latter part of this year despite underperforming in the past couple of weeks.
The pseudonymous analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s looking at decentralized graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering blockchain Render (RNDR), AI and machine learning platform Fetch.ai (FET), the decentralized data storage protocol Arweave (AR) and the decentralized information processing protocol RSS3 (RSS3).










“The play right now is to just be patient, scale into the ones you like and just wait. We’ve seen a decent pullback on many of these and I think that there should be some decent buying opportunities available in the coming weeks. Still bullish on this sector myself.”
Altcoin Sherpa also feels somewhat bullish on Echelon Prime (PRIME), a web3 ecosystem that aims to advance the next generation of gaming.
“PRIME is a coin that everyone loves and a good gaming play for this current cycle.
We’ve seen a strong pullback and I’d personally view the $15-$11 area as a good strong place to accumulate if you like this project. I probably won’t buy but will observe. Lots of good TA (technical analysis) confluence there though with the 0.50 and 0.618 key Fibonacci levels + 200 day exponential moving average (EMA).”

PRIME is trading at $16.70 at time of writing.

Analyst: Solana Comes On Top In Product Execution, But Ethereum Is Superior


								Solana and Ethereum are the clear competitors in the epic battle of supremacy. Though Ethereum was the first smart contracts platform, there are inherent problems like scalability that new chains like Solana and Cardano, for example, aim to solve.
Solana Developers Doing Well In “Product Execution” And Communication
Taking to X, one observer notes that while Solana might be gaining traction, Ethereum remains superior. From mid-last year, and driven by the positive progress in the resolution of the FTX bankruptcy, SOL prices have been on a sharp uptrend. 

Network activity, mainly meme coins, has been fanning demand, pushing its valuation to fifth in the market cap ranking. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains perched at second, primarily because of its first-mover advantage and the depth of its ecosystem.

Developers searching for cheap transactions have been increasingly deploying on Solana. At its core, the platform is designed to be highly performant. Its architecture allows for fast transaction speeds and low costs, making it an attractive option for developers and users seeking efficiency. 
The analyst noted that this appeal will only grow because Solana developers take product execution and communications “very well.” 
The decision to lean on product execution means developers desiring a network offering high throughput, similar to traditional platforms, can find a home. Since the network can scale, it can duck the high gas fees plaguing legacy chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
Is Ethereum A Superior Technology With Poor Marketing?
Even so, their preference for “product execution” is also Solana’s undoing. Blockchain purists argue that though Ethereum is slow, at least it is decentralized. The decentralization in the second most valuable network gives it an edge, allowing it to have a higher level of reliability.
Ethereum’s optimization for decentralization means it operates on a more distributed network of nodes, enhancing its security and resilience against censorship. So far, beaconcha.in data shows there are over 1.8 million validators, and the number keeps increasing.

However, this emphasis on decentralization comes at a cost. Ethereum is slower and more expensive than Solana, which, the analyst said, is more centralized in exchange for higher performance, slashing transaction costs. 

Subsequently, due to the emphasis on decentralization, the analyst thinks Ethereum is emerging as a choice infrastructure primitive, boosting great tech. Since it was the first smart contracts network, it is emerging as a platform for creating virtually any verifiable system, including cheap and performant solutions.

Bitcoin miner reserve drops to 1.81M BTC: What’s happening? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin Miner Reserve drops to year-to-date low.
This suggests an uptick in miner coin sell-offs.

Bitcoin [BTC] Miner Reserve has fallen to its lowest level since the beginning of the year, data from CryptoQuant has shown.
This metric measures the amount of coins held in affiliated miners’ wallets. Its value indicates the reserve that miners have yet to sell. At press time, 1.81 million BTC valued at $125 billion at current market prices were held across miner wallets.
Source: CryptoQuant
When BTC Miner Reserve declines, it suggests that miners on the Bitcoin network are distributing their coins for profit or to sort mining costs. 
Data from CryptoQuant showed that after an extended period of decline, BTC Miner Reserve initiated an uptrend on 8th April, as the market awaited the fourth Bitcoin halving scheduled for 19th April. 
After the halving event, the metric rose briefly to peak at 1.82 million BTC on 23rd April, after which it re-commenced its downtrend. Since then, the amount of BTC miners held has declined by 1%.
Interestingly, there has been a decline in miner-to-exchange activity in the past three months. 
Per CryptoQuant’s data, the flow of BTC from miners’ wallets to exchanges assessed (using a 30-day moving average )has declined by 48% since its year-to-date (YTD) high of 11,853 BTC recorded on 27th March.
Source: CryptoQuant
This, however, does not mean that miners have not been selling their coins. They may have been selling their BTCs through Over-the-Counter (OTC) markets instead of directly to exchanges. 
They might also be engaging in Peer-to-Peer sales, where they sell directly to buyers without using exchanges. 
Bitcoin bulls and bears slug it out
According to CoinMarketCap data, BTC exchanged hands at $68,988 at press time. The leading crypto asset has continued to face significant resistance at the $70,000 price level. 
Assessed on a three-day chart, the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were 57.72 and 40.95, respectively.

A combined reading of the values of these key momentum indicators suggested that while the market witnessed a rise in buying momentum, there was also notable selling activity in the market. 
For BTC’s price to rally past $70,000, buying pressure has to increase and surpass profit-taking activity.

Crypto set for a âbright June," according to industry experts - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US sets a good tone for the crypto market at the end of 2024’s second quarter. Investors’ eyes are all over how the ETH price will react, how the altcoin market will behave, and what altcoin ETFs might be presented to the SEC in the upcoming weeks. Industry experts shared with Crypto Briefing their insights into June’s outlook.Tristan Frizza, founder of decentralized exchange Zeta Markets, stated that the crypto market will continue with “choppy” action in the short term. However, Bitcoin (BTC) whales are still accumulating BTC, while the beginning of Ethereum ETFs trading might drive demand for ETH up. This paints an optimistic view for the long term in 2024, especially as the ETF approval is likely to ripple positive sentiment throughout the broader marketAdditionally, with the rising speculation on market direction, the market might see an increase in on-chain derivatives trading volume over time. Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, also believes that the approval of the Ethereum ETFs represents a significant milestone for crypto, capable of further integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. Furthermore, it boosts investors’ confidence in the short term.
“The ETF’s approval is expected to boost investor confidence and could lead to a price surge for ETH. The increased liquidity and stability from institutional investments could make ETH a more attractive asset for both retail and institutional investors,” Kooner added.
Marko Jurina, CEO of Jumper.Exchange, highlighted that the US tax payments have been completed, and China is injecting additional liquidity into the Yuan. Moreover, there is an expectation that the European Central Bank (ECB) will cut rates in June or July, amidst persistent inflation in Europe. Notably, crude oil prices have fallen below $80 for the first time since February, which can be seen as a de facto consumer stimulus.
“These factors are converging to create a potentially volatile market environment, especially as we approach the US presidential elections. Consequently, we anticipate increased market interest and a likely positive trend throughout the summer,” Jurina assessed.
On top of a June heated with speculations over the starting date of Ethereum ETF trading in the US, James Davies, co-founder and CPO of Crypto Valley Exchange, expects a “meme coin summer” soon. The memetic-based trading might overflow to the traditional markets, with stocks such as GameStop also receiving significant attention.
“We see a summer containing the pump of meme coins similar to the NFT summer of 2021.  As a result, we will probably see some retail money pulled from other high-yield projects temporarily,” explained Davies. He added that another major event for crypto in June includes the continued arrival of more traditional market players into the space.
Darren Franceschini, co-founder of Fideum, was quick to state that the market “can buckle up for a bright June,” as technical indicators from the crypto market point towards a rebound. 
“Innovation in the blockchain space keeps pushing forward, and who knows, maybe June will see some exciting new developments. The broader economy looking good too – the Fed’s taking a measured approach with interest rates which could fuel steady growth. Experts are feeling bullish, and June might just be the turning point for a fantastic summer for both crypto and the world’s finances.”
Year of electionsTwo important elections might impact the crypto market in 2024: the elections for the European Parliament and the US presidential elections. The European Parliament elections are close, set to happen between June 6th and June 9th. Jag Kooner, from Bitfinex, highlights that this election is important for shaping future legislation, including policies on cryptocurrencies. 
“The elections could see a major shift in the political landscape, with right-wing and populist parties expected to gain substantial ground. This shift could influence regulatory stances, potentially leading to more stringent controls or, conversely, more supportive policies depending on the composition of the new parliament,” added Kooner.
Notably, this has a direct impact on the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. MiCA aims to create a unified regulatory framework for crypto across the European Union, providing legal clarity and potentially attracting more investment. 
“The outcome of the elections will determine the pace and enthusiasm with which these regulations are implemented. A parliament more favorable to crypto could accelerate the adoption of supportive regulations, boosting market confidence. Conversely, a shift towards more conservative policies could introduce new compliance challenges and uncertainty,” stated Bitfinex’s head of derivatives.
Moreover, although set to happen on November 5th this year, the US elections might start impacting the regulatory landscape for crypto already in June. Tristan Frizza, from Zeta Markets, underscored that the market is already considering the effects of a potential Trump win in the upcoming US elections, and that could lead to a more crypto-friendly administration.

DIY Chatbot: Raspberry Pi Serves Up $70 AI Module - Decrypt

Micro-computer developer Raspberry Pi is adding artificial intelligence to its latest motherboard model, the Raspberry Pi Foundation said on Tuesday.Developed in collaboration with artificial intelligence processor developer Hailo, the Raspberry Pi AI Kit is available to upgrade the Raspberry Pi 5 and retails for $70 the UK-based charity said. With the new AI upgrade, the tiny and affordable computer can run AI models—including chatbots, object recognition and pose detection, if a camera is attached.“If you’ve ever wanted to experiment with the world of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and machine learning on your Raspberry Pi 5, we have the perfect product for you,” Senior Principal Engineer at Raspberry Pi Naushir Patuck wrote.According to Raspberry Pi, the AI kit comes preassembled with a Hailo-8L “entry-level” AI accelerator module designed to support products that require limited AI capacity or lower performance.The small, affordable, modular Raspberry Pi hardware has fostered a massive do-it-yourself community, which has used the credit card-sized computers to power everything from small form media centers to Bitcoin nodes. Raspberry Pi is a popular tool for teaching children how to build and program computers, as well as other projects.Image: Raspberry PiAccording to Raspberry Pi documentation, the AI Kit connects to the Raspberry Pi 5 motherboard using an M.2 HAT+ adapter, which allows the AI Kit to run independently of the Raspberry Pi motherboard.The Raspberry Pi motherboard uses a Unix-based operating system, Raspberry Pi OS, that will need to be configured to take advantage of the AI add-on.“When the host Raspberry Pi 5 is running an up-to-date Raspberry Pi OS image, it automatically detects the Hailo module and makes the [Neural Processing Unit], available for AI computing tasks,” Raspberry Pi wrote.Once installed, Raspberry Pi users can go to Hailo’s “Model Zoo,” which features a library of pre-trained AI models.Launched in 2017, Tel Aviv-based Hailo develops AI hardware, accelerators, and systems used in autonomous vehicles, and generative AI models. In April, Hailo announced the close of a $120 million funding round, coinciding with the release of its latest AI accelerator, the Hailo-10.“We are thrilled to support Raspberry Pi and empower its vibrant community of professional engineers and creative makers with cutting-edge AI capabilities,” Hailo CEO and co-founder Orr Danon said in a separate statement. “Our partnership with the world’s leading single-board computer provider will inspire a new era of computing, enhanced by our high-performance AI processing capacity.”The Raspberry Pi Foundation and Hailo did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Can Shiba Inu Price Reach A New ATH Of $0.0001? Analyst Says it’s Closer Than You Think | Bitcoinist.com


								Despite having a good year in 2024, the Shiba Inu price has yet to beat its previous all-time high price of $0.00008. This has sparked speculations of whether the meme coin would be able to reach new milestones such as $0.0001. In regards to this, a crypto analyst has unveiled a brand new analysis and prediction that puts the Shiba Inu price 300% higher than it currently is, at a new all-time high price.
Shiba Inu Price Can Reach $0.0001
Shiba Inu community member Shib Knight shared an analysis that has raised the hopes of investors. This analysis shows what looks to be support for Shiba Inu already being formed at around $0.000025. From here, it is possible for the meme coin’s price to bounce and rally.

The target laid out by the crypto analyst puts the SHIB price at above $0.0001. This is a price target that was called for in the 2021 bull market, but the meme coin had failed to reach it. Instead stopping at $0.00008 before crashing around 90% in the bear market.
However, it seems that Shiba Inu has finally gathered enough momentum to retire at this level once more. According to Shib Knight, the price will rise the almost 350% required to reclaim this level. But that is not the most interesting thing about this prediction.
The time frame suggests by the crypto analyst for when this will happen is what has caught the attention of crypto investors. If the analyst is correct, then the Shiba Inu price would be sitting above $0.0001 sometime this June.


SHIB Holds Up Well Amid Market Crash
One thing that has shone through for Shiba Inu is its ability to retain a good portion of its value even as prices are crashing. Over the last day, the Bitcoin price has fallen below $69,000 once more, taking the market down with it. Many cryptocurrencies have notched double-digit losses in the last week as a result of this, but not all have suffered this fate.

More specifically, meme coins such as BONK and PEPE have suffered notable losses, with the former falling more than 22.5% and the latter seeing 14.6% losses. Likewise, others such as FLOKI and Dogwifhat have seen their losses cross 10%.
However, Shiba Inu maintains one of the lowest loss rates, falling only behind Dogecoin in top meme coins. While Shiba Inu has fallen only 6.2% during this time, Dogecoin has fallen 5.3%. This makes the top mee coins the strongest when it comes to weathering a market crash.

GameStop memecoin experiences record volume amid 300% surge - AMBCrypto



GME started the month with an over 300% spike in value.
The volume has set another ATH record.

U.S. financial analyst Keith Gill’s actions once again stirred the market, triggering another surge in the GameStop memecoin. This surge followed a similar rise in the stock equivalent after Gill reactivated his account on Reddit.
GameStop memecoin resurgence
On 3rd June, the value of GameStop memecoin soared by over 300%. This surge was attributed to posts by Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty, on X and Reddit.
 Gill’s account posted a reverse UNO card on X, which sparked various interpretations. 
Meanwhile, on Reddit, the investor shared details of his GME stock holdings and options. Before this, Gill had been inactive on X for over two weeks and on Reddit for over three years.
Gill’s post also led to a surge in GameStop’s stock price. This isn’t the first time his social media activity has caused such reactions. In May, a post on X after years of absence stirred speculation, resulting in a significant surge in the GME memecoin’s value.
GameStop memecoin’s 300% spike
Analysis of GameStop memecoin on a daily timeframe revealed a spike of over 300% by the close of trading on 3rd June.
The memecoin surged by 269.27%, climbing from approximately $0.00038 to $0.014. In May, it experienced a remarkable rise of over 1,500% following Roaring Kitty’s post.
Source: TradingView
At the time of writing, GameStop memecoin was trading at around $0.012, marking a decline of over 14%. 
Additionally, the spike pushed it into the overbought zone according to its Relative Strength Index (RSI), which exceeded 70 before declining due to the price drop.
Analysis of GameStop memecoin’s volume on Santiment also showed a significant spike. On 3rd June, the volume surged from around $19 million to over $490 million, marking the highest volume in years. 
As of the latest data, the volume was nearly $328 million.

Solana Trader Turns $10,000 Into $400,000 in 10 Minutes With Little-Known Cryptocurrency | Cryptoglobe


                                
A cryptocurrency trader has managed to turn around $10,000 worth of Solana’s native SOL token into nearly $400,000 in just 10 minutes trading a little-known cryptocurrency on the cryptocurrency’s blockchain for a 3,900% gain in little time.



According to data shared by on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the cryptocurrency trader spent 60 SOL worth around $9,900 to buy 89.18 million $HAPPY tokens, which were launched by pseudonymous crypto user bazingahappy who spent 85 SOL worth around $14,000 to buy 793 million tokens of the cryptocurrency, or 79.3% of the total supply.







Notably, bazingahappy rejected any involvement in the trader that turned $10,000 into nearly $400,000 in just 10 minutes, replying to Lookonchain in a post suggesting the service was confusing people.



 As CryptoGlobe reported, some  astute traders (or gamblers) have managed to capitalize on the meteoric rise of Solana (SOL)-based memecoins, realizing astronomical gains in the process, with data showing, for example, one trader purchased a substantial amount of Dogwifhat (WIF) in December 2023 and has since seen a staggering 118,967% return on their investment.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Another trader has also found success with MAGA (TRUMP), a memecoin inspired by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who is currently campaigning for the presidency once more, while another made millions worth Jeo Boden (BODEN).



Shortly after former U.S. President Donald J. Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records involving reimbursements to his former lawyer Michael Cohen for hush money payments, several Trump-inspired meme-inspired cryptocurrencies were launched, with one trader making over $160,000 in just 5 hours from them.



These success stories highlight the potential for significant gains in the volatile world of cryptocurrency trading, particularly when it comes to memecoins built on the Solana blockchain.



However, it is crucial to remember that such astronomical returns are not the norm and that investing in memecoins carries a high level of risk. As with any investment, it is essential to conduct thorough research, exercise caution, and never invest more than one can afford to lose.

Bitwise CIO says market undervaluing Washington’s shifting attitude toward crypto

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan believes the market is underestimating the significance of Washington’s evolving attitude toward cryptocurrenciesHougan said in a June 4 memo that the US political landscape regarding crypto has changed significantly toward a more positive stance in recent weeks, and the market would been at a new all-time high already if its impact had been priced in.He added that the shifting tides in Washington could unlock substantial “alpha,” a term used to describe an investment strategy’s ability to outperform the market.Shifting tidesHistorically, crypto has been a partisan issue, with Republicans generally supporting it and Democrats showing resistance. Hougan cited Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) famously announcing plans to “build an anti-crypto army” last March as an example of the Democratic opposition.However, crypto advocates have been strategically building political influence, culminating in significant legislative actions.On May 8, 21 House Democrats voted alongside Republicans to repeal SAB 121, a controversial SEC rule that restricts large banks from holding crypto. The Senate followed suit, with 10 Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, joining the GOP in support of the repeal.This marked the first positive legislative action on crypto in US history.Further momentum came on May 20, when 71 Democrats joined 208 Republicans in the House to pass FIT21, a comprehensive crypto bill that would assign primary oversight to the crypto-friendly Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).Additionally, the SEC, led by Democrat-appointed chair Gary Gensler, approved filings to list spot Ethereum ETFs, a move few anticipated.Despite these advancements, crypto faces ongoing political challenges. President Joe Biden recently vetoed the repeal of SAB 121, highlighting the complex regulatory environment. However, Hougan sees these developments as a turning point.He said:“Crypto still has a long way to go, politically speaking. But the winds have started to change.”End of regulatory uncertaintyHougan believes the broader market has yet to recognize the implications of these political shifts. He said that regulatory uncertainty has long been a primary concern for financial advisors and Wall Street institutions.A recent Bitwise survey revealed that 64% of US financial advisors cite regulatory uncertainty as the main barrier to greater crypto exposure in their portfolios. Hougan argues that once this barrier is lifted, a significant portion of the estimated $20 trillion managed by these advisors could flow into crypto.The potential impact on Wall Street is equally substantial. Major financial institutions have hesitated to fully embrace crypto due to regulatory concerns. Hougan suggests that if Wall Street were to accept crypto as a mainstream asset, the market could reach new heights.While the broader market remains largely indifferent to these changes, Hougan believes this presents an opportunity for savvy investors. He said:“The market will wake up to the fact that we are in a new era for crypto. Until it does, there may just be some alpha laying around.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

BNB 'Extremely Bullish': Analyst Targets $1000 Breakout As It Hits New Yearly High


																Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has experienced a notable surge of 7% within the past 24 hours. 
This upward movement reflects the overall positive trend in the market and places BNB ahead of the top five cryptocurrencies in terms of performance. Interestingly, an important milestone has been achieved as BNB surpassed its previous yearly high of $645 from March, as the token reached a high of $673 as of Tuesday.
BNB Primed For Bullish Surge To $1,000? 
Renowned market expert “Sheldon The Sniper” believes that BNB is positioned to be one of the leading altcoins in the ongoing bull market, with a target of $1,000 if the current uptrend continues. 
Expressing an optimistic outlook, Sheldon states that Binance’s token “is looking extremely bullish” and is expected to surpass its previous all-time high of $686, which was reached in May 2021, despite being currently down 2.2% from that level.

Another crypto analyst known as Kaleo draws attention to the distractions surrounding Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) and emphasizes that BNB is on the verge of entering a “phase of price discovery.” 
Kaleo reminds that BNB played a significant role as an early leader in the previous bull market, suggesting a potential repetition of history in the current market cycle. During the 2021 bull market, BNB experienced substantial growth of 50% in late 2021. 
In addition, following the exchange’s CEO Changpeng Zhao’s conviction in April, the regulatory scrutiny surrounding Binance has significantly reduced. This positions the crypto platform and its native token favorably to capitalize on anticipated institutional inflows and a surge in trading volume.
Trading Volume Soars To $2 Billion, Market Cap Hits $100 Billion
Data from CoinGecko reveals a substantial 15% increase in BNB’s trading volume over the past 24 hours, reaching an impressive $2.3 billion compared to the previous day’s trading session. 
The market capitalization of Binance Coin currently stands at $102 billion, indicating a notable uptrend as it has gained over $6 billion within a 24-hour period, highlighting the renewed interest and inflow of capital from investors.
The sustainability of BNB’s uptrend remains uncertain, and it is crucial to monitor key levels in various potential scenarios, including sustained bullish momentum or a price correction. 
If the bullish trend continues, the next significant resistance levels in the BNB/USD daily chart are at $671 and $676. These levels represent three-year hurdles for the token and must be overcome for further upward movement. 
Conversely, it is essential for bulls to defend the $633 level, as a breach between this support level and the current price of $668 could result in a significant loss of gains if a retest occurs.

	Related Reading


In sum, Binance Coin has showcased a significant performance in the market, outperforming major cryptocurrencies and achieving new milestones. 
With experts expressing optimism about its future, BNB’s potential to surpass its previous all-time high and lead the current bull market is generating considerable excitement among traders and investors.

FLOKI: Will a $12M investment set the stage for a bull run? - AMBCrypto



The statement seemed to have triggered positive sentiment around FLOKI.
A key metric flashed a buy signal, suggesting that FLOKI’s price could be set to hit $0.000030.

Floki [FLOKI] is in the news again, and this time, it could be for the right things holders can think of. On the 4th of June, the Floki development team announced that market maker DWF Labs has agreed to purchase $12 million in FLOKI tokens.
For context, market makers are individuals or entities that provide liquidity for projects or exchanges. According to the disclosure, the purchase would be geared at supporting the Floki ecosystem at large. The Medium post read,
“This strategic purchase is aimed at further strengthening Floki’s position in the industry, especially in what is poised to be one of Floki’s most pivotal years ever due to the impending release of several key products.”
However, this was not the first time DWF Labs was helping the token to boost its adoption. In February, the market maker committed $10 million to the memecoin.
New money, higher market cap?
Between that time and the time of writing, FLOKI’s price has increased by 69.13%, suggesting that the injection of liquidity had a good impact on the token’s value.
Apart from that, the FLOKI team development released a trading bot last week, suggesting that it was committed to improving the utility on the network. At press time, the price of the cryptocurrency was $0.00026.
This was a 5.60% decrease in the last 24 hours. However, with the latest announcement, FLOKI might begin to walk its way up in what it referred to as the “most explosive bull run.”
Source: CoinMarketCap
There have also been predictions that FLOKI could hit a $10 billion market cap this cycle. As of this writing, the market cap was $2.53 billion as shown above.
Therefore, if the metric hit such level, the memecoin’s price could be worth $0.0010.
It is time to set entries
In terms of the Weighted Sentiment, AMBCrypto observed that it was -0.119. This implies that there were more negative comments about the project that positive ones.
However, one thing we noticed that the perception was getting better suggesting that demand for FLOKI might begin to increase. Another metric supporting this upswing was the Mean Coin Age (MCA).
Source: Santiment
At press time, the 90-day MCA had decreased. Before now, FLOKI had high coin-age activity which meant that old tokens were moving into exchanges. This was one of the reasons the price plunged.
But the decreasing metric implies that many holders are retiring their tokens into self-custody. As such, FLOKI might not experience a wave of selling pressure. To evaluate if it could be a good time to buy FLOKI, AMBCrypto looked at the price-DAA divergence.
DAA stands for Daily Active Addresses. So, the metric combines the relationship between network activity and price to predict entry and exit points.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s FLOKI’s market cap in DOGE terms

As of this writing, the price-DAA divergence was -1083%, indicating that the price grew more than the active addresses.
This is a strong buy signal with evidence from the surge in February when FLOKI rallied to $0.00030.

Is Bitcoin ready for a rally? These market indicators say otherwise - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin speculators were reluctant to bid, based on the Open Interest stagnation.
Funding rates were only slightly positive, and BTC might not be ready to rally.

Bitcoin [BTC] held on to the $67k support level, defending the previous week’s gains and the bulls were looking to build on it. At press time, the price was at $68.9k, and the $71.4k-$71.6k is the next resistance zone.
The trading volume slump posed a threat to the bulls. Short-term holder profitability also grew. The coin days destroyed metric soared recently, which could spark Bitcoin volatility.
Assessing the speculator sentiment

In a post on X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst Axel Adler observed that the weekly change in Open Interest was neutral at -1%. This came even though BTC had flipped the $67k level to support and was aiming to push higher.
The lack of speculative interest over the past week indicated that most market participants were sidelined. They were unwilling to bet on price movements and lacked bullish conviction. This could see BTC form a short-term range between $67k and $71.5k.
The analyst also reflected that this would need to change for Bitcoin to embark on its next trend.
The lack of bull dominance pointed toward a lethargic market

In another post, the analyst also showed that dramatic price surges have been accompanied by spikes in funding rates. In late 2020 and early 2021, the massive rally from $20k was accompanied by periods of high funding rates that reached +0.15.
The rally since 2023 October also saw the funding rate spike above the +0.03 mark. However, at press time, it was at +0.008.

This showed a lack of bullish conviction. Combined with the slump in the weekly trading volume, the evidence strongly hinted that Bitcoin is not ready to breakout past the $72k area yet.
Investors and traders need to be prepared for more rangebound price action in the coming weeks.

From Frog to Fortune: Crypto Trader Makes Nearly $5 Million Over Six Months With Memecoin Bet | Cryptoglobe


                                
A cryptocurrency trader has managed to make nearly $5 million in profit over a six-month period through a position in the memecoin named after the popular internet frog Pepe, investing $490,000 into the cryptocurrency to buy 365.96 billion PEPE late last year to only realize their gains now.



The trader has now deposited their funds on leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance after HODLing them for over half a year after buying them on MEXC, a cryptocurrency exchange, to secure a return on investment of nearly 1,000%.



According to data shared by on-chain analysis service, the trader’s profit with the move is of around $4.8 million.







This isn’t an isolated case, as an early investor in the meme-inspired cryptocurrency recently realized a gain of around $3.4 million from an investment of little over $460 they made in the cryptocurrency’s early days to realize a gain of nearly 740,000%.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

These successes are driven by the speculative nature of mmecoins, which unlike traditional investments aren’t tied to the performance of an underlying company or market, but are seen as instead being tied to their respective communities.



To some analysts, memecoins are just driven by online buzz and social media trends and align with the greater fool theory of investing, wherein profits are made by buying assets in the hopes of selling them to a “greater fool” that’s willing to buy them later on at a higher price.



The cryptocurrency space, itself, has been associated with the greater fools theory in the past, with Neel Kashkari, who took office as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis on 1 Jan 2016, saying it’s “just a tool of speculation & greater fools.“



This was not the first time that Kashkari has come across as a crypto skeptic. Back in August 2021, while speaking at the Pacific NorthWest Economic Region (PNWER) annual summit held in Montana he said that he was less optimistic about Bitcoin compared to five or six years ago. Rather than sparking financial innovation, Kashkari said the current landscape of crypto is comprised of “95% fraud, hype, noise and confusion.”

Analyst Projects Bitcoin To Surge 18% In Next Market Move, Here's How | Bitcoinist.com


								Against the backdrop of the recent surge in Bitcoin’s value, well-known cryptocurrency analyst and trader Javon Marks, with an optimistic outlook, has predicted the price of BTC to rise by over 18%, sending prices to unprecedented heights following a bullish breakout from a bullish pennant pattern.
Bitcoin Next Move Could Reach $80,000s Range
This impending spike predicted by Javon Marks could propel BTC to new all-time highs and result in substantial gains, positioning the coin as a promising asset in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency world. 
Last week, Javon Marks pointed out that Bitcoin, the largest crypto asset by market cap, was exhibiting mild indications of strength, Supported by a Bullish Pentacle formation. 

This strength allowed for the confirmation of a bullish pattern that may drive prices into a bullish breakout. Should a breakout occur, Javon Marks anticipates a potential 17.1% surge in the asset’s price to the $80,000 range.
The post read:
Bitcoin (BTC) has just recently tested the Support of a Bullish Pennant pattern and is showing light signs of strength off of it. With this strength, a bullish pattern is confirmed that can lead prices into a bullish breakout. A break could result in a 17.1% push to $80,000+.
However, a few days later, the crypto analyst highlighted that Bitcoin was holding back from the bullish pennant pattern after pushing heavily off support. In reaction to this breakout, Javon Marks claims a potential near +18% increase for Bitcoin into the $80,000s could occur soon.
Meanwhile, today, the expert has confirmed the breakout from the bullish pennant pattern, reiterating his 18% price spike into the $80,000s level at a much faster pace.
Javon Marks appears to be very bullish about the crypto asset, as he predicts a move to $116,652 and beyond in another X post. The analyst claims the move to the price above level seems much more likely to happen from $69,225, and it will happen sooner rather than later than most people realize. “Something here is in the works, and it may be, right now, in its early stages of being unveiled,” the expert added.
Breakout From The Pattern After An 18-Day Consolidation
Javon Marks’s analysis aligns with cryptocurrency expert Captain Faibik’s outlook for the digital asset. Captain Faibik has also confirmed a breakout from the bullish pennant formation in BTC’s chart.

Faibik stated that BTC is breaking out of the pattern after undergoing a consolidation phase for over 18 days. As a result, he believes the coin could reach a new all-time high in the upcoming days.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price has increased by 1.41% to $70,000, with a market capitalization of more than $1.38 trillion in the past day. Although BTC’s price is displaying a positive trend, its trading volume has decreased by over 8% in the past 24 hours.
