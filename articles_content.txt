Donald Trump Vets Vice Presidential Candidates: GOP's Top Contenders, Betting Odds - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump is one of the leading candidates in the 2024 presidential election.After a falling out with former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump is set to select a new vice-presidential candidate to join his campaign for the 2024 election.What Happened: Trump remains the betting favorite to win the 2024 presidential election after being found guilty on 34 federal counts in a highly publicized criminal trial alleging falsified business records.While Trump awaits sentencing and an appeal in the legal process, attention on the 2024 election campaign for the former president is turning to who he will select as his running mate.Trump's campaign team has begun vetting top contenders as reported by the Associated Press.The list of vice president candidates who received vetting requests from Trump's campaign team include:North Dakota Gov. Doug BurgumSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)  Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio)Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.)Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.)Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.)Ben CarsonSources said that candidates have been asked for various levels of paperwork as part of the vetting process.The vetting process could signal a vice-presidential pick coming sooner than later, but Trump's campaign team cautioned that the process is still early."Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump," Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement shared by the Associated Press.The Republican National Convention in July could serve as one potential event to announce a running mate according to a report.Several of the candidates who have been vetted recently were among the key people who showed up at Trump's hush money trial to show support for the former president and in some cases to criticize the legal process and individuals involved as a way for Trump to get around a gag order.Related Link: Trump Found Guilty On All 34 Counts In Hush Money Criminal Trial: Here’s What Happens NextBetting Odds: With the recent list of candidates being vetted, the betting odds on prediction market Polymarket have changed.Calling itself the world's largest prediction market, Polymarket offers betting on items in categories such as politics, sports, cryptocurrency, pop culture and more.On Polymarket, users deposit to Polygon MATIC/USD using USDC USDC/USD and can deposit with Ethereum ETH/USD. Winning wagers cash out at $1.Over $31 million has been bet on the site for the market of who Trump will choose for his vice president candidate, up from $17 million at the end of April.Here are the current odds for Trump's vice president on Polymarket, with odds from May 9 in parentheses:Tim Scott: 25% (19%)Other Man: 17% (20%)Marco Rubio: 11% (9%)JD Vance: 10% (13%)Ben Carson: 8% (4%)Sarah Huckabee Sanders: 7% (2%)Other Woman: 6% (8%)Elise Stefanik: 5% (5%)Vivek Ramaswamy: 5% (1%)Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: 4% (3%)Scott has jumped to the top of the leaderboard on Polymarket as the current betting favorite. In early May, the Other Man option was the favorite. With Burgum not listed individually, the North Dakota governor falls into this category.Burgum has been spending increased time with the former president and viewed by some political experts as a frontrunner.Back in January, Stefanik and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem were the betting favorites on Polymarket. Controversy may have sent Noem off the shortlist and Stefanik was the only female candidate on the reported list of seven candidates being vetted.Time will tell who Trump selects as his running mate. With a close election predicted for the head-to-head rematch against President Joe Biden, Trump’s vice presidential candidate could prove increasingly important to win over certain demographics and independent voters.Read Next: Trump Vs.

Magnetic X's Farming Protocol Drives Liquidity to XRP Ledger


							

Magnetic X’s DeFi platform on XRP Ledger fuels yield farming rewards for users.



Total value locked in XRP Ledger AMM pools surpasses $5.3 million.



High APRs drive growing interest in yield farming on the XRP Ledger.




Magnetic X, a protocol facilitating applications on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has reported significant growth in its DeFi ecosystem.



Over 37 days, 703 users (“farmers”) have collectively earned over 50,000 XRP through Magnetic X’s platform, showcasing its potential for generating rewards.







The protocol’s total liquidity now stands at 1.9 million XRP, bolstering its MAG token, currently priced at 2,240 XRP. This growth coincides with the recent surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) in XRPL AMM pools, surpassing 10 million XRP as of June 3rd.



While the recent introduction of AMM functionality to XRPL faced initial challenges with low fees, “farming” has emerged as a potential solution. By offering higher income opportunities, farming incentivizes users to provide liquidity, thereby revitalizing the AMM ecosystem.









It is to be noted that on April 30, Magnetic X had introduced XRPL farming, which quickly became popular within the community.



Notable farming pools, such as the MAG/XRP pool and a pool with a 68,000 XRP TVL and 63.56% APR, have attracted significant attention due to their high returns. The 666/XRP pool, with a TVL of 108,000 XRP and an impressive APR of 180.45%, further demonstrates the growing interest in XRPL farming.







This surge in activity aligns with a broader trend of increasing TVL in XRPL AMM pools, which has grown from 7.4 million XRP six weeks ago to over $5.3 million as of today.

'The Sandbox' Ethereum Game Valued at $1 Billion With New Funding - Decrypt

The Sandbox, an Ethereum metaverse game platform, announced Wednesday that it has raised $20 million in convertible promissory notes at a $1 billion valuation. That makes the long-running project the latest crypto “unicorn,” based on the billion-dollar valuation.The latest funding round was led by Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands; Animoca, a prominent metaverse investment firm, is also the parent of The Sandbox’s operating company, Bacasable Global Limited. LG Tech Ventures and True Global Ventures also participated in the round."We are deeply honored by the continuing commitment to the vision of The Sandbox, and we're incredibly excited about the future of composable user-generated content games," said Animoca co-founder and executive chairman Yat Siu, in a statement.With the new funding in tow, The Sandbox’s development team said that its key priorities include improving creator tools, adding new social and gameplay features, and developing a mobile version scheduled for 2025.The Sandbox is one of the most prominent blockchain games, thanks to partnerships with over 400 celebrities and brands—including Snoop Dogg, Gucci, and Paris Hilton—and previously immense demand for in-game land plots sold via NFTs. In fact, someone paid $450,000 worth of crypto for a land plot near Snoop Dogg’s metaverse mansion in 2021.The game’s SAND token on Ethereum remains one of the 100 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world based on market cap, per data from CoinGecko.

Ethereum’s Prospects for Hitting New All-Time High a ‘Certainty,’ Says Crypto Trader - But There’s a Catch - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst believes Ethereum (ETH) is heading to new all-time highs (ATHs).
Pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,900 followers on the social media platform X that ETH will likely have a massive breakout against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC).










However, the trader warns that the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) continues to act as resistance for the ETH/BTC pair and there may be more downside before a breakout.
“ETH: ETH/BTC has underperformed for a while now, interesting to see that the 200-week exponential moving average is still bearish (last time it was bearish like this was March 2021). To be determined if this recent price action is ‘the bottom.’ ETH to ATH is still a certainty, but I think that this is still disturbing to watch.”



Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X



ETH/BTC is trading for 0.05384 BTC ($3,841) at time of writing, up nearly 1% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum reached an all-time high of about $4,900 in November 2021.
The analyst also believes that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), which tracks the percentage of the total market cap that belongs to Bitcoin, will continue to be bullish until the fourth quarter of this year, meaning altcoins could lag behind BTC until then.
“You should probably accumulate shitcoins from now until late Q4. Hard to say what the particular timing is but most alt/BTC pairs are going to continue to go down in my opinion. But once Q4 rolls around, expecting BTC.D to come down and for there to be some alt action.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests BTC.D will reach a peak level at around 64%, about 10% higher than the current level.

Bitcoin Miner Selling Intensifies, BTC Reserves Fall To 3-Year Lows | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin miners’ reserves have seen a steady decline over the past few months since the halving event in April. The latest figures indicate a massive decline to 3-year lows, signaling intense selling pressure from miners amidst fluctuating BTC prices and market volatility.
Bitcoin Miner Holdings Drop To New Lows
Before the Bitcoin halving event on April 20, market experts foresaw potential challenges for Bitcoin miners as block rewards become reduced by half. This prediction is showing true, as BTC miner holdings have witnessed a severe decline over the past few months. 

According to the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin miners’ reserves have fallen from 1.84 million BTC in the previous year to about 1.80 million BTC presently. This drop suggests that BTC miner holdings are currently at their lowest levels since Bitcoin’s Satoshi era days, which was approximately 14 years ago. 
CryptoQuant also disclosed that BTC miner reserves are down 50% from previous highs, indicating an increased selling volume from miners. This selling pressure is likely induced by the increased mining operational costs as investors continue selling off their Bitcoin holdings to acquire better mining equipment to remain financially stable. 
The cost of BTC mining is escalating as electricity prices rise and mining rewards reduce. The need for more efficient hardware has also become increasingly urgent in order to keep up with the complexities associated with BTC mining.  
Moreover, Bloomberg reported that BTC miners stand to lose $10 billion in revenue annually, spurred on by the far-reaching effects of the Bitcoin halving cycle. This pessimistic outlook is also magnified as BTC mining hash rates reach 3-year lows after witnessing its largest crash since 2021. 
Excluding miner reserves, the price of Bitcoin witnessed massive declines after the halving event in April. At the time, its trading volume plummeted significantly, suggesting a decline in investor demand and interest in the cryptocurrency. 
Currently, BTC seems to be steadily approaching its all-time high, surging past the $71,000 mark earlier this week. The unexpected momentum has been partly attributed to the increased inflows from investors into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs has also had a positive impact on the price of BTC, indicating investors increasing interest in the cryptocurrency. 
BTC Miners Turn To AI
Amidst Bitcoin miners dwindling reserves, many are now turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a way to generate more revenue. Recently Core Scientific, a BTC mining titan, announced a 12-year collaboration with Core Weave, a specialized cloud provider and AI hyperscaler. 

Core Scientific has revealed plans to support CoreWeave, expanding the relationship between the two companies in the hopes of generating more than $3.5 million in revenue over the next 12 years.

BNB's Impossible Pump | Bankless


Sudden Surge. Binance founder CZ just started his 4-month prison sentence, but that hasn’t stopped the native token of his exchange’s closely affiliated BNB Chain from achieving its highest price ever! Why is BNB outperforming this week?BNB has gained over 20% off Monday’s lows, breaking out above $700 for the first time in history. It has not given back a rally since shortly after Binance’s November settlement announcement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.Although BNB is exhibiting outsized strength at the moment, it is not alone in the pump. This move up comes at the same time as many cryptos, stocks, and commodities have gained on investor optimism as major Western central banks commence their rate cut processes.Source: TradingViewMany onchain BNB metrics have ticked steadily upwards this week, with daily transaction fees and DEX volumes seeing the greatest impacts from the surging speculative activity that has resulted from BNB’s gains; both metrics have more than doubled from Monday!While the majority of blockchains – from Solana to Sei and Arbitrum to Optimism – have seen on-chain usage statistics slide lower this week, BNB Chain has been one of the few holdouts to experience increases in daily active addresses and transaction counts.Unfortunately, these recent increases are merely blips from a longer-term time perspective, and every major onchain BNB metric remains well below its March 2024 local highs set after BTC obtained new all-time highs.Indicating that this rally has largely been driven by speculation, open interest on BNB perpetual swaps has exploded by 50% during this week's move up to reach $1.05B, the highest level on record, suggesting that leverage traders (who will eventually need to close their positions) heavily contributed to the gains.Source: CoinGlassShould crypto prices continue to rise in the coming months as global central banks lower their interest rate targets, BNB likely ascends alongside, and is a prime candidate for outperformance among the majors.BNB’s relative strength has increased by a respective 29% and 35% against BTC and ETH during 2024, and despite the fact that there is zero possibility this token receives a spot ETF at any time in the future like these two alternatives, its holders could be positioned for enhanced upside if recent performance holds.

Top Crypto Analyst Shuffles Altcoin Portfolio Before Ethereum ETF: Here's What He Rotated Into - Benzinga

Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe shared insights about recent adjustments to his altcoin portfolio in a new podcast episode.What Happened: Van de Poppe remains optimistic about altcoins, focusing on higher ROI prospects, influenced by the pending approval of the Ethereum ETH/USD ETF. He detailed that around four weeks ago, he went all-in on altcoins but has since adjusted their specific holdings."Altcoins are going to do really well," he said, attributing recent underperformance to Bitcoin ETF impacts. He noted his high-risk appetite, quoting, "That’s how I made a lot of money and that’s how I lost a lot of money."He adds that the reason for markets to trade sideways is due to the Ether ETF has not been entirely approved, with only the 19B-4 filings greenlit but not the S-1 filings. He predicted, "Once that kicks in, the interest starts to come into the markets and into the ETF."Altcoin Rotation StrategyHe emphasized targeting altcoins with higher potential returns, specifically those affected by Binance’s recent focus on low floating high FDV coins. Coins like Celestia TIA/USD saw significant runs after listing on Binance, illustrating the exchange's market-moving power.Focusing on market movers like Binance and BlackRock is crucial as BTC price surge was led by BlackRock’s ETF involvement. He stressed the importance of shifting from older altcoins like Atom ATOM/USD and Curve CRV/USD which have underperformed, to newer projects with better upside potential. Some examples include:
Renzo RENZO/USD: This one dropped around 70% since and is showing an opportunity.



Portal PORTAL/USD: A gaming coin with a relatively higher floating supply. It has seen a drop of 70 to 80% and starts to grind up.

ECB rate cut could spur Bitcoin and stablecoin growth in Eurozone, experts highlight - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates by 0.25% today, making it the first cut in five years and reducing it to 3.75%. Crypto industry experts shared with Crypto Briefing that this movement is important for different reasons, as it raises important questions about stablecoins in the European Union and the demand for Bitcoin in the Eurozone.Aurelie Barthere, Principal Research analyst at Nansen, explained that the ECB’s rate cut was already priced in by the markets, so investors shouldn’t have surprises. 
“In general, the ECB has less influence than the Fed on crypto markets, and the ECB follows the Fed, not the other way around. The reason why the ECB cut earlier than the Fed is the weakness of growth in the Eurozone vs the US,” Barthere added.
As reported by BBC, Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB said the outlook for inflation had improved “markedly”, paving the way for the rate cut. Yet, Lagarde warned investors to keep their hopes in check, as inflation might average 2.5% in 2024, and the ECB would keep interest rate policy “sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary.”Nevertheless, the ECB decision might benefit the crypto market indirectly, highlighted Eneko Knörr, CEO of Stabolut. “While European economic policies might not have a direct influence on global crypto trends, lower interest rates generally drive investors toward higher-risk, higher-return assets,” he explained.As a result, crypto might become more attractive as investors seek better yields. Therefore, the rate cut could boost interest in crypto as part of a broader search for higher returns.Moreover, Bitfinex analysts assessed that this move aims to stimulate economic growth amid signs of a slowdown in the Eurozone, although this might weaken the euro. This is good news for crypto, as investors in the European Union could ramp up their demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin. “The increased liquidity from this monetary easing could also support risk assets, including crypto.”Kevin de Patoul, CEO of Keyrock, is also keen to believe that the rate cuts are a bullish signal for markets with higher risks and potential returns. Additionally, the stablecoin sector in the Eurozone might witness a significant impact. 
“This move raises important questions about the future of EURO stablecoins, especially in light of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation coming into effect in June. The rate cut could significantly impact the financial outlook for EURO stablecoin issuers.”
Weighing if this decision affects the FOMC meeting next week in the US, Knörr stated that the Fed decisions are largely irrelevant to ECB actions, and vice-versa. However, the ECB’s rate cut might signal to markets that inflation concerns may be easing.

Jim Cramer is right: Dog coin ETFs are this bull market’s missing spark - Blockworks


All things considered, there probably won’t be a BONK ETF anytime soon.
But the notion that cryptocurrencies might one day invade the stodgy stock market via ETFs is seriously compelling. 
Mad Money host Jim Cramer was on the right track during his CNBC appearance yesterday. “Why shouldn’t there be a BONK ETF?” Cramer asked SEC Chair Gary Gensler.
However, the real trick to getting SEC approval has turned out to be courting CME, which is regulated by the CFTC — and not Gensler’s agency. Bitcoin and ether both had futures markets for years before spot ETFs were approved.
Perhaps a dog coin fund might be an easier sell. Coinbase Derivatives, which is also regulated by the CFTC, launched its own dogecoin futures markets not long ago.
CME Group denied it had any plans for dogecoin futures when rumors circulated in 2021. What better time to revisit that decision than now?
CNBC talks memecoins — a bull signal?
It wasn’t even just a BONK ETF that was floated on CNBC yesterday. Cramer also made the case for ETFs backed by sushiswap, polkadot, cardano (he called it “cordano”), immutable, ronin and osmosis and myneighbouralice.
“[They have] all traded millions — I’m talking millions of dollars this very morning… I would think that BONK is a natural, and osmosis… shouldn’t we have some sort of product?”
Gensler sidestepped by redirecting the question to the matter of disclosure. Today is the SEC’s 90th birthday, he said, and reminded the audience (talking into the camera) that President Roosevelt created the Commission to ensure sellers of securities openly inform prospective investors so they can make better decisions.
The moment Gensler found out about $CRAMER, which spiked up to 500% following the segment (Source: CNBC Television)
Gensler’s point was that those disclosures supposedly aren’t happening across crypto. If you ask lobbyists, industry lawyers and founders, this is because issuers and protocol stewards simply don’t consider the tokens securities or investment contracts — so there’s no disclosure required. And in many cases, there’s no centralized entity through which to disclose.

Then Gensler came for the crypto exchanges. 
“These crypto exchanges, Jim, are doing things we would never allow this New York Stock Exchange to do,” Gensler said. “Our laws don’t allow you to trade against your customers.”
But the previous questions were awkward for Gensler, even before Cramer brought up memecoins that borrow likenesses of celebrities and other media personalities, including himself and the SEC chair.
(Gensler said those should be registered as securities, but it’s unclear whether he fully grokked the concept of memecoins about public figures that weren’t issued by the actual person.)
Cramer may not have remembered, but the SEC already labeled cardano a security in both Coinbase and Binance lawsuits filed last June, alongside a dozen others including solana, polygon, BNB, internet computer, filecoin and Axie Infinity. 
So far, the companies and entities working to build out those ecosystems haven’t been sued — just crypto exchanges found listing them. Tron founder Justin Sun was sued separately months before over TRX and bittorrent (BTT), while the SEC stung Ripple Labs for XRP in December 2020 and sent Uniswap Labs a Wells notice in April.


The colorful band of lines beneath the cross pulls downward following the lawsuits — but few have recovered
Still, the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits coincided with a severe drop in the bitcoin ratios for the tokens singled out by the SEC. 
Most had fallen more than 10% against bitcoin in the three days following the suits, with those losses doubling over the next two weeks or so. Bitcoin itself dropped around 7% over the same period.
To date, only bitcoin ratios for solana and near have made it back out of the 13 tokens named by the SEC, followed by ICP, which is only just short. Ironically, near and ICP have been largely invigorated by the AI narrative, of which Gensler is a huge fan.
However, beating bitcoin (and thus growing the bitcoin ratio) has been tough this bull market, and tons of cryptocurrencies that haven’t been named as securities by the SEC have underperformed. 
This bull market has been lacking a true altcoin season. Perhaps a few filings for dogecoin ETFs will be the catalyst.

Stablecoin bill may pass before the election, says JPMorgan

Photo: Mike Segar (Reuters)The stablecoin bill is likely to be approved before the presidential election and poses a threat to Tether’s dominance, according to JPMorgan, as reported by CoinDesk. Moreover, the Federal Reserve is now less likely to issue a central bank digital currency after a House bill last month banned the central bank from doing so, per the report.Softening jobs market could actually be good news, says strategistIn light of the current state of crypto regulations in the U.S., JPMorgan shared its report on what is likely to happen in the near future. Analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team have reported that new regulatory measures seem to oppose the Federal Reserve’s development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), per CoinDesk. According to the investment bank, regulators may favor U.S.-compliant stablecoins, potentially reducing the dominance of non-compliant stablecoins, such as Tether— the biggest stablecoin, as reported by CoinDesk. Notably, stablecoins – the type of cryptocurrencies pegged to assets or fiat currencies – have faced scrutiny from regulators over their functionality. The analysts said the stablecoin bill, named “Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act,” has the potential to be passed before the 2024 presidential election. Moreover, the bank stated that U.S. banks would be discouraged from involvement in cryptocurrencies, per the report. JP Morgan did not immediately respond to a Quartz request for comment on the reported analysis.Last month, the House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which now has to be approved by the Senate and by the president. It is unlikely to happen before the election, according to the bank.

What Lower Interest Rates Mean for Crypto Investors


The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BoC) have cut interest rates, marking a pivotal shift in monetary policy. 
The ECB reduced its key rate to 3.75% from 4%, a move anticipated by markets despite ongoing inflationary pressures in the eurozone. Meanwhile, the BoC lowered its key policy rate to 4.75% from 5%, becoming the first G7 nation to do so in the current cycle.
ECB, BoC Slash Interest Rates

The ECB’s decision, influenced by an updated inflation outlook, reflects the need to moderate monetary policy after a period of steady rates. The ECB’s latest projections show a slight increase in inflation expectations for 2024 and 2025, with 2026 remaining stable at 1.9%. 

“Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady,” Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, said in a statement.

This cut is the first since September 2019 and follows a series of hikes that began later than other central banks but now places the ECB ahead in reducing rates.
On the other hand, the BoC’s rate cut aims to ease the burden on highly indebted consumers. Governor Tiff Macklem emphasized that future cuts would depend on continued downward inflation trends. 

“Governing Council is closely watching the evolution of core inflation and remains particularly focused on the balance between demand and supply in the economy, inflation expectations, wage growth, and corporate pricing behaviour,” the BoC Governing Council said in a statement.

These rate cuts have several implications for the crypto market. Lower interest rates typically reduce borrowing costs, encouraging both consumer spending and business investment. This increased liquidity can boost investments in higher-yielding assets, including cryptocurrencies. Additionally, lower returns on traditional savings can drive investors toward riskier assets like crypto.
Furthermore, the rate cuts might lead to higher prices for crypto. With safer investments offering lower returns, investors often seek higher returns in the crypto market. This shift can increase demand for digital assets, potentially driving up their value.

However, the moves by the ECB and BoC come with caution. Both institutions indicate that future cuts will be data-dependent, highlighting a cautious approach amid uncertain economic conditions. Economists suggest that the ECB may wait until September for another cut, while the BoC might move again in July.

European Central Bank Cuts Rates-What It Means for the Fed and Bitcoin - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its three key interest rates by 25 basis points each on Thursday—and crypto bulls are anticipating a potential boost to Bitcoin's price, particularly amid speculation that the Fed could follow suit.The organization’s new rate for its main refinancing operations is now 4.25%. Meanwhile, the rates for its marginal lending facility and deposit facility are now 4.5% and 3.75%, respectively. This marks the central bank’s first rate cut in nearly five years.“Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly,” wrote the ECB in a Thursday press release. “It is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady.”The ECB’s decision proves that a global central bank pivot is now well underway, after monetary authorities across the globe raised rates to address surging inflation during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Swiss Central Bank already announced its first 25 basis point cut in March, while the Bank of Canada confirmed its first cut in four years on Wednesday.The question now is whether the United States Federal Reserve will soon follow suit. A similar move could prove bullish for stocks and crypto alike, which historically perform well during periods of cheap borrowing and money supply growth.However, unlike other regions, inflation in the United States remains stubbornly above 3%, while Fed officials refuse to accept any result less than its 2% target.In a Monday interview, Neel Kashkari—president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis—argued that citizens would rather put up with a shrinking economy than with persistently high inflation.Combined with continued resilience in wage growth and the labor market, he expects rates to remain high for some time.“If I look at this resilience and economic activity, that does not look like an economy that is under pressure of very high, very tight monetary policy," he saidAccording to CME FedWatch, the consensus view is that rate cuts will arrive later this year—possibly in September, and almost certainly by November. June, however, is considered to be almost certainly a write-off.“The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” wrote the Federal Reserve in a statement following its last meeting in May.Interest rate cuts are historically positive for Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, with some analysts pegging BTC's recent price uptick on bets that the Fed and others will indeed trim down rates.Even so, prominent BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has theorized that money supply growth—and hence, new highs for Bitcoin—will happen regardless of whether the Fed cuts rates or not.The U.S. Treasury, for example, must continue making high interest rate payments to bondholders while rates are elevated, putting money in people’s pockets and counteracting the intended effect of higher rates.“When you combine Fed and Treasury activities, the net is an injection of $21 billion per month,” Hayes wrote to Twitter in February. “This is one reason why tech/AI [and] crypto are pumping and will continue to pump.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum ETF Approval Sparks Altcoin Frenzy, Meme Coin Mania: What Investors Need To Know - Benzinga

The approval of Ethereum ETFs stirred the competition between Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD for dominance in the smart contract arena. Should Solana also receive ETF approval, the rivalry is expected to escalate, potentially influencing both platforms’ market dynamics. Analysts suggest that Layer 1 blockchains such as Avalanche AVAX/USD and Cardano ADA/USD might benefit from a broader market surge despite the initial focus on Ethereum.Altcoins: A Mixed BagAccording to analysts, the influx of new investors through the Ethereum ETF might create a "rising tide lifting all boats" effect. Established altcoins such as Cardano and Polkadot DOT/USD, known for their strong utility functions and established developer communities, could see substantial price increases. These altcoins, offering real-world solutions, may attract investors seeking broader blockchain ecosystem exposure beyond Ethereum.However, a "flight to quality" scenario might emerge. New investors, prioritizing perceived stability, could favor Ethereum over riskier altcoins, potentially causing a temporary decline in prices of smaller altcoins, especially those grappling with scalability or unclear roadmaps.Meme Coins: A Speculative PlayDue to increased crypto market attention, meme coins like Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD could experience a surge in interest. Platforms such as Binance Square anticipate a meme coin frenzy. However, this spike might be short-lived. Many meme coins lack strong utility and rely heavily on social media hype.Projects with long-term value propositions and proven technologies may become more attractive to investors as the market matures, possibly leading to a "meme coin top" where only the strongest meme coins with real-world applications or unique features survive.Ethereum vs. Solana: The Battle for SupremacyThe Ethereum ETF could see Ethereum's price reach new heights due to increased investor interest. However, Solana’s potential ETF approval might balance the competition in the long term. The success of both platforms depends on addressing scalability issues. Ethereum's transition to Ethereum 2.0 promises improved transaction speeds and reduced fees, while Solana offers high speed and low fees but faces challenges like network congestion and potential centralization. The platform that balances speed, security and scalability will likely dominate the smart contracts space.Layer 1 Blockchains: Potential ResurgenceDespite recent challenges, Layer 1 blockchains such as Avalanche and Cardano could benefit from a broader market surge.

Has China Reopened Access to Cryptocurrencies? Statement from the Exchange that Started Registration for Chinese Users - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bybit, one of the world's top three cryptocurrency exchanges in terms of volume, officially announced that Chinese immigrants can now open accounts and trade digital assets using its platform.
Bybit recently opened cryptocurrency membership registrations from China, leading to speculation that China is turning to cryptocurrencies. Now it has become clear that this is not actually the case.


“Overseas Chinese users will now be able to register and open accounts on the Bybit platform, enjoying the same benefits as our existing user base,” Bybit said in a statement. said. The company added that it is committed to adhering to all applicable regulations in the markets in which it operates. The company also said it hopes to operate in Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and the European Union.

As it is known, crypto activities are banned in China and even a Chinese student who launched crypto money was arrested today.





In addition, Bitcoin mining, which was once extremely popular, is also banned in the country. Before the ban, China was the world's largest crypto mining center.

Bitcoin Open Interest Sets New All-Time High: Is Price Next?


								Data shows the Bitcoin derivatives Open Interest has shot up to a new all-time high (ATH) recently. Here’s what this could mean for the asset’s price.
Bitcoin Open Interest Has Registered A Steep Rise Recently
In a post on X, CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn has discussed about the latest trend in the Open Interest for Bitcoin. The “Open Interest” here refers to the total amount of derivatives positions related to the cryptocurrency that are currently open on all exchanges.

When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market right now. Generally, the total amount of leverage in the sector goes up when this trend forms, so it may lead to the asset’s price registering a higher degree of volatility.
On the other hand, a decrease in the indicator suggests the derivatives users are either closing up positions of their own violation or getting forcibly liquidated by their platforms. Either way, the coin could become more stable following such a drop, due to the decreased leverage.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past few years:

The value of the metric seems to have been climbing up over the last few days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest had sharply risen earlier in the year when the cryptocurrency’s price had witnessed its rally towards the new ATH.
In this surge, the indicator had surpassed its record value set during the peak of the 2021 bull run. As the price fell to consolidation following the mid-March ATH, though, the metric also observed a cooldown.
With the latest recovery run for Bitcoin, however, the trend has once again seen a reversal for the Open Interest, as investors have rapidly started opening new positions. The indicator’s value has now surpassed the high seen earlier in the year, and by a margin at that.
It would appear that speculation has made a return in the market in full force and as it has often happened historically, these extreme levels of Open Interest could once again result in some sharp price action for the cryptocurrency. The direction of these fluctuations, of course, can be in either direction.
As mentioned earlier, the reason volatility goes up after an increase in the Open Interest is due to a rise in the leverage. When leverage increases, mass liquidations become more probable to take place in the market. It’s these high amount of liquidations that can trigger chaos in the market.

In an earlier X post, Maartunn had shared how the the aggregated Open Interest in the cryptocurrency sector as a whole had been approaching an ATH. Therefore, it would appear that Bitcoin isn’t the only coin that has been witnessing an increased appetite for speculative activity recently.

Robert Kiyosaki Confident Bitcoin Will Hit $350K By August 2024, Here's How


																Robert Kiyosaki, financial guru and author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has made a staggering prediction for bitcoin’s (BTC) price in the next two months.
In a recent tweet, Kiyosaki said he is confident that BTC will be worth $350,000 by August 25.
BTC to Tap $350K in August
Kiyosaki said while his prediction may be “suckers bait,” speculation, and an opinion, it is not a lie because any forecast about the future is not false. Nevertheless, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author revealed that he wanted the BTC at $350,000 prediction to come true.
As a years-long Bitcoin supporter and proponent, Kiyosaki has touted the cryptocurrency, alongside gold and silver, as a must-have asset for individuals and entities who want to survive the impending crash of the United States dollar.
Earlier this year, he predicted that BTC would tap $100,000 in June 2024 and $300,000 by the end of the year. At the time of writing, BTC had yet to surpass its all-time high of $73,700 and hovered around $71,000. However, all hope is not lost as the crypto market is known for its extreme pumps and could pull a surprise that would see BTC surge past the predicted price within hours or days.




Kiyosaki’s latest prediction is a step up from its previous forecast of BTC at $300,000 by year-end. The absence of a major Bitcoin event or upgrade that could trigger a rally strong enough to push BTC past $300,000 in the next two months raises the question of the source of Kiyosaki’s confidence in such a prediction.
The financial guru attributed his confidence to the incompetence of U.S. leaders, including President Joe Biden, Fed chair Jerome Powell, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Although Kiyosaki’s BTC prediction remains a wish, he said he is certain about the incompetence of the American leaders, who he tagged stooges.
Kiyosaki Endorses ETH and SOL
Interestingly, Kiyosaki has added Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) to his list of safe-haven assets, along with gold, BTC, and silver. He urged his followers to buy more of the cryptocurrencies and precious metals to protect themselves from the three stooges.
“I am confident Bitcoin will hit $350,000 sometime in 2024 but for it’s only a target, a dream, and a wish.  I keep buying more Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, because quite certain their prices will continue to rise,” Kiyosaki stated.

Congress Considers Benefits of Tokenizing Real World Assets - The Defiant

“Tokenization can leverage the efficiency and transparency of blockchains to help modernize U.S. markets,” said Congressman French Hill.On June 5, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing titled "Next Generation Infrastructure: How Tokenization of Real-World Assets Will Facilitate Efficient Markets."The discussion focused on tokenization, the process by which real-world assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate are represented digitally on a blockchain.“With the help of blockchain, tokenization can automate some of [the] critical processes within a financial transaction, bringing along streamlined settlement and lower costs,” said committee Chairman Rep. French Hill of Arizona in his opening remarks.One of the examples discussed was BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has distributed $1.7 million in dividends to date using the Ethereum blockchain, highlighting the technology’s ability to streamline and automate aspects of asset management and financial transactions. BUIDL has grown to a $462 million market capitalization in less than three months.BUIDL Market CapU.S. lawmakers heard testimony from several industry experts, including Nadine Chakar, the global head of DTCC Digital Assets, who emphasized the transformative potential of tokenization for established markets such as U.S. equities and Treasuries.The DTCC is no stranger to the technology, having recently conducted a ‘Smart NAV’ pilot to evaluate the feasibility of distributing mutual fund Net Asset Value (NAV) data on blockchain networks.Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, shared insights into his company's efforts in creating regulated platforms for tokenizing and trading financial assets on public blockchains."This technology can improve how money flows from companies to investors so investors can redeploy their assets and get better returns," he said.Robert Morgan, CEO of the USDF Consortium, discussed tokenization's potential to improve financing options for consumers and small businesses. By offering more efficient payment solutions and reducing credit costs, tokenized mechanisms like bank-minted deposit tokens could enhance financial inclusion, according to Morgan.Chairman Hill also criticized the anti-crypto stance of U.S. financial regulators, such as the SEC and Federal Reserve.“The private sector should not have to pursue a financial regulator’s endorsement prior to exploring the latest innovation in technologies for a possible way to save the company and consumers money and have a more effective product,” he noted.

Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Responds To Celebrity Memecoins: 'How Do We Push Things In A Better Direction?' - Benzinga

When Vitalik Buterin helped found Ethereum in 2013, he envisioned using the platform and blockchain technology as a force for good. He envisioned the network as a means to increase social welfare and provide users access to valuable projects. It makes sense, then, that Buterin has criticized the meme coin craze overtaking the crypto community in 2024. Buterin stated he is not a fan of the meme coin frenzy and prefers the community push "things in a better direction."Don't Miss:Buterin's comments were in response to a post on X regarding the Mother Iggy (MOTHER) token, a project centered on rapper Iggy Azalea. "If $MOTHER breaks into sustainable value creation, it'll also be the mother of this cycle's celebrity experimentation," said Chris Burniske on X. The Ethereum co-founder responded, stating he is "feeling quite unhappy about with [sic] ‘this cycle's celebrity experimentation' so far," and that he can respect the means "if the end is worthy (health care, open source software, art, etc)."Buterin argues that the creators of these tokens use celebrities' names to attract investors while providing little value in return. He contends this practice detracts funds from more useful projects and contradicts his original vision for Ethereum. Celebrity memecoins have recently become popular among crypto investors. Tokens centered around celebrities like Donald Trump, Caitlyn Jenner, and Elon Musk have attracted billions in investment without providing much value. While most of these meme projects are antithetical to Buterin's grand vision for Ethereum, he mentioned one project that used its funds to add value, though not to the scale he hoped for."Ashton and Mila’s Stoner Cats was vastly more honorable than anything we’ve seen from this 2024 celebrity memecoin era — at least there was an actual show being funded," Buterin noted. The Stoner Cats project featured an NFT collection, which funded an animated show. The project raised enough to hire Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Chris Rock, and Buterin himself as voice actors. Stoner Cats is an example of how crypto project funds can create valuable content. However, the SEC sued Stoner Cats over its NFT offering, resulting in a $1 million civil penalty.With many projects aiming to drive up token prices or make quick money, Buterin asks, "How do we push things in a better direction?" It will be interesting to see how projects respond to his call-out. Read Next:

How Many Users Does Farcaster Actually Have? - The Defiant

A Dune dashboard says 55,000 daily active users (DAU) , but their API says it may be a tenth of that.Farcaster is the blockchain-based social media darling of this cycle, enjoying parabolic growth and a billion-dollar valuation, but data show active users may be a fraction of the most widely-cited numbers.Farcaster has a public API endpoint, which fetches “Power Badge” users, defined as users “who are active, interesting to others and not spammy,” according to the app’s documentation. As social media is overrun by bots, Farcaster’s Power Badge users offer a more reliable way to gauge actual daily active users (DAU).The Defiant ran the numbers and found there are 4,360 daily Power Badge users, compared with the 55,000 daily active users shown on the most popular Dune Analytics dashboard for the app. The dashboard measures DAUs by users performing some action on the platform, and is often cited by Farcaster co-founder Dan Romero."It's Just Bots"The findings signal crypto-based social media adoption is still a niche use-case, even by crypto standards. For reference, exchanges Coinbase and Uniswap boast about 300,000 DAUs. Activity on crypto-based social media, also known as SocialFi, is negligible compared with web2 social media. X has 250 million DAUs.The discrepancy between a superficial reading of Farcaster’s user data and the power-user numbers also signal how untrustworthy web3 activity metrics are as bots muddle the data.“It's quite painful that I see a lot of those decentralized social projects, they try to say, ‘hey, we have this much DAU,’ – No, it's not real.The data is all open,” Suji Yan, the founder of Mask Network, one of the earliest blockchain-based social media networks, said in an interview. “It's an elephant in the room. Everyone should know that it's just bots.”Entrepreneur Liron Shapira pointed to the relatively low Farcaster DAUs the public API was fetching in a May 23 X post. “I now believe Farcaster has between 50 and 5k DAUs, not 45k as a naive reading of Dune Analytics would suggest,” he wrote. He told The Defiant that the reason is that Dune “counts bots.”Romero did not publicly reply to Shapira’s claims or to a request for comment from The Defiant.Activity SlidesBut even using Dune Analytics’ data, activity on Farcaster’s has been sliding lately. Reactions and casts–the equivalent of X’s posts or likes– have more than halved to 3.1 million from 6.1 million a month ago.Farcaster DAUs - Dune AnalyticsFarcaster isn’t alone. In recent months, SocialFi has dipped towards its all-time low in activity, with most networks trending downwards with haste. BitClout, which launched in 2021 and is backed by big-name investors including Winklevoss Capital has all but faded out.Another formerly popular SocialFi app, Friend Tech, showcases a meager 230 DAUs, down 97% from its peak.Farcaster launched in 2020 with its founding team composed of Dan Romero and Varun Srinivasan. In June the protocol announced its most recent funding round, a $150 million Series A at a valuation of $1 billion, led by Paradigm Capital, a16z, and Huan Ventures among others. Srinivasan said Farcaster is “sufficiently decentralized.”White-Listed AccountsOther analysts say Farcaster’s active users may be even lower than what the Power Badge user numbers suggest. Geoff Golberg, founder of Social Forensics, which specializes in social media analytics, said of the 4,344 accounts he found using the API on May 9, roughly 21% or 918 accounts didn’t register any activity.Farcaster documentation shows accounts must be active to earn a Power Badge, which leads to an unsettling implication: A large number of accounts appear to have been white-listed to have Power Badges, Golberg said.Golberg said he came to this conclusion after digging into the data when he found he had lost his Power Badge after criticizing Farcaster for inflating its metrics.“It certainly feels as though the Farcaster team is attempting to silence my voice by reducing the visibility of my account,” he wrote in a May 9 post. “Web2 social’s shadowban has evolved to Web3 social’s shadowban.”Walking the Web3 TalkThe implication that Farcaster is unilaterally and opaquely white-listing or shadow-banning accounts goes directly against the ethos of blockchain-based social media. Web3 proponents say SocialFi will offer users permissionless access to open source social networks. The web3 ideal is that users will control their data and assets, and share the upside of the platforms’ growth.Golberg’s analysis is likely not enough to prove that Farcaster is manipulating user engagement in a centralized way.But the platform’s API does show that so far, a small subset of crypto users are walking the talk when it comes to using SocialFi.

Tether (USDT) Report from JPMorgan - Here is the Bank's Assessment - Bitcoin Sistemi


JPMorgan noted in a recent research report that U.S. crypto regulations are moving in a direction that favors the launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), looks negatively on crypto adoption by local banks, and non-compliant stablecoins.
The bank notes that regulatory initiatives have increased in the US in recent months, raising questions about the direction of crypto regulation ahead of the presidential elections later this year.


Analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a report on Wednesday: “They are against a coin tied to the Fed, against U.S. banks dealing with cryptocurrency, against non-compliant stablecoins like Tether (USDT), and against all tokens other than Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) being securities.” “They are against being classified as such,” he wrote.

The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), passed by the House of Representatives last month, still needs to be approved by the Senate and ultimately the President. The bank said this was unlikely to happen before the election.





JPMorgan noted that Congress passed a resolution overturning the SAB 121 accounting rule that made it harder for banks to store crypto assets, but the resolution was vetoed by President Joe Biden.
The report said the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Anti-Surveillance Act is an attempt to block a U.S. CBDC, preventing Fed banks from offering certain products to consumers and using a central bank digital currency for monetary policy. The bill banning the FED from issuing CBDC was passed by the House of Representatives last month, but it is unclear whether it will be accepted in the Senate.

The Sandbox Raises at $1B Valuation | Bankless


Crypto gaming startup The Sandbox has raised $20M at a $1B valuation. Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands led the investment, which was supported by LG Tech Ventures and True Global Ventures.What's the scoop?Token Reaction: Following the funding announcement, the SAND token increased by 4.5%, though this new round speaks to the broader challenges in the NFT and gaming spaces. The company’s private valuation went from a targeted $4B in 2022 to an actualized $1B today.Future Plans: The capital will go towards enhancing features and developing a decentralized metaverse for mobile devices, which is expected to launch in 2025. Updates to some of its other tools are also planned.Bankless Take:While the “metaverse” stood out as a central narrative last cycle, we have yet to see it return to those heights this time around. That being said, the ability to build one’s own metaverse for friends or a community remains an intriguing prospect, evident from the reported 5.7M users and >1K unique experiences developed via The Sandbox since its Alpha release last November. With projections that the metaverse may add $5T to the global economy by 2030, this forever sought-after virtual land continues to draw investment, especially from the Web3 angle that believes digital ownership via blockchains would be a way for users, not just providers like Minecraft or Roblox, to share these riches.

Terraforms Explained: ETH's Best Onchain Art? | Bankless


My two favorite NFT projects are Nouns and Terraforms. Nouns, I intend to join. Terraforms, I intend to keep collecting. Full disclosure: I hold a few Terraforms right now! I’d like to have a lot more, and honestly, the driving motivation isn’t financial. I find these digital artifacts mesmerizing and likely to age like fine wine in various senses atop Ethereum. The magic here is due in no small part to the creator duo, Mathcastles, being new masters who have used Ethereum as an artistic medium, a computational creative engine, to an extent we haven’t seen before. That said, I feel confident that in 100 years, the art world will look back on Terraforms as important, a major first mover in runtime art because they will see what I see now: a series that broke new ground in a way that expanded the possibilities of art itself. This is high praise, of course, but Terraforms is also hard to explain. It has many nuances and transcends genres. For this post, let’s catch you up on the basics of this unique collection and why, in my humble opinion, it’s one of the best examples of onchain art on Ethereum today! First, What Is Runtime Art?Runtime art is a burgeoning genre within the digital art world that leverages the unique capabilities of blockchain tech, e.g. Ethereum, to create dynamic and evolving artworks. Unlike traditional digital art, which is typically static and stored offchain, runtime art is generated and maintained entirely on the blockchain. This means that the artwork is not just a stored image but an active, living entity that evolves over time based on the underlying smart contract code.At its core, runtime art is about creating art that is dynamically computed at the smart contract level. When I say "runtime," I’m referring to the period during which a program is running. In the context of Ethereum, this means that the art is continuously generated and updated by the smart contract moment by moment, every time it is interacted with. The art can change and adapt in response to various inputs, in other words, such as time, blockchain data (like gas prices or block hashes), or user interactions.While runtime art is still a young genre, several projects have already made significant impacts here. Among these, Terraforms by Mathcastles stands out as one of the prime examples. 
That’s because the Terraforms collection takes full advantage of Ethereum's capabilities to create a series of artworks that are not only visually stunning but also dynamically generated and continuously evolving. This makes Terraforms a trailblazer in the realm of runtime art, pushing the boundaries of what digital art can be and setting a high standard for future projects in this genre.What Are Terraforms?VIDEOLaunched on the Ethereum blockchain in December 2021, Terraforms is the brainchild of the anonymous duo known as Mathcastles, comprised of 0x113d and xaltgeist. At its core, Terraforms is a generative art project that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to create dynamic, interactive, and fully onchain artworks. Each NFT in the Terraforms collection represents a "parcel" of land within a conceptual 20-level virtual "Hypercastle." These parcels are not mere static images but are living pieces of art that evolve over time, driven by the underlying smart contract code.via the Unofficial Terraforms Community FAQ The Terraforms Hypercastle is a complex, multi-layered virtual structure. Each of the 11,104 parcels within the Hypercastle is a 32x32 grid of Unicode characters, creating a visually striking and symbolically rich piece of art. These parcels are categorized by several traits, including:Zones: 75 distinct color palettes.Biomes: 92 sets of glyphs used for animation.Chroma: The pace of animation akin to a heartbeat.Topography: The heightmap of each parcel, introducing a temporal dimension as the height fluctuates over time.Additionally, Terraforms offers a unique system of “modes” that enhance the interactivity and dynamism of the series. Each parcel within the Terraforms collection can exist in different modes, each with its own characteristics and functionalities. Here's a brief overview:Terrain ModeTerrain mode is the default state of a Terraforms parcel. In this mode, the parcel displays a pulsing ASCII design that resembles a topographical map.This mode showcases the initial generative art created by the smart contract. It is static in terms of user modification, but the visuals are dynamic and continuously evolving.Daydream ModeWhen a parcel is switched to Daydream mode, it becomes a blank slate that the owner can use to create custom ASCII art.Owners can activate Daydream mode by entering a command directly into the contract via Etherscan. They can then use community-built tools to draw on their parcel.Once a parcel is switched from Terrain to Daydream mode, this change is irreversible. However, modifications within Daydream mode can be reversed.Terraform ModeTerraform mode is activated when the custom drawings made in Daydream mode are saved back to the blockchain.Parcels can switch between Daydream and Terraform modes indefinitely. This flexibility allows owners to continuously refine and update their designs.In Terraform mode, the custom ASCII art becomes a permanent part of the parcel's blockchain record, viewable by others.Antenna ModeAntenna mode is a new feature introduced with the Terraforms 2.0 upgrade. It allows parcels in Daydream or Terraform modes to receive broadcasts and updates from new artwork programs, i.e., new smart contracts.To activate Antenna mode, owners need to interact with the contract on Etherscan, providing their parcel IDs and enabling the feature.Antenna mode can be turned on or off, offering flexibility and control over the parcel's interaction with new broadcasts.The contract tracks when a parcel enters Antenna mode, with timestamps used for seasonal updates. For instance, parcels activated during "Season 0" can receive special broadcasts and participate in unique events.5 Reasons Why Terraforms Are Great Onchain Art on Ethereumvia On-Chain Checker 1. Fully Onchain and ImmutableTerraforms is among the minority of NFT projects that are fully onchain. Unlike many NFTs that store images offchain and only use the blockchain for ownership records, Terraforms stores all its data directly on the Ethereum blockchain. This includes the code that generates the art, ensuring it is immutable and will last as long as Ethereum exists. This full onchain approach guarantees the permanence and integrity of the artwork. It cannot be altered or lost due to external factors, providing an unprecedented level of artistic authenticity and reliability.2. Dynamic and Runtime ArtTerraforms is a prime example of runtime art, meaning the artwork is dynamically generated at the moment of viewing through the underlying smart contract. The visuals are not static images but are created in real-time based on the code.This approach introduces a new dimension to digital art, where each interaction with the artwork can be unique. It leverages Ethereum as an "always on" computer, continuously generating art that evolves over time, reflecting the blockchain's state.3. Composability and InteractivityTerraforms, thanks to being fully on Ethereum, is highly composable, allowing new artwork programs and features to interact with existing parcels. The introduction of the Antenna mode in Terraforms 2.0 exemplifies this, enabling parcels to receive broadcasts and updates, thereby integrating new artistic elements over time.Zooming out, composability allows Terraforms to continuously evolve, making it more than just a static collection of NFTs. It fosters a dynamic environment where community members can develop new tools, create derivative works, and build on top of the existing infrastructure, enhancing the project's longevity and relevance.I’ve lurked in the Terraforms Discord for years. I can’t lie, it’s one of the smartest and most sincere online groups I’ve ever seen, filled with onchain builders and creatives par excellence constantly sharing their works and thoughts. These aren’t posers; these are the people art schools will be studying in a century. And I don’t say that lightly, it’s not true for most NFT-centric projects today. In a word, Terraforms via Mathcastles has cultivated a robust community that actively and meaningfully contributes to its development. This includes creating visualizers, tools for interaction, and other enhancements. The community engagement is evident in the rich ecosystem of resources that have emerged around Terraforms, like terrafans.xyz, erraformexplorer.xyz, and jaydenkur.com/terra/.Community-driven projects tend to have greater resilience and innovation, as they benefit from the collective creativity and effort of their members. This collaborative spirit is a cornerstone of Terraforms' success and sustainability.5. Designed for LongevityAlong with being fully onchain, which makes it time-resistant, Terraforms includes a built-in decay mechanism that can cause its terrain to collapse over a long period, potentially spanning thousands of years. This decay is a deliberate feature, symbolizing the passage of time and the ephemeral nature of digital art.However, this collapse is not inevitable. Holders can prevent their parcels from decaying by actively switching between modes. Transitioning a parcel to Daydream or Terraform mode helps prevent the decay process, allowing the wider series to persist in its current state.Currently, enough parcels have entered Daydream mode to prevent this collapse from ever occurring. With that said, Terraforms is still one of the few projects on Ethereum today that has been hard-coded with instructions designed to span centuries. What to Watch Going Forward?“[It’s] this notion of a Culture Settlement Layer, which is how I see Ethereum, and one lens of how I've come to see Terraforms and Project 2 as art pieces. The bundle of described patterns / protocols / technologies described above … they treat Ethereum as a way to bootload and sustain new networks.” — 0x113d, Terraforms co-creatorThe more you dig into Terraforms, the more you realize that it poses more questions than answers when it comes to art and the role of computers in our lives. Even in this article, I know I’ve failed to capture the full magic of this collection as I and others see it. Like I said before, it defies straightforward explanation. Some of the magic is intangible. But in some senses, Terraforms is a gateway. It’s enough to learn about it and then explore for yourself from there, and if it resonates, you’ll never not find it interesting. It’s a new kind of artwork that functions as a cultural settlement layer, and toward that end, it’s one of the greatest expressions of onchain art on Ethereum today.All in all, then, I honestly believe Terraforms stands out as a beacon of innovation, creativity, and longevity in the 21st century art scene. If you’re an art enthusiast, or a tech aficionado, or simply curious about the intersection of these worlds, Terraforms offers a glimpse into the future of onchain creativity. Study it!

Firm Attacks US Miners, Bitcoin Network Growing Stronger


								Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm, has launched a scathing attack on the Bitcoin mining industry in the United States, branding it a haven for “snake oil salesmen” that devour investor capital and harm the environment. 
Investment Firm Attacks Bitcoin, Claims Mining Model Flawed
In a post on X, the management firm announced that it had started its war on the burgeoning industry by drafting two letters to Texas authorities.
One is addressed to the Navarro City Commission, where Riot Blockchain has set up its base. Another letter was sent to the Texas state senators.

The investment firm is urging them to crack down on Bitcoin mining in the state, comparing it to the fraudulent Chinese schemes exposed a decade ago. 
What stands out is that their fight will be centered on Bitcoin mining operations in Texas. Considering its low energy costs, the state is a major hub for Bitcoin mining in the United States. 
Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView
If anything, their opposition to Bitcoin mining has led Kerrisdale Capital to disclose that they are actively shorting Riot Blockchain’s stock. The investment firm thinks the mining farm is a “prime example of a dysfunctional Bitcoin mining business model” trapped in “a vicious cycle of cash burn.”
In their assessment, these public mining firms mostly rely on continuously issuing new shares to fund operations, even when Bitcoin is at or near all-time highs. The investment firm argues this is a sign of a flawed business model.
Kerrisdale Capital also pointed out profitability issuers for these Bitcoin mining operations, even when prices are at record levels. In these cycles, they claim that Riot Blockchain has struggled to be in green. Beyond this, they cite environmental concerns and increasing regulatory scrutiny surrounding mining. 
Additionally, they think the availability of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) means owning shares of mining farms is an unnecessary risk. Over the last six months, spot ETF issuers in the United States have bought billions worth of BTC on behalf of their clients.
Miner Fights Back, Network Strong
As expected, the attack has sparked outrage. Bob Burnett, the founder of Barefoot Mining, has vehemently rejected the “snake oil salesman” label, emphasizing the dedication and hard work of securing the network. 

Of note, the founder points to the resilience of many mining companies during challenging market conditions and their role in maintaining the integrity of the broader ecosystem.

Even with the criticism, Mempool.Space data shows that the total hash rate remains high and steady at over 500 EH/s when writing. At the same time, even after Halving, Foundry USA remains the largest mining farm in the world by hash rate.

Bitcoin over BTC miner shares? Hedge fund makes this prediction! - AMBCrypto



Hedge fund predicts that Bitcoin miners’ shares will go to zero. 
BTC and MSTR have performed better than overall BTC miner shares on a YTD basis. 

After going short on MicroStrategy’s MSTR stock in March, TradFi hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital is back with another short strategy, this time targeting Bitcoin miner Riot Platform’s RIOT share. 
So, what’s the beef with RIOT? Kerrisdale Capital’s CIO Sahm Andrangi told Yahoo Finance that, 
“Our investment thesis is that this sector is not going to be around in five years,’
On X (formerly Twitter), the hedge fund slammed Riot further and called it a ‘dysfunctional hamster’ and ill-equipped to offer better rewards to shareholders. 
‘Like other US-listed miners, $RIOT’s biz model is a dysfunctional hamster wheel of cash burn, which is why it loots retail shareholders with non-stop ATM issuance to fund operations. Even with $BTC near all-time highs, post-halving $RIOT’s mining ops aren’t profitable.’
Interestingly, Andrangi was against the whole Bitcoin mining sector, termed it the ‘stupidest business model’, and predicted that it would ‘ultimately go to zero.’
Bitcoin as a hedge against BTC miners
In such a bearish scenario, the hedge fund maintained that BTC would always perform better against BTC miner shares. So, it would be used as a hedge against BTC miner shares – long BTC, short BTC miners. 
However, since Kerrisdale Capital’s last short strategy against MSTR in March, the stock has soared 37%. 
This tipped some market watchers to adopt a contrarian approach and ‘thank’ the fund for calling BTC miners’ shares ‘bottom’ for the rest of 2024. 
Another X user outrightly wondered how flawed the fund’s strategy was. 
‘This genius is shorting #Bitcoin miners and $MSTR heading into the greatest crypto bull market in history.’
However, the fund was right on BTC outperforming miner shares. On a YTD (year-to-date) basis, MSTR was up 147%, and BTC had 67% gains as of press time. 
However, RIOT was down 37%, while overall BTC miner shares tracker, based on Valkryie Bitcoin Miner ETFs (WGMI), was modestly up only 6% over the same period.

That said, the WGMI has been trending higher as BTC rises. But, it remains to be seen whether the hedge fund’s ‘BTC miners going to zero’ projection will turn out.

$1,500,000,000 Liquidation Cascade Waiting for Bitcoin at $72,000, According To Willy Woo - The Daily Hodl


								On-chain analyst Willy Woo says there’s a “cascade” of liquidation that’s primed to begin when Bitcoin (BTC) hits $72,000.
Woon tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that $1.5 billion worth of short positions are “ready to be liquidated all the way up to $75,000 and a new all-time high.”










Source: Willy Woo/X
Woo also looks at the Bitcoin Macro Oscillator (BMO), which is a composite of four signals: the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator, volume-weighted average price (VWAP) ratio, cumulative value-days destroyed (CVDD) and the Sharpe Ratio.
MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all BTC at the price they were bought at) and is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued.
VWAP represents the average traded price of an asset throughout the day, taking into account both volume and price. Traders use the VWAP to help them determine whether an asset is trading underbought or overbought based on its intraday price action.
The coin days destroyed metric looks at the value of each Bitcoin transaction while giving weight to the number of days since the coins were last moved. The CVDD tracks the cumulative sum of the coin days destroyed metric as a ratio to the market age.
The Sharpe Ratio aims to compare the return of an investment with its risk by dividing a portfolio’s excess returns by a measure of its volatility.
Explains Woo,
“This 2.5 months of consolidation under bullish demand has been very good for Bitcoin, it means price has more room to run before topping out.
Chart: BMO moves 1 level down, now has 2-3 levels to climb before a macro market top.”

Altcoins Are Ready for Their Big Run, According to Crypto Analyst Michaël van de Poppe - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that altcoins are poised to spark a massive rally starting at the end of June.
In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 719,600 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins are gearing up for a ride “back to normal values.”










“The altcoins are ready for their upwards run. I think we’ll be seeing a lot of momentum from late June until September – October. A repricing back to their normal values after the big cascade of the first period of the year.”
Van de Poppe goes on to say that a trio of cryptocurrencies are also showing strength. According to the trader, Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing signs of upward momentum, noting that if the crypto king can hold the $70,000 price level, it could reach new all-time highs.
“The upwards momentum [of] Bitcoin continues to happen. $70,000 broke upwards, through which the important level is to hold $70,000 now for continuation to the all-time high.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Bitcoin is trading for $71,595 at time of writing.
Moving on to Ethereum (ETH), Van de Poppe says the leading smart contract platform by volume would benefit from financial institutions getting their S-1 filings for ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
“Ethereum focusing on generating that higher low. I think certainty regarding the S-1 approvals is going to lead to a strong upwards move and the higher low. Just a matter of patience.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Ethereum is valued at $3,847 at time of writing.
Concluding his analysis with layer-2 scaling solution Polkadot (DOT), the analyst says there’s still time to accumulate despite its price slowly moving upwards.
 “DOT is doing great in fundamental growth. They are focusing on RWA (real-world assets) and have multiple great projects within the ecosystem (Centrifuge and Energy Web). Right now, the price starts to crawl upwards and I think it’s still a great time to accumulate a position.”

DOT is trading for $7.28 at time of writing.

Will Bitcoin ETFs Soar on Sooner-Than-Expected Fed Rate Cut? - ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF Common Shares of Beneficial Interests (BATS:ARKB) - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD surpassed the $71,000 mark, indicating increased market confidence in potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This streak of daily increases is the longest in three months, just 4% below its all-time high of $73,798 set in mid-March, per Bloomberg.Investors should also note that the short-term correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 Index is at its highest since early 2023, indicating that further gains in the tech-heavy index may coincide with a rise in the crypto market leader.ETFs like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITO, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust BITB should now be in focus.Will Fed Cut Rates Soon?Traders are increasingly pricing in the likelihood of a Fed rate cut as early as September following data indicating a slowdown in U.S. inflation and a softer job market. Inflation, which resumed its climb in the first quarter of 2024, is finally showing signs of cooling. Also, the manufacturing sector slowed further in May. Job openings also dropped to new 3-year low. There is now 55.3% probability of a 25-bp Fed rate cut in September, as per the CME Fedwatch Tool, up from 51.3% recorded on Jun 3, 2024. This has led to a decrease in Treasury yields lately, easing financial conditions and benefiting speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Notably, benchmark US treasury yield dropped to 4.33% on Jun 4 from 4.61% recorded on May 29, 2024.Tom Couture, Vice President of Digital Asset Strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, noted that crypto assets are responding positively to the decline in rates. Despite recent struggles to maintain levels above $70,000, optimism persists due to inflows into U.S. ETFs and progress in Washington towards crypto regulatory frameworks.Bullish Prospect Ahead for Bitcoin?Michael Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, expressed optimism about a more favorable U.S. political environment for digital assets, predicting that Bitcoin could reach a record $100,000 or higher by the end of the year, as quoted on Bloomberg.To read this article on Zacks.com click here.

Humane AI Pin Implosion? Poor Sales, Fire Risk, and Potential Acquisition - Decrypt

The Humane AI pin is hot—in all the wrong ways.After heavy launch hype, Humane AI’s $700 AI Pin was met with a wave of harsh reviews. Amid poor sales, the device is now struggling with a faulty accessory. On Wednesday, Humane AI warned users to “immediately stop using and charging” the AI Pin’s optional charging case because of “a fire safety risk.”“Upon receiving a single report of a charging issue while using a third-party USB-C cable and third-party power source, we identified a quality issue with the battery cell supplied by a third-party vendor used in your Charge Case Accessory,” the company said.Humane noted that not all battery cells were affected but that they were telling all users to stop using the case “out of an abundance of caution.” The company also noted that the AI Pin itself—as well as add-on battery and charging pad—were unaffected.Humane declined to provide additional comment to Decrypt.What is the Humane AI Pin?The world got an early preview of the Humane AI pin when it was worn by iconic supermodel Naomi Campbell on the runway during Fashion Week in Paris in September.Designed to be pinned to a lapel or other article of clothing, the AI Pin includes a generative AI model that can answer questions, recall schedules, and search online with the push of a button.“Anything you would search the web for or even use ChatGPT for, you can use on your pin,” Humane AI said during a demonstration in March.From hype to fizzleThe Humane AI pin got lots of buzz, in part due to backers that included Qualcomm, OpenAI, Microsoft, T-Mobile, and TIDAL, and the fact that the Humane AI’s team included veterans from Apple, Samsung, Google, and Amazon.Reviewers delivered a harsh reality check, most notably top technology YouTuber Marques Brownlee. Complaints included its price tag, required monthly subscription, and poor usability—it was declared “too bare bones” and “clunky” by Wired Magazine. “It is an expensive product and expensive subscription for a device that does less,” Mac Rumors writer Steve Moser said on Twitter. “You can only have one expensive aspect for a successful gadget.”The long-term prospects for the company dimmed even before the latest charging case debacle. Humane AI is in the process of looking for a buyer—courting legacy technology company Hewlett-Packard (HP)—according to a report by the New York Times.According to the Times, the Humane AI pin only received 10,000 orders, compared to the 100,000 orders the company reportedly hoped to receive.Humane AI began shopping itself around a week after reviews of the product began coming out, valuing itself at $1 billion after a new fund round, according to the Times report.While the company may be in dire straits, Brownlee did acknowledge a good use case for the fashionable device—which was pitched as a way to leave your smartphone behind.”You’ll have a new phone number, you’ll have to charge another device… but you’ll have less screen time,” he said.A new niche marketWearable technology is not new—smart glasses and watches are well-represented on the market. However, since the launch of OpenAI’s flagship product ChatGPT in November 2022, there has been a race to bring generative AI to the masses in form factors besides smartphones.In September, Facebook's parent company, Meta, announced the launch of its new augmented reality (AR) glasses that include a connection to the company's new MetaAI chatbot.While not a “wearable” the Rabbit R1 offered a personal AI assistant at a more reasonable $200 and does not require a subscription to use. The Rabbit R1 demo in January at CES was so impressive Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella compared it to the reveal of the iPhone.“I thought the demo of the Rabbit OS and the device was fantastic,” Nadella told Bloomberg. “I think I must say, after Jobs and the launch of iPhone, probably one of the most impressive presentations I've seen.”“Overall I’m impressed with this device and I think the R1 is really a standout product,” tech reviewer Justine “iJustine” Ezarik said in her review. “It combines solid hardware with smart adaptive software and it’s really user-focused designed."While the reviews for the Rabbit R1 were notably more kind than the reception, the Rabbit R1 still drew some criticism, from being dismissed as a dressed up Android app to being declared “barely reviewable” by Brownlee.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

VanEck Analysts See Ethereum Price Hitting $22,000 By 2030 ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
Analysts at global investment firm VanEck said on June 5 that they had raised their 2030 price forecast for Ethereum to $22,000 — up from just $11,800 last year. That would represent a massive jump from Ether’s current market price.



Ethereum’s Unique Value Proposition



Asset manager VanEck, which has filed paperwork to list an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), predicts that ETH ETFs will be much bigger than their Bitcoin peers owing to Ether’s disruptive power and cash flow generated for token holders.







While Ethereum has yielded $3.4 billion in revenue in the last year, VanEck sees that figure hitting $51 billion by 2030.



“We believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world. ETH can be thought of as ‘Digital Oil’ because it is consumed by engaging in activity on Ethereum,” the Wednesday report authored by Matthew Sigel, Patrick Bush, and Denis Zinoviev stated. “The Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech.”



VanEck portrayed Ethereum as the heart of its financial ecosystem. Its network currently secures more than $90 billion in stablecoins, roughly $7 billion in tokenized assets, and $308 billion in digital assets.

&nbsp



“Compared to Web2 applications, Ethereum ($3.4B) generates more revenue than Etsy ($2.7B), Twitch ($2.6B), and Roblox ($2.7B) […] Ethereum is a vibrant economic platform that can be considered a “Digital Mall” whose usership has grown ~1500%, and revenue has surged at a 161% CAGR since 2019,” the report added.



$2 Trillion Market Cap



VanEck also recognizes Ethereum’s potential to disrupt the infrastructure, artificial intelligence, marketing, advertising, social, and gaming industries.



“Should it do so while maintaining its dominant position among smart contract platforms, we see a credible path to $66 billion in fresh cash flow to token holders supporting a $2.2.trillion asset or $22,000 per coin, by 2030.”



$22,000 by 2030 would mark a 487% increase from the current price of $3,845.64. Notably, $22K is VanEck’s base case price estimate. The most optimistic and bearish price projections were $154K and $360, respectively.



Spot Ether ETFs In The Works



The prognostication is also based on the expectation that spot ether ETFs will soon be greenlighted for trading. These new products will boost Ethereum’s appeal among more conservative institutional investors, just as the recently launched spot BTC ETFs drew strong investor demand, amassing a total net inflow of $15 billion since their inception.



“We anticipate that spot ether ETFs are nearing approval to trade on U.S. stock exchanges,” according to the report. “This development would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold this unique asset with the security of qualified custodians and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs.”



After clearing BTC ETFs in January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission failed to engage much with applicants on ether ETFs. However, that changed when the regulator gave the nod to 19b-4 forms tied to the ETFs. The SEC, however, must first approve S-1 filings before investors can buy the spot ETH products.

FTX creditor group files objection against bankruptcy reorganization plan

A group of FTX creditors led by Sunil Kavuri has objected to the reorganization plan filed by the defunct exchange’s bankruptcy managers.According to a June 5 court filing, the creditors argued that the plan failed the best interest test. Justifying the objection, Sunil noted that it is unconfirmable as a matter of law as it includes releases not in the interest of the estate. He added that the plan also ignores property rights issues.Notably, the creditors argued that FTX’s cash repayment would force a taxable event that could be avoided through in-kind repayment. As such, creditors would be forced to pay tax on declared gains upon the cash receipts. They wrote:“Because the Debtors state that they will take the position that this ‘forced exchange’ is a taxable event, it will inflict additional hardships on customers through forced taxation that could be avoided by making an ‘in kind’ distribution.”Kavuri made reference to the current lawsuit against the estate’s law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, over its ties to the exchange prior to its collapse. He claimed that the plan included an exculpation clause “so they and no one involved [can be] sued for misconduct.”The creditors further stated that FTX must update the disclosure statement for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settlement and include the examiner report. The objection follows a recent agreement to settle tax claims with the IRS.The settlement plan will see the IRS receive a $200 million priority claim within 60 days after the approval. Additionally, they also receive another $685 million lower-priority claim paid after customers have been fully paid.On May 7, FTX bankruptcy managers announced a reorganization plan that would see creditors gain full cash repayment. Per the plan, creditors with claims below $50,000 would be eligible for a 118% recovery within 60 days of the court approval.Similarly, other non-governmental creditors would also receive their total claims with up to 9% interest as compensation.Mentioned in this articlePosted In: FTX, BankruptcyLatest Alpha Market Report

How to Sell ETH to Wall Street | Bankless


Ethereum’s spot ETFs could begin trading any day now! One big question remains: how will we sell ETH to Wall Street?It's a question that has perplexed the industry at many times. While Bitcoiners have solidly clung to the easy-to-understand narrative of “digital gold,” Ethereum’s fans have often had a tougher time landing on a shared, succinct narrative that sparks external interest in the ecosystem.Today, we’re evaluating six of the most prominent narrative contenders that encapsulate the essence of Ethereum. We then explain the thought process behind why each could be potent in onboarding the next generation of investors to Ethereum, and assign each one a narrative grade ranking based on how successful we think they will be in courting adoption among prospective ETF buyers👇"It's a Tokenization Platform"Tokenization has already been touted by financial luminaries, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, as representing a paradigm shift for financial markets for its promises to drastically decrease friction and cost while improving accessibility and liquidity. Additionally, it aims to unlock unprecedented levels of transparency and composability!Explaining Ethereum as the world’s leading tokenized asset platform spells out why the Network is important in terms that TradFi participants can understand.Although tokenization does not delve into the positive relationship between increasing onchain activity and ETH price, it demonstrates the central role Ethereum could play in modernizing the financial system; achievement of this goal alone would make ETH the most valuable crypto asset in existence.The narrative captures Ethereum’s role as a global settlement layer for real world assets, making it easier for TradFi to rationalize Ethereum’s role as the global settlement layer for an interconnected network of chains and its pursuit of modular scaling.Narrative Grade: BDespite stated excitement for tokenization from numerous financial institutions, the narrative is hampered by some regulatory uncertainty, but fortunately, investor excitement for tokenization could catalyze needed legislative action to provide regulatory clarity on digital assets and their role within financial markets.
"Ethereum is the Onchain App Store"Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum offers highly expressive smart contracts that unlock financial programmability for developers, enabling the network to become an onchain equivalent of Apple’s App Store.Those who download and fund an Ethereum-compatible crypto wallet receive unfettered access to a litany of consumer applications that facilitate a wide variety of financial, gaming, and cultural interactions. In this digital economy, ETH must be used to pay for gas fees, inciting demand for ETH the asset, and transaction fees payments become revenue for Ethereum, which then trickles down to holders via the Burn – a crypto-native version of stock buybacks!An investment in ETH is akin to buying direct ownership in the App Store, a purchase many investors would be willing to make given its lucrative cash flow generation capabilities and its strong network effects – both qualities which Ethereum possesses.Narrative Grade: C While this narrative has gained traction in recent weeks as the best way to present ETH to TradFi and draws similarities to familiar products, it is unclear if external participants have a good understanding of the types of interactions that can be performed onchain, potentially leading them to ascribe little value to such activities.
"It's an Internet Bond"Parallels can easily be drawn between crypto-native staking schemes and fixed income instruments in TradFi.In exchange for providing 32 ETH as validator collateral (principal), stakers accrue rewards (interest). Unlike in TradFi, this relationship does not depend on any party’s ability to repay the loan, and is instead backed by immutable code and the future economic activity of Ethereum – in the form of block fee revenue and inflationary block rewards.Investors of all kinds love earning passive income off their assets, leading many to assume this would be a slam dunk narrative for Ethereum, particularly in comparison to the only TradFi traded alternative: non-productive BTC.Narrative Grade: CUnfortunately, spot ETH ETFs will not be launching with staking, and while crypto natives can continue to generate yield via this avenue, it is unlikely that the “Internet Bond” narrative will be compelling among investors who can not access this feature, at least until staking-enabled ETFs are launched. ETH: The Internet Finance Bond on BanklessRead our analysis of Ethereum’s internet finance bond with the launch of Ethereum 2.0"ETH is Ultra Sound Money"Bitcoin maximalists have long espoused their chosen digital currency’s “sound money” principles, emphasizing that the network’s programmatic block reward issuance schedule is resistant to debasement, giving BTC its store of value status.“Ultra Sound Money” was created by the Ethereum ecosystem to meaningfully differentiate it as an investment against Bitcoin, and was was first popularized by Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake in September 2020 immediately prior to last cycle’s boom.Although Ethereum does not presently have a guaranteed emissions schedule, ETH supply can turn deflationary as block demand increases thanks to EIP-1559, reducing the number of tokens in circulation over time to theoretically imbue the token with superior store of value qualities, thus creating an “ultra sound money.”Narrative Grade: DSurging prices throughout 2021 made the idea of a deflationary token highly attractive, but this narrative become decidedly less attractive alongside the sharp drop off in inflation; should policy makers resort to debasement to stimulate a global economy in decline, Ultra Sound Money could emerge as as premier narrative. Then again, it may be too degen of a descriptor for Wall Street.
"It's Digital Oil"Bitcoin may have already taken the moniker of “digital gold,” but who cares about a shiny rock when you can own an alternative decentralized commodity that fuels the global economy?When making transactions on the Ethereum L1 and many of its L2s, users must pay for their transaction fees using Ether to get execution; due to the widespread prevalence of onchain transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem, many see ETH as the digital corollary for oil.Like oil, which derives intrinsic value for its usage as a key commodity input, Ether benefits from usage of the applications on Ethereum that require the payment of gas to access.Narrative Grade: DIncreasing usage of Ethereum’s onchain applications should have positive implications for Ether by showcasing the close connection between activity and price, but this narrative seems difficult to sell to traditional market participants who have displayed resilience in making onchain interactions and do not fully grasp what the onchain economy is.
"It's Internet Money"By virtue of Ethereum’s expressive smart contracts, developers can create applications on the blockchain as discussed in the case above for representing Ethereum to TradFi as the next generation equivalent of the App Store.Within this ecosystem, ETH is the native “internet money,” serving as the medium which many store their value in and use for payments. Further, the existence of these smart contracts makes this money programmable, enabling its automated usage by applications.Among earlier generations of crypto users who sought out utility for their assets, the ability to use Ether as money was an attractive use case that drove many to adopt crypto technology, however, it is probably far-fetched to assume that the narrative can produce any excitement for remaining TradFi hold outs.Narrative Grade: FTo start off, the concept of internet money may not be taken seriously by the types of sophisticated/older investors that ETFs are meant to attract. Moreover, people do not typically invest in monies due to their inherent inflationary properties and propensity to lose purchasing power over time, an association which could make it difficult for investors to see value in an asset categorized as such.
🧐 Wait, why no “A” grades?Keen-eyed readers may have noticed that none of the above narratives received an “A” grade! While each narrative certainly comes with its own attractive features, none in isolation are the silver bullet solution required to onboard the next generation of investors to Ethereum.All are either stale or unproven, and while narratives help investors understand aspects of Ethereum, an understanding of the network in its entirety is necessary to fully grasp the revolutionary impacts this technology could yield…For the non-crypto natives that spot ETFs are intended to attract, it will likely be the concept of tokenization that allows them to recognize that importance of block space, the acknowledgement of which is a prerequisite to grasping the notion of Ethereum is the onchain equivalent of the App Store and unlocks their ability to appreciate Ether as digital oil and a new form of money!Regulatory clarity is required for Ethereum’s tokenization and internet bond narratives to truly gain traction, but in the meantime, the ecosystem can always fall back to Ultra Sound Money should policy makers resort to debasement to kickstart the faltering global economy.Ethereum may be too complex to distill down to a single narrative, but efforts to do so present the ecosystem in an approachable format to external investors that could potentially pique their excitement and lead them to dive deeper down the crypto rabbit hole!

Biden Vetoes Bipartisan Bill To Overturn SEC's Crypto Custody Rules - Benzinga

On Monday, President Joe Biden has vetoed a bipartisan resolution aimed at overturning the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) crypto custody guidance. The resolution passed both the House and the Senate and sought to invalidate the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121.Presidential Veto ExplainedIn a letter to the House of Representatives, Biden stressed the importance of the SEC's guidance in safeguarding investors. “SAB 121 reflects considered technical SEC staff views regarding the accounting obligations of certain firms that safeguard crypto-assets,” Biden stated. He emphasized that the resolution would “inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to set forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues.”Biden further clarified, "This reversal of the considered judgment of SEC staff in this way risks undercutting the SEC’s broader authorities regarding accounting practices. My Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors."Legislative BackgroundThe Republican-led legislation garnered notable bipartisan support. It passed the House with a 228 to 182 vote, including backing from 21 Democrats. The Senate approved the bill with a 60 to 38 vote, with eleven Democrats supporting the measure.Political and Regulatory ContextThis veto arrives amid heightened scrutiny of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD. The Biden administration's stance on digital assets is closely watched, especially with the 2024 election on the horizon. Voters have been increasingly considering candidates’ positions on cryptocurrency regulation.Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump, Biden’s anticipated Republican challenger, strongly supports the crypto industry. Recently, Trump began accepting crypto donations and pledged to uphold investors’ rights to self-custody their assets. Benzinga’s Future of Digital AssetsAmid this regulatory backdrop, the upcoming Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event in New York City on Nov. 19, 2024, is poised to be a crucial gathering. This one-day event will bring together digital asset innovators and institutional investors at Convene, 225 Liberty Street. Attendees can engage in extensive networking, attend executive roundtables, and participate in 1:1 meetings, making it an essential event for those involved in the digital assets space.Since its inception in 2022, the conference has consistently attracted thousands of participants. The 2024 edition promises significant improvements in the agenda and will welcome a diverse array of investors, founders, operators, and thought leaders globally. This year’s conference is set to offer unparalleled networking opportunities and deal-making sessions, reinforcing its reputation as a pivotal event in the digital assets industry.Now Read: Kamala Harris Gets Her Own Cannabis Strain ‘Kamala Kush’ Whether She Likes It Or Not: Watch Jimmy Kimmel Break The News To HerImage: President Joe Biden.

When Is An XRP ETF Coming? Ripple President Joins The Conversation To Provide Answers | Bitcoinist.com


								Ripple President Monica Long has shed light on the potential launch of an XRP ETF, clarifying the crypto payment company’s stance on the subject. She addressed the growing interest within the market, stating that the introduction of an XRP ETF would be a reasonable progression. 
Ripple President Deems XRP ETF Plausible
In a recent interview with CNBC, Long addressed the growing curiosity surrounding the possible launch of an XRP ETF. When questioned about the likelihood of an XRP ETF in the near future, Long remarked “I think it will make a lot of sense.”

She cited XRP’s current regulatory status within the United States as the basis for a potential XRP ETF, emphasizing that only XRP and Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, have obtained regulatory clarity regarding their status in the United States. 
Long lauded XRP’s performance in the crypto market, declaring that it currently ranks among the top 10 cryptocurrency assets by market capitalization and is among the top 5 digital assets in terms of trading volume. Her endorsement of XRP as a major player in the crypto market further solidifies her conviction that the market might see an XRP ETF soon.
Following the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF and an Ethereum Spot ETF, XRP has remained firmly in the spotlight, as numerous crypto analysts predict that the cryptocurrency could be next in line for an ETF. 
Despite the excitement and hopes for an XRP ETF, the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could pose a significant challenge. 
Before the SEC’s approval of an Ethereum ETF, various crypto analysts had low expectations of an Ethereum ETF in 2024. They pointed out that the SEC’s implicit classification of Ethereum as a security could hinder its ETF approval process.  
The same analysis could be applied to XRP, which has been entangled in a nearly four-year court battle with the SEC. In its lawsuit against Ripple, the US SEC accused the crypto payments company of selling unregistered securities in XRP. This claim has been rigorously disputed by Ripple in court, winning a victory after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that programmatic sales of XRP were not considered unregistered securities. 
In spite of these regulatory hurdles, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse has maintained an optimistic outlook for an XRP ETF, predicting a possible approval by 2025. 
Ripple Stablecoin Set To Launch This Year
In the interview, Long shared valuable insights on the development and launch of Ripple’s stablecoin. While specific details about the stablecoin launch date and features remain undisclosed, the Ripple President revealed that the crypto community can look forward to a possible launch later this year. 

She emphasized the importance of stablecoins within the volatile crypto market, highlighting that stablecoins had a multi-billion dollar market capitalization and have emerged as a reliable payment option for users who want to move and store their assets safely.

Giant Whale Dumped This Altcoin: Chart Shows Sudden Drop - Bitcoin Sistemi


Onchain data witnessed a whale having an impressive impact on the price of an altcoin today.
According to data provided by Lookonchain, within two hours, a cryptocurrency whale sold a total of $7.08 million worth of UniSwap (UNI) tokens, causing the UNI price to lose approximately 4% of its value. This depreciation shows itself strikingly on the UNI chart.


The cryptocurrency whale in question bought these UNI tokens for an average of $10.54 by paying $13.7 million. At the time of writing this article, UNI price is trading at $10.46.
Graph showing the decline in the UNI price.

Despite selling a large amount, the giant whale still has 969,808 UNI tokens worth $ 7.46 million. The amount of profit made by the whale, who accumulated these tokens in 3 different wallets, from the last sales is around 800 thousand dollars.





Uniswap wants to introduce a fee switch mechanism soon, and this mechanism, which has received great support from the community, will transfer some of the transaction fees on the platform to UNI token holders.

$1.5 Trillion Asset Manager Franklin Templeton Explores New Crypto Fund For Solana, XRP, Shiba Inu ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
$1.64 trillion Wall Street asset manager Franklin Templeton is mulling the launch of a new private fund that would invest in tokens other than Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).



Franklin Templeton Eyes Altcoin-Focused Crypto Fund 



According to a June 6 report from The Information citing anonymous individuals with knowledge of the plans, the private fund will target institutional investors and will be dedicated to altcoins like Solana, XRP, Shiba Inu, Cardano, and the like.



Franklin Templeton is no stranger to the crypto ecosystem. The Wall Street titan forayed into the digital assets world in 2018. It introduced a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in mid-January and has also applied to offer a similar offering for the industry’s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. In fact, Franklin Templeton was recently the first issuer to announce its sponsor fees for its spot ETH ETF in its updated S-1 statement.



“We are excited about ETH and its ecosystem. Despite the midlife crisis it’s recently experienced, we see a bright future with many strong tailwinds to push the Ethereum ecosystem forward,” the company previously stated in an X post.



By venturing beyond the top two major crypto assets, the asset management firm is signaling comfort with the class of tokens that the SEC has long deemed unregistered securities.

&nbsp



While the report does not indicate which altcoins in particular would be included in the new crypto fund’s basket, Franklin Templeton has publicly hailed the growth of the Solana network in 2024, commending Anatoly Yakovenko’s vision of “a single atomic state machine as a powerful use case of decentralized blockchains.”



Staking Rewards And Global Expansion



Franklin’s Thursday announcement comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s shocking approval of key regulatory filings related to the spot Ether ETF applications in late May — despite the top financial cop having reportedly classed Ethereum internally as an unregistered security for more than a year. 



Notably, staking rewards were not included in the proposed Ether funds when the SEC gave its regulatory blessing to the first stage of applications last month. However, Franklin Templeton is considering offering investors staking rewards with the new altcoin fund.



Although Franklin Templeton’s spot BTC ETF has not been as successful as the financial instruments offered by peers BlackRock and Fidelity, the report noted that the company is keen to grow its crypto assets business outside the US.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Compressed Below $72K, But Dovish Fed Amid Soft U.S. Data, Global Rate Cuts May Bring All-Time Highs

The big question going forward is if the U.S. Federal Reserve might join the rate cutting trend, and while some members of that central bank have suggested any monetary easing could be a 2025 story, recent data has shown softening in both inflation and economic growth. Tomorrow will bring the government's May employment report and a weak read could boost the odds of an imminent Fed rate cut.

"Cheater" Alert on this Altcoin: Analytics Firm Warns - Insider Investor Bought Nearly Half of Total Supply - Bitcoin Sistemi


There were interesting developments in today's onchain data, especially on the memecoin side.
It has been observed that, most likely, an insider, that is, a person from the altcoin team, made a high profit by purchasing a large amount of a cryptocurrency as soon as it was released.


The suspicious altcoin was a newly launched memecoin called EgyptCat (SPHYNX). According to Onchain data, a cryptocurrency whale purchased a large amount of tokens by paying a high transaction fee as soon as this altcoin was launched, in a process called “sniping”.

According to the data, the cryptocurrency whale in question purchased SPHYNX by paying 120 SOL just seconds after the altcoin was launched. Balina wallet then sold these cryptocurrencies for 3,257 SOL and made a total profit of 540 thousand dollars within an hour.





However, cryptocurrency analysis platform Lookonchain claimed in its statement that the SPHYNX altcoin launch was an unfair launch. According to Lookchain, one insider purchased 49.62% of the total SPHYNX supply using 10 different new cryptocurrency wallets. The insider, who spent a total of 670 thousand dollars, later distributed these tokens to almost 300 different wallets.

Charles Hoskinson Blasts Media's Negative Portrayal of Cardano's Prospects


																Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has dismissed claims that the network suffers from weak fundamentals.
He criticized media outlets for their continued negative portrayal of the ecosystem, asserting a stark contrast between the reality of Cardano’s progress and the media’s depiction.
Cardano Founder Refutes Media’s Gloomy Forecasts
In a sharp rebuke this week, Hoskinson accused the media of wrongly predicting the downfall of the blockchain network and affirmed that the ecosystem is here to stay.
Hoskinson highlighted the significant advancements made by Cardano over the years and outlined a major hard fork in the offing, which he described as the most significant in the project’s history.
He pointed to the rapid growth of community DApps, Cardano’s role in scaling research and development, and the importance of upcoming events such as Rare Evo, the Foundation Summit, and Token 2049.




He also noted the maturation of technologies like Hydra, the development of partner chains, initiatives like Midnight and Prism, and numerous community events, including Catalyst and the constitutional convention in Argentina.
Despite these positive developments, Hoskinson expressed dismay over the negative headlines in the media, exemplified by speculation about Cardano’s potential collapse. While condemning these narratives as “beyond pathetic,” Hoskinson went on to criticize the low quality and effort put into covering Cardano’s ecosystem.
In his latest tweet, the IOG exec expressed his frustration by stating,
“Never in my career have I seen such a profound disconnect between reality and opinion with the cryptocurrency influencer and media perception of Cardano versus its actual fundamentals.”
He reiterated his belief in Cardano’s resilience and its potential to drive the cryptocurrency industry forward, addressing significant economic, political, and social issues.
Cardano’s Chang Hard Fork
The Cardano ecosystem is gearing up for the upcoming Chang hard fork, which is scheduled for the second quarter of this year. This upgrade represents a new era of governance for the Cardano blockchain.
The fork will introduce two significant upgrades: Chang Upgrade Number One and Chang Upgrade Number Two. The first upgrade will deploy governance features on the Cardano network, initiating the technical bootstrapping phase outlined in SIP 1694, setting the stage for decentralized voting and governance actions, etc.
Building upon this, Chang Upgrade Number Two will transition SIP 1694 out of the technical bootstrapping phase, unlocking the full potential of on-chain governance, including delegated representative participation and treasury withdrawals. This will enable the Cardano community to propose and fund new projects, ensuring the ecosystem’s sustainability and continuous evolution.

Scammers Ask for Crypto on Fake SpaceX Elon Musk Livestream by Dubbing an AI Voice Over Real Video: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A new report shows that over 100,000 people viewed a fake SpaceX livestream combining real video with an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated Elon Musk voiceover.
According to a report and screenshot from TrustNodes, over 125,000 people were watching a SpaceX livestream on a fake YouTube channel with a QR code asking for crypto donations on the screen.










Source: TrustNodes
The QR code remained on the screen for the entirety of the livestream.
The YouTube channel, @SpaceXFromElon, has nearly 3 million subscribers, despite its prominent lack of a check mark. The real SpaceX YouTube channel, @SpaceX, has 6.7 million subscribers and, perhaps most importantly, a verified check mark.
In the fake live stream, the AI-generated Elon Musk voice, after expounding on the benefits and future profits of Bitcoin (BTC), directly asks for viewers to scan the QR code in a pitch to make them crypto-rich.
AI-generated crypto scam videos have been on the rise with the explosion of the technology. Elon Musk is a common target, and the same channel used the same live stream during the eclipse just two months ago.
Musk is well known in the crypto community as a Dogecoin (DOGE) supporter.
Metrics on how many viewers followed the QR code are currently unavailable.

Dogecoin Bullish Outlook: Analyst Predicts 4x Surge, Eyeing New All-Time High | Bitcoinist.com


								As the meme coin mania persists, popular cryptocurrency expert and enthusiast Javon Marks, in a bullish outlook for Dogecoin (DOGE), has predicted the crypto asset to undergo a 4x surge, projecting it to reach a new all-time high and potentially climbing higher.
Impending 4x Spike For Dogecoin To New All-Time High
This optimistic forecast, which indicates tremendous growth potential for Dogecoin in the upcoming months, coincides with a more general upward trend in the cryptocurrency sector. The crypto analyst attributes the positive outlook for the popular meme coin to the pattern of previous breakouts and runs.
Back in April, Javon Marks shared an intriguing prediction for DOGE that it could witness a massive rally to the pivotal $12 price mark. “A $12 DOGE (Dogecoin) could be well on its way and the process may have already begun,” he stated.
DOGE set for 4x spike to new all-time highs | Source: Javon Marks on X
A month later, the crypto expert reiterated the bold forecast, noting that the trend is still present. According to Javon Marks, Dogecoin was held in a broken-out state once more, and these runs, the expert confirmed, have gotten bigger one after the other, due to the pattern of previous breakouts and runs. This indicates that the next run, which might already be in its early phases, might be bigger than the last run, where DOGE saw a move of more than 20,000%.
The post read:
DOGE (Dogecoin) holds in a broken-out state once again and based on the trend of prior breakouts and runs, these runs have consecutively gotten larger, meaning the upcoming run, which may be in the early stages now could be larger than the previous run, which was an over 20,000% move.
As a result, Javon Marks anticipates another huge run from the asset’s price at that time that might trigger a move of over 7,500% to the $12 price target, if not higher. He further highlighted that possibly the trend might be at the beginning, suggesting that the coin could be poised for constant gains from this point.
And now, the analyst asserted that the trend shows DOGE could experience a  4x spike to new all-time highs and potentially much higher. Given the momentum of this trend, Javon Marks now believes a $10 mark might be forthcoming for DOGE, maybe even toward the $12 level.
DOGE Seeing Positive Movement
Presently, the biggest meme coin, Dogecoin, is experiencing a positive movement along with other well-known cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). 
After falling as low as $0.155 during the start of the month, DOGE has experienced a rebound to the $0.16 threshold. Given the current momentum in the meme coin market, DOGE may be in a position to attract more gains in the coming months.
At the time of writing, DOGE had a market capitalization of over $23.64 billion, a 24-hour trading volume of over $684 million, and a price increase of 2.82% in the past week, trading at over $0.1635. Its market cap in the past day has increased by 0.62%, while its trading volume is seeing a negative drop of over 19%.

Crypto Trading Activity Declines: Centralized Exchanges See 20.1% Drop in May | Cryptoglobe


                                
The total cryptocurrency trading volume on centralized exchanges has plunged 20.1% last month to a total of $5.27 trillion while major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum remained rangebound, with a sudden volatility spike after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Ether exchange-traded funds in the US.



According to CCData’s latest Exchange Review report, spot trading volumes on centralized exchanges last month fell 21.6% to $1.57 trillion to record their second consecutive monthly decline in trading activity.



Derivatives trading volumes were also hit, dropping 19.4% to $3.69 trillion, in a smaller decline that meant the market dominance of derivatives products has grown to its highest level since December 2023.



Source: CCData



The derivatives market share growth can be attributed to a surge in interest from traders following the unexpected approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC, which as CryptoGlobe reported led to an ETH price rise of over 20% in a single day. The report suggests that traders flocked to the derivatives markets to capitalize on this regulatory development.



The report adds that open interest on centralized exchange rose by 30.5% to $55.2 billion in May with the three largest derivatives trading platforms – Binance, OKX, and Bitget – seeing rises of 33.2%, 22.1%, and 39.2% respectively.







On the CME, open interest for Ethereum futures notably rose 59.3% to $1.25 billion with sentiment for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization growing significantly after the SEC’s surprised approval of spot Ether ETFs.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

That same exchange, as a result of the approval, saw Ethereum options trading volumes rise to a new all-time high of $931 million, while ETH futures contracts rose 37.5% to $20.5 billion in a month in which the CME saw overall derivatives volumes drop 7.42% to $115 billion.



Open interest for Ethereum instruments across the cryptocurrency space notably rose 50.3% to $14 billion, according to CCData’s report. Notably, Ethereum whale accumulation has been growing, as according to an analyst from cryptocurrency analytics firm CryptoQuant, over 800,000 ETH worth around $3 billion has moved off of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in little over a week.



The analyst noted that institutions preparing for a spot Ethereum ETF to start trading in the United States could be behind the centralized exchange outflows in a bid to meet the potential demand from investors for such a fund.



IntoTheBlock, a cryptocurrency intelligence firm, has noted that whale accumulation has recently intensified, with 41% of the supply of the second-largest cryptocurrency now being held by addresses with more than 1% of its total circulating supply, up from 36% at the beginning of the year.



Per the firm, the trend highlights the increasing confidence in ETH among large holders.

Roaring Kitty Reveals Livestream Return as GameStop Stock Blasts Off - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsQuintessential meme stock GameStop (GME) skyrocketed 48% in a single day, closing out Thursday at $46.55, hours after its biggest booster Keith Gill—better known as Roaring Kitty—publicly scheduled a YouTube livestream for noon ET on Friday.The move came after eagle-eyed fanatics noticed a small update to his YouTube account earlier in the day. GME was already up 9% intraday at the time, capping off a dizzying few days where the share price popped 16% yesterday alone, and its strong growth led to potential losses of $1 billion for short sellers who expected its price to weaken.The price of GME is up 185% over the past month; its returns over the past six months and year-to-date show roughly the same rise.Moments after markets closed, Gill's DeepFuckingValue account on Reddit posted a new “YOLO update” that showed GME's closing price, and another massive set of gains.The stock—along with other nostalgia-tinged "meme stocks" like AMC Entertainment—rocked the markets in 2021 when retail investors rushed to buy, many hoping to hurt large institutional investors that had bet heavily against it.GME has again been on a roll since Roaring Kitty returned to Twitter on May 12. Even though his cryptic video clip posts did not mention GameStop, it caused enough of a frenzy that GME trading had to be halted several times the following day.After a couple of weeks of silence, Roaring Kitty returned to both Twitter and Reddit this week, with a new post under Gill's DeepFuckingValue account on Sunday explicitly indicating GameStop stock holdings—and a massive $200 million bet that the game retailer's stock will be worth more than $20 on June 21.Gill's revelation of direct participation in the GME rally he sparked was enough to prompt investment giant Morgan Stanley to reportedly consider removing him from its ETrade trading platform, and drew the scrutiny of federal and state regulators concerned about market manipulation.With Twitter and Reddit accounts revived, Gill's return to YouTube was perhaps inevitable.The last Roaring Kitty livestream was in April 2021 and has garnered 1.1 million views since. Anticipation is high for the upcoming show, with over 14,200 YouTube users already signed up to watch as of writing. The associated chat is already overflowing with a constant stream of live comments.While meme stock, crypto traders, and everyday investors wait with bated breath to hear what Gill might have to say on Friday, the livestream description includes a frank disclaimer similar to the ones that have always preceded one of his videos.“The Roaring Kitty channel and livestreams are for educational and entertainment purposes only,” it reads. “I don't provide personal investment advice or stock recommendations during the stream.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

‘Hamster Kombat’ Telegram Game Hits 100 Million Players-Here's When the Token Is Coming - Decrypt

Hamster Kombat, the latest Telegram-based game to follow in the footsteps of crypto gaming sensation Notcoin, is seeing skyrocketing interest ahead of the upcoming token launch on The Open Network (TON). Now the team has revealed a massive milestone for players and has teased a launch target for the impending token.On Wednesday, the Hamster Kombat team announced that it has drawn 100 million players into the Telegram mini app to date, blasting upwards from a claimed mark of 60 million players last Friday.That’s an enormous amount of players for any game, let alone one that is set to have a crypto token in the near future. There’s very little friction to start playing, to be sure, and the game itself is built around a simple clicking mechanism.It’s not difficult to get people to hop in and start playing Hamster Kombat, though whether they stick around is another story. For now, screenshots of data shared by Hamster Kombat point to something in the range of 40-45 million daily active users (DAU), though a large chunk of that may be people playing for the very first time given the influx of new users.Hamster Kombat is also seeing significant social media attention, giving some credence to the claimed player base stats.The game now has the single largest Telegram channel on the messaging app with over 27 million subscribers, or more than three times that of the official Notcoin announcements channel, for example. It has also racked up nearly 17 million YouTube subscribers, and has almost six million Twitter followers as well.Why are people tapping their screens incessantly and operating a hamster-led fictional crypto exchange? Most players are likely in it for the eventual token airdrop, given how well Notcoin—its spiritual predecessor—landed for players recently. And now we have a target for when the token might drop.In a Twitter Spaces held with the TON Foundation earlier this week, a Hamster Kombat team member who went by “Hamster Girl” said that the current token listing target is in July—though that could change based on various factors. A TON Foundation representative separately confirmed to Decrypt’s GG on Thursday that the game’s team is aiming for July.“It can be a little bit sooner, it can be a little bit later, because there's obviously different moving parts involved including compliance [and] negotiations,” Hamster Girl said on the Twitter Spaces.Notcoin’s token listing, for example, was delayed for about a month. It was originally scheduled to happen in parallel with the Bitcoin halving on April 20, but just days before the planned drop, developer Open Builders pushed back the NOT launch. It then missed an end-of-April target before finally launching on May 16.But the NOT launch proved to be well worth the wait for players, particularly those who held onto their tokens—it’s up 350% in the last two weeks and is now one of the top 60 cryptocurrencies overall by market cap at $2.15 billion.Hamster Kombat players are undoubtedly hoping for similar buzz once their token is available. And Toncoin, the native token of The Open Network, may be benefitting from the Hamster Kombat buzz too. Now the 10th most-valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, TON hit a new all-time high price of $7.76 early Wednesday.And for players who enjoy the tapping gameplay, fear not: Unlike Notcoin, Hamster Kombat apparently doesn’t plan to pause the gameplay once the token launch nears.“Obviously, the game will never stop,” said Hamster Girl. “It will not stop after the listing. It will keep rolling, and a lot more mechanics are coming, a lot more cards [...] and a lot more incentive to invite even more friends and play along with each other.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

U.S. Charges Three in Connection With Evolved Apes NFT Scam

"The defendants ran a scam to drive up the price of digital artwork through false promises about developing a videogame," U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. "They allegedly took investor funds, never developed the game, and pocketed the proceeds. Digital art may be new, but old rules still apply: making false promises for money is illegal."

Did Hulk Hogan Really Pump and Dump a Solana Meme Coin? - Decrypt

One week after celebrities Caitlyn Jenner and Iggy Azalea launched buzzy meme coins, it appeared as if legendary professional wrestler Hulk Hogan had done much the same on Thursday with the HULK token on Solana.But after the coin was quickly “rugged” at the expense of investors, Hogan took to Instagram to urge fans to ignore any crypto post that came from his Twitter account.“Please do not take notice of any posts posted today,” Hogan shared on Instagram. “They are not from me and will be promptly removed.”Indeed, there’s no sign of the purported crypto scam on Hogan’s official Twitter account. In fact, there’s nothing on his feed anymore—everything’s been deleted.It’s not immediately clear whether Hogan’s Twitter account was hacked to share an elaborate crypto scheme—as we’ve seen in the past with other celebrities and public figures—or if perhaps someone connected to Hogan and the account had used it maliciously.The website URL on Hogan’s otherwise empty Twitter profile still points to a website created for the token, and a quick search of his name reveals the wreckage left in the crypto community on Thursday.Hogan’s account had shared dozens of posts about the HULK meme coin, including tweeting at Iggy Azalea about her coin. The account also shared an apparent video endorsement of the coin, but journalist Matt Binder tweeted that it’s actually pulled from an unrelated 2023 video about a karaoke competition and didn’t specifically mention cryptocurrency.According to on-chain data from DexScreener, the HULK token quickly skyrocketed to a market cap of nearly $19 million. That’s before the price quickly plunged, apparently due to the person who originally deployed the token selling large quantities—a crypto “rug pull” on buyers—or a classic pump-and-dump, for that matter.HULK now sits at a market cap of just $3 million, down about 85% from the short-lived peak, with some $82 million worth of trading volume in just a matter of hours. Traders have taken to Twitter to complain about feeling swindled by the legend—though that apparent dismay, in some cases, may be softened by the glow of nostalgia.“LMFAO man, I was the biggest Hulk Hogan fan growing up… literally would watch wrestling in the electronic store TV from outside every week,” tweeted pseudonymous trader and influencer Wizard of SoHo. “If I could tell my 8-year-old self that someday Hulk Hogan would scam me for 20K … holy shit LMFAO.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

New York Sues Crypto Miner and Exchange for $1 Billion In Fraud - Decrypt

New York Attorney General Letitia James has levied another billion-dollar lawsuit against crypto scammers in the state that she says defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors.James’ office accused crypto exchange NovaTech and mining firm AWS Mining of “engaging in illegal pyramid schemes” that robbed investors, including 11,000 New Yorkers, of over a billion dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency, according to a Thursday press release. She now seeks to ban both firms from doing further business in New York.“These cryptocurrency companies targeted immigrant and religious communities with promises of financial freedom but instead stole their money and drained their life savings,” said James, noting their use of common crypto scam channels including social media and WhatsApp groups.According to the lawsuit, AWS Mining and its promoters–naming Panama residents Cynthia and Eddy Petion, among others–promised investors “15 to 20 percent monthly returns” through crypto mining business, including bonuses for roping in new investors.Unable to sustain its promised returns for long, the company collapsed in 2019, after which the Petions moved on to launch NovaTech. The startup trading platform recruited customers using similar tactics: high-return promises and recruitment bonuses.While supposedly paying investor returns using the company’s weekly profits, investor profits were actually generated using money coming in from new investors. Despite taking in over a billion dollars between 2019 and 2023, prosecutors say the platform only ever processed $26 million in actual crypto trades.“We are seeing the real dangers of unregulated cryptocurrency platforms with schemes like these, but New Yorkers can rest assured that we will use the tools at our disposal to crack down on crypto fraudsters,” James vowed.The NYAG has led a slew of high-profile cases against crypto industry leaders, securing $2 billion from crypto trading desk Genesis Global following its late 2022 collapse.She also secured $22 million from crypto exchange KuCoin last year for failing to register as a commodities and securities exchange. The lawsuit famously alleged that Ethereum is an unregistered security rather than a commodity—a debate that regulators nor lawmakers have yet sorted out.The US House of Representatives recently passed legislation in an attempt to clear the air on how commodities and securities law applies to crypto, and how exchanges can properly register with each agency.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Robinhood CEO Says Exchange Is Ready For Roaring Kitty Livestream Surge: 'We Are Prepared' For GameStop Frenzy - Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD), GameStop (NYSE:GME) - Benzinga

Robinhood Markets Inc HOOD is making headlines as CEO Vlad Tenev addresses the company’s preparedness for the recent surge in GameStop Corp GME shares and its strategic acquisition of Bitstamp. This follows Keith Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, announcing a livestream, causing GameStop shares to soar by 47%.In an interview with Fox Business on Thursday, Tenev assured that Robinhood is ready for increased trading volume. “We are prepared. We’ve been working on improving the infrastructure tremendously,” he said. Tenev highlighted the company’s 24-hour market trading, which allows customers to trade stocks 24 hours a day, five days a week. “So much of this activity starts on the weekends or late at night, Sunday evening in this case,” he said.Tenev was asked what he was doing Sunday night when Gill posted his $115 million GameStop holdings (which he updated to $586.459 million on Thursday), igniting trading activity. “I think I was at home, just usually working on Sundays. I was preparing for the week and fortunately, back in COVID days, I would be watching all of our metrics like a hawk, talking to the engineers, but knock on wood, things have been running fairly smoothly.”Also Read: GameStop Meme Coin Rallies 50% Amid Roaring Kitty Video Countdown And Market Manipulation DebateThe interview also covered Robinhood’s acquisition of Bitstamp for $200 million. Tenev outlined three primary benefits: accelerated international expansion, the creation of a new exchange and entry into the institutional business. “It accelerates our international expansion. Bitstamp is a global company with operations in many of the major markets,” he told Fox Business.“We’ve been thinking for a long time that there is a need for a new exchange in the marketplace, and this paves the way for a new player.”Tenev also mentioned the move into the institutional business. “Many of our market makers say that a new exchange is needed, one that’s trusted, takes regulatory compliance seriously, and has an advantage in technology,” he said. Robinhood aims to provide the lowest cost trading and superior user experience, recently reducing margin rates to the industry’s lowest.Looking ahead, Tenev sees the convergence of traditional assets and crypto technology. “We think that in the future, crypto technology and the traditional financial system, including stocks, could converge,” he said. This vision aligns with Robinhood’s strategy to lead in both the crypto and traditional financial markets.Now Read: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Losing Steam Before ‘Fifth Attempt To Break This BTC $72-$73K Resistance Level’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock

Kraken looking to raise $100 million in preparation for 2025 IPO

Kraken is reportedly planning to raise $100 million through a final funding round by the end of the year before an eventual IPO in 2025, Bloomberg News reported on June 6, citing people familiar with the matter.The report said that Kraken is currently looking for a marquee company to join its board to help organize the IPO. However, discussions with companies have only involved verbal exchanges of terms and valuations without formal documentation.Kraken did not confirm the plan and only told Bloomberg that it is “fully focused on investing” in its goal of “accelerating the global adoption of crypto.Earlier IPO rumorsRumors around a Kraken IPO have circulated since at least February 2021, when Bloomberg reported that the firm could go public at a $10 billion valuation.In March, Kraken’s co-founder and then-CEO Jesse Powell confirmed that the company was considering an IPO and called $10 billion a “low valuation.” He anticipated a 2022 IPO but emphasized that such an offering was not guaranteed.The IPO did not come to fruition before Powell announced plans to step down as CEO and become chairman in late 2022, a transition completed in April 2023.In November 2023, new CEO Dave Ripley declined to comment on any specific IPO plans but said the company sought private and public funding alike.Crunchbase data indicates the firm has raised more than $30 million in over 20 funding rounds.SEC has sued KrakenKraken would need to register its IPO with the SEC, which is currently embroiled in a legal tussle with the exchange.The SEC filed a lawsuit against Kraken in November 2023, alleging that the exchange was operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency, among other concerns.Kraken has opted not to settle and is combating the lawsuit in court. It is unclear how the lawsuit might impact any future Kraken IPO.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Shiba Inu Open Interest Returns To February 2024 Levels, What Happened Last Time?


																Shiba Inu has seen a notable uptick in its open interest that has sent renewed vigor through investors. While the meme coin’s open interest is yet to break its Match 2024 all-time high, it is on a bullish trend that could see an attempt soon.
Shiba Inu Open Interest At February Levels
The total Shiba Inu open interest has climbed back above $97 million across multiple exchanges, bringing it to one of the highest levels so far for the year. According to data from Coinglass, the SHIB open interest is now sitting at $97.08 million as of June 6, 2024.

	Related Reading


This figure is notable because the open interest has been struggling over the last few months. After hitting an all-time high of almost $136 million in March 2024, the Shiba Inu open interest fell rapidly, losing more than half of its value by mid-April.
However, the SHIB open interest began to recover in May, and with June rolling around, the open interest has surged. From the March lows to the currently June figures, the Shiba Inu open interest is now up almost 100%, showing a notable spike in interest from investors.
Source: Coinglass
Currently sitting above 97%, the SHIB open interest is now around 60% away from making a new all-time high. The possibility of this happening has significant implications for the SHIB price hitting a new all-time high as well.
Why A Rise In Open Interest Is Important
The Shiba Inu open interest is on the rise is significant not just to measure investor interest but in how it affects the SHIB price. Looking at the March figures when the SHIB open interest had hit a new all-time high, the price had rallied right alongside it. So the current increase could translate into a price rally as well.

	Related Reading


If the open interest were to go back to its $136 million ATH, going by how much the price rose the last time, it could see the Shiba Inu price touch $0.00004 once more, and hit a new yearly high. This is because in March, the SHIB price more than doubled when the open interest surged.
However, in the last 24 hours, there has been a small slow down in the open interest, with an overall 0.42% decrease. The SHIB price is currently trending at $0.0000256 at the time of writing, representing a 4.41% decrease in the last week.

Bitcoin (BTC) Hidden Disaster Incoming? XRP Reaches Turning Point: What's Next? Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Path to Victory?

When Bitcoin recently broke through the $70,000 barrier, it achieved a major milestone. However, the development of a double top pattern around the $71,900 level may be a warning sign that this achievement is approaching.According to technical analysis, a double top pattern is a bearish signal that is on the verge of finishing on the BTC chart. It appears when an asset reaches its peak, retraces its steps and then reaches its peak once more before beginning to decline. This pattern indicates that there may be a downturn and that the asset may find it difficult to sustain its upward momentum.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAn analysis of the current Bitcoin chart: In the case of Bitcoin, the price tried to rise after crossing $70,000 but encountered resistance close to $71,900. Bitcoin may finish the double top formation, signaling a possible end to the current rally if it is unable to overcome this resistance and retreats.Relative Strength Index (RSI): A price correction is usually preceded by overbought levels, which are approaching for Bitcoin.Trading volume: The volume has not been particularly high during the recent upward trend, which implies that the buying pressure may be waning.Broader market context: The general sentiment of the market is still largely positive despite these cautionary signals. The increasing acceptance of Bitcoin by the general public and institutions could offset any possible bearish trends.Important levels to keep an eye on: Support at $70,000: Should Bitcoin fall below this mark, it may validate the double top pattern and trigger a downturn. The resistance is at $71,900. A high volume surge over this point could invalidate the bearish pattern and indicate that the upward momentum is still there.XRP's positive dynamicsXRP is finally showing some positive dynamics, yet cautiously. The asset's price is moving upwards and might soon reach the 100 EMA resistance level (orange line). For now, the consolidation at the 50 EMA continues and a bounce off of it would be a go-to scenario for the asset.The price of XRP has been consolidating recently around the 50 EMA (green line). The market may be waiting to act decisively before making a move, as indicated by this consolidation. If XRP is able to overcome the 50 EMA support, it might proceed to the 100 EMA, which is a crucial resistance level that might dictate its next significant move.The Relative Strength Index is not overbought or oversold at this time, indicating neutrality. This state of neutrality may signal a major move in prices. The volume has exhibited a degree of stability, suggesting that the market is in equilibrium with minimal buying or selling pressure. In either case, a volume spike might indicate a breakout.Key levels to watch: 50 EMA support: This is an important level of support. Bullish momentum may be indicated by a significant rebound from this level. Resistance at 100 EMA: An important resistance level is found at the 100 EMA, or orange line. Victory here might pave the way for increased costs. Long-term moving averages: The 200 EMA, or black line, continues to be a level of long-term resistance. To validate a long-term upward trend, XRP must break above this.Shiba Inu's pathSupporters of SHIB have been encouraged by its recent price movement. Strong support is being provided by the bounce off the 50 EMA. The critical resistance at $0.000027 may be tested shortly if the price can maintain its current upward momentum. If this barrier is broken, there may be a major trend reversal and additional gains.The positive outlook for SHIB is supported by a number of technical indicators. As of right now, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neither overbought nor oversold. Instead, it is in a neutral zone. This shows that there is still potential for growth without running the immediate risk of a reversal because of overbought circumstances.The market appears to be in equilibrium as the trading volume has remained steady. The impetus required for SHIB to overcome significant resistance levels may be a spike in volume.A crucial level of support for SHIB is at 50 EMA. As we are seeing right now, a significant recovery from this level frequently denotes bullish momentum.Resistance at $0.000027: There has been a lot of resistance at this level. Breakouts above $0.000027 may allow SHIB to rise to all-time highs. It will also be crucial to keep an eye on the 200 and 100 EMAs. A break above these long-term resistance levels would confirm SHIB’s bullish trend.

Feds Charge UK Nationals With $3 Million ‘Evolved Apes’ Ethereum NFT Scam - Decrypt

Three UK nationals are charged with orchestrating a $3 million scam related to the “Evolved Apes” NFT collection, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday. Mohamed-Amin Atcha, Mohamed Rilaz Waleedh, and Daood Hassan are accused of wire fraud and money laundering in what authorities called a pump-and-dump scheme.The DOJ said the charges stemmed from a 2021 scheme to get NFT collectors to purchase one of “10,000 unique” Ethereum-based NFTs called Evolved Apes that could then be used in an online battle royale game. The defendants made off with 798 ETH, worth around $2.7 million at the time.“As alleged, the defendants ran a scam to drive up the price of digital artwork through false promises about developing a videogame,” U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in a statement. “They allegedly took investor funds, never developed the game, and pocketed the proceeds.”The DOJ alleges that Atcha and Waleedh aggressively promoted Evolved Apes, including hiring an unnamed social media influencer to shill the project.A pump-and-dump scheme is when investors are enticed to buy an asset based on misleading information. The fraudster uses early interest to drive up the price of the asset, only to sell everything off and disappear—or “rug pull”—leaving unwitting victims holding worthless tokens.According to case documents, Waleedh identified himself as the lead marketing manager for Evolved Apes when attempting to withdraw funds that had been stuck on an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange that the group was using. When Waleedh was allowed to access the funds, the DOJ alleged, he transferred them to a cryptocurrency address controlled by Hassan.“Digital art may be new, but old rules still apply: making false promises for money is illegal. As we allege, thousands of people believed these false promises and were tricked into buying these NFTs, including here in the Southern District of New York,” Williams said. “NFT fraud is no game, and those responsible will be held accountable.”If convicted, the trio faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.Rug pulls are rampant in the cryptocurrency space. Most recently, two rug pulls made headlines, including in May when a purported “mother and son” duo staged a scandalous livestream to pump the “LIVEMOM” token and made off with $300,000. This was followed by another scheme in which a pseudonymous creator shilled the “HANDS” meme coin.“I don’t have hands, I cannot rug you guys, chill,” the creator said during a livestream on the NoHandsNoRug Twitch channel—only to reveal his hands before selling the 7 SOL accumulated in the scheme, worth around $1,000.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Goldman Sachs Predicts Incoming ‘Wall of Money’ Could Fuel Summer Stock Market Rally | Cryptoglobe


                                
Goldman Sachs is raising a bullish flag for the stock market in early July, anticipating a surge driven by a ‘wall of money’ from passive investment vehicles over the beginning of the third quarter and second half of the year.



According to Scott Rubner, managing director and tactical specialist in Goldman’s global markets division, share prices could also benefit from strong seasonal trends and a potential increase in retail investor participation, as Bloomberg reported.



In a note, Rubner wrote he is seeing a “re-emergence in retail traders during the summer, they tend to come around in July,” and noting that since 1928 the first 15 days of that month have been the best two-week stretch for equities, with returns tending to taper off after July 17.



The S&P 500 itself boasts a winning streak in July for nine consecutive years, averaging a return of 3.7%. The Nasdaq 100 fares even better, with 16 straight Julys in positive territory and an average return of 4.6%.



Based on his calculations, Rubner estimates an influx of roughly nine basis points of new capital each July. In the context of today’s market, this translates to approximately $26 billion considering the $29 trillion pool of passive assets available for investment.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Retail investors could also benefit the cryptocurrency space, which has been seeing institutional investors add to their exposure via the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched in the United States back in January.



As CryptoGlobe reported, earlier this year BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw its BTC holdings surpass those of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), making it the world’s largest exchange-traded fund offering investors exposure to the price of Bitcoin.



Source: CCData



Analysts attribute this shift to Grayscale’s higher fees, which have driven investors towards BlackRock’s lower-cost alternative after GBTC was converted into a spot Bitcoin ETF at the same time several of these ETFs started trading in the United States.



Notably, BlackRock’s income and bond-focused funds have recently added exposure to its own spot Bitcoin ETF, with regulatory filings showing that BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Fund and Strategic Global Bond Fund purchased shares of iShares Bitcoin Trust.

Analyst Says Dogecoin Ready To See A Breakout Massive Whale Accumulation | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Kevin (Formerly OG Yomi) has highlighted a bullish pattern on the Dogecoin (DOGE) chart, which shows that a breakout is imminent. His prediction follows the recent wave of accumulation by DOGE whales, with these buys likely contributing to the potential breakout. 
Dogecoin Indicator Flashing Breakout Signal
Kevin mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the two-month Bollinger Bands breakout indicator on Dogecoin is flashing an imminent breakout, which is set to occur for the foremost meme coin for the first time since November 2020.

He added that DOGE was also about to see the first two-month Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) bullish cross since November 2020.

The analyst sounded confident about this imminent breakout, suggesting it was inevitable. Crypto analyst Kaleo also shared a similar sentiment, claiming in a recent X post that Dogecoin looks ready for that parabolic move to the upside. Crypto Kaleo is so bullish on Dogecoin that he predicted that the meme coin will outperform Bitcoin in this bull run.

Kevin had also made a similar prediction earlier in April, claiming that Dogecoin could outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle if it continues to hold up well. The analyst had also previously predicted that DOGE could rise to as high as $3 based on historical patterns. A price surge of such magnitude will almost certainly out the meme coin above the flagship crypto. 
Meanwhile, DOGE’s imminent breakout could be triggered by recent purchases made by Dogecoin whales. These investors have purchased over 900 million DOGE in the last seven days. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also recently suggested that Dogecoin’s price might skyrocket soon enough. 
He mentioned that DOGE’s market sentiment was as bearish as it was in early February, just before its price skyrocketed by 200%. Interestingly, Martinez believes that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $6 in this bull run. He had also noted that DOGE’s current unimpressive price action was part of its “usual behavior” before massive bull runs. 
DOGE Might Reach $10 In This Market Cycle
Crypto analyst Javon Marks has offered a more ambitious price prediction than Martinez’s. He raised the possibility of Dogecoin rising to $10, highlighting a breakout trend that suggests that the meme coin may soon be on its way to this price level. Interestingly, the chart he shared showed that DOGE could even rise to as high as $16. 

Marks was referring to the breakout trend in which Dogecoin’s run has continually increased in every subsequent bull run. As such, he believes this upcoming bull run won’t be different, with DOGE surpassing its rally of over 20,000% in the 2021 bull run this time around. 
At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.16, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Treasury Secretary Yellen warns of financial stability risks posed by AI

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expressed significant concerns about the potential dangers artificial intelligence (AI) poses to the stability of the financial system.Yellen made the remarks during a keynote address at a conference on AI and financial stability on June 6. Her speech stressed the urgency of addressing these emerging risks and called of both the government and private sectors to collaborate on finding solutions.The Treasury secretary said:“This [AI] is a rapidly evolving field. We have our work cut out for us.”Increasing riskYellen acknowledged the advancements AI has brought to the financial sector, such as improved fraud detection and enhanced customer service through chatbots.However, she and other experts cautioned that deeper integration of AI could lead to increased risks, including the potential for AI to be misused in scams or market manipulation through misinformation.Yellen warned:“Insufficient or faulty data could also perpetuate or introduce new biases in financial decision-making.”She highlighted the complexities of AI models, the inadequacies in current risk management frameworks, and the reliance on a limited number of models by numerous market participants as key areas of concern.The Treasury Department has issued a request for information to gather insights from stakeholders about the uses, opportunities, and risks of AI in the financial services sector. This initiative is intended to inform future policymaking by incorporating expert opinions and current practices.Yellen said:“The tremendous opportunities and significant risks associated with the use of AI by financial companies have moved this issue toward the top of Treasury’s and the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s agendas.”AI under scrutinyYellen’s warning comes amid a wider governmental scrutiny of both AI and the companies behind the technology. The DOJ is reportedly preparing to investigate multiple tech giants, including Nvidia and Microsoft, over antitrust and competition concerns related to AI technology.US antitrust enforcer Jonathan Kanter announced plans to investigate the AI sector due to concerns about potential monopolies, according to a Financial Times report.Kanter highlighted the need to examine AI’s competitive landscape, focusing on areas like computing power, data for training large language models (LLMs), cloud services, engineering talent, and hardware.Kanter emphasized the urgency of acting to prevent dominant tech firms from monopolizing the AI market. He suggested real-time regulatory intervention to be effective and less invasive.A particular concern is the scarcity of graphics processing units (GPUs) necessary for training LLMs, with rising demand impacting chip allocation.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

DuckDuckGo Launches a Private Portal to Top AI Chatbots - Decrypt

DuckDuckGo, renowned for its privacy-focused search engine and web browser, has announced a new service that allows users to interact with popular AI chatbots privately and anonymously. The service, called DuckDuckGo AI Chat and accessible at Duck.ai, is globally available now.The interactions on Duck.ai are private because "neither DuckDuckGo nor the chatbot providers can use the users’ data to train their models," the company explains. They are also anonymous, as DuckDuckGo doesn’t require users to set up accounts, or provide personal information before start interacting with it.DuckDuckGo even strips away metadata, such as server or IP addresses, so that queries appear to originate from the company itself rather than individual users.Although the supported commercial AI chatbot providers—OpenAI and Anthropic—do keep access logs, DuckDuckGo says it has “agreements in place with all model providers to ensure that any saved chats are completely deleted by the providers within 30 days, and that none of the chats made on our platform can be used to train or improve the models.”That makes preserving privacy easier than changing the privacy settings for each service.Duck.ai features a light and clean user interface and lets users choose from the two commercial, closed-source models and two open-source models. The closed-source models are OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo, which powered the free version of ChatGPT until recently, and Claude 3 Haiku, Anthropic’s small version of its Claude 3 model. The open-source models are Meta’s Llama-3 70Bn and Mistral AI’s Mixture of Expert model Mixtral 8x7b.DuckDuckGo said it will add more models in the future, further expanding the range of options available to users.This new service is a welcome addition for privacy conscious individuals, joining the recent launch of Venice AI by Crypto founder Erik Voorhees. Venice AI features an uncensored AI chatbot and image generator that doesn't require accounts and doesn't retain data.As for which AI tool to usel? It depends on your needs.In terms of text generation, DuckDuckGo's offerings of GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 3 Haiku are superior to Venice's Hermes and Dogge LLMs. DuckDuckGo also provides additional functionalities for users of its browser, including DuckAssist, an integrated assistant being developed into a native AI companion.However, Venice AI offers a wide set of Generative Image models, which DuckDuckGo doesn't, and its models are uncensored, both in text and image generations which is a major point against its competitors.DuckDuckGo's AI service is free to use “within a daily limit.” The company said it is considering launching a paid tier to reduce or eliminate these limits, akin to Claude, OpenAI, and even Venice.DuckDuckGo said its AI Chat service is a complementary partner to its search engine and not just a hype-driven experiment.“We view AI Chat and search as two different but powerful tools to help you find what you're looking for – especially when you're exploring a new topic,” the company said. “If you start with Search, you may want to switch to AI Chat for follow-up queries to help make sense of what you’ve read, or for quick, direct answers to new questions that weren’t covered in the web pages you saw.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Kraken Is Targeting An IPO Next Year: Report


																Kraken, one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, is orchestrating a large funding round before a potential initial public offering next year, according to a new report from Bloomberg.
Sources contacted by the outlet say the exchange likely aims to raise $100 million before the move.
Kraken To Go Public?
If Kraken were to follow through, it would become the second publicly traded pure-play crypto exchange in the world after Coinbase, its larger rival.
The supposed plans are a response to investor inquiries on the matter fueled by the crypto market rally in recent months, which has boosted trading volumes from which exchanges like Kraken generate profit.
Two of the people contacted said Kraken would raise the money in a “pre-IPO round” with the intention of completing it by the end of the year.




An IPO could be completed as soon as next year, the people said, after Kraken can find a “marquee” company to join its board. Only verbal discussions have occurred regarding terms and valuations without any formal documentation, one person said.
“We are always exploring strategic paths toward Kraken’s Mission: accelerating the global adoption of crypto,” said Kraken, declining to comment specifically on fundraising or IPO matters. “We remain fully focused on investing in this goal.”
Public stock and crypto trading platform Robinhood said on Thursday hat it would acquire crypto exchange Bitstamp. Earlier this year, stablecoin issuer Circle also announced plans to go public.
A Maturing Crypto Market
Kraken’s parent company, Payward, was founded in 2011. While the exchange has intended to go public for years, a mix of volatile crypto market downturns and regulatory issues have continued to thwart its efforts.
As of today, momentum is turning around on both fronts. Bitcoin is now experiencing a newfound wave of demand from Wall Street, with experts believing tens of billions of dollars are yet to enter the newly launched ETF products.
Meanwhile, policymakers are starting to open up to crypto, and are pushing forward legislation to create legal clarity for the industry. Last month, the House of Representatives passed comprehensive legislation to clarify which crypto assets are commodities vs securities, and how crypto exchanges can properly register with regulators.
Kraken has run into its share of trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) already, paying a $30 million fine last year for failing to register its staking as a service product. It now faces a lengthier lawsuit for allegedly listing dozens of unregistered securities on its platform, which it is fighting back against in court.

Ashton Kutcher Says AI Will Make Movies Better-Hollywood Disagrees - Decrypt

Actor and entrepreneur Ashton Kutcher has waded into hot water again after he suggested that AI could someday be used to create Hollywood-quality movies without the need for studios, actors, or crew.Kutcher's comments came during an on-stage conversation with former Google CEO Eric Schmidt at the Berggruen Institute, a Los Angeles, Calif.-based think tank last week. A video excerpt from the exchange has since been set to private and is no longer visible on YouTube.The co-founder of Schmidt Futures asked Kutcher what the future holds for Hollywood in the age of AI. In response, Kutcher questioned why—when tools like Sora AI are available—a filmmaker would go through the trouble of shooting on location.“Why would you go out and shoot an establishing shot of a house in a television show when you could just create the establishing shot for $100? To go out and shoot it would cost you thousands of dollars,” Kutcher said, according to a report by Variety. “Action scenes of me jumping off of this building, you don’t have to have a stunt person go do it, you could just go do it.”In February, OpenAI unveiled its Sora AI model that uses text-based instructions to create minute-long, high-definition videos. Sora is currently in an invitation-only closed beta, but Kutcher said he had early access.Kutcher went further, suggesting that content creators could use the AI model to create their own movies using content they find online—omitting acknowledgement of the obvious copyright and intellectual property ramifications of his suggestion.“You input the shot that you want to see or scene that you want to see, the trailer that you want to watch, and it invents that thing,” Kutcher said, adding this would lead to a proliferation of new content.That tidal wave of new, AI-facilitated content, Kutcher said, would change the paradigm of how movies are made, and how success is measured.“The bar is going to have to go way up because why are you going to watch my movie when you could just watch your own movie?” he said.His colleagues in the entertainment industry strenuously disagreed on social media.“Not even AI could make a movie where Ashton Kutcher is a good actor,” comedian and actor Gianmarco Soresi wrote on Twitter.Many critics pointed out that Kutcher is co-founder of an investment fund focused on AI, and that his comments clearly support the disruptive technology and not the industry being disrupted.“The fact that Ashton Kutcher has a venture capitalist firm that is currently investing in AI should have been disclosed,” tweeted Alice Herring, who lists membership in The Animation Guild in Hollywood. “He's not speaking as a filmmaker (because he's never been a director, DP, writer, or editor), he's speaking as a salesman for investments.”Kutcher responded to the backlash late Thursday, posting on Twitter that he does not think “AI will replace the film industry or creative arts.”“It's an amazing tool that we should learn to work with to become more prolific and efficient as [artists],” he wrote. Acting like it doesn't exist will be catastrophic.”Kutcher recently courted controversy for another tech project he launched with wife and fellow actress Mila Kunis.“If you're wondering if Ashton Kutcher also fell for the Metaverse, crypto, and NFTs... yes. The answer is yes,” Lincoln Michel, author of “The Body Scout,” wrote, referring to Kutcher and wife Mila Kunis’ Stoner Cats NFT project.Stoner Cats remains in limbo after the production was slapped with a notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had violated federal securities laws when it sold NFT passes to watch the show in September. The federal regulator hit the Stoner Cats project with a $1 million fine.In 2023, the union members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) took to the picket lines after negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) broke down over a myriad of issues including the use of generative AI in film and television productions.The strike lasted over six months before contract negotiations were resolved in September. "In a contract valued at over one billion dollars, we have achieved a deal of extraordinary scope that includes 'above-pattern' minimum compensation increases, unprecedented provisions for consent and compensation that will protect members from the threat of AI," SAG-AFTRA wrote on Twitter.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Kraken Eyes $100 Million Funding Before Potential IPO


On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Kraken, a US-based crypto exchange, is considering raising a final funding round of more than $100 million ahead of a possible initial public offering (IPO).
This strategic move aligns with the digital asset market’s resurgence, drawing potential investors and showcasing a recovering industry.
Regulatory Challenges Loom as Kraken Prepares for IPO

Kraken aims to complete this fundraising by the end of the year, leveraging the favorable market conditions to prepare for the IPO. The exchange is also seeking a “marquee” company to join its board, aiming for a successful IPO as soon as next year.
Kraken reportedly has been discussing an initial public offering since at least 2021. At the time of publication, Kraken declined to comment specifically on the fundraising or IPO plans. However, the company reaffirmed its commitment to boosting global crypto adoption.
Read more: Kraken Review 2024: A Review of Its Security and Features

“We are always exploring strategic paths toward Kraken’s Mission: accelerating the global adoption of crypto. We remain fully focused on investing in this goal,” it stated.

Despite its IPO plan, Kraken has faced significant regulatory challenges in recent years, including a high-profile case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2023, the company settled charges related to its staking services, agreeing to pay a $30 million fine and cease these services in the US.
This year, the company is facing a new case with the agency. The SEC accused Kraken of operating an unregistered securities broker-dealer, clearing agency, and exchange.
These charges resemble those previously levied against another US-based crypto exchange—Coinbase. However, Kraken continues to dispute new allegations from the SEC.

The prospect of a Kraken IPO has generated considerable buzz within the crypto community. Market observers speculate that a successful IPO could indicate a positive shift in the regulatory environment for digital assets.

“If VCs are gonna fund Kraken here assuming an IPO, they must be assuming a complete 180 in crypto regulatory issues given the Coinbase lawsuit,” Leigh Drogen, general partner at investment firm Starkiller Cap, speculated.

China's First Crypto Fraud Trial Ends With Student's 4-Year Prison Sentence | Bitcoinist.com


								In a groundbreaking case that has drawn significant attention in China, a college student named Yang Qichao has been sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison and fined 30,000 yuan ($41,000) for “fraudulently” issuing a cryptocurrency called BFF on the Binance’s BNB Chain. 
The case, which took place at the People’s Court of Nanyang High-tech Industrial Development Zone in Henan Province, marks the first criminal trial in China involving the issuance of a virtual currency. The Asian country has strict regulations that prohibit people from participating in the issuance, trading, or investing in these assets.
Criminal Trial On Crypto Fraud
According to local media reports, the incident began in May 2022 when Yang Qichao, a senior student at a university in Zhejiang, created a digital virtual currency called “Blockchain Future Force” (BFF) on the Binance chain. 
It is alleged that Yang Qichao injected liquidity into the currency and then withdrew the funds, causing the value of BFF coins to depreciate significantly. One individual, Luo, who purchased BFF coins, suffered losses of 50,000 of Tether’s USDT stablecoin (equivalent to approximately 330,000 RMB).

Yang Qichao’s defense lawyer argued that Luo, “an experienced participant” in cryptocurrency transactions, should have been aware of the risks involved. 
The lawyer contended that Luo had a “clear understanding” of the speculative nature of crypto investments and acknowledged the industry’s lack of regulatory oversight. 
The lawyer questioned whether Luo’s decision to exchange 50,000 USDT coins for BFF coins resulted from misjudgment, given that virtual currency transactions inherently carry investment risks.
Profitability Amidst Alleged Fraud
During the trial, the issue of whether virtual currencies should be considered protected property under criminal law was also debated. 
Although cryptocurrencies do not possess currency attributes, the court acknowledged that they can be traded on international platforms, yielding economic benefits and demonstrating undeniable property characteristics. 
As a result, the court recognized the conversion of the 50,000 USDT coins into the country’s official currency, the yuan, as “a relevant factor” in determining the sentence.
Furthermore, the defense lawyer highlighted that despite Luo’s initial claim of being defrauded, subsequent analysis of his transaction records revealed a series of rapid and profitable trades. This led to the argument that Luo had actually profited from the investment, thereby calling the notion of fraud into question.

Per the report, the case has sparked a broader discussion about the legal status and regulation of virtual currencies in China. With the country’s legal policies yet to fully recognize the legitimacy of virtual currencies, issues surrounding their issuance, trading, and protection remain ambiguous. 
The outcome of this case may serve as a precedent for future legal proceedings involving virtual currencies, shaping the legal landscape in this emerging field.

Maker Metrics Under The Microscope: Clues To MKR's Price Path Ahead


																Amidst the crypto market resurgence, the smart contract platform Maker and its native token MKR have experienced a challenging period, with MKR demonstrating a consistent downtrend after reaching a yearly high of $4,070 in April, plummeting to as low as $2,440 just one week later. 
Dive into the protocol’s key metrics and observe notable levels to gain insights into potential price movements and actions for the MKR token in the near term. 
Maker Protocol’s Updated Metrics Reveal Positive Growth 
The Maker protocol, known for its decentralized stablecoin DAI, recently disclosed updated metrics highlighting its health and growth over the past month in a post on social media site X (formerly Twitter). 
DAI, governed by MakerDAO’s decentralized blockchain, enables the borrowing and lending of cryptocurrencies. The current DAI supply, exceeding 5 billion DAI, is a critical metric reflecting the total amount of DAI created and circulating. 

	Related Reading


Total Value Locked represents the dollar value of assets locked within the Maker Protocol. Despite being live on one chain since its inception, Maker has approximately $8.76 billion locked, making it the fourth-largest decentralized finance (DeFi protocol). 
The Maker Protocol allows the minting of DAI by depositing accepted assets into Maker Vaults. The ETH-C Vault type holds the largest share, with approximately $2.07 billion worth of ETH locked. 
The system surplus needs to reach 50 million DAI to achieve a complete MKR burn. On the other hand, the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) represents the rate at which the Maker Protocol rewards users for locking their DAI within DSR contracts. Currently, the DSR cost amounts to approximately 153 million DAI.
Currently, the protocol notes that most DAI remains within DeFi, with externally owned Accounts (EOA) and the DSR serving as the top use cases, holding over 2.3 billion and 1.96 billion DAI, respectively. 
In terms of revenue generation, SparkLend D3M and Spark’s MetaMorpho D3M lead the way, generating an estimated $155 million in annual revenue based on their deposit APYs. This highlights the significance of various collateral types and revenue streams within the Maker ecosystem.
Potential Catalyst For MKR’s Price?
Despite the growth and investor interest in the Maker ecosystem, the upcoming Endgame Plan, a proposal to revamp its governance and tokenomics, is expected to act as a catalyst for the MKR token, potentially boosting its price. 
The proposal aims to establish a self-sustainable equilibrium called the Endgame State, envisioning a resilient ecosystem where Maker Core’s scope and complexity will no longer change.

	Related Reading


Currently, MKR is trading at $2,612, experiencing a slight decline of over 2% in the past 24 hours and around 8% in the last 30 days. CoinGecko data also indicates a recent 4.7% decrease in trading volume, totaling only $72 million compared to the token’s $2.4 billion market cap.
If the Endgame plan indeed generates renewed interest in the token and acts as a catalyst for MKR, the next significant obstacles to monitor in the short term are situated around the $2,660 level, which has impeded the token’s ability to surpass higher levels in the past few days. 
Additionally, on its potential path to reclaim the $3,000 milestone, resistance levels at $2,710 and $2,760 would need to be overcome before potentially retesting the resistance at $2,845. Moving forward, on the MKR/USD daily chart, the levels at $2,905 and $2,950 act as the final hurdles before reaching the $3,000 milestone.
The 1-D chart shows MKR’s price trending downwards since April 2024. Source: MKRUSD on TradingView.com
It remains to be seen whether further developments and growth in key metrics, coupled with the anticipated Endgame proposal, can stimulate a significant bullish momentum for MKR, enabling it to overcome resistance levels and regain its bullish trend.

Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Expert Predicts Doom For ETH's Price - Here's Why


								Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser has recently reiterated his stance on Ethereum, predicting a dire future for the cryptocurrency against Bitcoin. Keiser’s latest critique, shared on social media platform X, revives his longstanding view that Bitcoin outshines Ethereum and other altcoins on fundamental levels.
According to Keiser, Ethereum is “heading to zero against BTC,” citing fundamental differences in their underlying technologies and legal classifications.

Commodity Status And Decentralization Concerns
Keiser’s argument hinges on the idea that Ethereum is not centralized and lacks the commodity status and a decentralized proof-of-work algorithm that “bolsters” Bitcoin’s appeal.
He points out that in countries like El Salvador, where he advises President Nayib Bukele on Bitcoin initiatives, Ethereum is regarded as an unregistered security rather than a commodity—a status that Bitcoin has maintained in regulatory circles in the United States.

Despite the criticisms from Bitcoin proponents, ETH continues to hold a substantial market position, trading above $3,800 with slight gains of 0.8% in the past 24 hours and 2% over the past week.

While Bitcoin maximalists like Kaiser remain critical of the altcoin, many experts maintain a positive outlook, anticipating that ETH could mirror Bitcoin’s historical performance of a parabolic rise.
Notably, ETH’s recent performance comes amid positive forecasts from major financial analysts, including those from investment firm VanEck, which recently adjusted their prediction for Ethereum’s long-term price potential.
Contrasting View: VanEck Predicts A Bright Future For Ethereum
In a recent post updating its forecast for ETH, Investment firm VanEck has offered a more optimistic view, projecting ETH’s price could reach $22,000 by 2030. This bullish outlook is based on ETH’s role in the smart contract platform space, its ongoing development, and its ability to disrupt traditional markets.
The report from VanEck credits Ethereum’s “robust” framework for developers and its potential impact on finance and Big Tech as pivotal factors for its future valuation.

The analysts at VanEck also point to the imminent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a key driver for ETH’s adoption and price increase. They argue that such developments will enhance ETH’s accessibility and demand, potentially leading to a significant market capitalization boost.
The VanEck analysts particularly noted:
Driven by a strong value proposition to entrepreneurs, the Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech. Should it do so while maintaining its dominant position among smart contract platforms, we see a credible path to $66B in free cash flow to token holders supporting a $2.2 trillion asset, or $22k per coin, by 2030.

Record High: $Near $100 Trillion Global Liquidity ‘Most Important Chart’ for Bitcoin Price | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) is set to benefit from the growth of money supply in the United States as global liquidity has recently surged to near the $100 trillion mark, at a time in which BTC itself is trading at $71,000.



According to a chart shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) by the founder of on-chain data service LookIntoBitcoin, Philip Swift, global supply – known as M2 – is nearing a historic high around $100 trillion.



This unprecedented level of liquidity is historically correlated with Bitcoin price movements, according to Swift. His platform, as Cointelegraph first reported, tracks global M2 data and compares it to Bitcoin price behavior, and shows that the current M2 of $94 trillion dwarfs the figure observed in late 2021, when Bitcoin hit its previous all-time high of $69,000, with a $3 trillion increase.







Furthermore, M2 has rebounded a full 10% since dipping to $85 trillion in late 2022, coinciding with the depths of the crypto bear market.  These findings resonate with other recent liquidity-based analyses, which also project a bullish outlook for Bitcoin.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The relationship between Bitcoin and the U.S. M1 money supply is also noteworthy. This metric is currently breaking out of a seven-year consolidation period – the longest in Bitcoin’s history – suggesting significant room for growth.



Institutional investors appear to be using Bitcoin as a way to diversify their portfolios, with cryptocurrency investments products year-to-date having seen $15 billion of inflows, of which $14.74 billion were to products offering exposure to BTC.



Products betting on the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum’s ETH, saw $33.5 million inflows in the week, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cleared the path for the listing of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the country, bringing their year-to-date flows to just $11 million.



Meanwhile, products offering exposure to Ethereum rival Solana ($SOL) saw $5.8 million worth of inflows, bringing year-to-date flows to $35 million. Products focusing on multiple digital assets saw $2.7 million of outflows last week.

Former Federal Prosecutors, Agents Ask U.S. Sec. Blinken to ‘Step Up’ Efforts to Secure Detained Binance Exec’s Release

Despite a court order to move him to a hospital from Kuje prison – known to hold violent criminals and terrorists, including members of the Islamist jihadist group Boko Haram – Nigerian officials have reportedly refused to transfer him. In their letter to Sec. Blinken, Haun and the other signers call Gambaryan’s captivity “not only unjust but inhumane,” adding that, in addition to not receiving adequate medical care, he has not been allowed to speak with his lawyers or family.

Ripple CTO Sends Crucial Warning To Community - Here’s What It Is | Bitcoinist.com


								Ripple CTO David Schwartz has sent a crucial warning to the community members in regards to a number of scams that have been proliferating. With the crypto market prices recovering once more, scammers are back in full force and they tend to hone in on a community as their target victims, warranting warnings such as this.
Ripple CTO Warns Community Of Scams
A new type of scam targeting X (formerly Twitter) has made the rounds, seemingly harnessing the fear of accounts getting banned as a way to hack user accounts. The DM, which was posted by another X user who goes by @3YearLetterman, reveals a threatening message from someone pretending to be from the X team.

The contents of the DM show an initial accusation that the X user’s account was being investigated for copyright violations. They further went on to ask the recipient to provide feedback on this issue through completely a form.
However, the link attached to the DM is a malicious one which will trick the X user into sharing their account details, and thereby compromising their account. The DM is then signed with X Support Team, presumably to sell the illusion that this was actually a correspondence from the real X team.
Responding to the post, the Ripple CTO urged users to ignore all messages like these when they receive them as they are just trying to steal their login information. “CAUTION: If you receive a DM anything like this, it is fake. The link goes to a phising site that will collect your login and personal information,” Schwartz said.


Crypto Scams Are On The Rise
Recently, another prominent figure in the crypto space warned community members of rampant scams. DaVinci, a Shiba Inu team member, posted about scammers creating multiple variations of the team’s unlaunched TREAT token to steal investors’ funds.
Just like the Ripple CTO, DaVinci urged individuals to be careful when interacting with tokens on the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange. He explained that given the decentralized nature of the exchange, they cannot stop these tokens from trading, but they can warn investors and have them informed.

Last month, Canadian authorities also took the initiative to warn its citizens due to the alarming rise in crypto scams. One of the major scams targeting investors include romance scams, where the scammer convinces their victims to invest in a crypto site, which ends up being fraudulent.
This comes as the number of investors who are holding cryptocurrencies continue to be on the rise. Due to the rather anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, it makes it a prime hunting ground for these scammers.

Bitcoin Dips Again: Temporary Setback or Buying Opportunity?


																Bitcoin price started a downside correction from the $71,650 resistance zone. BTC is now consolidating and might correct toward the $69,500 support.

Bitcoin struggled above $71,500 and started a downside correction.
The price is trading above $70,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.
There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $70,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).
The pair could decline further if there is a move below the $70,000 level.

Bitcoin Price Starts Correction
Bitcoin price extended its increase above the $70,000 level. BTC was able to clear the $70,500 and $71,200 levels to move further into a positive zone. However, the bears were active near the $71,650 zone.
A high was formed at $71,682 and the price started a downside correction. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $67,285 swing low to the $71,682 high. There was also a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $70,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

Kraken Pre-IPO Fund Raising Round Aimed at $100 Million Amid Crypto Surge - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Kraken pre-IPO fund raising round is seeking over $100 million, and it is aiming to complete the round by the end of the year to set the stage for a potential IPO.



The exchange faces ongoing regulatory challenges but remains focused on accelerating global crypto adoption and enhancing its board for better IPO prospects.




Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is reportedly in discussions to secure over $100 million in pre-IPO funding, according to Bloomberg.



Kraken Pre-IPO Fund Raising Round Aimed at $100 Million Amid Crypto Surge 4



Kraken Pre-IPO Fund Raising Targets $100M



Kraken pre-IPO fund raising round is anticipated to close by the end of the year, setting the stage for a potential initial public offering (IPO).



Founded in San Francisco in 2011, Kraken is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges. The exchange is eyeing this final funding round in response to heightened investor interest fueled by the recent rally in digital asset markets. This resurgence in interest coincides with a notable increase in cryptocurrency valuations and a perceived easing of U.S. regulatory pressures on digital assets.



Kraken’s journey towards an IPO has been ongoing since at least 2021, but the company has encountered challenges due to past downturns in crypto prices and regulatory hurdles. The company has had contentious interactions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including settling one case last year and contesting another involving allegations of operating as an unregistered securities broker, dealer, clearing agency, and exchange. Kraken has consistently denied these allegations.




Growing Investor Interest in the Crypto Sector



In a statement, the exchange reiterated its commitment to accelerating global crypto adoption but declined to comment specifically on Kraken pre-IPO fund raising round or IPO plans. “We remain fully focused on investing in this goal,” the statement read.



As part of its IPO preparations, Kraken is reportedly seeking to add a high-profile company to its board to enhance its public offering prospects, potentially as soon as next year. So far, discussions have involved verbal negotiations on terms and valuations without formal documentation.



The broader crypto sector is attracting increasing attention from investors and policymakers alike. Robinhood recently announced plans to acquire Bitstamp, another prominent crypto exchange. Additionally, U.S. regulators have shown a more favorable stance towards crypto, exemplified by the SEC’s approval of exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin and steps towards approving similar funds for Ether. Cryptocurrency has also become a significant topic in political circles, with presidential candidates striving to present themselves as industry supporters.

Ethereum ETFs Brace For Sluggish Reception, JPMorgan Expects Modest $1-$3 Billion Inflows | Bitcoinist.com


								According to a Bloomberg report, analysts suggest that the debut of the recently approved Ethereum ETFs in the US may generate significantly less demand than spot-Bitcoin products. Major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, await final approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list the long-awaited Ethereum funds. 
However, JPMorgan strategists anticipate much smaller net inflows into Ethereum ETFs than the $15.3 billion flowing into Bitcoin vehicles this year.
Analysts Divided On Ethereum ETFs’ Potential
Per the report, the success of the five-month-old Bitcoin ETFs can be attributed to a controversial narrative that presents Bitcoin as digital gold, a concept that Ether lacks. Additionally, the Ether funds will not offer staking rewards for blockchain maintenance, a feature available to those who hold the token directly.
Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets Pty, highlights that ETH lacks the same profile as Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s market value of $1.4 trillion is three times larger than Ether’s. This discrepancy indicates that the Ethereum ETFs in the US may not have a comparable impact.


In a surprising shift, the SEC recently signaled its willingness to approve spot Ethereum ETFs, following its earlier acceptance of Bitcoin funds due to a court reversal in 2023. While this development boosted Ether’s price, its 109% gains over the past year still lag behind Bitcoin’s 169% surge, including its record high in March.
JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou estimate that prospective Ether portfolios will attract a “modest” $1 billion to $3 billion in net inflows for the remainder of the year. 
However, as Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, reports, these products may struggle to capture 20% of the current $62.5 billion Bitcoin ETF assets in the US.
Despite these reservations, Vetle Lunde, a senior research analyst at crypto specialist K33 Research, remains optimistic, predicting $4 billion worth of net inflows in the first five months for the Ethereum ETFs and a significant “supply absorption shock” that could boost ETH’s price.
VanEck Bullish On Ethereum
Fund manager VanEck, which aims to launch an Ethereum ETF, sees potential in the popularity of the Ethereum blockchain underlying the token, particularly for applications in crypto financial services. 
Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s Head of Digital-Asset Research, believes that investors will eventually recognize the greater potential for application and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem than Bitcoin.
It is worth noting that the launch of nine new US ETFs for Bitcoin on January 11 initially caused a decline in Bitcoin’s price, coupled with outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. However, the strength of demand for the new ETFs eventually overshadowed these concerns, and Bitcoin resumed its upward trajectory.
Similarly, asset manager Grayscale plans to convert its $11 billion Ethereum offering into an ETF, similar to its Bitcoin fund. While redemptions from the Grayscale fund may create selling pressure on ETH, the overall market impact remains unclear.

As of the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,830, while Bitcoin continues to approach its record levels of $73,7000 reached in March. Ether is still some distance away from its all-time peak of $4,866, achieved during the 2021 bull run.

Bitcoin's CPI turns positive after 10 days - What does it mean for prices? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index is now positive.
This signals a spike in coin accumulation by US-based investors.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] Coinbase Premium Index (CPI) has turned positive after returning negative values for about ten days, pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst BQYoutube has found in a new report.
This metric measures the difference between BTC’s prices on Coinbase and Binance. When its value is positive, it suggests that the coin is priced higher on Coinbase compared to Binance. It is interpreted to mean strong buying interest from US-based investors. 
Conversely, when it declines, and its value is negative, it signals less trading activity on the US-based exchange.
At press time, BTC’s CPI was 0.006. 
Source: CryptoQuant
Confirming the resurgence in activity from US-based BTC holders, BTC’s Coinbase Premium Gap was 4.48 at press time. 
According to CryptoQuant data, this was the first time the metric had returned a positive value since 18th May. 
Source: CryptoQuant
BTC traders in Korea look away
Although BTC’s Korean Premium Index (KPI) has trended downward since 15th April, it remains above the zero line. Also referred to as the Kimchi Premium, this index measures the gap between BTC prices on South Korean exchanges and other exchanges.
Source: CryptoQuant
At 0.78 at press time, BTC’s Kimchi Premium was at its year-to-date low, signaling that regional demand for the coin by Korean investors is at its lowest since the beginning of the year. 

Negative sentiment follows the coin
At press time, BTC exchanged hands at $71,148. Its price has risen by 10% in the past 30 days. During that period, the coin traded briefly at $71,315 on 21st May before witnessing a pull back.
However, despite BTC’s recent price rally, negative sentiment trails the coin. At press time, its weighted sentiment was -0.355. In fact, the value of this metric has been negative since 24th May. 
Source: Santiment
This indicates that despite its price rally in the past few weeks, there is still a bearish bias toward the leading coin among market participants.
This has been the case even with the daily profits made by coin holders.

 AMBCrypto assessed the daily ratio of BTC transaction volume in profit to loss (using a seven-day) moving average and returned a value of 1.8.

BitMEX Co-Founder Dumps PENDLE Stake, Triggering Market Volatility


							

Arthur Hayes unstakes $9.41M PENDLE, sparking market concerns.



Hayes holds 1.69M PENDLE with $6.46M unrealized profit.



PENDLE price slightly drops after Hayes’s transaction.




Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, unloaded 1.55 million PENDLE tokens valued at $9.41 million, fueling concerns among PENDLE token holders. This move raises concerns about a potential price dump, given Hayes’s significant holdings of 1.69 million tokens and the possible impact on the market.



Hayes is an influential crypto trader. Currently, he retains 1.69 million PENDLE tokens, with an average purchase price of $2.24 per token. This holding translates to an unrealized profit of approximately $6.46 million. Despite the recent un-staking, some believe Hayes’ commitment to PENDLE remains strong. Just days before this move, he acquired additional tokens at an average price of $6.15.







For those uninitiated, Pendle Finance is an algorithmic trading protocol whose associated PENDLE tokens allow users to tokenize and trade future yields. This novel approach attracted not just intrigue but funding as well, thus influencing the price of the token.



Hayes’s advocacy for Pendle Finance also boosts the credibility of the company within the DeFi space. He has endorsed the protocol several times, stating it as a major derivative exchange.







Source: CoinMarketCap









The market was quick to react to Hayes’s un-staking. The price of PENDLE, which had reached a high of $7.10 in late May, fell to $5.9 immediately following the transaction. In the last 24 hours, the token’s price has declined again by almost 1% at the time of writing, which reflects the community’s cautious sentiment.



Hayes’s recent purchase of PENDLE tokens suggest confidence in the token’s future. As the DeFi landscape evolves, Hayes’s moves will likely continue to shape market dynamics, making Pendle Finance a project to watch.

ProShares Files to List Spot Ethereum ETF on NYSE


ProShares, a leading exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuer, has filed a proposal to list and trade spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF shares under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
This move reflects ProShares’ commitment to expanding its digital asset offerings, providing investors with a secure and regulated option to gain exposure to Ethereum.
SEC Filings Clarify Staking Policies for ProShares Ethereum ETF

The ProShares Ethereum ETF will use Coinbase Custody Trust Company for ETH custody. Like other asset managers’ filings, ProShares also emphasized that the firm or any affiliated parties will not engage in activities related to Ethereum staking.
BeInCrypto reported that potential spot Ethereum ETF issuers have updated their 19b-4 and S-1 filings to remove the staking aspects. These actions aim to clarify the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance on staking for spot Ethereum ETFs.
Read more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works
However, approving these ETFs without incorporating staking capabilities could disadvantage investors interested in earning additional yield from staking rewards. Those who purchase, hold, and stake ETH have the opportunity to receive staking rewards, which can result in extra yield. By omitting the staking feature, spot Ethereum ETFs will be unable to provide additional benefits for investors.
The SEC has 45 days, extendable to 90 days, from the notice publication date to respond to the filing. Since ProShares filed on June 6, 2024, approval could come as early as late July 2024.
This proposal follows ProShares’ recent announcement of two Ethereum-linked ETFs, ProShares Ultra Ether ETF (ETHT) and ProShares UltraShort Ether ETF (ETHD), which target 2x and -2x daily ETH returns, respectively. These ETFs are expected to be listed on the NYSE this Friday.
ProShares is known for launching the first Bitcoin-linked ETF in 2021, the Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which invests in futures contracts. However, ProShares has not pursued a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, unlike some asset management giants.

This latest proposal aligns with recent comments from Matteo Greco, a Research Analyst at Fineqia. Greco highlighted the growing interest and commitment from traditional finance players in digital assets.

“These recent developments underscore the global demand among traditional finance investors to diversify their portfolios by increasing exposure to digital assets. Earlier this year, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US paved the way, followed by similar product launches for BTC and ETH in Hong Kong. Additionally, news of spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US and spot Bitcoin ETF trading in Australia further highlights the industry’s momentum,” he told BeInCrypto.

However, it is important to note that these spot Ethereum ETFs need approval for both filings to trade in the market officially. The approval in May was only for the 19b-4. Analysts predict that the final approval for these ETFs could occur sometime in July 2024.

A new Bitcoin all-time high? Here's your June price forecast... - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin is only entering the second, more aggressively bullish phase of the cycle, according to one metric.
The security and network fundamentals remained intact, bolstering confidence.

Bitcoin [BTC] reached its all-time high against the U.S. Dollar on the 14th of March, 2024, reaching $73,777. Previously, the Bitcoin all-time high was at $69,000, set on the 10th of November.
Against other fiat currencies, Bitcoin has already established an all-time high. The Turkish Lira, the Argentine and Philippine Peso, and the Indian Rupee are just a few.
This showed that USD faced a lower inflation rate than these currencies, but also meant that Bitcoin is increasingly likely to be seen as an inflation hedge.
The reason behind the belief in Bitcoin
In a recent AMBCrypto report, the Thermo Cap ratio metric was explored. The findings were that the network fundamentals were strong and the value invested into the network was growing steadily.
However, it was also noted that the Network Value to Transactions metric was dropping. This meant users were not transacting enough volume to justify the BTC prices. The growing investor confidence and the rise of the “inflation hedge” argument.
Another report showed that the futures market participants remained sidelined and the funding rate was subdued.
A strongly bullish piece of news was needed to shake Bitcoin out of its lethargy. The $886 million inflow into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday, the 4th of June, did just that.
Examining on-chain metrics to understand the bull run

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Axel Adler pointed out that the price performance of Bitcoin on the higher timeframes has not yet gone parabolic.
In the 2017-18 run, 380 days of steady gains were followed by another 351 days of parabolic uptrend.
If it repeats, BTC could see another 12 months of uptrend.

The short-term holder (STH) Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) has not peaked either. According to the analyst, it would need to climb above 0.4 to mark the end of the current bull run.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

The highest it has gone was 0.29 in March which was followed by a large correction as BTC consolidated over the past two months.
Therefore, the Bitcoin all-time high is very likely only a matter of time from here on.

$2.2 Billion Crypto Options Expire as Macroeconomic Data Looms


The crypto market is preparing for potential temporary turbulence, with over $2.2 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options set to expire today.
Can the expiration cause greater volatility in the market, and will it affect the price of the two leading cryptocurrencies?
Examining the Impending Options Expiration for Bitcoin and Ethereum

Approximately $1.24 billion in Bitcoin options contracts and $984 million in Ethereum options contracts are due to expire. Depending on how traders react to the event, the expiration of these options contracts could trigger a new wave of sell-offs or buying pressure.
According to Deribit data, 17,609 Bitcoin contracts are set to expire, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.67. This ratio suggests a prevalence of purchase options (calls) over sales options (puts).

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s maximum pain point is around $70,000. The maximum pain point is the price level at which the asset will cause financial losses to the greatest number of holders.
Analysts at crypto option trading tools provider, Greeks.Live, have suggested a positive outlook for Bitcoin and Ethereum prices despite the upcoming options expiration. They explained that the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, has shown signs of strength following the announcement of interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada (BOC) and the European Central Bank (ECB).

“US Non-Farm Payrolls and Unemployment Rate have also become more interesting, with The Fed rate cut expectations now at the center of macro trading. Short-term [implied volatility] IV is now clearly rising, with the weekly [at-the-money] ATM IV back above 50% but still below 50% at the end of the week, just as traders are betting on [today’s] data to exceed expectations, with slightly stronger bullish forces,” they noted.


In the Ethereum market, 259,641 contracts are set to expire. The put-to-call ratio stands at 0.64. Ethereum’s maximum pain point is $3,650.

While options expirations can cause temporary market disruptions, they are often followed by stabilization. Traders should remain vigilant, analyzing technical indicators and market sentiment to navigate the anticipated volatility effectively.
As the week concludes, Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience. Bitcoin reached a two-month high of $71,713 before slightly retreating. On the other hand, Ethereum is trading at $3,805, having experienced a minor decline.

Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Will Include EIP-7702 and EVM Object Format for Optimized Experience - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Ethereum Pectra upgrade will introduce the EVM Object Format (EOF).



Vitalik Buterin’s proposed EIP-7702 will enable Ethereum account addresses to temporarily function as smart contract wallets during transactions.



Petra, slated for release in the first quarter of 2025, is set to be one of Ethereum’s most comprehensive upgrades.




Ethereum’s core developers have reached a consensus to incorporate the EVM Object Format (EOF) in the forthcoming Pectra upgrade, as outlined in EIP-7692.



Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Will Include EIP-7702 and EVM Object Format for Optimized Experience 4



Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Introduced EOF and EIP-7702



This addition, encompassing approximately 11 EIPs, introduces an optional container for EVM code, aiming to enhance code validation and introduce innovative features.



Should EOF pose any challenges, it will be partitioned into separate forks to ensure the continuity of the Pectra upgrade without significant delays. Notably, EOF will not be integrated into the initial version of devnet 1. The Ethereum Pectra upgrade will also include the account abstraction standard, EIP-7702, proposed by Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type enabling Ethereum account addresses to transiently function as smart contract wallets during transactions, with their original state restored thereafter.



Pectra is heralded as a “comprehensive” upgrade, slated to encompass 19 EIPs, positioning it as one of the most extensive upgrades in Ethereum’s history. Ethereum’s core developers have expressed their ambition to roll out the Pectra upgrade by the first quarter of 2025.




Ethereum’s Ambitious Upgrade Targeting Enhanced User Experience



Pectra upgrade marks Ethereum’s next significant advancement, succeeding the Dencun upgrade, which was successfully implemented in March 2023. The Ethereum Pectra upgrade aims to address the user experience challenges within the Ethereum network and its ecosystem, complementing the solutions provided by the Dencun upgrade, particularly regarding transaction fees on Layer 2 platforms.



Additionally, the upgrade is anticipated to integrate EIP-7251, aiming to increase the maximum effective balance within Pectra. This modification will empower individual validators to stake more than 32 ETH, with a capped maximum of 2,048 ETH, diverging from the current 32 ETH limit. Elevating the maximum effective validator balance seeks to streamline operations by allowing operators to manage fewer but higher-stake validators, potentially reducing complexity.

Kraken Bolsters IPO Ambitions With Plans Of A Massive $100 Million Funding Injection | Bitcoinist.com


								US-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, is reportedly considering a final funding round as it explores the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO), according to sources familiar with the matter. The exchange has received inquiries from potential investors amid the current rally in the digital asset market.
Kraken Gears Up For Pre-IPO Funding Round
According to a Bloomberg report, sources suggest that Kraken is likely to seek more than $100 million in funding. The renewed interest from investors, coupled with a perceived shift in US regulatory attitudes towards digital assets, has reignited discussions about companies in the crypto sector going public. Just recently, Bitcoinist also reported that Robinhood acquired another crypto exchange Bitstamp.

Kraken has been contemplating an IPO since at least 2021. The funding round, potentially designated as a pre-IPO round, is expected to be finalized by the end of the year, according to one source. 
Kraken, founded in 2011 in San Francisco and operating under its parent company Payward, has stated that it remains committed to its mission of accelerating global adoption of cryptocurrencies.
While Kraken has expressed its intentions to go public for several years, previous market downturns and regulatory challenges, including ongoing legal battles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have hindered its progress. 
Kraken settled one case with the SEC in 2020 but is still involved in another case in which it is accused of operating an unregistered securities broker-dealer, clearing agency, and exchange. The company disputes these allegations.
Favorable Regulatory Winds
In recent months, US regulators and politicians have taken a more favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies as the US presidential campaigns have shifted, with crypto becoming one of the main issues in the race for the White House. 
The US SEC’s approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) investing in Bitcoin and its steps towards approving similar funds for Ethereum, also indicate a growing acceptance of digital assets. 
According to Bloomberg, with the surge in crypto prices throughout the year, Kraken is projected to generate revenue between $1 billion and $2 billion this year, according to insiders. 
In comparison, Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange, which went public through a direct listing in 2021, is estimated to achieve revenue of $5.9 billion, as compiled by Bloomberg analysts.

Kraken is now actively seeking a company to join its board and ensure a successful IPO, potentially as early as next year. The discussions thus far have involved informal exchanges of terms and valuations, without formal documentation.

US Bitcoin ETFs attract record inflows with new all-time high in sight - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in Bitcoin (BTC) have seen net inflows for a record-breaking 18 consecutive days, contributing to the alpha crypto’s nudge toward a new all-time high (ATH).According to data compiled by Bloomberg, net subscriptions for the group of nearly a dozen products reached $15.6 billion through Thursday since their launch on January 11, bringing total assets to $62.3 billion.Bloomberg reports that the Bitcoin funds offered by major players like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments have emerged as some of the most successful debuts in the ETF sector’s history. The report also claims that the crypto industry’s “center of gravity” is shifting back from Asia to the US.ETF demand and expectations of future Fed interest-rate cuts are highlighted as factors for considering how Bitcoin would surpass its most recent ATH of $73,798 before June ends.Sean Farrell, head of digital-asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, noted the “massive inflows into spot-Bitcoin ETFs” and stated that the macro environment continues to favor crypto, with slower economic growth at a non-recessionary pace and ongoing signs of disinflation.Compounding this projection, BlackRock’s $21.4 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust has become the world’s largest fund for the token, surpassing Grayscale Investments LLC’s $20.1 billion Bitcoin trust. The $12.3 billion Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ranks third.The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reluctantly allowed spot-Bitcoin ETFs in January following a court reversal in 2023. In May, the agency also surprisingly pivoted toward approval of funds for Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency.However, under Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC remains critical of the digital-asset industry’s alleged non-compliance with regulations, while Congressional efforts to provide legislative clarity for crypto have recently gained momentum, with more support from the Senate and federal judiciary courts to strike down the SEC’s overreach in other sectors such as traditional finance and banking.

Meme Coin Crashes 85% Due to Insider Selling


The price of the HULK cryptocurrency has dropped by nearly 85% due to insider selling, according to a recent post by cryptocurrency analytics firm Lookonchain. An insider managed to secure a gain of 812x, making nearly a million dollars in hours. They spent just $1,200 worth of Solana (SOL) tokens in order to buy 190 million HULK tokens. Within just three hours after the trade, the trader dumped all of their newly acquired tokens, making the HULK price collapse.This comes after former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan was busy promoting the celebrity meme coin in now-deleted posts on the X social media network. Hogan even took a shot at rapper Iggy Azalea and her viral Mother Iggy (IGGY) token made headlines due to massive gains.In his Instagram post, Hogan denied promoting the cryptocurrency, urging his followers not to take notice of any posts from him. "They are not even from me and will be promptly removed," the former professional wrestler said. Even before Hogan's clarification, it was obvious that there was something off with the latest celebrity meme coin. A video posted by Hogan that was meant to promote the token had no mention of HULK. In fact, it is an old video from December 2023 that is not even related to crypto.It is not clear what happened to Hogan's social media profile, but it is possible that he got hacked or scammed. The HULK token is now basically worthless after reaching a market cap of nearly $19 million on June 6.

Hulk Hogan-Themed Crypto Loses $15M in Market Cap In Minutes: Here's Why - Benzinga

A Solana SOL/USD-based memecoin promoted by Hulk Hogan reportedly suffered a $15 million loss in market cap after the wrestling legend allegedly deleted social posts shilling the cryptocurrency.What Happened: HULK‘s value plunged from $17 million to a mere $2 million within minutes of Hogan’s supposed deletions, according to a post by a Solana-associated X account Thursday. Widely-followed journalist Matt Binder posted screenshots, allegedly showing promotional posts by Hogan earlier in the day. In one of the posts, Hogan wrote, “Website hulkhogan.com is #updated with the $HULK info! I’m all jacked up for tonight!” The posts have been removed as of this writing, and Hogan later clarified on Instagram that the posts were not from him.See Also: Here’s How Much Just $100 In Bitcoin Will Be Worth If Cathie Wood’s BTC Prediction Is CorrectWhy It Matters: The recent surge in celebrity-endorsed memecoins has been a topic of concern in the cryptocurrency community. Launching memecoins has become easier than ever before thanks to launchpads such as pump.fun. However, fears of pump and dump and rug pulls have caused market anxiety.Ethereum ETH/USD creator Vitalik Buterin expressed his disapproval of the fad earlier this week, criticizing the trend and urging the community to steer “things in a better direction.” He argued that the creators of these tokens use celebrities’ names to attract investors while providing little value in return.Interestingly, there appears to be a correlation between the involvement of celebrities in cryptocurrency markets and cycle tops. Referencing events from previous cycles, it was seen that when celebrities begin promoting cryptocurrencies, the market typically experiences a final surge before hitting a local top.Photo by CMP_NZ on ShutterstockRead Next: Kitty-Themed Crypto Pumps 65% In Anticipation Of ‘Roaring Kitty’ YouTube Livestream, Trading Volume More Than Doubles

Bitcoin on Cusp of Major ‘Blue Sky Breakout’, Says Crypto Analyst Kevin Svenson - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								Analyst and trader Kevin Svenson is saying that Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing a bullish signal amid the flagship crypto asset’s double-digit bump over the past month.
In a new video, Svenson tells his 78,400 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is on a parabolic trend and is close to a “point of going vertical.”










“Bitcoin is near what is called a Blue Sky Breakout. A Blue Sky Breakout is when an asset breaks above all previous historic price action and experiences what’s called price discovery. So a Blue Sky Breakout is likely what’s coming up very, very soon.”
Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube
According to Svenson, Bitcoin is in a parabolic trend and could go up by around 26% from the current level.
“We are following this exponential rise in price, an accelerating trend… the target is $90,000. In mathematics, a parabola can only be so steep before it turns backward. So you have to understand that we are going to break it at some point. But I think we have a lot higher prices to see before that happens. Going from $70,000 to $90,000 is no joke. That is a huge gain for all the top players out there.”
Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube
Svenson says that if history repeats itself, Bitcoin could hit the $90,000 price in about two months.
“So if we were to get the vertical push and reach $90,000 by about August or so September is the worst month of the year on record for Bitcoin and the stock market going back in time, of all of history.
And so if we are going to follow some level of seasonality, well that’s perfect timing here… going vertical into August and then seeing a major pullback in September followed by an October bounce, which is also quite common, a sideways consolidation and a push into the New Year.
So this parabolic trend prediction of $90,000 is not a cycle peak target – it is simply a trend target. The current trend on the weekly and I think that this cycle is going to be continuing to expand into 2025.”

Bitcoin is trading at $71,200 at time of writing, up by around 12% over the past 30 days.

Three Important Polkadot (DOT) Price Predictions to Watch


																TL;DR

Polkadot’s native token, DOT, is currently priced at around $7.20, showing a modest 2% weekly increase, despite a booming cryptocurrency market.
Analysts, including Michael van de Poppe and Crypto Thanos, predict a potential bull run for DOT, with targets up to $17, driven by fundamental growth, improved use cases, and advancements in AI and gaming.


DOT’s Next Target
While the cryptocurrency market has been booming lately, Polkadot’s native token – DOT – has not recorded as substantial gains as most of the leading assets. Its price currently stands at around $7.20 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 2% increase on a weekly scale.

DOT Price, Source: CoinGecko
Many well-known analysts, though, remain optimistic that DOT is yet to experience a bull run, praising its merits. One example is the X user Michael van de Poppe, who claimed that the coin “is doing great in fundamental growth.”
He believes the moment is perfect for investors to enter DOT’s ecosystem, envisioning a 130% rally toward $17. However, he added, the price must first overcome the “crucial resistance” at $9.30.
Crypto Thanos and il Capo of Crypto also gave their two cents lately. The former assumed that DOT is “still in accumulation range” and “is improving their use cases day by day.” The analyst has high hopes for it based on several fundamentals such as “radical change in the use” of the token, “supersession of the old model of parachain auctions,” reduction of inflation via the burning of fees, and others.




For their part, il Capo of Crypto argued that DOT is “forming a new bullish trend” and is leading among major blockchains in advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and gaming. 
“It ensures secure data transfers, decentralized processing for AI, and seamless asset integration in gaming, with enhanced security and governance,” the analyst concluded.
Previous Forecasts
Other analysts touching upon the matter in the past few weeks include Block Diversity and Altcoin Sherpa. The former predicted a price increase as long as DOT stays above the $6.90 mark. Recall that its value briefly dropped below that level on May 31 before reclaiming it. 
Altcoin Sherpa envisioned a bull run but claimed that DOT won’t be able to outperform the rest of the market. As such, they think selling holdings during the next pump is the right move.
One important on-chain indicator that signals that the asset’s price is yet to surge is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. A ratio above 70 suggests that DOT could be headed for correction. The latest data shows that RSI has been hovering below that level since May 22.

China Never Banned Bitcoin Mining, Researcher Reveals


								In a striking revelation that challenges widely-held perceptions, Daniel Batten, a Bitcoin environmental impact analyst, disclosed that BTC mining was never officially banned in China. According to Batten’s research, despite widespread reports to the contrary, the so-called “ban” was actually a temporary suspension, and mining activities have largely resumed across the country.
Bitcoin Mining Was Never Banned In China
Batten’s report highlights that the hashrate within China, which is a measure of the computational power used in mining and processing Bitcoin, currently accounts for approximately 15% of the global total. This information stands in stark contrast to the dominant narrative that emerged in May 2021, when numerous major news outlets reported a comprehensive crackdown on cryptocurrency transactions and mining operations by the Chinese government.

Batten argues that the drop in network hashrate, which fell from 179.2 EH/s to 87.7 EH/s—a 51.1% reduction—was temporary and misinterpreted as a definitive ban. “If you are a disruptive student, and the principal sends you away from school, those ‘days absent from school’ don’t mean you’ve been expelled. It could mean you’ve merely been suspended,” Batten explained, drawing an analogy to clarify the situation in China.
Further investigative reporting supports Batten’s assertion. For instance, reports immediately following the “ban” indicated that many miners remained operational and unfazed. CNBC and NBC both reported on ongoing mining activities within China. Additionally, by December 2021, mining activity had rebounded to 19.1% of the global hashrate, as per Cambridge data, signaling a significant recovery.
“We’ve talked to multiple mining companies and mining distributers in China. The message is clear: if you’re small, useful and not using it to get money out of China, you’re welcome. This philosophy has made Bitcoin mining more distributed and more clean-energy based,” Batten added.
Innovative uses of Bitcoin mining in China have reportedly included harvesting wasted renewable energy and recycling heat, pointing to a more nuanced approach towards Bitcoin mining than previously understood. Batten also noted that local provincial governments often actively support Bitcoin mining, particularly when it involves small-scale operations that contribute to local energy solutions without attempting to circumvent capital controls.

“If you have 200-500 miners and want to do renewable-energy mining, you’re welcome. This is particularly in Inner Mongolia, the Texas of China, which has a lot of wasted renewable power they want to monetize,” Batten stated and added that “China let back the miners that served a specific purpose.”
Moreover, there’s no off-grid coal-based mining any more. “Mining is mostly hydro, much of which is sub-1MW,” Batten revealed. This is in line with China’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. Thus, the Bitcoin mining “ban” seems part of a broader effort to reduce the energy intensity of high-consumption industries.
According to Batten, Western media outlets have largely misreported these dynamics. This misunderstanding has perpetuated a false narrative about China’s stance on Bitcoin mining, which Batten aims to correct. Supporting this perspective, Jaran Mellerud from Hashlabs noted, “There are still several big miners operating in China. The local government lets them operate as they desperately need economic activity there.”
These findings not only challenge the mainstream media’s portrayal of China’s policies but also highlight a broader pattern of misinterpretation and sensationalism in reporting on Bitcoin mining’s legal and regulatory status worldwide.

Jasmycoin set for another rally? Potential 60% gains ahead! - AMBCrypto



Jasmycoin has a strongly bullish outlook based on the on-chain metrics.
The Fibonacci extension levels showed the token could rally another 60%.

Jasmycoin [JASMY] noted high volatility over the past two days. On the 3rd and 4th of June, prices rose by 25% within 36 hours. They retraced by 11.1% over the next two days and traded at $0.039 at press time.
Despite the lower timeframe volatility, the higher timeframes signaled bullish promise. How high can the move go, and does the on-chain metric support the idea of continued expansion?
The social metrics promised vast JASMY gains

Like the February rally, the social volume, as well as the daily active addresses, were both surging. When it happened on the 20th of February, JASMY rallied 263% over the next two weeks.
While this does not guarantee another 260% rally, it showed that hype and momentum can drag an asset a long way forward.
The dormant circulation spikes were small in recent weeks, showing that a large wave of selling was not yet in sight.
During the February rally, despite a dormant circulation surging to indicate profit-taking, the prices continued to climb. Hence, even if the dormant holders wake up soon, investors have reason to hold on and not panic.
Robust bullish sentiment was detected based on these two metrics

The 30-day MVRV shows whether short-term holders are in profit or not. The mean dollar invested age (MDIA) downtrend is a signal that the network is not stagnating. Together, they were strong evidence for a bullish JASMY.
The NVT ratio was not high, which indicated the coin was not overvalued based on its transaction volume. Overall, the metrics were positive.
Source: JASMY/USDT on TradingView
The 50% Fibonacci retracement level served as support from March to May before the recent uptrend occurred. Using the same move, a set of extension levels were plotted. The $0.0415, $0.05, and $0.064 are the next bullish targets.

Read Jasmycoin’s [JASMY] Price Prediction 2024-25

The RSI on the 3-day chart showed intense bullish momentum and the CMF’s reading of +0.12 supported the idea of firm capital inflow.
Hence, it is likely we see another 30%-60% move higher. In case of a retracement, the $0.0256-$0.0288 region would offer a slightly aggressive long-term bullish re-entry.

Mastercard and Visa Payments Return After a Hiatus on Binance


							

Binance has announced the resumption of its payment services through Mastercard and Visa.



The new move comes after a period of restrictions following Binance’s legal struggles with the SEC and CFTC.



Mastercard states that its decision to resume its alliance with Binance is the result of severe scrutiny of the exchange.




Binance has announced the reinstatement of crypto payment services through Mastercard and Visa. Binance revealed this decision via a recent X post, stating, “Use Mastercard, Visa, or SEPA for bank transfers and experience seamless transactions!”







A Binance spokesperson shared insights into the rigorous scrutiny the platform underwent in recent months. The spokesperson asserted:




 “Over the past several months, we have reviewed the enhanced controls and processes that Binance has put into place. It is based on those efforts that we have decided to allow Binance-related purchases on our network.” 




It is to be noted that Mastercard and Visa had severed their partnerships with Binance amid the exchange’s legal battles with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Back in August 2023, Mastercard announced its decision to discontinue its alliance with Binance in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Bahrain. In October, Binance had to cancel its Visa debit card program in the European Economic Area (EEA).









Following a period of restrictions, Binance has re-enabled the “Buy Crypto” options via Mastercard. The feature allows a maximum one-time purchase of up to 5,000 euros (approximately $5,440) for euro-based transactions and up to $20,000 for U.S. dollar-based purchases. The Binance spokesperson commented:




 “Following an extensive review of the rigorous controls and processes that Binance put into place, Mastercard made the decision to allow Binance-related purchases on its network. We look forward to adding support for further products, such as withdrawals, at a later date.” 




Mastercard and Visa’s decision to resume their relationship with the crypto exchange signals a potential easing of Binance’s legal challenges. This demonstrates Binance’s initiative to reclaim its position as a leader in the crypto industry, providing customers with flexible and convenient transaction options.

Can Whales Help Worldcoin (WLD) Price Reclaim Former Glory?


Worldcoin’s (WLD) price is on a bullish path propelled by one of the most influential cohorts, the whale addresses.
This investors’ accumulation has enabled WLD to recover recent losses with the help of investors potentially.
Worldcoin Investors Accumulate

Worldcoin’s price is above the $5 mark but still attempts to break past a crucial resistance level. However, the whales could be the altcoin’s savior, as the large wallet holders have consistently added WLD to their holdings.
In the past two weeks, addresses holding between 100,000 and 1 million WLD have bought over 6 million WLD. This supply, worth nearly $30 million, proves investors are optimistic about a price rise.

Thus, they are accumulating now to reap profits once Worldcoin’s price breaks out.

This sentiment is shared by retail investors and is also evident in their behavior. Upon distributing the participation, i.e., active addresses, by profitability, we can observe that the potential for selling is rather low.
In the case of WLD, less than 6% of all addresses conducting a transaction on the network are in profit. Generally, a dominance of this cohort hints at profit booking, but currently, WLD holders are HODLing overselling.

Worldcoin’s price could capitalize on this as accumulation and minimal selling create the perfect atmosphere for a rally.
WLD Price Prediction: Rise and Shine

Worldcoin’s price recently bounced off the support at $4.53 after failing to breach the resistance at $5.14. This barrier has been unbroken since mid-May, making it crucial in initiating recovery.
With the help of the investors’ bullishness, WLD could breach this resistance and flip it into a support floor. This would enable a rise to $5.64, which is the next major barrier for the altcoin.

However, a failed breach would keep Worldcoin’s price consolidated between $5.14 and $4.53. A fall to the latter would also increase the potential for a breakdown, invalidating the bullish thesis.

The stock Nvidia surpasses Apple for market cap in the race for shares

According to recent data, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple among the most valuable tech stocks in the world. However, the competition for the top spot is tight, with Microsoft holding a slight edge over all. 
Let’s see all the details below. 

Nvidia stocks in strong growth briefly surpass the value of Apple
As anticipated, on June 5, Nvidia, the American chip manufacturer, briefly surpassed Apple, becoming the second most valuable company in the world by market capitalization, before returning to third place.
The surge in Nvidia’s market capitalization, which reached over 3.01 trillion dollars, brought the company very close to Microsoft’s peak value of 3.1 trillion dollars. However, Apple’s recovery has been just as swift.
On June 6, in fact, at the opening of the US markets, Apple regained its position, returning to second place with a valuation of 3.007 trillion dollars. 
In the same period, Nvidia settled in third place with a valuation of 2.973 trillion dollars. These values represent new all-time highs for Nvidia, Apple, the NASDAQ, and the S&P 500. 
Further movements are expected in the coming days, as the global technological landscape continues to evolve. Despite the fluctuations, Microsoft has maintained its advantage, remaining the most valuable company of all time by market capitalization. 
However, the dynamic technological context, combined with imminent product launches, partnerships, and potential regulatory interventions, could cause significant changes in the rankings.
Furthermore, on June 10, the Worldwide Developer’s Conference of Apple will be held, and analysts predict a series of announcements on artificial intelligence (AI) from the Cupertino company, including a potential partnership with the ChatGPT producer, OpenAI.
Apple tries to close the gap with Microsoft
According to numerous reports, Apple executives are concerned about falling behind Microsoft, which has invested over 13 billion dollars in OpenAI. 
Rumor has it that Apple is rapidly forming partnerships with OpenAI and other related companies, as well as integrating artificial intelligence technologies developed by former employees of rivals like Google.
In any case, Nvidia could be the main beneficiary of the increase in AI stocks expected for 2024. 
His chip GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) continue to see a growing demand, consolidating themselves as the reference hardware platform for the development of artificial intelligence.
The dominant position of Nvidia in the AI market is evident, with its chips used by tech giants like Microsoft and Google. However, the influence of Nvidia extends well beyond, involving other industry leaders such as OpenAI, Amazon, and Elon Musk’s xAI.
The growing adoption of Nvidia GPUs is driven by the need for advanced computing power for artificial intelligence applications. 
With the continuous development and implementation of AI technologies, Nvidia is in a strategic position to capitalize on this trend, offering hardware solutions that have become essential for many of the world’s biggest technological innovators.
Looking at 2024, Nvidia seems poised to maintain and perhaps expand its leadership in the AI sector. 
With a customer base that includes the most influential names in global technology, the company is well positioned to reap the benefits of the surge in artificial intelligence, continuing to drive innovation and growth in this dynamic field.

Blockchain.com: the crypto company launches its Web3 domain

Blockchain.com, the leading crypto finance company, has formed a new partnership with Unstoppable Domains to launch its new Web3 domain: “.blockchain”. This domain will be enabled for DNS through a request to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

Blockchain.com: the crypto company and its new Web3 domain enabled for DNS 
Blockchain.com collaborates with Unstoppable Domains to launch its new DNS-enabled Web3 domain: “.blockchain”. 
In practice, the leading crypto finance company has announced its strategy to create one of the first Web3 domains enabled by DNS through a request to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
Together with Unstoppable Domains, the Web3 domain of “.blockchain” will be presented in time for the anticipated six-year ICANN registration program next year.
This would mean that if the request is accepted, the .blockchain domain will be ready to join the ranks of generic top-level domains registered by ICANN such as .com, .net, .org, .biz, .info, and others. 
In this regard, Lane Kasselman, president of Blockchain.com commented as follows: 
“Joining forces with Unstoppable Domains to drive the next evolution of web domains is exciting. Our joint efforts underscore our dedication to a user-centric web. We look forward to engaging with ICANN to realize our shared vision”
Blockchain.com: the crypto company partners with Unstoppable Domains for the Web3 domain
With a solid experience in generating adoption, Blockchain.com is the perfect partner to help Unstoppable bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 domains. 
Just think that over 40 million verified users on Blockchain.com have created more than 90 million wallets and the company has supported over 1.2 trillion dollars in cryptocurrency transactions.
Not only that, its all-encompassing and sector-specific nature makes .blockchain an ideal candidate to promote widespread adoption of blockchain-based companies in the Web2 ecosystem.
On the other hand, to date, Unstoppable Domains has been at the forefront in using blockchain technology to give users and brands control over their digital identities.
Sandy Carter, COO di Unstoppable Domains, commented:
“We are excited to collaborate with Blockchain.com in this ambitious venture. Our alliance is ready to launch with a Web3 domain to test and provide a low-cost solution. This is a step forward to ensure we can plan and strategize the next works of ICANN”.
The success of this partnership will allow any brand to collaborate with Unstoppable to expand the reach of existing Web3 domains, providing a low-cost integrated naming solution before the next ICANN round. 
This opportunity extends beyond companies to include cities and locations, with Unstoppable Domains responsible for creating the first city-focused Web3 domain, “.Austin”.
.
Unstoppable Domains and Women in Tech sponsored by President Macron
Recently, Unstoppable Domains formed a partnership with the renowned organization Women in Tech, on the occasion of their Global Summit, sponsored by President Emmanuel Macron. 
In practice, during the Women in Tech Global Summit 2024, the first Web3 top-level domain (TLD) in the world, dedicated to women, will be launched. 
This is “.WITG”, and, in addition to strengthening the digital identity of the brand, it allows its community to become ambassadors on social media and in Web3 communities. Not only that, the women of the community will be able to network and access special educational resources, such as blockchain and AI.

Roaring Kitty’s YouTube Livestream Sparks Meme Coin Surge


Meme coins are experiencing a significant surge after an announcement by Keith Gill, widely known as Roaring Kitty or DeepF**kingValue. Gill revealed plans for an upcoming YouTube livestream scheduled for June 7 at 16:00 UTC. 
This announcement ignited an immediate and explosive reaction in the crypto and stock markets.
Roaring Kitty on the Way to Become a Billionaire

Specifically, Solana blockchain-based tokens like GME, AMC, and KITTY have substantially increased. GME meme coin, unrelated to the GameStop (GME) company, has experienced the most remarkable rise, soaring 110% in just 24 hours and accumulating a staggering 560% increase over the past week. 
Consequently, GME has become one of the top performers among all Solana-based meme coins. Traders are considering the GME meme coin as an alternative to the GME shares in case there are restrictions on trading the shares.
Furthermore, GameStop shares surged by 47.5% in a single day, with the price per share reaching $46.55. According to a screenshot shared by Gill, the notional value of his stake in GME stocks now exceeds $586 million.

This includes his holdings of 5 million shares, valued at over $232.75 million, and call options worth more than $324.30 million. Gill’s unrealized gains from these investments total approximately $382.51 million.

“Roaring Kitty is set to be a billionaire as GameStop stock, GME, surges to $67.50/share in after-hours trading. If GME opens at or above current levels tomorrow, his shares will be worth ~$325 million, and options worth ~$700 million for a combined ~$1 billion,” the Kobeissi Letter said.

This financial juggernaut began to gather momentum on June 2. On that day, Gill disclosed on Reddit—his first post since April 2021—that his holdings in GME shares and call options had surpassed $180 million in notional value.
Additionally, the low market cap meme coin Roaring Kitty (KITTY) mirrored the explosive trajectory of GME, with an impressive 199% increase in a single day. Similarly, AMC tokens also felt the positive effects, nearly doubling in value. This indicates a broader market trend.

Encouraged by Gill’s announcement, crypto traders are aggressively acquiring positions in these high-risk assets. 
According to Lookonchain, an on-chain analysis platform, there’s notable activity from major traders. One such investor, who owns the Solana wallet – coux7, made significant investments in GME and KITTY coins.

This trader allocated 5,000 Solana tokens (SOL)—worth approximately $850,000—to purchase 35.99 million GME coins. Moreover, he spent an additional 1,460 SOL—valued around $248,000—to acquire 8.6 million KITTY coins.

Bitcoin ETFs Are Hot, But Prices Are Not: Here's Why


							

Eric Balchunas said that BTC holders are selling their tokens.



Despite billions of inflows into Bitcoin, the price of the coin remains stagnant.



An analyst stated that ETFs hold only 5% of supply, while BTC whales hold 95%.




In a series of conversations on X platform, Frank Makrides, an investor, questioned Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas about why the price of Bitcoin (BTC) remained range bound despite record inflows into the spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications were approved in the United States by the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year and have since attracted billions of dollars in inflows, with BlackRock leading the demand.



Makrides also called for Bitcoin ETF issuers BlackRock and Fidelity, along with other asset management firms and their market maker, JPMorgan Chase, to “show us exactly what they’re doing with their funds.”









On the other hand, Balchunas was swift to reply, stating, “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the call is coming from inside the house” and added:




“This is not ETFs doing, obvious because they buying like crazy lately, it’s bitcoin holders selling or leveraged flushers or whatever. Time and again ETFs go on flow-a-thons and its met with selling from other holders.”




Another analyst, Jimie, commented on Balchunas’ post, explaining that spot Bitcoin ETFs worldwide hold around 5% of the total BTC circulating supply while the rest is held by whales. He noted that “ETF inflows are significant and yet minimal compared to the volume of BTC being traded and sold by these groups,” stating that for every buyer, there needs to be a seller.

Buy Now, Crypto Bull Market Returns, Says Arthur Hayes


																In a new essay titled “Group of Fools,” Arthur Hayes, the outspoken co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, casts a critical eye over recent macroeconomic developments and their implications for the crypto market. Hayes, known for his direct and often provocative commentary, employs a blend of technical analysis, central banking critique, and currency market insights to build a case for what he believes is the return of a Bitcoin and crypto bull market.
A “Group Of Fools”
He begins by emphasizing the significance of the dollar-yen exchange rate as a macroeconomic barometer. According to Hayes, this metric crucially influences global financial stability and policy decisions. “The dollar-yen exchange rate is the most important macroeconomic indicator,” he asserts.
Hayes revisits his earlier proposal for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to engage in extensive dollar-for-yen swaps with the Bank of Japan (BOJ), a move he argues would empower the Japanese Ministry of Finance to bolster the yen through targeted interventions in the forex markets. Despite the theoretical benefits of this strategy, Hayes notes with a mix of irony and frustration that the G7 nations, which he refers to as the “Group of Fools,” have opted for a different route.

	Related Reading


The narrative then shifts to a critical examination of the G7’s central banking strategies. Hayes points out the stark discrepancies in interest rates among the major economies, with Japan maintaining a near-zero rate while other nations hover around 4-5%. He critiques the conventional wisdom that supports rate cuts as a tool to manage inflation, which universally targets a 2% rate among G7 countries, despite their diverse economic conditions.
“The G7 central banks—with the exception of the BOJ—have all raised rates aggressively in response to inflation spikes,” Hayes writes. However, he highlights yesterday’s unexpected rate cuts by the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank despite prevailing inflation trends, suggesting a deeper, unstated economic strategy aimed at bolstering the yen against a backdrop of geopolitical and economic tensions with China.
He describes this move as a cessation of what he terms “rate hike Kabuki theatre,” a maneuver he believes is designed to maintain the dominance of the Pax Americana-led global financial system.
Why The Bitcoin And Crypto Bull Run Returns
It is in this context that Hayes pivots to the implications for the crypto market. Looking ahead, Hayes turns his gaze to the crypto markets, suggesting that these recent shifts signal a fortuitous environment for investment in digital assets. Hayes speculates that the coordinated actions of central banks to adjust interest rates downward, despite high inflation, are setting the stage for increased liquidity in global markets, which traditionally benefits riskier assets like Bitcoin and subsequently altcoins.

	Related Reading


“The June central banking fireworks kicked off this week by the BOC and ECB rate cuts will catapult crypto out of the northern hemispheric summer doldrums. This was not my expected base case. I thought the fireworks would start in August, right around when the Fed hosts its Jackson Hole symposium,” Hayes noted.
He argues that these monetary policy shifts are likely to ignite a bull market in Bitcoin and crypto, particularly as central banks appear to be entering a cycle of rate easing. “We know how to play this game. It’s the same game we have been playing since 2009 when our Lord and Saviour Satoshi gave us the weapon to defeat the TradFi devil. Go long Bitcoin and subsequently shitcoins.” Hayes declares, referencing the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.
As the G7 meeting from June 13-15 looms, Hayes anticipates further developments that could influence global financial markets. He expects the communiqué from this gathering will likely address currency and bond market manipulations explicitly, or at least signal continued accommodative policies. Additionally, Hayes forecasts that despite conventional caution against policy shifts near major political events like the US presidential election, unusual circumstances might prompt unexpected moves.
Hayes concludes his essay by reinforcing his bullish stance on Bitcoin and crypto, driven by his analysis of G7 monetary policies and their impact on global exchange rates and financial stability. His call to action for the crypto community is to capitalize on these developments, positioning themselves for what he predicts will be a lucrative phase in the markets.
“For my excess liquid crypto synthetic-dollar cash, […] it is time to deploy it again on conviction shitcoins. […] But suffice it to say, the crypto bull is reawakening and is about to gore the hides of profligate central bankers,” Hayes concludes.
At press time, BTC traded at $71,200.

Crypto Whales Are Buying Up Bitcoin Like It's 2020 Again


							

Large investors buying Bitcoin at pre-bull run pace.



Spot ETFs drive record Bitcoin holdings in the U.S.



Ethereum demand rises, whales hold record amounts.




According to a CryptoQuant weekly report, large investors, known as “whales,” are accumulating Bitcoin at a pace similar to that seen before the 2020 bull run. The firm’s data reveals daily injections of $1 billion into Bitcoin and a significant increase in holdings by these whales. This mirrors similar activity observed in mid-2020.











Source: Cryptoquant



CryptoQuant also highlights a surge in Bitcoin purchases from spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States. These ETFs track the price of Bitcoin but trade on traditional stock exchanges. The chart shared by CryptoQuant shows that total spot ETF Bitcoin holdings in the U.S. have reached record highs, indicating growing institutional investment.



Source: Cryptoquant



Ethereum is also exhibiting positive signals. CryptoQuant reports a rise in Ethereum demand since May 20th, likely driven by the recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. Daily purchases by long-term holders, or “permanent holders,” have risen to 40,000 ETH.



Adding to the bullish sentiment, CryptoQuant reveals that large investors currently hold a record number of Ethereum, totaling 16 million ETH. This suggests whales see value in Ethereum and are actively accumulating cryptocurrency.









While the outlook for Bitcoin and Ethereum appears promising, CryptoQuant cautions that Tether’s USDT stablecoin market cap growth has decelerated significantly. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and are used to facilitate trading. CryptoQuant suggests that a lack of stablecoin liquidity could hinder a sustained price rally for Bitcoin.



Overall, CryptoQuant’s analysis paints a positive picture for Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, investors should remain mindful of potential challenges like slowing Tether growth and conduct their own due diligence before making any investment decisions.

Economic Data Fuels Bitcoin's Surge to $71,000


Bitcoin (BTC) has recently experienced a significant boom, reaching over $71,000 due to positive macroeconomic indicators and rising interest from institutional investors.
This surge, the longest in three months for the cryptocurrency, stems from anticipation of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Such adjustments could favor speculative assets like Bitcoin.
Institutional Confidence Bolsters Bitcoin’s Resurgence

Market optimism has grown regarding the Federal Reserve’s potential lowering of interest rates this year. Traders now see a higher likelihood of a rate cut as early as November.
This shift follows reports indicating slowing US inflation and a weaker jobs market, alongside notable dips in some Treasury yields. Financial conditions seem easing, which could benefit speculative investments, including cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s value hit $71,177, an over 4% increase over the last week.

Banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. predict the Federal Reserve might reduce rates as soon as next month. Despite previous skepticism in April, traders now expect stable rates until November.
However, the recent trend suggests a possible quicker adjustment. The globe’s bond market has also seen its most prolonged rally since December.
This Friday’s employment data release is pivotal before next week’s Fed rate-setting meeting. It will reveal whether traders or banking forecasters better align with the Fed’s monetary policy direction.
Amid these developments, Bitcoin attracts institutional buyers like Semler Scientific (SMLR). Pending market conditions, the healthcare company decided to make Bitcoin its primary treasury asset.
It acquired 581 Bitcoin for $40 million, bringing its total holdings to 828 Bitcoin worth $57 million. Semler Scientific views Bitcoin as a stable value store and worthwhile investment. The company appreciates its scarcity and potential as an inflation hedge.

“We believe that Bitcoin’s unique attributes discussed above not only differentiate it from fiat money, but also from other cryptocurrency assets, and for that reason, we have no plans to purchase cryptocurrency assets other than Bitcoin,” the company stated.


Additionally, crypto-focused firms are also showing optimism. Bybit, a global crypto exchange, reportedly would allow Chinese expatriates to open accounts and trade.
This move aims to meet the growing demand for secure and user-friendly crypto trading solutions among the Chinese diaspora and worldwide Chinese communities. The development occurred following reports on Wednesday suggesting that Bybit may have facilitated signup and verification processes for users located in China despite the country’s well-known ban on Bitcoin.

These activities are part of a broader pattern in which major financial organizations and crypto companies strategically position themselves to take advantage of Bitcoin’s potential. This is a strong indication of the increasing optimism regarding the future of this cryptocurrency.

Data Dive: Why Almost Every Bitcoin Holder is Winning Right Now


							

Santiment confirmed that a 98% supply of Bitcoin is currently in profit. 



ADA and MATIC have 53.5% and 35% of the supply in profit, respectively.



Ethereum (ETH) ranked second with 95% of supply in profit.




Blockchain analytics firm Santiment reported on X that nearly 98% of Bitcoin’s (BTC) total supply is currently profitable, marking substantial gains for investors since the cryptocurrency’s inception.







To clarify its methodology for readers unfamiliar with blockchain data analysis, Santiment explained:




“Think of it this way – If a BTC coin was mined and first introduced at $60K, it is considered in profit since BTC is currently valued at $70.8K. If a BTC coin was mined at $73K, then it is not. We calculate this for each coin to find the total % that are in profit vs. not in profit.”




Ethereum (ETH) follows closely behind with 95.1% of its supply in profit, along with 86.8% of Chainlink’s (LINK). Additionally, 82.2% of Dogecoin’s (DOGE) supply and 78.8% of XRP’s supply have also experienced appreciation over time.









Cardano (ADA) holds the lowest ranking among these digital assets, with 53.5% of its supply currently profitable. Polygon (MATIC) fares even worse, with only 35% of its supply in profit. Santiment attributes this to MATIC’s introduction during the 2019 bear market, terming the period of MATIC’s launch as its “handicap.”

A few metrics and market indicators hinted at a price increase. 

Solana [SOL] witnessed much traction in the recent past as several investors withdrew SOL to buy other Solana-ecosystem tokens. While activity around SOL remained high, its price action turned bearish in the last 24 hours.
 Let’s have a closer look at what’s going on. 
Solana’s trading volume rises
Lookonchain’s recent tweets revealed that an insider used just $1.2k worth of SOL to buy 190.2 million HULK, which accounted for 19% of the latter’s total supply. 
Soon after that, the insider sold off the recently accumulated HULK for 5,760.7 SOL, which was worth $979k. 
Another whale withdrew 8,943 SOL, worth $1.54 million, from Binance to buy 8.6 million MOTHER at $0.1789. Thanks to all these transactions, SOL’s trading volume remained high throughout the last week.
In the last 24 hours alone, SOL’s tracing volume remained at more than $2 billion. 
Meanwhile, SOL managed to push its price up by nearly 3% in the last seven days. But the trend changed in the last 24 hours as the token’s value dropped by over 1%. 
According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, Solana was trading at $171.88 with a market capitalization of over $79 billion.
Will SOL remain bearish?
To see whether SOL would continue to remain bearish, AMBCrypto then analyzed its on-chain data. We found that SOL’s weighted sentiment remained in the negative zone. This meant that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market. 
Its funding rate has increased substantially over the last few days. Nonetheless, its social volume was high, reflecting its popularity in the crypto space.

AMBCrypto’s look at Coinglass’ data revealed a bullish metric. We found that SOL’s long/short ratio increased sharply in the last four hours. 
For starters, a high long/short ratio suggests that there are more buyers than sellers in the market, which can be inferred as a bullish signal for the token.

Our analysis of Solana’s daily chart also revealed a few bullish indicators. For instance, the Money Flow Index (MFI) registered a sharp uptick over the last few days.

Additionally, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) also followed a similar trend and went up. These suggested that the chances of SOL’s price rising were high. 
Nonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remained bearish as it continued to trade under the neutral mark of 0.

Injective (INJ) Jumps by 12% Daily to $30, Bitcoin (BTC) Calms at $71K (Market Watch)


																The inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs have been nothing short of impressive in the past several days, but BTC has failed to make a major move out of its current trading range of around $70,000 to $71,000.
The altcoins are also quite sluggish on a daily basis, with BCH emerging as the top performer from the larger caps.
BTC Stalls at $71K
As reported over the weekend, the trading action during that period was quite uneventful. BTC had recovered some ground following the late Friday drop and stood at around $67,500.
However, the market picked up on Monday, and bitcoin quickly pumped to over $70,000. It failed there at first as the bears stopped the rally, but BTC was not confined and initiated another leg up that propelled an impressive rally to a multi-week peak of $71,767 amid the growing ETF inflows.
Since then, though, the asset has failed to maintain its run, even though the ETFs continue to experience substantial inflows. As of now, the cryptocurrency trades at $71,000 once again, with its market cap standing still at $1.4 trillion.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Its dominance over the altcoins has not moved either, sitting at 50.4% on CG at the time of this writing.

INJ, BRETT, JASMY on a Roll
Most of the larger-cap alts have mimicked BTC’s performance in the past few days, meaning that they sit quietly on a daily scale now, too. ETH, BNB, DOGE, SOL, SHIB, AVAX, TRX, and DOT are slightly in the red, while XRP, LINK, TON, and ADA have charted insignificant gains.
Bitcoin Cash is the only notable gainer from this cohort of assets, having jumped by 4% to $513. In contrast, FET and KAS have dropped by 3-4%.
The top 100 alts have produced a few double-digit gainers, including BRETT (26%), JASMY (13%), and INJ (12%). In fact, INJ has tapped $30 following today’s surge.
The total crypto market cap, however, has remained sluggish at $2.8 trillion on CG.

4 altcoins to buy under $1 for end of 2024


    Although many assets in the cryptocurrency market are struggling to maintain their bullish momentum, taking the lead from the market’s representative – Bitcoin (BTC) – some altcoins, still worth under $1 per wholecoin, represent a great purchase for the end of this year.



Indeed, this has been a bullish year for the majority of participants in the crypto sector, as many digital assets are recording constant increases, marked by occasional hiccups, but these four altcoins should not have many obstacles to explosive growth by late 2024.



#1 Shiba Inu (SHIB)



Specifically, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the altcoins that looks like a great investment opportunity for the end of 2024, particularly as one of its largest whales, which has profited over $120 million trading SHIB in its early days, has recently bought more than 700 SHIB tokens, demonstrating strong confidence in the meme token.

Indeed, Shiba Inu, the token in which this trader has invested more than $18 million, is currently trading at $0.00002527, down 1.09% on the day, also declining 2.40% across the previous week, but nonetheless an increase of 11.23% in the last month, as per data on June 7.

#2 XRP (XRP)



Secondly, XRP is generating optimism thanks to the continuous legal wins in the courtroom battle between blockchain company Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with one analyst suggesting its consolidation period could end with a massive breakout.







Meanwhile, the XRP token costs $0.52442, which suggests no price change on the day, a gain of 0.91% in the past week, while also accumulating an advance of 0.66% on its monthly chart, according to the most recent charts retrieved by Finbold.

#3 Dogecoin (DOGE)



Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) has shown potential reflected in heightened interest coming from the market’s largest holders, as observed by crypto expert Ali Martinez, as well as showing technical analysis (TA) indicators that point to an imminent breakout, similar to its past chart patterns.







At the moment, Dogecoin is changing hands at the price of 0.16099, recording a slight decline of 0.37% on the day while advancing 0.95% over the week, and the popular doge meme token making a positive growth of 8.55% in the last 30 days alone.

#4 Cardano (ADA)



Finally, Cardano (ADA) is currently awaiting for its next critical update – the Chang hard fork set for late June, with an aim to bost governance, functionality, and responsiveness in the bull market, which might ignite a price rally for the popular token after it takes place.



According to Cardano pioneer Charles Hoskinson, its main advantage is the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Ouroboros protocol:




“The advantage of Proof-of-Stake is that because you don’t have that gargantuan overhead and energy expenditure for deciding who gets to make a block, it means you can put a lot of your magic in the other two stages. So you end up getting protocols that are much lighter and massively more energy efficient.”




For now, Cardano is trading at the price of $0.46349, writing down a growth of 1.09% in the last 24 hours, as well as advancing 3.32% across the previous seven days, adding up to the 4.76% increase accumulated on its monthly chart, as per data on June 7.

Conclusion



Ultimately, the above four altcoins – the crypto assets other than Bitcoin – might represent a great opportunity as the year 2024 draws to its end, but things in this sector can sometimes change on a whim, so doing one’s own research and weighing all the risks is critical when investing in them.

Telegram Seeks to Disrupt App Store Model with In-App Token


							

Telegram CEO Pavel Durov announced the launch of Telegram Stars, an in-app token focused on new payment methods.



The Telegram Stars allows users to purchase digital goods and services on the platform.



The in-app token is available on both Google and Android and is compliant with their crypto sales policies.




Telegram CEO, Pavel Durov, unveiled the platform’s new payment system for digital purchases. The innovative in-app token, Telegram Stars, allows users to purchase digital goods and services directly on the platform.



In a Telegram post, Durov shared insights into the platform’s innovative development, stating, “With Telegram Stars, mini apps can now accept payments for digital services using the most seamless payment method possible – in-app purchases on Android and iOS.” The CEO added:




 “The recent mini app boom has already made Telegram the main destination to launch new apps. Stars and ad subsidies bring this to a new level – unprecedented in the history of social media.” 




Notably, Durov has elaborated on the processes involved in purchasing goods via Telegram Stars. According to his post, app developers can swap their Stars for Toncoin (TON), the native token of Telegram’s The Open Network, through Fragment. Fragment is a platform primarily used by the community to buy and sell Telegram usernames.



As reported, Telegram Stars is available on both Google and Apple platforms. Telegram’s CEO explained the in-app payment system’s compliance with Apple and Google’s digital product sale policies, stating:




 “Apple and Google take a 30% cut when users buy Stars from them, but Telegram will subsidize ads purchased with Telegram Stars. So if developers reinvest Stars in promoting their app, the overall commission will be nearly 0%. As a result, launching apps on Telegram makes more economic sense than launching traditional mobile apps.”




Subsequently, Telegram released a post detailing the terms and policies of Telegram Stars. Emphasizing that it’s just the beginning of the system, the platform added, “Future updates will bring additional features and functionality to Stars – like gifts for content creators and more.”

‘We Will Continue To Pursue Our Strategy of Purchasing Bitcoins With Cash’, Says Semler Scientific CEO | Cryptoglobe


                                
Semler Scientific, Inc. (Nasdaq: SMLR), a company at the forefront of developing technology products for healthcare providers, has announced the purchase of an additional 247 bitcoins, amounting to $17 million in cash. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 828 bitcoins, acquired at an aggregate cost of $57 million, inclusive of fees and expenses, as of 6 June 2024. This acquisition underscores Semler’s strategic initiative to incorporate Bitcoin as a key component of its financial strategy.



Semler Scientific, renowned for its innovative medical products and services, primarily markets QuantaFlo®, a rapid point-of-care test cleared by the FDA. QuantaFlo® measures arterial blood flow in the extremities, assisting in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, particularly peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The company is pursuing new 510(k) clearance to broaden QuantaFlo®’s applications, enabling healthcare providers to evaluate patients’ risks of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).



On 28 May 2024, Semler Scientific revealed its acquisition of 581 bitcoins for $40 million, including fees and expenses. This move reflects the company’s confidence in Bitcoin as a reliable store of value and an attractive investment.



Eric Semler, the company’s chairman, highlighted Bitcoin’s significance as a major asset class. He emphasized Bitcoin’s scarcity and finite supply, presenting it as a viable hedge against inflation and a safe haven amid economic uncertainties. Semler noted that Bitcoin’s digital resilience and architecture provide advantages over gold, which has a market value approximately ten times that of Bitcoin. He suggested that Bitcoin’s potential acceptance as digital gold could yield significant returns.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Semler also pointed to the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, underscored by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of 11 Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on 10 January 2024. These ETFs have garnered over $13 billion in net inflows from nearly 1,000 institutions, including global banks, pensions, endowments, and registered investment advisors. Institutions now hold over 10% of all bitcoins.



Before deciding on Bitcoin, Semler Scientific’s board and senior management evaluated various uses for their cash reserves, including acquisitions. Eric Semler explained that after considering different options, the company determined that investing in Bitcoin was the best use of its excess cash.



According to a press release issued on 6 June 2024, Dr. Doug Murphy-Chutorian, MD, Semler Scientific’s CEO, had this to say about his firm’s latest Bitcoin purchase:



“Semler remains focused on our two strategies of expanding our healthcare business and acquiring and holding bitcoin. The company now holds 828 bitcoins, underscoring our view that bitcoin is a compelling investment and can serve as a reliable store of value. We will continue to pursue our strategy of purchasing bitcoins with cash.”

This Project Developed by Coinbase Became the Largest Layer 2 Network, Surpassing the Optimism (OP) Network! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Base, a Layer 2 Ethereum network developed by Coinbase, has surpassed OP Mainnet to become the largest Layer 2 network in the OP Stack-based 'Superchain'.
Base Surpasses OP Mainnet to Become the Largest OP Stack-Based Layer 2 Network
According to DeFiLlama data, the network's total value locked (TVL) has increased by 20% since the beginning of May to $1.7 billion.


Base's mainnet, which went public in early August 2023, is positioned as the third most valuable Layer 2 blockchain in terms of TVL, behind Arbitrum at $3.81 billion and Blast at $2.26 billion.
This major milestone highlights Base's rapid growth and increasing adoption among decentralized applications (dapps).





The network's prominence was significantly boosted by decentralized exchange Aerodrome, which contributed $714 million in deposits. Uniswap follows as the second largest participant with $312 million.

These developments place Base at the forefront of the Superchain ecosystem, an interconnected Layer 2 rollup network built using the OP Stack software suite.


This ecosystem aims to increase the scalability and efficiency of Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain, thus reducing the load on the main Ethereum blockchain.
Optimistic rollups, including Base, Arbitrum, Blast, and OP Mainnet, work by default by assuming that all transactions are valid and validating them only when evidence of fraud is presented.





This method contrasts with zero-knowledge rollups such as zkSync, Linea, and Scroll, which provide ex ante cryptographic proofs of transaction validity.
Base's impressive growth and strategic integration within Superchain highlights its potential to drive greater innovation and scalability within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Three Reasons Why Bitcoin's (BTC) Bull Run is Yet to Escalate


																TL;DR

Bitcoin has surpassed $71,000 with a market cap of over $1.4 trillion, showing potential for further growth due to low trader euphoria (FOMO) and a stable RSI at 60.
Negative BTC exchange netflow suggests reduced selling pressure as investors move to self-custody, indicating bullish market sentiment.


No FOMO
Bitcoin (BTC) has been thriving lately, with its price surpassing the $71,000 mark and market capitalization exceeding $1.4 trillion (per CoinGecko’s data). The asset is 14% up on a monthly scale and 165% yearly, but some essential indicators signal that a further rally could be in the cards.
BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko
One such element is the lack of Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). According to the market intelligence platform Santiment, traders are not as euphoric at the moment as they were at previous peaks. 
FOMO is a psychological phenomenon characterized by the anxiety that others are having fulfilling or rewarding experiences without you. It often manifests as a compulsive desire to stay connected with what the masses are doing.
In the context of crypto, FOMO refers to the fear of missing out on potential investment gains in a particular digital asset that has been performing quite well. 




However, the phenomenon can cause people to enter the market emotionally rather than rationally. Investors might ignore necessary due diligence and investment strategies, leading to impulsive buys at high prices. This, in turn, could lead to crucial losses in the event of a severe market correction.
In many cases, FOMO has occurred during market peaks and has been followed by significant price declines. The lack of it (as of the moment) may indicate that BTC’s bull run is yet to show its full potential.
RSI 
Another metric hinting that BTC’s price may continue its uptrend in the near future is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This technical analysis tool identifies whether the asset is overbought or oversold. 
It ranges from 0 to 100, with a ratio above 70 signaling that a correction might be imminent. The latest data shows that BTC RSI is 60, crossing the aforementioned level only four times in the past 30 days. 
BTC RSI, Source: Crypto Waves
Abandoning Exchanges
Last but not least, we will touch upon the Bitcoin exchange netflow which has been predominantly negative in the last week (according to CryptoQuant’s data).
Shifting from centralized platforms to self-custody methods is considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.

Cardano's Blockchain Tech Finds New Home in Argentina's Entre Ríos


							

Cardano Foundation partners with Argentina’s Entre Ríos to promote blockchain adoption.



Ethiopia’s 2021 initiative and Argentina’s 2024 partnership signal growing Cardano use in national projects.



ADA price rises 1.12% in 24 hours, highlighting market response to new partnerships.




The Cardano Foundation has announced a new partnership with the province of Entre Ríos in Argentina.



The collaboration, formalized by a public signing between Entre Ríos Governor Rogelio Frigerio and Cardano Foundation’s LATAM Lead for Business Development Rafael Fraga, aims to foster blockchain adoption within the region. This development underscores Cardano’s commitment to expanding blockchain communities and driving innovation across Latin America.







This partnership in Argentina follows a notable precedent set by Ethiopia in 2021. The Prime Minister of Ethiopia, with a background in computer engineering and transformational leadership, outlined an ambitious plan to leverage Cardano for national development.



This multifaceted initiative includes using Cardano for various applications such as voting, payments, insurance, trade, savings, and investments. The Ethiopian government’s strategic vision aims to integrate Cardano into the nation’s technological and economic infrastructure, thereby fostering a tech-driven economy.







Argentina’s decision to embrace Cardano technology highlights the potential for blockchain solutions to address local challenges and promote innovation across various sectors.



This partnership is expected to create new opportunities for technological advancement, stimulate economic growth, and improve efficiency in public and private services within the region. Additionally, it underscores the growing recognition of blockchain’s potential to drive substantial progress in developing countries.









Amid these developments, the price of Cardano (ADA) has shown a positive trend. ADA currently trades at $0.4638, with a 24-hour trading volume of $277,105,195.07. The cryptocurrency has experienced a 1.12% price increase over the past 24 hours and a 3.43% rise in the last seven days. These price movements reflect a growing interest and confidence in Cardano’s potential as a transformative technology.



Analysts attribute this upward trend to the recent strategic partnerships and growing adoption of Cardano’s blockchain solutions in various national projects. The increasing use of Cardano for real-world applications has likely strengthened investor sentiment, further driving the cryptocurrency’s market performance.

Robert Kiyosaki's Bold Bitcoin Prediction: $350,000 By August "Is Not A Lie" | Bitcoinist.com


								Amidst a confluence of market optimism and favorable conditions, popular Bitcoin investor and acclaimed author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad” Robert Kiyosaki in a striking forecast has predicted that BTC will reach an astonishing $350,000 by August this year.
This projection from Kiyosaki demonstrates his robust belief in the largest cryptocurrency asset by market cap as a store of value and a promising alternative investment during times of economic uncertainties.
Impending Massive Gains For Bitcoin
The “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author, Robert Kiyosaki shared the intriguing forecast for Bitcoin on the X (formerly Twitter) platform. His forecast comes at a time when optimism and technological developments are supporting the cryptocurrency industry, indicating that Bitcoin may be ready for historically high increases in the months to come.

According to Kiyosaki, the value of BTC will be $350,000 by August 25, 2024, and this is not a lie. Rather it is a prediction, a speculation, and an opinion, as he believes no forecast about the future is false. Kiyosaki further underscored his desire for the crypto asset to reach the aforementioned target. “I want $350,000 Bitcoin to be a fact, and I want it to be true, but it is only a prediction,” he stated.
While the author is confident BTC will reach $350,000 sometime in the year, it is only a target, a wish, and a dream. This is due to the uncertainty and volatility surrounding digital assets, as their trajectory can not be fully determined. Despite all of this, Kiyosaki has highlighted his dedication to acquiring more BTC and other notable cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), citing his belief in these assets to attract significant gains in the near future continuously.
The author’s major purpose in making such a move is due to his confidence in the incompetence of the current leaders in the United States such as the country’s President Joe Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellin, and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome H Powell.
Kiyosaki claims in actuality these leaders of the nation are the 3-Stooges, and he is very positive they are completely incompetent. Thus he has urged the community and his followers to protect themselves from these 3-Stooges by purchasing more BTC, Ethereum, Solana, Gold, and Silver.
Strong Belief In BTC’s Value Growth
Distinguished for his book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Robert Kiyosaki has been an outspoken supporter of Bitcoin, citing several price targets over time. In April, Kiyosaki publicly expressed his alignment with Ark Invest’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Cathie Wood’s audacious forecast for Bitcoin to reach $2.3 million.

Wood claims by putting more than 19% of the world’s assets, worth a staggering $250 trillion into BTC, it could soar to an all-time high of $2.3 million. Although this forecast seems unreasonable, Kiyosaki is confident about the prediction because he believes Wood is exceptionally clever and has sound judgment.

Arthur Hayes adjusts Bitcoin outlook: Predicts surge following rate cuts - AMBCrypto



Hayes tips a BTC break out as central banks start cutting interest rates. 
However, the Fed’s meeting on 12th June could help define the next BTC price direction. 

Bitcoin [BTC] could be primed for a bullish breakout from its months-long range as major central banks start cutting interest rates, per BitMEX founder and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes. 
Hayes had earlier projected that the breakout could happen in August. However, he has adjusted his outlook following rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BOC). 
‘The June central banking fireworks kicked off this week by the BOC and ECB rate cuts will catapult crypto out of the northern hemispheric summer doldrums’ 
This will mark the start of central bank ‘easing cycles’, and the US will forced to jump in, per Hayes. As a result, the executive nudged, 
“Go long Bitcoin and subsequently sh*tcoins. The macro landscape has changed vs. my baseline. Therefore, my strategy shall change as well.”
Macro outlook and key catalysts
BTC has been holding above $70K for the past two days and was poised to flirt with $72K or the March ATH if key macro events in the next few days play out in its favour. 
Most market watchers opined that Bitcoin could set a definite price direction after the Fed’s meeting next Wednesday (12th June). 
Recently, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, summarized the macro outlook and stated, 
‘The market needs conviction that Powell is going to cut in July. That could come from a weak jobs report Friday, weak CPI and/or dovish Fed next Wednesday.”
However, even if the Fed doesn’t cut immediately, the US mitigation against the massive fall in the Japanese Yen’s value could induce more money supply and lead to the same outcome, per Hayes. 
Reacting to a reported Japan’s offloading of US treasuries to boost its Yen, Hayes noted that, 
‘Uh oh, Bad Gurl Yellen got some work to do. $JPY must strengthen to prevent the UST apocalypse.’
Already, the surge in the US money supply has begun in earnest, and most analysts expect it to boost BTC and overall risk assets. 
In the meantime, BTC Open Interest (OI) rates have spiked to a record high, demonstrating a massive influx of liquidity into the king coin. Crypto derivative tracking platform Coinglass noted, 
‘#Bitcoin open interest hits all-time high of $37.66B’

The OI spike underscores bullish expectations for the king coin. That said, more momentum and direction could be set next week after the Fed’s decision.

Meme Dream Come True: Investor Turns $777k Into $9.4M In Just 8 Days Betting On Iggy Azalea's Coin - Benzinga

A trader is laughing all the way to the bank after having invested in a memecoin themed on Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, the latest in the growing fad of celebrity-endorsed cryptocurrencies.What Happened: According to an X post by on-chain tracking platform Lookonchain on Thursday, the investor invested $777,000 to buy 50.35 million of the token, called MOTHER, from the period between May 29 and June 1.In 8 days, his stash ballooned to $9.4 million, netting an eye-popping profit of 1110%. As of this writing, he continues to HODL, indicating that he is still bullish on the token.See Also: GameStop-Themed Cryptocurrency Surges Following Roaring Kitty’s Social Media ActivityThe token has been trending hot on social platforms since the rapper began aggressively pushing it via her official X account. Since its launch last week, the Solana SOL/USD-based memecoin has amassed a market cap of more than $213 million, according to CoinMarketCap. In the last 24 hours, it gained 37%, with trading volume rising by 159% to $211 million. Why It Matters: The success of the MOTHER token comes amidst criticism of celebrity cryptocurrencies by Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin has expressed his disapproval of the meme coin frenzy and urged the community to push “things in a better direction.”However, the MOTHER token’s performance contrasts with other celebrity-themed coins like the Hulk Hogan-themed HULK, which lost $15M in market cap in minutes after some insider pulled off a pump-and-dump strategy.Another coin, promoted by reality TV star and former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, saw steady gains of 17% over the week, after cratering from the initial euphoria.Read Next: Former Federal Agents Rally Demand For Release Of Detained Binance Executive In Nigeria, Urge State Secretary Blinken To Step Up EffortsPhoto via Shutterstock

The ideal time for this resistance to break is either today, Friday, June 7, or next week, Wednesday, June 12," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note shared with CoinDesk.

Can XRP Break Out of Its Slump? All Eyes on Crypto Regulations


							

Global regulations could unlock XRP’s potential, shaping its journey in the crypto landscape.



Technical analysis hints at consolidation for XRP, with potential bullish momentum awaiting.



Investors await clarity on regulatory developments to gauge XRP’s future amid legal uncertainties.




The cryptocurrency sector is on the verge of potentially transformative global regulatory developments, with Ripple and its associated cryptocurrency, XRP, at the center of this evolving narrative. Clearer regulatory frameworks could significantly impact XRP’s trajectory, potentially boosting its adoption and usability in the financial sector.



Regulatory clarity is crucial for XRP, given its association with Ripple, a company focused on revolutionizing cross-border payments. Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over XRP’s classification as a security underscores the need for definitive regulations. Transparent rules could resolve these ambiguities, fostering a more stable operating environment for XRP.



However, the actual impact on XRP’s adoption and price depends on the specific nature of the regulations implemented. Restrictive laws could inhibit growth, whereas supportive regulations could accelerate the cryptocurrency’s progress.



Turning to market indicators, XRP currently shows signs of consolidation. It is trading at $0.5237, having dipped 0.06% over the last day. Technical analysis reveals that the 20-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) are positioned above the current price. This alignment might indicate a short to medium-term downtrend or market consolidation.







Source: TradingView



Additionally, trading volume has fluctuated, with notable spikes suggesting increased trading activity during significant price movements. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) presents a potential bullish crossover, hinting at increasing buying momentum, though with overall low momentum suggested by its proximity to the zero line.









The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 50, reflecting neutral market momentum. This indicator suggests that the market is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a balanced but undecided trading environment.



If XRP maintains its consolidation phase and shows growing momentum, a breakout above the SMAs could signal a bullish trend reversal. Such a move could push XRP towards higher resistance levels, potentially around $0.60. Conversely, a breakdown below recent lows might see it testing lower support levels.

Crypto traders eye Memeinator (MMTR) amid bullish projections for Bitcoin - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Analysts are bullish on Bitcoin, Ethereum as prices hover above $71k and 3.8k respectively.
The outlook has investors eyeing new gems, with Memeinator (MMTR) potentially top target among memecoins.

Crypto traders have seen a massive run for memecoins over the past month or so. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spiked above $70,000 this week and has analysts projecting further gains amid unprecedented spot ETFs inflows.
While the current political buzz has several meme coins going parabolic, Memeinator (MMTR), a new market entrant, is among those likely to outperform in coming months largely due to its strong utility.
Bitcoin and crypto reacts to ECB rate cut
Crypocurrencies rose slightly as the European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates for the first time in five years. Market experts say the Fed and other central banks will soon follow this trend, aiding the long term outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) amid cheap money flow.
This week also saw reports emerge that Franklin Templeton, a $1.6 trillion asset manager, is looking to launch a crypto fund that will give investors exposure to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The fund will target institutional investors, The Information reported.
But notable from this is that crypto is on the ascendancy when it comes to the adoption curve, and recent traction in the spot ETFs market points to this.
For instance, Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $488 million on June 5, and $218 million on June 6. Over the past three days, net inflows have reached over $1.5 billion.
Analysts’ bullish price predictions for BTC, ETH
While prices have largely remained ranged for BTC and ETH, analysts are bullish on what’s next. Standard Chartered analysts this week projected Bitcoin could hit $100,000 ahead of the upcoming US election.
The Fear & Greed Index, currently at 78 and showing extreme greed suggests traders are confident, while open interest is at a historic $38 billion
Similar sentiment surrounds ETH. The total ETH futures Open Interest is currently over $16.6 billion as traders target the spot Ethereum ETF trading debut. 
VanEck analysts recently noted that Ethereum price could rise to over $22k by 2030.
Crypto outlook and new gems like Memeinator (MMTR)
As top cryptocurrencies dominate bullish price predictions, analysts are also highlighting memecoins, AI tokens and the emerging Bitcoin-Fi (DeFi on Bitcoin) ecosystem as areas likely to see an epic bull market.
While the likes of Pepe and Floki have memecoin traders bolstering positions, Memeinator (MMTR) offers a new opportunity.
Memeinator recently made its trading debut after successfully navigating its presale. The project aims to be the top utility-focused meme coin, riding an ecosystem that includes a play-to-earn model, NFT marketplace and staking.
These features have Memeinator poised as one of the meme coins with a solid outlook in its growth trajectory. A big plus for Memeinator could be the upcoming launch of meme-inspired game Meme Warfare.
Although the token’s debut coincided with a broader dip for altcoins, MMTR price is above a key level.

Insider trader turns $1,000 to $1 million in three hours


    The crypto market rally of 2024 has already featured many of the hallmarks of a cryptocurrency bull market, including the release of multiple new coins and tokens, a new all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin (BTC), and various stories of rapid wealth-building.



The most recent of the rags-to-riches stories came late on June 6 when data from Solscan revealed that an insider acquired more than 190 million Hulkmania (HULK) – 19% of the total circulating supply – at the cost of just 7.1 Solana (SOL), worth $1,200 at the time. 



The trade enabled them to, within a mere three hours, sell the 190 million HULK for more than 5,760 SOL – worth just under $1 million at the time.







 In total, the investment returned more than 81,000% and grew about 812 times, per the calculation published on X by Lookonchain.



A side-effect of the selling was that it drove the price of the HULK token into the ground, reducing the value of the cryptocurrency by some 85%.

The meme coin continued plummeting after the incident, and the mystery surrounding HULK only deepened as Hulk Hogan himself made an Instagram post claiming that his X account was compromised and urging fans to disregard any cryptocurrency-related posts.



Solana remains popular for new projects



Throughout 2024, Solana has been a highly popular blockchain for the launch of new cryptocurrencies thanks to its consistent uptime, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.



The native token of the Solana blockchain SOL has also benefitted from significant enthusiasm, driven in part by its market performance.



Indeed, the token saw a rapid rise in late 2023 when it rocketed from about $20 in October to above $100 on New Year’s Day, and its strong performance continued into 2024.



Following the rise – which, by the time of publication, amounted to 69.63% on the year-to-date (YTD) chart – Solana price today reached $171.96.

The risks and rewards of a crypto bull market



Despite the other highly successful trades – which have seen various investors make hundreds of thousands, millions even within just hours – it is worth noting that caution remains highly important in the crypto market.



Along with the string of positive news and developments, the 2024 bull market has featured its fair share of mishaps and scams.



A team member behind the meme coin Slerf (SLERF), for example, accidentally burned some $10 million worth of investments shortly after launch while the team behind CondomSol seemingly pulled off an old-fashioned rug pull.

Crypto Analyst Charles Edwards Explains Why Bitcoin Has Not Hit $100K Already | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 7 June 2024, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, shared an insightful thread on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), discussing the current state and future prospects of Bitcoin’s price. 



Edwards is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, known for his technical analysis and investment strategies. He is the founder of Capriole Investments, a digital asset hedge fund focused on outperforming Bitcoin through quantitative strategies and stringent risk management.  Edwards’ expertise covers a broad range of topics within the crypto industry, including valuation metrics, technical analysis, and macroeconomic conditions. 



Edwards began by questioning why Bitcoin hadn’t yet reached $100,000, despite significant institutional activity. He noted that since the launch of US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11, these ETFs have acquired 200% of the Bitcoin mined during this period. With Bitcoin’s price up 50% to $71,000 since the ETFs’ inception, he acknowledged the notable growth but highlighted that many expected more substantial gains. 



Next, Edwards discussed the influence of long-term holders on Bitcoin’s price. He explained that the share of Bitcoin held by long-term holders (those who have held their assets for more than two years) has decreased from 57% in December 2023 to 54% as of June 2024. While a 3% decrease might seem minor, Edwards pointed out that this equates to approximately 630,000 Bitcoins being sold. This selling pressure from seasoned holders counteracts the buying pressure from new institutional investments, contributing to the slower-than-expected price increase.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Edwards also highlighted that the effects of the recent Bitcoin Halving, which occurred in April, have not yet been fully realized. The Halving event reduced Bitcoin’s daily issuance by 50%, meaning fewer new Bitcoins are being introduced into circulation. He predicted that over the next year, the difference between spot ETF demand and Bitcoin supply will grow significantly, as institutional processes for investment often require several quarters to complete. This delayed response could lead to more pronounced price movements in the future as the supply squeeze tightens.



In the final part of his thread, Edwards outlined three key factors that could drive strong price appreciation for Bitcoin: increased daily buying by ETFs, reduced selling by long-term holders, and growth in US liquidity. He emphasized that for substantial price growth, at least one of these conditions would need to be met. Edwards expressed optimism that these factors would align over the coming months, suggesting that Bitcoin’s price could see more significant upward momentum as these dynamics play out.



At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $71,027, up 69.13% since the start of the year.

Injective (INJ) Price Set To Skyrocket 33% On Bullish Signal


																In an analysis shared on X, renowned crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom) forecasts a significant 33% rise in the price of Injective (INJ) based on a classic bullish chart pattern known as the inverted head and shoulders (iH&S). The chart suggests a strong reversal possibility from recent bearish trends, potentially steering the cryptocurrency’s price to new local highs.
Injective Price Prepares For Lift-Off
The iH&S pattern, prominently featured in Olszewicz’s chart, is a revered formation among technical analysts for predicting bullish reversals following a downward trend. This pattern is identified by three troughs: the middle trough (head) being the deepest and flanked by two shallower troughs (shoulders), which are approximately of similar depth.

On the chart, the left shoulder forms around mid-April, dipping below $23.50. The head is seen in May, dropping to a low near $21.08. The formation completes with the right shoulder in early June, reaching down around $23.90, mirroring the left shoulder.

The neckline, which is a key component in this pattern, is drawn across the peaks that connect the shoulders and the head. On Olszewicz’s chart, this line is positioned at approximately $28.70. A breakout above this neckline is typically interpreted as confirmation of the pattern’s completion and an impending bullish trend. According to the chart, the price of INJ is about to break above this critical threshold.
The analyst’s chart also integrates the Ichimoku Cloud, which provides a dynamic look at potential support and resistance areas. Presently, the price of INJ is hovering near the lower edge of a red cloud, indicating an upcoming resistance zone, which traders might watch closely.

	Related Reading


Further enriching the analysis are the Fibonacci extension levels drawn from the lowest point of the head to the neckline of the iH&S pattern. These levels project potential price targets if the bullish breakout is confirmed. The 1.618 Fibonacci extension is marked at $34.74, and a more ambitious 2.0 extension reaches $39.09. These targets represent potential resistance levels where traders might take profits, hence they are crucial for understanding possible future price movements.
Josh Olszewicz’s reliance on the iH&S pattern combined with other technical indicators such as the Ichimoku Cloud and Fibonacci extensions presents a comprehensive view. This analysis suggests that INJ’s price could escalate towards $34.74 and might even extend to $39.09, marking a 33% increase from the current price.
Investors and traders need to monitor INJ’s price movement closely, keeping an eye on trading volumes and market sentiment which could either accelerate or hinder the predicted bullish momentum.
At press time, INJ traded at $29.51.

GameStop Reports Missed Q1 Results Early, Before Roaring Kitty's Livestream - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) has disclosed its financial results for the first quarter of 2024, ending May 4. The company reported net sales of $0.882 billion, a significant drop from the $1.237 billion reported in the same quarter of the previous year.



This decline in net sales was accompanied by a reduction in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which decreased to $295.1 million from $345.7 million in the prior year’s first quarter. However, the SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 33.5%, up from 27.9% in the previous year.



The earnings were released earlier than expected, and the timing is interesting as Keith Gill, one of the key figures of the GameStop short squeeze, is set to return to YouTube with a live stream, with many expecting the price of the stock to surge shortly again.



GameStop’s First Quarter Performance



The net loss for the quarter was $32.3 million, an improvement from the $50.5 million net loss in the first quarter of 2023. The company ended the quarter with $1.083 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and maintained limited long-term debt, primarily a low-interest, unsecured term loan from the French government’s COVID-19 response.



The gross profit for the quarter was $244.5 million, down from $287.3 million in the previous year. The operating loss narrowed to $50.6 million from $58.4 million, reflecting the company’s efforts to manage costs amidst declining sales. Despite these efforts, the company’s overall financial health remains a concern, with significant reductions in key areas such as net sales and gross profit.





GameStop Misses Revenue and EPS Expectations in Q1



When comparing GameStop’s current performance against expectations, the results are mixed. Analysts had anticipated an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.045 and revenue of $1.05 billion for the quarter. However, the actual EPS came in at -$0.11, significantly below expectations, and the revenue of $0.882 billion also fell short of the forecasted $1.05 billion.



This shortfall in revenue and higher-than-expected losses per share indicates that the company is facing more significant challenges than anticipated. The decline in sales across all segments, including hardware and accessories, software, and collectibles, underscores the difficulties in maintaining market share and revenue growth in a competitive and evolving industry.



The gap between expectations and actual performance highlights the need for GameStop to reassess its strategies and address the underlying issues affecting its financial health. Despite the cost-cutting measures, the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales suggests that the company needs to find more effective ways to streamline operations and improve efficiency. The lower-than-expected revenue also points to potential weaknesses in the company’s market positioning and product offerings, which need to be addressed to meet future expectations.



GameStop Did Not Provide Specific Guidance for Upcoming Quarters



Looking ahead, GameStop’s guidance remains cautious. The company has not provided specific financial guidance for the upcoming quarters, reflecting the uncertainty in the market and the challenges it faces. However, the management has emphasized the importance of strategic and transformation initiatives aimed at improving profitability and sales growth. The focus will be on expanding technology expertise, enhancing retail and e-commerce experiences, and managing cost reduction initiatives effectively.



The company’s liquidity position, with over $1 billion in cash and marketable securities, provides some cushion to navigate through the current challenges. However, the significant decrease in current assets from $2.25 billion to $1.87 billion and the reduction in total assets from $3.07 billion to $2.58 billion indicate that GameStop needs to stabilize its financial position and work towards sustainable growth.

The First Step Act may not apply to SBF or Ryan Salame


While Protos, along with other media outlets, was quick to point out that the Donald Trump-era law the ‘First Step Act’ could be a road to early release for Sam Bankman-Fried, Ryan Salame, and other first-time, nonviolent offenders, it turns out that the law is less about ‘the letter of the law’ than it is about a judge’s discretion.
Indeed, if we take a look at a previous example of a massive financial fraudster attempting to use the act to get early release, it seems incredibly unlikely that Bankman-Fried or Salame can expect to have a significant amount of time shaved off their sentences.
What is the First Step Act?
Though it’s been repeatedly discussed, it’s worth going over some of the minutiae of the First Step Act. The main point of contention regarding the act is that inmates can, possibly, get out of prison in half of the time they’ve been sentenced to. However, it’s important to note that there are many caveats.
First of all, while a former federal prosecutor told CNN that Bankman-Fried could possibly shave 12.5 years off his sentence, it’s simply not clear that’s true. Buried within the details of the bill is a section that describes ineligible prisoners, specifically “Section 1030(a)(1), relating to fraud and related activity in connection with computers.”
Bankman-Fried was found guilty of wire fraud, securities fraud, and commodities fraud, all seemingly revolving around computers and his trading.
This doesn’t mean that he can’t take any time off his sentence whatsoever: federal prisoners are still eligible to take off over 50 days a year if they involve themselves with programs to reduce recidivism and don’t cause problems while incarcerated. In this sense, Bankman-Fried will likely be able to knock a few years off of his 25-year sentence.
No matter how you look at it, a major factor will be whether or not a judge believes at some point that Bankman-Fried has repented for his actions, served enough time in prison, and is no longer a threat to society. It remains to be seen if or when this metric will be met.

Bad news for Bankman-Fried and Salame
On that note, the outlook for both felons seems less than optimistic. Bankman-Fried is guilty of one of the largest frauds in history and Salame, as he’s stated on X (formerly Twitter) himself, is charged with the “largest case of campaign finance fraud in American history.” These are prime examples of when individual cases can be used to prove a point to the public at large.
Similar to Bankman-Fried, Samuel Israel III led a massive financial fraud, bilking investors out of $450 million in the late 1990s. After serving 11 years of a 22-year sentence, Israel attempted to utilize the First Step Act to get early release in 2019.
Unfortunately for him, this request was denied, with the judge saying “It would make a mockery of the sentencing statute if this financial fraudster, who ruined the lives and finances of hundreds of people while living the high life of an ostensibly successful hedge fund manager, were to have his sentence reduced.”
With that in mind, it’s difficult to imagine that either Bankman-Fried or Salame would see a dramatic reduction in their sentences.

Meme Coin Mom Vs. Ethereum Dad: Did Iggy Azalea Just Shade Vitalik Buterin? - Benzinga

Rapper and composer Iggy Azalea, who launched the MOTHER MOTHER/USD token on the Solana SOL/USD blockchain, recently took a jab at Ethereum ETH/USD co-founder Vitalik Buterin. What Happened: Azalea posted a meme depicting herself holding a baby with Buterin's face, along with the caption, "he was just hangry (sic)."This mockery came in response to Buterin’s critical remarks about the trend of celebrity meme coins, where he expressed his disapproval of the “financialization as a final product” premise driving many of these projects.Commenting on Azalea’s post, Hayden Adams, CEO of Uniswap UNI/USD said, “No issues with memecoins or celebcoins – I think there's value to memetic attention and it's cool to create markets for it. That said, the underlying purpose and value of the tech goes way beyond financial games. And the best builders in the space are motivated by positive social change.

Coinbase exchange’s layer-2 scaling solution, Base, has outranked many of its peers on sustained growth since the start of this year. According to data from DeFiLlama, the Base Total Value Locked (TVL) has now jumped to its all-time high (ATH) in value at $1.784 billion. Base crossed the $1 billion milestone earlier in March.Base-Optimism flipIn relation to their relative ages, Base is a relatively newer protocol compared to Optimism. However, the emergence of Base came with a very defined embrace that has helped it keep up pace with growth figures.While it currently boasts of a TVL ATH of $1.78 billion, Optimism has only managed to rake in $878.62 million. Though Base was designed using the OP Stack, both layer-2 protocols currently operate on a very different adoption rhythm. On Base, the largest application is Aerodrome with a TVL of over $712 million. This protocol is also deployed on Optimism, however, with $147.01 million in value locked. The other intersecting application in the top five for both Optimism and Base is Uniswap. Again, the TVL of Uniswap on Base is $314 million, while that of Optimism comes in at $73.97 million.The OP Stack ecosystem itself is bigger than the duo of Base and Optimism, with other DeFi, gaming and media protocols designed using the technology. Popular examples on this front include opBNB, Farcaster and Zora Network, among others.While each of these protocols has recorded impressive growths over the past year, Base remains in the lead, per current data.OP Stack and growth hurdlesDespite the growth of Base and its recognition on the market, the protocol still faces significant backlash from critics. Most of the conversation in this regard hinges on the emergence of meme coins with a very short shelf life.Activities on Base have often forced network congestion that generally leads to a halt in the Coinbase ecosystem as a whole. The OP Stack ecosystem is also known to suffer attacks, with Sonne Finance’s $20 million exploit one of the latest in the ecosystem.

Bitcoin Whales Stockpile Despite Lackluster Market Performance


							

Major cryptocurrencies have shown minimal price movement in recent months.



Large investors (“whales”) are accumulating Bitcoin at a rapid pace.



The lack of price movement creates uncertainty about the market’s future direction.




In a recent tweet, influential crypto analyst CryptoGodfatha highlighted the lackluster performance of several major cryptocurrencies since his predictions in March.







On March 14, 2024, CryptoGodfatha tweeted a list of cryptocurrencies to watch in 2024, noting their then-current prices: Bitcoin at $73,000, Ethereum at $4,000, Solana at $165, Ston at $4.10, Wrapped Filecoin (WFIL) at $3.00, Dogecoin at $0.168, and Sui at $1.643. His message was succinct: “Eyes on these for 2024.”



In his latest tweet, CryptoGodfatha compared those prices to current values: Bitcoin at $71,000, Ethereum at $3,800, Solana at $170, Terra at $7.43, Wrapped Filecoin at $3.26, Dogecoin at $0.16, and Sui at $1.12. The comparison reveals minimal price movement for most assets, signaling a period of stagnation.



“Not much growth since March,” he commented on the disappointing performance. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has dropped slightly from $73,000 to $71,000. Ethereum also saw a small decrease from $4,000 to $3,800.



Solana, a top altcoin, experienced a minor increase from $165 to $170. Terra, not included in the March tweet but added to the latest update, stood at $7.43. Wrapped Filecoin saw a slight rise from $3.00 to $3.26, while Dogecoin and Sui declined slightly from $0.168 to $0.16 and $1.643 to $1.12, respectively.Despite this stagnation, a recent CryptoQuant weekly report indicates that large investors, known as “whales,” are accumulating Bitcoin at a pace similar to that seen before the 2020 bull run. The firm’s data reveals daily injections of $1 billion into Bitcoin and a significant increase in holdings by these whales.

How Telegram Stars Enhances Mini Apps Like Notcoin


Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has introduced “Telegram Stars,” an in-app token designed to streamline the purchase of digital goods and services. This new feature broadens Telegram’s scope from a secure messaging platform to an expansive digital marketplace.
Telegram Stars facilitates transactions within the app’s ecosystem. Users can obtain these tokens through in-app purchases on platforms like Apple, Google, or PremiumBot. 
How Telegram Plans to Enhance Its Ecosystem Through Stars

Users spend these Stars on digital products, including e-books, online courses, and items for Telegram games.
Compliant with Apple and Google’s policies on digital sales, Telegram Stars aims for a seamless integration into mobile app stores. Furthermore, Telegram plans to allow developers to convert earnings from their bots into Toncoin (TON), enhancing the versatility of these digital tokens.
Read more: What Are Telegram Bot Coins?

Telegram Stars strategically enhances the visibility and usage of mini-apps like Notcoin, which do not require installation. Users can utilize Stars to conduct transactions within such mini-apps, and developers can also use Stars to promote their apps on Telegram.

“Apple and Google take a 30% commission when users buy Stars from them, but Telegram will subsidize ads purchased with Telegram Stars. So if developers reinvest Stars in promoting their app, the overall commission will be nearly 0%,” Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram, explained.

The influence of these innovations is evident in the crypto market, particularly with Notcoin (NOT). It is currently trading at $0.022, up by 4.17% in the past 24 hours. 
Although the short-term impact on its price has been minimal, Notcoin has climbed into the top 60 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Earlier this week, Notcoin briefly made it to the list of top 50 cryptocurrencies.

The rapid success of Notcoin is backed by significant support from Durov himself. Earlier this month, he noted that assets in his account, initially worth $6.8 million, appreciated fourfold within two weeks, reaching nearly $25 million. 

Durov’s strategy involves holding these tokens with the expectation that their value will increase by 100 times. He targets a staggering $680 million valuation for his Notcoin portfolio.
Durov has praised Notcoin’s growth, declaring it “the largest cryptocurrency community in the history of social media.” He also highlighted the advantages of Telegram’s large user base and scalability for deploying crypto applications.

As Notcoin gains momentum, achieving record trading volumes and market cap milestones, it highlights Telegram’s transformation into a key platform for crypto solutions.

Whale activity spikes on Solana amid Roaring Kitty's GME update - AMBCrypto



Whales accumulated large amounts of GME and KITTY after Roaring Kitty’s announcements.
Activity on the Solana network surged while revenue generated declined.

The attention around GameStop stock jumped sharply on Thursday after Keith Gill, a popular online investor known as RoaringKitty shared an update on his significant investment in the company.
GameStop won’t stop
Gill revealed on Reddit that his holdings in GameStop stock and options weren valued at a combined total of $586 million. He also announced a livestream on YouTube scheduled for 7th June.
This update sent GameStop shares soaring by 47% by the end of the trading day on 6th June.
Interestingly, the surge in GameStop stock wasn’t contained to just the traditional stock market. The excitement rippled through the digital asset market as well.
Solana-based meme token GME, inspired by GameStop but with no official connection to the company, surged more than 80% over the past 24 hours according to CoinGecko data.
This jump came even though the broader cryptocurrency market was pulling back. Similarly, the micro-cap AMC token, which shares the name of the struggling movie theater chain AMC but has no affiliation with it, also jumped by 83%.
Additionally, the KITTY token on the Solana network also grew by 108.73% over the last 24 hours.
Source: CoinMarketCap
Whales also began accumulating large amounts of these tokens. According to Lookonchain’s data, a trader spent 6,460 SOL amounting to $1.1 million to buy GME and KITTY on the Solana network.
Specifically, the trader spent 5000 SOL amounting to $850,000 to buy 35.99 million GME at $0.02362 and 1,460 SOL which came up to $248,000 to buy 8.6 million KITTY at $0.02891.
Source: X
How is Solana doing?
Sustained whale interest can cause the price of these tokens to surge even further, which may attract more investors to buy these tokens.
Solana will be the network that would gain the most from this memecoin mania. Due to the cheap fees on the Solana network, most users opt for Solana while making these kinds of tokens to capitalize on these crypto trends.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the token terminal’s data revealed that the number of active addresses on the Solana network grew by 23.0% over the past month.
Despite the surge in price, the overall revenue generated by Solana had declined by 37.6% during the same period.

Next Ethereum Upgrade Pectra Is Set To Be 'The Largest' Ever


								Christine Kim, a researcher at Galaxy Digital, has labeled the forthcoming Ethereum upgrade known as Prague-Electra aka Pectra as “possibly the largest in Ethereum’s history.” In a thread on X, Kim laid out the code changes and highlighted how Pectra could fundamentally alter Ethereum’s operational and security paradigms.
Why Ethereum Pectra’s Uprade Is Massive
Pectra follows the successful implementation of the Dencun upgrade, which was rolled out in March 2023, marking it as the next significant advancement for the Ethereum network. It integrates a variety of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that target key aspects of network functionality from cryptographic enhancements to system efficiency improvements. Here’s a closer look at each the Prague changes:

EIP-2537: This EIP aims to add operations for the BLS12-381 curve as a precompile. This move is crucial for performing operations like BLS signature verification, enhancing security through more robust cryptographic proofs, and facilitating better interoperability with the Ethereum Beacon Chain.
EIP-2935: Authored by Vitalik Buterin and others, EIP-2935 proposes to store the last 8192 block hashes in storage slots of a system contract. This allows for stateless execution and is a foundational step toward the upcoming Verkle trees upgrade, which aims to drastically reduce state size and improve network scalability.



EIP-7685: Authored by Lightclient, this proposal introduces a general-purpose bus for sharing EL triggered requests with the CL. Its implementation is expected to streamline the process of code testing and the deployment of execution-triggered requests, such as those related to consensus layer changes.
EOF (Ethereum Object Format): This is a collection of 10 EIPs that revamp how EVM bytecode is processed. The expected result is an improvement in the dapp developer experience by making smart contract code execution more efficient, logically sound, consistent, and upgradeable.
EIP-7702: Proposed by Vitalik Buterin, Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, and Matt Garnett, this EIP aims to introduce a new transaction type that allows setting the code for an Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) during a transaction. This could significantly enhance user experience by enabling transaction batching, sponsored transactions, and more flexible control over EOAs.

Several key EIPs have been confirmed for the Electra part of the upgrade, addressing crucial aspects of validator operations and system efficiency:

EIP-6110: This EIP proposes providing validator deposits as a list of deposit operations added to the Execution Layer block. This change simplifies the validator experience by removing the need for deposit voting, reducing client software complexity, and decreasing the delay between submitting a deposit transaction and its processing on the consensus layer.



EIP-7002: Authored by Danny Ryan and others, this allows validators to trigger exits and partial withdrawals using their execution layer withdrawal credentials, enhancing the design of trustless staking pools.
EIP-7251 and EIP-7549: These proposals focus on optimizing validator balance configurations and improving the efficiency of attestations within blocks, which could reduce network bandwidth requirements and enhance overall security.

Uncertainties And Timeline
Kim also revealed that “alongside EIPs confirmed for Pectra, devs are also working on a few parallel initiatives like PeerDAS, history expiry, and light client development. Depending on how these go, we could see new EIPs included in Pectra later on.”
She highlights that multiple EIPs are currently being staged for implementation on development networks (devnets), which marks a shift in the Ethereum governance process. This strategic staging allows the community to adjust the upgrade scope based on real-world testing outcomes, ensuring robustness and stability before full deployment.
The active involvement of the Ethereum developer community is crucial, with ongoing discussions, testing, and feedback shaping the final configuration of the Pecta upgrade. The next stages involve further devnet implementations and community reviews, with the potential for some EIPs to be deferred to subsequent upgrades depending on their readiness and impact assessment.
Finally, “it’s unclear how large or small Pectra will actually end up being given that devs aren’t sure what EIPs will be activated together and what they’ll activate separately,” Kim concluded. Ethereum’s core development team has set a target to deploy the Pectra upgrade by the first quarter of 2025.
At press time, ETH traded at $3,807.

BTC Futures Positions Top Record $37B as Analysts Predict Bitcoin Surge to $83K

Bitcoin could be primed for a surge to $83,000, according to analysis by 10x Research. The breakout is contingent on BTC moving above $72,000 to complete an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern in which an asset experiences three price troughs with the middle one being the deepest. This pattern suggests it is "only a matter of time" before the BTC price reaches a new high, 10x founder Markus Thielen said. A breakout above $72,000, a mere 1% climb above its current price of around $71,300, may hinge on U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, scheduled for release at 08:30 ET. Weak data may strengthen the case for Fed interest-rate cuts, adding to upward momentum in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe updates his altcoin portfolio


    After going all-in on altcoins four weeks ago, professional crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe has shaken up his altcoin portfolio, removing some of the cryptocurrencies he considered underperforming to replace them with better alternatives that could offer a better return on investment (ROI).



Indeed, van de Poppe explained that altcoins suffered due to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but that some of them provided opportunities for strong gains, in a video streamed on his YouTube channel on June 6.



Altcoins out: ATOM and CRV



Specifically, one of the altcoins that the crypto expert has removed from his portfolio is Cosmos (ATOM), which he said was “fundamentally really strong but hasn’t been performing at all,” considering that “ATOM at this point has been seeing a correction that has been up to 50%. That is a lot.”

Furthermore, as another example of a crypto asset to remove from his portfolio, van de Poppe singled out Curve (CRV), which “has also been underperforming (…)” lately, “with a performance that’s been super-weak.,” and “continues to fall” against Bitcoin and Polygon (MATIC).



At the same time, he pointed out that these “might not be bad projects (…) but have been underperforming substantially” and “I just see less arguments of having them in my portfolio as they are underperforming heavily in the last period already.”



Altcoins in: SEI and TIA



On the other hand, the crypto market analyst pointed out that he wanted to position himself “into coins that do not have these back-holders, (…) are likely to have a higher return because the repricing didn’t take place yet” and which offer the opportunity cost of having them in his portfolio.



For instance, one of these altcoins with great potential, in his view, is Sei (SEI), which “has been seeing a (…) listing correction, and after that, it went up to close to 8x against Bitcoin even due to the fact that Bitcoin went live with the ETF.” As van de Poppe further highlighted:




“After that period, we basically went down, which means that this one is just going to rotate back up again. I think this is a very safe one actually that is just getting crushed due to the fact that Bitcoin ETF went live, so this one dropped approx. 70% since and is fuelling an opportunity.”

Moreover, the crypto trading expert mentioned Celestia (TIA) as “another one that has been providing the exact same peaks in the week of the Bitcoin ETF launch, went up 650% and corrected 75%,” reiterating his view that “those are opportunities that are substantial.”



Conclusion



All things considered, van de Poppe is a seasoned trader who has seen his share of gains and losses, risks and opportunities and is well aware of what he is getting himself into when trading crypto assets, illustrating the importance of doing one’s own research before making any major investing decisions.

Bitcoin Demand Shock: Potential For Explosive Price Growth?


The current situation for Bitcoin (BTC) reveals a pronounced demand shock, with prices steady at around $71,000. Demand from institutional investors, especially through spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), fuels this increase. 
Spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced unprecedented net inflows. For the past 18 days, they have recorded continuous positive inflows, the longest streak since their inception. 
Is Bitcoin Awaiting Explosive Price Growth?

Among Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is particularly noteworthy. It accumulated $350 million on Thursday, the highest in the last two trading months. In total, IBIT has acquired nearly $780 million worth of Bitcoin over the past three trading days.
This week alone, Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw inflows exceeding $1.7 billion. Significantly, June 4 marked the highest daily inflow of the week, with spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracting $886 million.

“That’s the highest weekly inflow since launch (+$1.7 billion) – and we still have one day left,” crypto analyst Miles Deutscher said.

Additionally, the discrepancy between Bitcoin miners’ output and ETF purchases highlights the shock in demand. Crypto investor Adam Back highlighted that while Bitcoin miners produced just 450 BTC on June 4, ETFs bought a staggering 12,508 BTC.

Despite these bullish activities, the Bitcoin funding rate remains neutral. This rate is crucial for maintaining market equilibrium and is a fee exchanged between traders of perpetual future contracts. It aligns the contract’s price with the Bitcoin spot price. 
Despite high Bitcoin prices, a neutral funding rate suggests a balanced market sentiment with a reduced risk of sudden downturns. 

“Last time we were here (in March/April) – it was a sea of orange/red (high funding rate),” Deutscher added.

Furthermore, the open interest in the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Group is rising, approaching all-time highs once again. Analyst Vetle Lunde from K33 Research reports that this increase is driven by more direct participant exposure and solid inflows into leveraged ETFs. 
Open interest, which represents the total outstanding derivative contracts not yet settled, has reached an 11-week high, surpassing 75,000 BTC. This measure indicates growing market liquidity, and mirrors heightened market sentiment and engagement. 

Moreover, according to CryptoQuant data, the supply of Bitcoin on crypto exchanges is at a one-year low. 

“Right on time for a second wave of ETF Flows. Demand shock + Inelastic supply,” Bitcoin investor, Thomas Fahrer said.

This traditional economic scenario of high demand coupled with low supply suggests potential explosive price growth for Bitcoin. The convergence of increasing institutional demand, balanced market mechanisms via neutral funding rates, and a tightening Bitcoin supply outline a promising outlook for its near-term valuation trajectory.

Ethereum ETF Demand May Be Muted Compared To Bitcoin ETFs, Analysts Say - Benzinga

The highly anticipated launch of Ethereum ETH/USD exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States may see a more subdued response compared to the initial excitement surrounding Bitcoin ETFs, analysts predict.What Happened: JPMorgan strategists, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, estimate that Ethereum ETFs will attract a modest $1 billion to $3 billion in net inflows by the year’s end, a stark contrast to the $15.3 billion garnered by Bitcoin ETFs, according to a Bloomberg report.Ethereum’s 109% price increase over the past year lags behind Bitcoin’s 169% surge.James Davies, CPO and founder of Crypto Valley Exchange, told Benzinga that analysts are expecting lower demand for Ether ETH/USD as its prominence relative to Bitcoin is not as broadly known and accepted by the public.”Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets Pty, concurred, noting, “Ether doesn't have the profile of Bitcoin,” and emphasized Bitcoin's BTC/USD market value of $1.4 trillion, which is three times that of Ether.SEC Approval ProcessDavies is optimistic about the approval process under SEC Chair Gary Gensler, stating, “Everyone sees that ETH ETFs will pass very soon.” He added that denial of these ETFs would likely lead to lawsuits, mirroring the legal actions seen with Bitcoin ETFs. Marko Jurina, CEO of Jumper.Exchange, also expects approval, saying, “Chances of issuance are imminently favorable,” given recent regulatory developments.Long-Term Advantages Of Ethereum ETFsDespite the expected lower demand, Ethereum ETFs offer unique benefits.“ETH has utility mostly not present in the Bitcoin ecosystem, so much of the overall crypto ecosystem is tied to ETH,” Davies noted, suggesting significant long-term growth potential. VanEck's Head of Digital-Asset Research, Matthew Sigel, supported this view, stating, “Over time, we expect investors to conclude that the potential for application and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem could be much larger than that of Bitcoin.”Also Read: JPM - Benzinga">JPMorgan: US Crypto Regulations Signal Opposition To CBDCs And Non-Compliant StablecoinsPotential Selling Pressure And Market DynamicsConcerns remain about selling pressure from Grayscale's planned conversion of its $11 billion Ethereum fund into an ETF. Davies warned, “The potential ‘selling pressure’ on Ether from redemptions in Grayscale’s Ethereum fund could be significant.” However, he also noted that net inflows to BTC ETFs could potentially offset this pressure.Broader Investor SentimentEther continues to trade below its all-time high of $4,866, with global investors showing less enthusiasm compared to Bitcoin. ByteTree Asset Management's Charlie Morris observed, “Global investors have been less enthusiastic about Ether, which they have had access to through Europe and Canada for years.”The implications of these developments and broader trends in digital asset investments will be a key topic at the Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. Industry leaders will provide valuable insights into how these strategic moves and regulatory changes are shaping the future of the cryptocurrency market.Read Next: Is Robinhood’s Crypto Exchange Deal Really ‘Massive’ And The ‘First Domino To Fall?’Image: Shutterstock

CoinGecko confirms data breach from third-party email platform - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Independent crypto data aggregator CoinGecko has confirmed that it experienced a data breach on June 5, 2024, through its third-party email platform, GetResponse.The company has provided a transparent account of the incident, detailing the steps taken to address the issue and advising users on how to protect themselves.The data breach occurred when an attacker compromised a GetResponse employee’s account, allowing them to export 1,916,596 contacts from CoinGecko’s GetResponse account. The attacker then sent phishing emails to 23,723 emails from another GetResponse client’s account (alj.associates). CoinGecko’s security team detected the unusual activity and worked with GetResponse to block further email delivery.Crypto Briefing previously reported on June 5 that several crypto firms are being targeted by a potential email vendor breach, based on a public disclosure from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. CoinGecko co-founder and COO Bobby Ong corroborated the disclosure and said that email blasts of fake token launches were being sent to mailing lists connected to crypto firms. Ong also went on to advise the crypto community to exercise caution when engaging with crypto newsletters.Details of the breachPersonal information compromised in the incident included users’ names (if provided during sign-up), email addresses, IP addresses, locations of email opens, and other metadata such as account sign-up dates and subscription plans. However, CoinGecko user accounts remain secure, and no passwords were compromised.CoinGecko has directly notified affected users via email and is actively investigating the situation with GetResponse. The company is also reviewing its security procedures and aims to enhance its security protocols in collaboration with its vendors.To protect themselves, users are advised to remain vigilant and exercise caution when opening emails, as there may be an increase in phishing or spam emails. CoinGecko has emphasized that it is not the only crypto company impacted by this organized, targeted attack.Users should be cautious of emails from unfamiliar or misleading domains, avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unsolicited sources, and be wary of emails claiming to offer token airdrops. CoinGecko has clarified that any email claiming to offer token airdrops by CoinGecko or GeckoTerminal is unauthorized and sent by the attacker, as the company does not have any officially issued coins or tokens.

‘Quiet Before the Storm’ - Trader Says Top Ethereum Rival Mirroring 2021 Price Action That Preceded 700%+ Rally - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst believes that one Ethereum (ETH) rival is gearing up for a massive gain.
Pseudonymous trader Kaleo tells his 641,800 followers on the social media platform X that Avalanche (AVAX) may be about to mirror a 2021 bullish pattern against Bitcoin (BTC).










“AVAX/BTC: I still wouldn’t sleep on Avalanche here. Chart looks like it’s at a spot similar to where it was in July of 2021. Big gains to start the year, followed by months of bleeding out before it started to rip. Quiet before the storm.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at his chart, the trader suggests that AVAX/BTC may breakout of a descending channel to 0.0014 BTC ($99.87) similar to how the trading pair soared from around 0.0003 BTC in July 2021 to about 0.0025 BTC in December 2021, a gain of 733%.
AVAX/BTC is trading for 0.0005105 BTC ($36.42) at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the analyst predicts that memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) will have a parabolic breakout against Bitcoin (DOGE/BTC).
“DOGE/BTC: you just have to bullieve.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at his chart, the trader suggests DOGE/BTC could soon soar beyond 0.00000380 BTC ($0.27). DOGE/BTC is trading for 0.00000227 BTC ($0.16) at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.
The trader believes altseason will officially kick off once Ethereum breaks through the key resistance level against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) currently around 0.054 BTC ($3,852).

ETH/BTC is trading for 0.05370 BTC ($3,798) at time of writing, down 1% in the last 24 hours.

Not SEC, Issuers Will Show Green Light To Ether ETF


                                SEC Chair: Ether ETFs Approval Hinges on Issuers' Responsiveness                                The current and future regulation of cryptocurrencies in the United States is complex, especially with the expected approval of spot Ether ETFs. Some of the recent statements by the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler have given a clear perspective on the timelines involved and what is expected in these approvals.What's the News?The Chair of the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler has mentioned that the moment when spot Ether ETFs will be introduced will heavily rely on issuers’ activity regarding the comments of the Commission. This statement was made following the approval of eight spot Ether ETFs through Form 19b-4 applications to trade on various exchanges in the United States. However, these ETFs can only trade after they have been registered with an S-1 registration statement.Gensler highlighted that the SEC is supposed to ensure investors receive enough information and that all parties are acting fairly. He also stated that the staff of the SEC has analyzed the filings and found out that they are similar to the approval of Bitcoin. However, the issuers have to be more receptive to the comments of the SEC. “It is really up to them how much they want to be responsive,” Gensler said implying that the pace of approval is at the issuer's discretion.Gensler reiterated that while spot Ether ETFs are approved in principle, they still require S-1 filings to be finalized. The approval process could take additional weeks or months, with the first week of July being a speculative target for some analysts. Gensler pointed to the importance of having strong rules and requirements for disclosure and compliance in the crypto space. He added that most of the exchanges lack enough transparency, which is crucial to avoid fraud and manipulation.Factors affecting the SEC’s decisionIt appears that the SEC has changed its approach to spot Ether ETFs based on the precedent set by Grayscale in a case regarding Bitcoin ETFs in 2023. The most crucial factor that Grayscale was able to prove its case was the approval of the SEC on Bitcoin futures ETFs. Gensler pointed out that Ethereum has a similar regulatory approach, as the relations between Bitcoins and Ether markets are studied by the SEC. This legal backdrop may have facilitated a more favorable view of Ether ETFs.Another angle to the SEC’s decision is linked to Commissioner Jamie Lizárraga, whose past ties to influential Democratic figures like Nancy Pelosi may have played a role. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart suggested that internal political dynamics and concerns over crypto’s popularity among Democrats could have influenced the SEC’s decisions.ConclusionAs the SEC continues to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency regulation, the approval of spot Ether ETFs will largely depend on issuer responsiveness and ongoing compliance with disclosure requirements, CoinGabbar concluded. The SEC’s actions might also reflect broader political dynamics, with significant support for crypto legislation among Democratic lawmakers. The passing of FIT21 in the House of Representatives exemplifies this trend, potentially shaping the SEC’s regulatory approach. The evolving regulatory landscape promises to bring more clarity and opportunities for investors and issuers alike.Also Read: US Antitrust Chief’s Vision For Preventing AI Monopoly

GameStop Dips in Premarket After Early Q1 Results, Equity Sale Announcement - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) released its first-quarter financial results for the fiscal year 2024 earlier than anticipated, coinciding with the much-awaited return of Keith Gill, also known as “Roaring Kitty,” to YouTube. The video game retailer reported a net loss of $32.3 million, an improvement from the $50.5 million loss in the same quarter last year.



However, the company missed analysts’ expectations on both revenue and earnings per share (EPS), with net sales declining to $0.882 billion from $1.237 billion in Q1 2023.



GameStop Misses Q1 Earnings, Plans to Sell Up to 75 Million Shares



GameStop’s gross profit for the quarter declined to $244.5 million from $287.3 million year-over-year. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to $295.1 million from $345.7 million, but increased as a percentage of net sales to 33.5% from 27.9%. The company ended the quarter with $1.083 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, while maintaining limited long-term debt, primarily a low-interest, unsecured term loan from the French government’s COVID-19 response.



In a separate announcement, GameStop revealed plans to sell up to 75 million additional shares of Class A common stock through an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC, entered into on May 17, 2024. This move follows a previous sale of 45 million shares, which generated gross proceeds of approximately $933.4 million.



The new share offering, deemed an “at the market offering” under Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act, could significantly dilute existing shareholders.





GameStop Stock Sees Extreme Premarket Volatility



As of June 6, 2024, GameStop’s stock price closed at $46.55, with a pre-market price of $42.78 at 7:26 AM EDT, representing a decline of 8.1%. The stock has experienced extreme volatility over the past year, with a 52-week range between $10.01 and $48.75, and daily trading volumes ranging from 1,731,300 to 206,979,100 shares.



Despite the mixed financial results, GameStop’s stock has delivered a year-to-date return of +165.54% and a 1-year return of +91.48%.



The significant pre-market surge in the stock price can be attributed to the anticipation surrounding Keith Gill’s return to YouTube.

Is Now the Time to Buy Shiba Inu? Crypto Analyst Says Yes


							

Popular crypto analyst Thescalpingpro has urged his followers on X to buy SHIB during its current dip.



SHIB’s trading volume has decreased by 43% to $397.78 million over the past week. 



SHIB faces strong resistance at $0.000026, where many traders tend to sell. Holding above $0.000025 is crucial for another upward push.




Crypto analyst, Thescalpingpro, has urged investors to buy Shiba Inu (SHIB) during its current dip. In an X post, the pseudonymous analyst emphasized that this might be the last opportunity to buy SHIB before a potential price increase.







Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.00002529, reflecting a 1.43% intraday dip and a 2.18% decline over the past week. SHIB’s trading volume has also fallen by 43% to $397.78 million over the same period. Similarly, its market capitalization has dipped by 1.50%, reaching $14.88 billion.



According to TradingView data, SHIB’s price has shown relatively stable movement with moderate volatility this month. The price consistently finds support around $0.000022 and encounters resistance at $0.000027, struggling to break through this level.



Furthermore, volume trends reveal a few noticeable spikes, which are significantly lower than in previous periods, such as during the March surge. Meanwhile, lower volume indicates decreased trading activity, often accompanying consolidation phases. These periods usually precede significant price movements as traders anticipate a breakout.



On June 5, SHIB reached a high of $0.00002633 after surpassing the $0.000025 level and 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). This development brought mid-term bullish momentum, supported by Bitcoin’s resurgence and a broader market uptrend.



However, the $0.000026 threshold remains a significant resistance level. According to IntoTheBlock data, 64,320 addresses purchased 69.74 trillion SHIB tokens at an average price of $0.000026. Each time SHIB retests this price, these addresses tend to sell off their holdings, increasing selling pressure and leading to a price correction.



As SHIB retraced most of its recent gains and slipped below $0.000026, it now aims to hold above $0.000025 to prepare for another potential upward push when bullish sentiment returns. Coincodex currently predicts that SHIB’s price could rise by 226.28%, reaching $0.00008195 by July 7, 2024.

Solana trader turns $53,500 into $2.86 million in five months


    GameStop stock (NYSE: GME) is up 165% year-to-date, and the cryptocurrency market has navigated this hype with a GME memecoin. A Solana (SOL) DeFi trader has made $2.8 million in unrealized profits with this purely speculative meme token.



In particular, the account ‘7eTbufa‘ purchased the GME token on January 29 and April 3 while trading at low prices. Overall, the trader stacked 90.23 million GME in Solana year-to-date and patiently held despite months of low volume.



This strategy is paying off, as these holdings were worth $2.86 million when Lookonchain reported the achievement. Specifically, GME traded at $0.03120 on the decentralized exchange Raydium, while Solana currently trades at $171.







However, the trader might face liquidity issues, and it’s not guaranteed that he can realize his profits with the Solana version of GME, which has no real value or relation with the GameStop stock.

GME stock hype and a meme coin mania among Solana traders



Meme coins like Solana’s GME have been trending among cryptocurrencies since May 13. Renewed interest surged when the famous meme trader Keith Gill returned to social platforms. Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, inspired the GameStop stock short squeeze in 2021.



His appearance is visible on the chart above. Notably, there was a price surge at that time, followed by a crash once the influencer went silent. The Solana trader held his GME meme coin untouched during the pump and the following crash.



Nevertheless, Roaring Kitty’s Reddit account disclosed a $180 million position on GameStop on June 3, pumping these meme assets again. GME stock currently trades at $44.07, up 164.37% year-to-date.

In this context, it is worth the warning that trading meme coins or meme stocks can be extremely risky. The risk of ruin with this asset class is high, and most traders will lose money instead of accruing gains.



Furthermore, experts warn of “The Greater Fool” theory dynamics that resemble financial bubbles, when the “mania” disappears and the late buyers remain with massive losses of assets that have no organic demand besides the highly speculative nature of traders trying to outplay the market, but being outplayed as soon as the “music stops.”

Ripple sells 150 million XRP of June reserves, pressures price


    Ripple, the XRP Ledger (XRP) developer and largest holder, sold 150 million XRP from this month’s reserves on June 7. The sale is worth $78 million, representing 0.25% of XRP’s $29.25 billion capitalization at $0.52 per token



On June 1, the company released 1 billion XRP from the initial distribution, locked in monthly escrows until 2027. Ripple then sent 200 million XRP to its treasury account and locked the remaining 800 million in new escrows.



Additionally, the ‘Ripple (35)‘ account sent an extra 200 million tokens to the sell-off reserves, totaling 400 million XRP.







As usual, the selling activity resulted from the treasury account, labeled ‘Ripple (1),’ sending tokens to the unlabeled account ‘rP4X2hTa‘. This action causes XRP supply inflation—by putting tokens that have never circulated before into circulation for the first time.

So far, the amount remains in the ‘rP4X2hTa’ account, which will likely be distributed to ‘rhWt2bhR‘ and other intermediary addresses before landing in cryptocurrency exchanges, as happened in previous months.

XRP price analysis amid Ripple sell-offs



It is noteworthy how Ripple sales directly impact XRP’s price, considering the supply pressure they create on the spot market. Historically, XRP suffered a local crash most of the time Ripple sold its tokens.



Year-to-date, only five of the 12 sell-off days had positive price action: February 5, 11, April 14, May 13, and 20. All the other seven days were of local crashes, evidencing the importance of monitoring the company’s activities.



Moreover, XRP had a negative monthly performance in three of the first five months of 2024, year-to-date.

As of this writing, XRP trades at $0.523 with an increasing supply pressure over its spot price. Therefore, investors should closely monitor Ripple’s dumps in June, as they could slow down an expected bull rally this cycle.

Bitcoin Open Interest reaches record levels: Could $80K be next? - AMBCrypto




The coin’s open interest hit the highest point since March, suggesting that BTC could break past $73,750.
Exchange withdrawal increased while the funding rate was positive, reinforcing the bullish bias.

For the first time since it hit its all-time high of $73,570, Bitcoin [BTC] Open Interest has hit a new high. Specifically, the Open Interest was $37.66 billion, according to data from Glassnode. 
Open Interest (OI) is the value of outstanding contracts in the derivatives market. If the OI decreases, it means traders are increasingly closing their positions, and this could lead to a price decrease. 
However, an increase in OI like Bitcoin has done recently is a sign that new money is entering the market. If sustained, this could back BTC’s uptrend and lead to a higher price.
Source: Glassnode
BTC aims higher, backed by exchange flow
As of this writing, BTC changed hands at $71,200. This represented a 3.89% jump in the last seven days. With increasing interest in the token, there is a high chance that it could surpass its all-time high and possibly reach $80,000.
Despite the bullish prediction, it is important to look at the spot trading activity on exchanges as this could also affect the price action.
One of the ways to do this is by looking at the supply on exchanges and the supply out of it. In addition, the balance held by some of the top exchanges could give an idea.
For instance, AMBCrypto found that Binance and Coinbase’s historical balance was down, indicating that users were withdrawing their BTC from the platforms. However, Kraken recorded a surge in BTC purchases on the 30th of May before the recent decline.
It seemed that many holders were buying more coins on exchanges and withdrawing them for the long term. If this continues to be the case, Bitcoin might evade selling pressure, and the price could hit an all-time high before the end of June.
Source: Santiment
Traders continue to bet on a rally
On the other hand, the prediction could be invalidated if supply on exchanges begins to rise. This is because an increase in the supply would mean that investors are willing to book profits. If this happens, BTC might lose hold of $70,000.
However, traders seem not to share the viewpoint of price decrease. This was based on the Funding Rate data obtained from Coinglass. 
According to the derivatives information portal, Bitcoin’s Funding Rate was positive. If the reading of the metric is negative, it implies that shorts are paying longs a fee to keep their position open. 
In this instance, the broader sentiment is bearish.

However, the positive reading of the metric indicated that longs are dominant, and are expecting BTC’s price to increase. Should Bitcoin rise to $74,000 as it is being talked about, traders with long positions would be rewarded.
 This could also give way to $80,000 provided bears fail to nuke the uptrend.

It allows traders to treat each market as an isolated position with distinct risk parameters, rather than having all positions cross-margined against a single pool of collateral.“Traders have the ability to confine collateral to a specific position and manually adjust the collateral for that given position,” dYdX said in an announcement. “We believe this will allow users to more intuitively understand and adjust their collateral management.”The update includes price oracle integrations from Slinky and Raydium, a Solana-based limit order book DEX. The Slinky integration will enable block-by-block price updates with improved latency by leveraging dYdX’s validators, while the Raydium oracle provides price data on all assets traded on the Raydium exchange.V5 also introduces batch order cancellations allowing users to cancel up to 100 short-term orders simultaneously.The update will additionally introduce liquidity provider (LP) vaults providing automated LP strategies in the coming weeks.Season 5 incentivesDYdX’s v5 launch will likely coincide with the project’s fifth season of incentives for users. The campaign will offer $5 million in DYDX tokens to traders and will run until mid-July 2024, pending a governance vote.The season will also introduce a multiplier for DYDX stakers, enhanced points for front-end trading activity, and separate trading reward allocations for major markets including BTC, ETH, and SOL. Season 5 will also distribute $100 deposit bonuses to the first 500 new accounts that sign up.Migration from Ethereum to CosmosIn 2017, Antonio Juliano launched dYdX as an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.DYdX ranked among Ethereum’s top DeFi protocols for several years, with the project migrating to a dedicated Layer 2 appchain with the launch of its v3 iteration in April 2021. However, dYdX exited the Ethereum ecosystem to deploy a Cosmos-based appchain with the deployment of its fourth version in November 2023.The project attracted funding from top crypto investment firms including Paradigm, Polychain, and Andreessen Horowitz over four funding rounds.

dWallet Network brings multi-chain DeFi and gaming trust protocols to Aptos


    dWallet Network, a multi-chain technology pioneer, has announced its expansion to Aptos, a leading Layer-1 blockchain known for speed and security, as per the latest updates shared with Finbold on June 7. 



The integration aims to introduce Zero Trust Protocols (ZTPs) and seamless multi-chain interoperability to Aptos’ (APT) decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming ecosystems. 



By leveraging dWallet’s Zero Trust architecture, ZTPs on Aptos will be able to execute transactions on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other blockchains.







Effortless multi-chain Web3 interactions 



Aptos stands out for its high-throughput, low-latency blockchain utilizing the Move smart contract language to create a robust platform for building advanced applications with minimal gas fees. 



With the dWallet Network integration, developers will have the tools necessary to create ZTPs with decentralized, noncollusive dWallets, enabling effortless multi-chain interactions across Web3.



This development is particularly significant for DeFi projects on Aptos, as it allows for native BTC and ETH transactions. 



dWallet technology



Additionally, dWallet Network’s technology introduces a foundational building block that allows asset control and enforces logic across any network. 



dWallet-generated signatures are indistinguishable from a regular user signature, even on non-smart contract networks like Bitcoin.



Such capability facilitates the creation of ZTPs that operate across networks without bridging or wrapping, upholding the principles of decentralization.



2PC-MPC protocols



To implement the dWallet’s Zero Trust primitive, dWallet Network uses a cutting-edge threshold protocol called 2PC-MPC.



This protocol enables the generation of an ECDSA signature requiring participation from both the end-user and numerous validators, potentially numbering in the hundreds or thousands.



Professor Benny Pinkas, a researcher at Aptos, commented on the protocol, stating:




“The dWallet team led pioneering cryptography research to introduce the innovative 2PC-MPC protocol, enabling multi-chain Zero Trust. I’m excited about developers in the Aptos ecosystem being able to develop ZTPs that operate seamlessly across all of Web3 in a cryptographically secure way.”




Toward a richer blockchain experience



Omer Sadika, Co-Founder of dWallet Network, expressed his enthusiasm about the expansion to Aptos, stating:




“We are excited to bring our decentralized, noncollusive dWallet building block to the fast and secure Aptos blockchain to enable ZTPs. Doing so broadens horizons for DeFi and gaming protocols within the Aptos ecosystem, and represents a significant leap towards realizing our vision of a seamless, Zero Trust and multi-chain future.”




Bringing dWallet Network to Aptos marks a significant milestone, promising to enhance flexibility, security, and interoperability in multi-chain DeFi and gaming. 



This integration is poised to drive innovation and accelerate adoption, offering developers new opportunities and providing users with a richer blockchain experience.

Bitcoin's price has been pretty steady at around $70,000 for a while now, since mid-May. Despite this, the cryptocurrency's price has shown minimal movement, fluctuating within a narrow 6% range. This period of low volatility has frustrated market participants, particularly as Bitcoin's all-time high of $74,000 remains tantalizingly close yet seemingly out of reach.The lack of movement in the price has seriously annoyed traders and investors, and there has been a lot of talk about price manipulation. Adam Back, who is a contemporary of Bitcoin's mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto, addressed these concerns in a recent discussion. Back suggested that the current price suppression could be down to certain sellers who urgently need cash and are offloading their Bitcoin holdings. He said that these sellers, who might not be willing or able to wait for higher prices, have a limited amount of BTC to sell. Once they have sold all their holdings, the market might start to move up again, says the developer.  These comments match what a lot of people in the cryptocurrency community are feeling. Many think that things like institutional investors and trading platforms like ETFs and Coinbase might be influencing the market. The idea is that these entities, possibly in collaboration with official agencies, are trying to keep prices stable or suppressed for their own strategic advantage.When breakout?However, Back’s perspective offers a glimmer of hope in the current market conditions. The idea that current sellers' influence is temporary suggests that once their selling capacity is depleted, Bitcoin could resume its upward trajectory.BTC to USD by CoinMarketCapThis view lines up with how the price has moved historical, as there have often been periods of consolidation before big price surges.Summing up, while the current trading range and low volatility are testing the patience of market participants, Bitcoin's price could break free from its current stagnation, potentially reaching new highs once the immediate liquidity needs of these sellers are met.

Why Roaring Kitty 'Has Already Won,' According To Crypto Traders - GameStop (NYSE:GME) - Benzinga

Keith Gill and his massive bet on GameStop GME stock sparked a debate within the cryptocurrency community about its consequences and lessons for the crypto industry.What Happened: Roaring Kitty could become a billionaire on Friday if GME reaches $69 per share and many within the crypto space are celebrating Gill’s potential win.“Roaring Kitty has already won,” declared veteran trader TheFlowHorse.“After this is closed out, I think this whole performance goes down in history as one of the greatest of all time.” This sentiment resonates with the “David vs. Goliath” narrative often embraced by crypto investors, who see themselves challenging established financial institutions.Others highlighted key differences between the GME saga and the cryptocurrency market.Ludwig Wittgenstein observed that Roaring Kitty “waited years for his play, striking at the perfect moment in a career defining way.” That kind of patience, he writes, is not one of crypto investors’ strengths. They “can’t stand a ‘chop’ for more than three seconds, running from one narrative to the other.”This comment criticizes the perceived short-term focus and volatility within some crypto circles compared to Gill’s long-term strategy.Also Read: JPM - Benzinga">JPMorgan: US Crypto Regulations Signal Opposition To CBDCs And Non-Compliant StablecoinsWhy It Matters: The potential influx of new investors from the GME frenzy raises intriguing questions for the crypto space.Anthony Pompliano, investor at Pomp Investments, noted the potential crossover in his tweet: “This story will once again rip through the media and be covered everywhere. What becomes of those who step up, as they did last time? Do they come into our world, looking for that opportunity?”Cold Blooded Shiller explores this further, questioning if the success of meme stocks like GME could lead to increased interest in cryptocurrencies.“Can crypto capture some of the attention mindshare? Perhaps things like the GME memecoin on SOL… are also positives for the crypto story,” highlighting the potential for a “perfect storm” where retail investors, ignited by the GME story, might explore opportunities in crypto markets.Read Next: Is Robinhood’s Crypto Exchange Deal Really ‘Massive’ And The ‘First Domino To Fall?’Image: Shutterstock

Meme coin BabyDoge, a rival of the two largest meme cryptocurrencies by market capitalization size – Dogecoin and Shiba Inu – has reported through its official X account that it has scored a major new listing.BabyDoge goes live on ToobitIn light of this listing, the meme coin price went up by almost 4% today. However, a small decline pushed it back down and, as of this writing, BabyDoge is changing hands at $0.000000001927.BabyDoge has been listed on the Toobit crypto exchange – the 29th-ranked crypto trading platform, according to the CoinMarketCap scale. Currently, this exchange has a daily trading volume of $768,706,316 and more than 500,000 users around the world. Now, BabyDoge has boosted its exposure and liquidity across the former Soviet countries (CIS member states), Europe, Turkey, Vietnam, Japan, MENA and South Korea. According to a tweet published by Toobit about this listing, BabyDoge deposits opened on June 6. Spot trading kicked off today at 8:00 a.m. UTC, and withdrawals will become available on June 8.BabyDoge contract renounced on EthereumEarlier this week, the BabyDoge team announced that it had taken a major step toward decentralization. The team has decided through a community vote to renounce the BabyDoge token contracts on the BNB and Ethereum chains. This means that the team will no longer have control over token issuance on these networks and will be unable to add any changes to it, leaving it completely decentralized. The contract on Ethereum has been renounced already, and the team is still running technical checks to do the same on the BNB chain for BabyDoge. On May 30, the team officially made a proposal to the community to start deploying BabyDoge on the Solana chain “to enhance transaction speed, reduce fees, and increase interoperability.”

Sky Mavis says $5.7M recovered from $600M Ronin exploit - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Sky Mavis has recovered $5.7 million of funds stolen from Axie Infinity’s Ronin Bridge, according to a Friday announcement from the team.The recovery was achieved through the collaborative efforts of various entities, including the Økokrim, a Norwegian law enforcement agency, and the FBI, said Sky Mavis. Specifically, Økokrim successfully froze and returned $5.7 million stolen from the bridge hack.
“We’d like to publicly extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who assisted in the recovery efforts, especially Økokrim and the FBI in the US, for their tireless effort to track down and recover these assets for the Axie and Ronin communities,” the team stated.
Allocation of recovered fundsSky Mavis noted that approximately 15% of the recovered assets will cover recovery efforts, while the remaining 85% will go to the Axie Infinity treasury.According to the team, recovering stolen crypto requires collaboration between law enforcement, legal professionals, financial experts, and blockchain specialists, including Chainalysis.In addition to $5.7 million in recovered funds, law enforcement has frozen an additional $40 million in stolen assets. However, recovering these funds will take longer, with no definitive timeline provided for their return.On March 29, 2022, the Ronin network suffered a major security breach, resulting in a loss of 173,600 ETH and 25 million USDC, totaling about $600 million.Following the incident, Sky Mavis raised $150 million to reimburse users. In April 2022, Binance reported that the exchange had recovered $5.8 million of funds stolen in the Ronin Bridge attack.Sky Mavis has since enhanced security measures, including partnerships with new validators like Google Cloud.

In a recent interview, Ripple’s Middle East and Africa Managing Director Reece Merrick shared his personal take on the company’s plans to create and launch its native stablecoin.He also explained why he believes it will be a success, while such popular USD-backed stablecoins as USDT and USDC have already existed in the market for many years. The video extract was shared by XRP enthusiast @BankXRP.Ripple's activity in DubaiIn particular, Merrick spoke about the sector he is in charge of, and part of it is Dubai where, recently, the Crypto Expo Dubai 2024 event took place. The executive stated that Dubai now offers “forward-thinking regulation” and a major network for Ripple to continue exploiting this region, taking up the manifold opportunities it offers.Currently, according to Merrick, Ripple has been in this area for four years, working not only on fintech expansion but also increasing crypto and blockchain adoption in that region. During the talk, the Ripple Middle East director also answered a few questions about Ripple’s plans to release its own stablecoin and take some of the market share from USDT and USDC that has been actively used not only there but around the world in general already.Ripple stablecoin's key USPWhen asked about the approaching development and the launch of the stablecoin by Ripple, Reece Merrick admitted that this seems to be a logical step for the company. Currently, he pointed out, there is a $150 billion market of stablecoins, and its is predicted to reach a staggering $2.8-$3 trillion by 2028. Besides, there is also significant demand for more businesses, which are compliant and regulated, to enter this space.Ripple now, according to Merrick, believes that there is a great need for a regulated USD-backed stablecoin to emerge on the market since around 60% of all settlements outside the U.S., including the Middle East region, are made in U.S. dollars.As for the unique selling point of Ripple’s stablecoin, Merrick said that the company has spent 12 years building a cross-border offering. “We have the infrastructure. The stablecoin was the next evolution of that.”

Fake Elon Musk Live Stream During SpaceX Launch


                                Elon Musk's Deepfake Version Deceive The Viewers During SpaceX Launch                                Over 35 YouTube channels live-streamed deepfake versions of Elon Musk during the recent SpaceX Starship launch, aiming to deceive space enthusiasts and crypto investors. The streams featured an AI-generated voice of Musk, promising viewers doubled returns on their cryptocurrency deposits.What’s The StoryOver 35 YouTube Channels live-streamed in the name of Elon Musk during the SpaceX launch. These fake streams were identified by cybersecurity researchers at Avast Threat Labs during the fourth experimental flight of SpaceX’s massive reusable spacecraft known as the Starship.  The actual event, as seen on SpaceX’s live stream, depicted the rocket re-entering Earth’s atmosphere and splashing down in the Indian Ocean as intended. However, the scam streams gained a lot of traffic by mimicking the genuine SpaceX accounts and having 170,000 viewers, which is likely to be inflated by bots to increase authenticity.The fake live streams showed Musk at a SpaceX event, speaking to the audience, while some of the streams slightly pixelated Musk’s face to hide the deepfake. An AI-generated voice replicating Musk’s speech pattern, including his stammers and hesitations said to the viewers, “This is not fake, this is a real giveaway, I guarantee it to you.” The voice instructed the viewers to send Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Dogecoin to specific addresses and guaranteed double the amount back.The streams also contained the sound of a simulated audience clapping, which helped to make it more realistic. “You get a unique opportunity to watch your crypto soar multifold as our rocket soars into space,” the AI voice said. However, the streams seemed to be genuine, but the participants were being scammed.Nine wallets belonging to three different scammers have received almost $34,000 by the 6th of June. However, it is still unknown how many people lost their money to the scammers. The fact that these wallets still contain a large amount of money points to the fact that some of the viewers were indeed victims.After the exposure, YouTube removed the fraudulent streams. However, the scammers were able to re-establish the channel renamed it to the Cardano Foundation, and proceeded to use deep fake live streams of Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson.Previous Scams Using Elon Musk's Name In Crypto SpaceElon Musk, a billionaire businessman and owner of Platform X and companies like Tesla, SpaceX is also a vocal supporter of Cryptocurrencies. Recently, a Deepfake video of Elon Musk was made with AI endorsing Crypto Trading services in Hong Kong. According to reports, a fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange named Quantum AI released a Deepfake Video featuring Elon Musk. This AI-generated deep fake video falsely triggers Crypto Users by claiming genuine crypto trading services featuring Elon Musk. It is not a secret that scammers often use Elon Musk’s image because he is a supporter of cryptocurrencies, especially the Dogecoin. In April, the same Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk found the same fake SpaceX YouTube accounts that used AI-generated Musks to advertise a double-your-money scam during the solar eclipse visible in North America.There are many rumors surrounding the market in the name of Elon Musk. One of the News circulating about Elon Musk having a Connection with Pi Coin and that he will accept Pi Coin as a payment option. However, no official statement regarding this matter was provided on social media or elsewhere. Failure to receive an official statement from Pi Coin left room for potential scams exploiting Elon Musk's name in the crypto space.ConclusionCoinGabbar highlights that it's important for viewers to be cautious and skeptical about the content they watch. This kind of scam uses advanced technology to create convincing fake videos. As the deepfake technology develops, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the original stream and a fake one. The fake streams featuring Elon Musk were part of a scam to steal cryptocurrency from unsuspecting viewers. Despite being taken down, the scammers quickly shifted to a new target, showing how persistent and adaptable they are. Therefore, in such a situation be cautious and double-check information online, especially when it involves sending money or personal information.Also Read: The Truth Behind SpaceX and Cryptocurrency Rumors

Crypto Analyst Decodes China's Influence on Altcoins and Bitcoin


							

Dylan, the host of Crypto Banter, highlighted several altcoins with potential upsides.



He noted a significant influence of Chinese market activities on these tokens.



The analyst discussed the European Central Bank’s rate cuts and positive job data as potential bullish triggers.




Cryptocurrency analyst and Crypto Banter host Dylan recently highlighted a list of altcoins with potential upsides. In a video, he focused on tokens including Injective, Runes, Cosmos, Floki, and Bitcoin. He emphasized several positive market developments, noting a significant influence from Chinese market activities.



The analyst identified Injective as a notable performer, having risen 7%. Other tokens, like Bret and Memes on Base, also experienced positive movements. Moreover, Dylan reviewed the Rune tokens, providing insights based on their current chart trends.



Regarding Bitcoin (BTC), the analyst noted a relatively flat trend on V bubbles but remained optimistic due to ongoing favorable market developments. Dylan stated:




“Looking flat on V bubbles but I can tell you what? it’s feeling relatively bullish out there. So let’s just take a look at what exactly they are doing to us. Yeah, is BTC on the 4H hour, and uh, you know they’re just pushing higher? We are grinding,” 




Bitcoin is currently trading at $71,284, reflecting a modest intraday uptick of 0.19%. Dylan indicated the key support levels of $70,600 and $69,800 as potential buying opportunities. Additionally, he highlighted the $72,000 mark as a crucial resistance level to watch for a bullish breakout.



The analyst also covered current trades, including positions in tokens such as AVAC, BTC, Phantom, and a newly opened position in VET, driven by a perceived Chinese narrative influencing its price.









In market news, Dylan discussed Christine Lagarde’s announcement of European Central Bank (ECB) rate cuts and positive job data. According to the analyst, this could trigger bullish sentiments in the market.



Dylan further referenced the S&P 500 index, noting potential bullish divergence but advising caution against premature market shorting. Overall, the Crypto Banter host emphasized the importance of monitoring key support and resistance levels. He also urged investors to stay informed about market developments and remain adaptable in their trading strategies.

$500 Million in Bitcoin Open Interest Erased After US Jobs Report


The recent US jobs report has significantly impacted the cryptocurrency market, wiping out over $500 million in Bitcoin open interest. 
This drastic market movement comes after mixed signals from the latest employment data.
US Jobs Report Slashes Bitcoin Open Interest

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that May saw an increase in hiring by 272,000 in the establishment survey. However, the household survey indicated a drop in employment and a rise in unemployment, which climbed to 4.0% — the highest since January 2022. 
Average weekly hours remained steady at 34.3, which often aligns with a soft economy. Additionally, average hourly earnings rose by 0.4% in May, marking a 4.1% increase from a year earlier.
Private sector hiring averaged just over 200,000 new jobs per month over the last three to six months, a notable increase from the 155,000 jobs seen at the end of the previous year. The index of aggregate weekly payrolls for private-sector workers, which combines hiring, wages, and hours, was up 5.4% over the last 12 months. This is a decline from the 6%-6.5% range observed a year ago, bringing it closer to 2018’s highs for the 2009-2020 cycle.
Following the report’s release, Bitcoin’s price saw a 2% correction, dropping from $72,144 to $70,668. This sudden price movement triggered significant liquidations. 

“Over $500 million of Bitcoin open interest wiped out within minutes. Shorts and longs were liquidated,” IT Tech noted.

The job report’s mixed signals have caused significant market fluctuations. While an increase in hiring suggests economic strength, the rise in unemployment and steady weekly hours indicate underlying weaknesses. 

The reaction from the crypto market reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic indicators but could soon revert.

“Unemployment just hit the highest level since COVID, and markets whipsawed down. Often, the first move on these announcements is the wrong one. Time will tell. But it for sure looks like unemployment has bottomed now, which suggests US liquidity will need to rise and rise soon. Rate cuts incoming,” Charles Edwards, founder at Capriole Investments, commented.

Big Shorters Bet $6.9 Billion Against Pro-Bitcoin MicroStrategy, How Are They Faring? | Bitcoinist.com


								Big shorters have placed significant bets on Michael Saylor’s business intelligence and software firm, MicroStrategy, selling stocks worth approximately $6.9 billion. Despite the substantial short positions, MicroStrategy stocks (MSTR), have continued to rise, outperforming investor expectations. 
MicroStrategy Big Shorters Lose Confidence
MicroStrategy short sellers are currently losing confidence as the price of MSTR stocks has skyrocketed over the past six months. The software intelligence firm currently holds a staggering $6.9 billion in short positions, constituting 23.14% of its market capitalization of nearly $30 billion. 

Short selling is a trading strategy where investors speculate on a stock’s potential decline. These investors, typically called shorters, borrow shares and sell them in the hopes that they will fall and then buy them back again at a lower price to take profits. 
In the context of MicroStrategy, the company’s stocks have not witnessed a significant decline since the beginning of the year. To be precise, MSTR stocks have risen by approximately 190.08% over the past six months. 
Numerous institutions are still hoping for a decline in MSTR’s price to enable them to generate profits. The high stakes and substantial capital involved in shorting MicroStrategy could pose a risk to several investors if the price of the stock does not plummet. 
Moreover, the tripling of MSTR stock value from $570 in December to $1,656 has made current short positions incredibly expensive. If the company continues to record more gains in its stock prices, short sellers may be put in a precarious position, potentially forcing many to exit their trades early to avoid bigger losses. 
Fintel, a financial data and intelligence provider has revealed a big short list, outlining the largest short positions disclosed by institutions to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the data, MicroStrategy’s biggest net short position holds approximately $2.4 billion. 
MSTR’s big short position is also the 27th largest amongst other institutions. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust currently ranks first, holding more than $114 billion in net shorts. 
MicroStrategy Stock Price Update
Short sellers have not been the only investors making big bets, as MicroStrategy founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Michael Saylor has been making substantial wagers on Bitcoin for the past few years. 

Earlier in January 2024, Saylor revealed he was selling shares to buy more Bitcoin. This decision comes after numerous Bitcoin acquisitions, positioning MicroStrategy as the top Bitcoin holder amongst public companies, according to CoinGecko. As of May 1, 2024, the software firm owned a staggering 214,400 BTC, valued at $15.2 billion, and accounting for more than 1% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. 
Moreover, in one year, MSTR stocks have risen by more than 469.66%, fueling a price increase to $1,656.63, as of writing. Google Finance data has disclosed that the stock value is still appreciating. In the last five days, MSTR is up by 3.67% and 31.75% over the past month.

8 Trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 24 Hours: What's Happening?

Shiba Inu on-chain data shows a substantial surge of whale-tier transactions, with an almost 7% increase in the last 24 hours. The volume of transacted SHIB exceeded $8 trillion, making the network far more active than it was last week.Large transactions worth more than $100,000 have grown dramatically in number. There were 140 of these transactions in the previous day, suggesting a resurgence of interest and potentially calculated actions by significant investors, or whales. The seven-day low of 99 transactions is drastically different from this uptick, indicating a change in the dynamics of the market.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView It is possible that whales are stockpiling SHIB in preparation for future price changes. This might be a calculated move to acquire a sizable holding of the token while values are thought to be favorable.Large volume purchases may result from institutional investors growing interest as they start to recognize the potential in Shiba Inu.The increased activity may also be the result of announcements or impending Shiba Inu-related developments and Shibarium. This includes information on new initiatives, collaborations and technological advancements within the SHIB ecosystem.Elevated interest is usually indicated by an increase in large transactions and trading volume, which can cause notable price fluctuations. As can be seen from the technical analysis, Shiba Inu is currently consolidating around its major support levels. SHIB appears to be holding steady, according to the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, but the increase in transaction volume could force the token to test new resistance levels.In general, the lack of volatility is a bigger problem for SHIB right now and will most likely become a source of suppressed performance, rather than growth.

Bitcoin Spikes To $72K, Then Drops $1,300 Following US Employment Report: What Happened? - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD fell over $1,300 from $71,997 to $70,663 within minutes following the release of the latest U.S. employment report.What Happened: The report indicated that non-farm payrolls increased by 272,000, surpassing the expected 182,000.Additionally, the U.S. unemployment rate rose slightly to 4%, higher than the anticipated 3.9%, while average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, above the forecasted 0.3%.The data likely led traders to infer that rate cuts in September have become less likely, causing the market’s brief correction. Bitcoin has recovered to $71,400 at the time of writing.Institutional Investors Drive Bitcoin AccumulationAccording to CryptoQuant, new whale wallets on the Bitcoin network are adding around $1 billion in BTC daily.This trend suggests significant institutional investment, with Bitcoin being transferred to custodial wallets. Over the past 30 days, permanent holders have accumulated an additional 70,000 BTC, the largest increase since late April. Additionally, Bitcoin demand from large investors is growing at a rate of 4.4% per month, indicating strong market support.The demand recovery for Bitcoin is also evident from the increased purchases of Bitcoin from spot ETFs in the USA. Holdings in these ETFs have grown from 819,000 BTC on May 1 to 859,000 BTC currently. CryptoQuant noted, “The purchases of Bitcoin from ETFs have so far this year been a meaningful source of demand.”Moreover, the selling pressure from traders has significantly decreased. The unrealized profit ratio for traders has reset to 0%, suggesting that heavy selling has been exhausted. This reduction in selling pressure enhances Bitcoin's market stability, reducing the likelihood of abrupt price drops.Also Read: Ethereum ETF Demand May Be Muted Compared To Bitcoin ETFs, Analysts SayDespite the positive trends in Bitcoin accumulation, stablecoin liquidity has not recovered its growth trajectory. The market capitalization growth of Tether's USDT, a proxy for fresh liquidity in crypto markets, has decelerated. This slowdown in stablecoin liquidity growth could potentially hinder a sustained price rally in the short term.What’s Next: These insights into Bitcoin’s market dynamics and institutional involvement will be key topics at the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Industry leaders will discuss the evolving landscape of digital asset investments, the role of institutional investors, and the impact of regulatory developments on market trends.Read Next: Franklin Templeton Goes Beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum, Eyes New Crypto-Focused Investment Fund For Institutional InvestorsImage: Shutterstock

Telegram launches Stars: they can be exchanged for TON

Today the founder of Telegram, Pavel Durov, officially announced on his channel the launch of Stars: the stars received can then be converted into TON via Fragment. 

The Telegram Stars and the conversion to TON
Stars is a new Telegram service that allows in-app purchases on Android and iOS on mini-apps. 
The mini-apps of Telegram are internal bots that can be used within the official Telegram app without needing additional installations. 
The most famous is @wallet, the integrated crypto wallet of Telegram. 
The traditional apps, on the other hand, need to be downloaded and installed, and this is why Telegram’s mini-apps, such as Notcoin, are growing so rapidly. The social nature of Telegram allows mini-apps to spread virally. 
Through Telegram Stars, users will be able to make payments within the mini-apps.
In fact, the service allows mini-apps to accept payments for digital services on Android and iOS, using a very simple payment method, in-app purchases.
Once the Stars are received, the owners or managers of the mini-apps can then convert them into Toncoin (the native cryptocurrency of TON) using the Fragment platform. 
Alternatively, they can use them to further promote their mini-apps on Telegram itself, with preferential conditions. 
Durov also points out that Apple and Google receive a 30% commission when users purchase Stars from them, and states that developers who reinvest the Stars in promoting their app will have an overall commission of almost 0%.
Toncoin
Toncoin has now been steadily in the top 10 of the criptovalute with the highest market capitalization in the world for a few months.
In fact, only two days ago it recorded its highest historical price, above $7.7, with a capitalization rising above 18 billion dollars. Just to give an idea, ADA of Cardano is at 17 billion, while AVAX of Avalanche is at 14. It won’t be long before TON manages to surpass even Dogecoin, ninth overall with 23 billion, and perhaps even XRP with 29.
TON is a blockchain that was created several years ago as a Telegram ICO, but was later halted by the SEC, which accused the company of issuing an unregistered security. 
Subsequently, the blockchain was detached from Telegram and officially made decentralized, even though behind the project there is always Telegram itself. 
Recently the company has been heavily promoting TON, so much so that the price of Toncoin has risen by 220% since the beginning of the year. 
The cryptocurrency TON landed on the crypto markets in August 2021, in the midst of a bullrun. 
After rising to $4.5 in November of the same year, it plummeted below $1 during the following bear-market. 
As recently as August of last year, it was around $1.2, but starting in September, it began a climb that first took it above $2.5, and then even above $7 in 2024. 
In particular, the latest real surge began in February of this year, when news started to come out about a real promotional campaign organized by Telegram itself. 
Telegram
Telegram is the second messaging app in the world behind only WhatsApp. 
It is, however, very different compared to the rival, because by now it is a true platform with various services, as well as a simple messaging app. 
In particular, its openness to the crypto world, with the launch of Toncoin and the integrated wallet, is making it a unique point of reference in the crypto sector. 
Recently, the remarkable success of the mini-app Notcoin has made it evident how useful it is for this platform to attract crypto users, and how convenient it is to use blockchain and cryptocurrencies to do business in the digital realm. 
The same NOT token of Notcoin, which landed on the crypto markets only last month at 11 thousandths of a dollar, recorded the all-time high five days ago at 28 thousandths, and still now hovers around 21 thousandths. 
The introduction of Telegram Stars on mini-apps further expands the use cases of TON on Telegram, because it effectively allows those who receive the Stars to use the Toncoin blockchain to monetize them. 
The crypto choice of Telegram might not only give further momentum to the spread of cryptocurrencies, but it could also constitute a significant competitive advantage for the messaging app itself against the competition.

Wormhole Launches Staking and Governance For W Token Holders - The Defiant

Wormhole’s governance mechanism is the first live example of its multi-chain governance protocol, MultiGov.Wormhole, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, deployed a multi-chain staking and governance mechanism for holders of its recently launched token, W.Launched on June 6, the governance system allows W holders to create and vote on governance proposals across Solana, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. Tokenholders can move up to 100 million W tokens from Solana to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains to participate in governance daily.“Introducing stake for governance is a significant step toward decentralizing Wormhole,” Wormhole said. “This is your opportunity to participate in governance and influence the future direction of the Wormhole DAO and platform.”Users can participate in Wormhole’s delegated Proof of Stake governance model by staking their W tokens and designating their governance power to a governance delegate. Stakers are not forced to lock up their tokens and can unstake or restake at any time.Wormhole launched as a bridge enabling cross-chain transfers between Solana and other blockchains in 2021. On June 6, Wormhole handled approximately 188,800 cross-chain messages and $30 million worth of asset flows, according to WormholeScan.To date, Wormhole has processed more than 1 billion messages, $43 billion worth of cross-chain transfers, and supports 30 different blockchains.MultiGovWormhole’s multi-chain governance mechanism utilizes MultiGov, a new cross-chain governance mechanism leveraging Wormhole’s cross-chain interoperability protocol.“By allowing users to vote from whatever chain they are on you break down the barrier of high gas fees and the complexity/cost of moving funds, you [abstract] a lot of the complexity with chain-to-chain movement,” tweeted Robinson Burkey, the co-founder of Wormhole.Wormhole said any DAO on Solana, Ethereum, or EVM-compatible L2s can leverage MultiGov.Wormhole launched its W governance token in April. The project airdropped 6% of the token’s supply to more than 400,000 wallets.Last year, the protocol raised$225 million in token warrants at a $2.5 billion valuation in the largest crypto raise of 2023. The project notably suffered the second-largest DeFi exploit in February 2022 when it lost $320 million to hackers.The price of W is up 10% in the past 24 hours, last changing hands for $0.68, according to CoinGecko data. Daily trading volume also increased by 150%.Related: Wormhole's W Token Climbs to $2.5 Billion Market Cap Post Airdrop

Prison nears for Trump-supporting crypto promoters Bannon and Guo


Steve Bannon is finally going to prison, and Miles Guo is trying to get out of jail — although his trial isn’t going particularly well. The once-Donald-Trump-supporting crypto promoters might have hoped for a presidential pardon if Trump’s campaign for the 2024 US Presidency was successful. However, the pair find themselves increasingly estranged from Trump as he focuses elsewhere and, as a result, their hopes of a pardon look to be fading.
Any presidential pardon would have been the second for Bannon, who received a pardon in January 2021. Incredibly, Bannon has managed to fumble that once-in-a-lifetime clemency, and yesterday, a US District Judge ordered him to report to prison by July 1 for contempt of Congress.
Two years ago, 12 jurors convicted Bannon of refusing to provide documents and appear for a Congressional deposition. Nevertheless, the judge mercifully stayed his actual prison sentencing for those acts, pending appeals. Yesterday, however, the judge’s patience ran out. “I do not believe the original basis for my stay exists any longer,” the judge concluded.
Bannon was Trump’s White House chief strategist for half a year, then Trump fired him. Over the next few years, Bannon would go on to promote a series of failed crypto projects, including F*** Joe Biden (FJB), Himalaya Coin (HCOIN), Himalaya Dollar (HDO), and others.

Felon Steve Bannon supported Miles Guo’s crypto
One of Bannon’s favorite crypto founders was Miles Guo who used a variety of aliases: ‘Miles Kwok,’ ‘Brother Seven,’ ‘The Principal,’ or ‘Guo Wengui.’ Guo was the leader of the Himalaya-branded crypto project that Bannon promoted.
Unsurprisingly, like millions of other altcoins promoted by celebrities, Bannon’s and Guo’s tokens have collapsed to near-$0.
For his part, Guo is defending himself in his own criminal trial. US district judge Analisa Torres, who ruled somewhat favorably toward Ripple in its unrelated SEC lawsuit, is presiding over Guo’s billion-dollar criminal fraud trial.

Guo was a member of Mar-a-Lago and an ally of Trump republicans and once offered allegedly incriminating information about Hunter Biden’s laptop. He also fundraised for Trump’s ‘Million MAGA March’ and bankrolled a legal challenge to the 2020 election in Georgia.
On Thursday, Guo’s lead translator and confidante, Ya Li, cried on the witness stand while describing Guo’s sprawling, fraudulent crypto schemes. Lamenting her mistaken belief that Guo was helping investors make money or support legitimate political causes, she concluded, “the whole movement is a scam.”
Li’s final day of cross-examination continues today. The trial is led by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. Guo has been in jail for months awaiting trial and is widely expected to go to prison sometime after his trial concludes this month.

Hulk Hogan Memecoin Slammed in $17 Million Crypto Rug Smackdown


								The Wild West of cryptocurrency just witnessed another saloon brawl, this time courtesy of wrestling legend Hulk Hogan and his ill-fated meme coin, HULK. Hogan allegedly rug pulled his investors, wiping out millions in a digital bodyslam.





Hulk Hogan Crypto Crash – What Went Wrong?




The story goes like this: HULK tokens were riding high, with a market cap of $17 million, thanks in part to a social media blitz on Hogan’s accounts. Investors were giddy, primed for a moonshot.
Then, quicker than a leg drop off the top turnbuckle, Hogan’s posts promoting HULK vanished into thin air, taking the token’s value with them. HULK crashed faster than a folding steel chair, plummeting to a measly $11,000. Investors were left reeling, their dreams of financial bliss shattered like glass jaws in a steel cage match.
Hogan claims he never authorized the promotional posts in the first place. Was it a rogue social media manager channeling their inner “Hollywood Hogan?” A case of mistaken identity? The plot thickens faster than instant mashed potatoes.


Savvy crypto enthusiasts smelled a scam from the get-go. Incriminating evidence surfaced – recycled videos from December promoting a karaoke event, and a glaring lack of endorsement on the other platforms linked to Hulk Hogan. This wasn’t a strategic body slam, it was a piledriver onto investor trust.

Celebrity Memecoin Fallout




Hogan’s supposed rug pull isn’t an isolated incident; it’s the latest body blow in a string of celebrity-endorsed meme coin meltdowns. Just weeks ago, TV personality Caitlyn Jenner pulled a similar stunt with her Jenner coin, leaving fans feeling bamboozled. Boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather also entered the ring. After hyping the token “FLOYD” on social media, Mayweather abruptly deleted his promotional posts, sparking fears of another potential rug pull.
The only one seemingly immune to the takedown is Iggy Azalea, whose MOTHER coin is still being aggressively promoted to her millions of followers. But with the stench of celebrity shilling hanging heavy in the air, investors are right to be wary.

Buterin Slams Shady Memecoin Projects
This whole fiasco has drawn the ire of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who’s about as impressed with these memecoins as a referee is with a chair shot. He lambasted these projects for their lack of innovation and blatant attempts to exploit fans for a quick buck.


So, what’s the takeaway from this crypto cage match? If a celebrity is shilling a meme coin with promises of riches beyond your wildest dreams, approach it with the same skepticism you’d have towards a wrestler promising world peace.

Should Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders Worry About Whales' Actions?


The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has been struggling to note bullish cues for weeks, which could continue over the coming weeks.
This is because the little support SHIB noted from its investors is now disappearing.
Shiba Inu Investors Pull Back

Shiba Inu’s price is expected to note some drawdown or sideways action due to SHIB holders’ skepticism. Evidence of this is visible in the whales’ activity and retail investors’ actions. 
The former are the most important group of investors as their moves directly impact price. A positive move leads to a rise, a negative result in a decline, and at the moment, it seems the latter could be the outcome. 
The total volume of transactions worth more than $100,000, generally associated with whales, has taken a dive. At the moment, the daily transaction volume of whales has dipped to a low of $30 million.

This decline in transaction volume is also met with high selling from SHIB holders, intensifying the bearishness.
The realized profits on the network have spiked massively, reaching a three-month high. Spikes in this metric emerge from investors selling their holdings. This selling is either the result of profit-taking or investors offsetting their losses.
In the case of SHIB, it is the latter since investors are moving their assets to secure whatever gains they have amassed.

Shiba Inu’s price is bound to move sideways since the investors are not explicitly bullish at the moment. SHIB could likely remain consolidated within $0.00002584 and $0.00002267. The larger range would keep the meme coin moving within $0.00002835 and $0.00002093.
The aforementioned cues also raise the chances of a decline, potentially sending SHIB to $0.00002267 or $0.00002093.

If Shiba Inu’s price does manage to breach the resistance at $0.00002835, it could establish a two-month high. This is key in sending SHIB to $0.00003000 to invalidate the bearish thesis.

Andrew Tate buys 10,000 of this crypto, plans to 'crash Solana'


    The crypto community has been familiar with Andrew Tate for some time due to his general fondness of Bitcoin (BTC) – a fondness that led him to proclaim in May that he is done with fiat and is going all in on cryptocurrencies.



More recently, Tate has apparently taken to expanding his horizons when it comes to the crypto market, first predicting Ethereum (ETH) is set to hit $4,000 soon and has, by June 7, seemingly declared war on Solana (SOL).



Indeed, on June 7, the social media personality made an X post with the attached gif of the Muppets’ Elmo in front of a fire stating that he ‘will crash the Solana network.’











Near the same time, Tate announced he had purchased 10,000 of a Madonna-themed token with the explanation he had done so ‘because f*ck Madonna,’ using all capitalized letters, thus complementing his usual belligerent style.







Andrew Tate’s trading warpath



Shortly thereafter, the former kickboxing star made yet another post promising he would acquire more cryptocurrencies of dubious value and hold them ‘diamond hands’ should said post be shared more than 2,000 times.



By press time, the post was retweeted nearly 5,000 times.



Holding an asset ‘diamond hands’ refers to holding it indefinitely, no matter the circumstances. 



The term originated as a strong sign of support and belonging to a community during the original meme stock craze of late 2020 and early 2021, and Tate is, indeed, reportedly participating in the GameStop (NYSE: GME) short squeeze of 2024.



Can Andrew Tate really crash Solana?



Despite Andrew Tate’s bold claim and massive social media following, truly crashing the Solana network might prove a tall order. Indeed, the blockchain is known for its consistent uptime and scalability and has, so far, been handling significant volumes successfully.



That being said, Tate might find some success in his latest endeavor given that, while Solana has been able to maintain significant uptime, it has been known to crash at times.



The blockchain’s token has also been performing exceptionally well in 2024 and is up as much as 69.63% year-to-date (YTD).



SOL YTD price chart. Source: Finbold



The strong 2024 performance came at the heels of a late 2023 rally, which saw SOL rocket from about $20 in October to above $100 on New Year’s Day, and Solana price today, at press time, stands at $171.14.

Bitcoin Runes Dominate BTC Transactions


Bitcoin transactions continue to grow following the halving, with data showing that much of the recorded demand comes from the Runes protocol. 
Since its launch, Runes has recorded at least 150,000 daily transactions, dethroning BRC-20, which now struggles to achieve 10,000 transactions.
Runes Dethrone BRC-20 and Ordinals as Protocol Transactions Surge

On-chain data shows that the Runes token standard has effectively sidestepped BRC-20 and Ordinals. According to Dune Analytics, the number of transactions on Rune has averaged at least 150,000 per day since its debut on April 20. The highest it has ever been was 753,584 on April 23.
On average, the share of Bitcoin transactions on Runes protocol relative to BRC-20 and Ordinals is also higher for Runes, coming in at around 40%. This trajectory comes as Runes makes creating fungible tokens on Bitcoin more efficient, unlike BRC-20, which uses the Ordinals protocol.
BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals have been controversial in the past amid complaints that they clog up the network and cause fee increases. Relative to simple peer-to-peer transactions, it is complex to create and transfer BRC-20 tokens. At the very least, one would need more space on the blockchain.

Bitcoin Transactions, Source: Dune Analytics
Casey Rodarmor, BTC developer and the creator of Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes, discussed the protocol’s pros and cons in his last appearance on Hell Money Podcast.

“If Runes are successful, they’ll drain liquidity, technology, and attention away from other cryptocurrencies, and bring it back to Bitcoin. I’m not creating a shitcoin [but] a venue for people to create shitcoins, which is possibly worse and more dangerous. We’ll see,” he said.

The Game-Changers for Bitcoin’s Future
Runes, BRC-20, and Ordinals have enabled Bitcoin to evolve and become more than just a store of value. Now, it is a platform for creative expression and complex financial instruments. The three token standards have progressively developed atop each other’s strengths and weaknesses, each better than the next.
Runes launched on April 20, when the fourth BTC halving happened. It increases the efficiency of creating fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network:

Enables off-chain transactions, thereby reducing congestion on the Bitcoin network and therefore facilitates more transactions to be processed quickly and cost-effectively.
Faster confirmation times and lower fees for users, which increase accessibility and practicality of Bitcoin transactions for everyday use.


Read more: Bitcoin NFTs: Everything You Need To Know About Ordinals
The main similarity between BRC-20 and Runes is that both use Bitcoin and pay fees in BTC to create new tokens. BRC-20, launched in February 2023, was developed to create a standard for fungible tokens on Bitcoin. Its key highlights were affordability, speed, and increased accessibility relative to its forerunner, Ordinals. It also brought programmability, unlike Ordinals.
Ordinals launched in January 2023. Through Ordinals, Rodarmor enabled the creation of NFT-like “inscriptions” on the Bitcoin network. He described the Ordinals “theory” as a lens to view the Bitcoin blockchain and see the “trackable satoshis pop into view like Pokémon in the tall grass.” Its main challenge was high fees.

Social media analytics and investment tools confirm growing interest in Runes. According to Lunarcrush, BRC-20 has up to 37,169 interactions, while Ordinals has 34,299. Meanwhile, Runes has 53,008 at the time of writing.

Cardano Skyrockets Jaw-Dropping 180% in Volume: Bullish for ADA Price?

The trading volume of derivatives on Cardano (ADA) has shot up by a whopping 170% in just 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass. This surge has propelled perpetual futures on the Cardano token to over half a billion dollars in trading volume during the same period.At the same time, data from CoinMarketCap shows that there has been a 117.88% increase in ADA trading volume on spot markets across various exchanges, with a total of $554.9 million traded. When you combine both spot and derivatives markets, the total trading volume of the Cardano token has reached a remarkable $1.09 billion in the past day.This surge in trading activity comes at a time when the price of the Cardano token is also on the rise. Since the opening of the latest daily candle, ADA has seen a solid increase of over 6%, reaching $0.49 — a level unseen in the past 17 days. ADA to USD by CoinMarketCapIt is likely that the volume growth is due to the FOMO among market participants. Over the past few weeks, the price action of the Cardano token has severely depleted investors and traders with its low-volatility movement. Against this background, jokes even began to appear that ADA at $0.45 is a stablecoin. The unexpected pump of the Cardano price could, on the contrary, provoke the fear and greed of market participants who were left behind, and make them ape into Cardano. In any case, the growth in trading volumes signals increased interest and attention on the popular cryptocurrency, which means increased volatility and drama.

Telegram's The Open Network is 2024's Fastest Growing Chain - The Defiant

TON's ecosystem has succesfully leveraged the messaging app's millions of users. Despite gathering little attention throughout the bear market, Telegram-integrated blockchain, The Open Network (TON), is the fastest growing major Layer 1 chain in 2024.TON’s total value locked (TVL) has increased 27 times to $386 million from $14 million this year, outpacing all competing Layer 1s and Ethereum Layer 2s on a percentage basis. The network’s native token, Toncoin, has surged too, boasting the 5th largest year-to-date gain among the top 50 tokens per CoinMarketCap, displacing competing Layer 1 Cardano from the top 10.The Open Network’s rapid ascent began in February with the launch of its Open League incentives program. The network’s ad-sharing program and Tether partnership have also driven activity and token price. TON’s growth showcases how a web2 app can successfully be a foundation for a strong web3 ecosystem, especially with a pre-existing user base of over 900 million monthly active users (MAU), like Telegram has.TON TVL vs. Price - DeFiLlamaSEC ScrutinyOriginally founded in 2013 by Pavel and Nikolai Durov, Telegram is the 4th most popular messaging app in the world by MAU.Recently, in an interview with Tucker Carlson, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov stated: “We'll probably cross one billion monthly active users within a year now”.The official Telegram team launched its blockchain, TON, in 2018 but faced scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was forced to shut down operations.In 2021, the project restarted development under the stewardship of the TON Foundation, which operates adjacent to Telegram.TON of IncentivesBut it’s been the last few months when the ecosystem started taking off. Bootstrapped by its incentives program called the “Open League”, the TON foundation is providing a multi-season rollout of $TON incentives.The Open League will distribute over $150M in rewards across the course of the program, split amongst a variety of categories such as DeFi, NFT, Token, and App ecosystems.As of March, Telegram announced its ad-sharing program built on TON. Channel owners that qualify will receive 50% of the revenue that Telegram makes from ads displayed in the respective channels, and payment distributions and withdrawals are moved exclusively through the TON blockchain.Built on TelegramThe majority of TON”s infrastructure is built on top of the messaging app, Telegram, to leverage its existing user base. TON-native wallet solutions such as Tonkeeper can operate directly within the messaging app. Tonkeeper wallets are also available as a separate mobile app or as a web application, and is currently the number 1 ranked finance app on Google Play.Tonkeeper transactions are routed through a Telegram channel, similar to how other Telegram bots function. These wallets allow for self-custody, payments, transfers, and access to applications such as NFT marketplaces, but instead of interacting with an installed browser extension, like most other Layer 1 chains, the functions are hosted in Telegram.TON raised $250 million in a 2022 round including Mask Network, FJ Labs, and MEXC Venture. The network also has strategic support from firms such as Animoca Brands and OKX. Last month, Pantera Capital announced their investment into TON, citing it as their “largest investment ever”.Pantera partner Ryan Barney wrote in a May 8 letter, “By leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and seamless UX with the vibrancy of TON’s emerging ecosystem, we believe TON has the potential to become one of the largest crypto networks.”DeFi on TONStill in its infancy, TON’s on-chain economy is small compared to Toncoin’s market cap of $17 billion. While its TVL soared this year, competitors such as Sui boast 85% more assets held in smart contacts and more native dApps, despite being valued nearly 70% lower.A sizable amount of the on-chain activity on TON takes place on the chain's largest native decentralized exchange (DEX), STON.fi, which hosts 67% of the total TVL. Outside of STON.Fi, and TON’s leading liquid staking solution, Tonstakers, DeFi on The Open Network is limited to a few small lending and derivatives platforms.Asynchronous PaymentsTON runs an asynchronous payment channel via two interacting networks called shard chains, that finalize transactions independently, and then confirm their states to the payment channel’s smart contract.This is different from other network designs, including Solana’s and Ethereum’s, which have synchronous payments, where one cannot begin the next transaction in a contract without confirmation of the initial transaction.On TON, the execution of smart contract functions will take place in a future block as opposed to the block the transaction is confirmed in. This can help the network handle high volumes of complex smart contract interactions.Blockchain Comparison. Source: MezenTON’s developer community is small. Electric Capital cites 175 monthly active developers on TON as of Dec. 31, 2023, compared to Solana’s 1,615. Despite this, TON touts the second-highest two-year growth percentage in terms of active developers, surpassed only by Celestia.The Future of TONOne of the primary goals for 2024 will be cross-chain interoperability, by integrating compatibility with Ethereum token standard ERC-20 , a founding member of the TON Core Dev Team, known as Dr. Awesome Doge on social media, said at the Web3 Festival held in April.The developer also said the team is building bridge support for other blockchains, including Bitcoin and Solana.Meanwhile, the token continues to outperform. Toncoin was the 13th best performer out of the 100 biggest coins by market cap in the past seven days, according to CoinGecko.The Open League incentives program is still underway and preparing to begin its Season 4. Season 3 concluded on May 29, and the TON foundation is currently accepting and reviewing applications for the next season's participants.

Hotter-than-expected jobs report shows mixed bag, markets dip - Blockworks


The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, much higher than analysts’ expectation of 190,000 additions. 
Unemployment rose to 4% in May — also higher than expected — marking its highest point since January 2022, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed. 
American equities initially dipped on the news before paring losses slightly. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes were trading 0.2% and 0.3% lower, respectively, at time of publication. 
Bitcoin and ether similarly dipped in the hour following the report’s release. Bitcoin recovered to trade around 0.3% higher to $71,500 at time of publication while ether lost around 0.8% and was hovering around $3,800, according to data from Coinbase. 
Although the headline figure of 272,000 may suggest a labor market too hot for the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts in the fall, the report overall was still fairly hawkish, according to Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone. 
Average hourly earnings increased 0.4% month over month in May and 4.1% year over year, suggesting that the labor market is actually relatively tight, Brown said. 
“The May employment report seems unlikely to be a game-changer in terms of the Fed policy outlook,” Brown said. “[Federal Open Market Committee] members continue, unsurprisingly, to place greater weight on the inflation side of the dual mandate, and are likely to reiterate next week that they are yet to obtain the ‘confidence’ being sought on a return towards the 2% target to enable the first rate cut to be delivered.”
Rate cut expectations for September remained largely unchanged Friday after the report dropped. Fed fund futures showed a 52% chance that the first rate cut will come early this fall, about the same odds markets had earlier this week, according to data from CME Group. 
The Fed’s June FOMC meeting will begin Tuesday and central bankers will reveal their interest rate decision on Wednesday. Committee members will also report projections next week, including their target interest rate for December 2024 and predicted inflation figures. 
Ahead of the interest rate decision, markets will also get the latest Consumer Price Index figures, scheduled for Wednesday morning. The inflation figures will be a “much more significant event,” according to Brown, as central bankers will be looking to see core CPI declining on an annual basis.

Michael Saylor Changes Tone On Ethereum (ETH): Will Saylor Buy Ethereum ETFs? - Benzinga

Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, has been a strong proponent of Bitcoin, frequently discussing its benefits across various platforms. MicroStrategy owns more than 1% of the entire Bitcoin supply and Saylor's personal holdings. Despite his focus on Bitcoin, Saylor recently began speaking about Ethereum. Don't Miss:Saylor appeared on the "What Bitcoin Did" podcast at the end of May to discuss his views on Bitcoin and crypto. "Bitcoin was going to be the only asset securitized and offered as a spot ETF by the Wall Street establishment—and it was going to spread as the one legitimate crypto asset," Saylor noted. Saylor was alluding to the recent advancement of spot Ethereum ETFs to the next approval stage, which occurred just days before the interview. Although the outlook for approval was initially bleak for much of 2024, the SEC is now taking a closer look at each application. Speculation suggests that trading could begin by the end of the summer. The advancement of the Ethereum ETFs surprised everyone, including Saylor. Previously, Saylor believed that Bitcoin was the only crypto asset worthy of investment, with other cryptocurrencies merely imitating Bitcoin's success. However, the approval of the ETFs arguably legitimizes Ethereum in the eyes of institutional investors. Trending: If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.For years, Saylor has focused on Bitcoin's limited supply and its use of blockchain for transactions. However, during the interview, he acknowledged the advantages of Ethereum, noting that ‘digital art, NFTs, tokens,…DeFi' are all part of ‘an entire range of use cases' for crypto. Despite recognizing Ethereum's benefits, Saylor still believes Bitcoin will remain the leader in crypto. He noted that institutional investors might ‘allocate 5% or 10% to the crypto asset class, but Bitcoin will be 60% to 70% of that.' The Ethereum ETFs could attract new crypto investors who will also buy Bitcoin. This raises the question of whether Saylor will invest in the Ethereum ETFs. Based on his interview comments, his top crypto choice remains Bitcoin. While he acknowledges some benefits of Ethereum and other tokens, he believes these benefits will attract more people to Bitcoin. "I think that we are politically much more powerful [when] supported by the entire crypto industry," he said. Given this perspective, it seems unlikely that Saylor will make significant investments in Ethereum ETFs, though it is not entirely out of the question. Read Next:

Crypto Trader Michaël van de Poppe Outlines Top Altcoin Gems for This Cycle - Here Are His Picks - The Daily Hodl


								Closely followed crypto strategist and trader Michaël van de Poppe is naming his top altcoin picks for the current cycle.
In a new strategy video, Van de Poppe tells his 165,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin (BTC) investors are likely to start funneling their profits into altcoins, sending alt projects much higher.










“Altcoins are going to do really well. They are likely going to do that. They have been suffering a lot in the past period because of the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, but I think that the rotation is going to be very close towards an upside for altcoins.”
The trader says that he is now bullish on several newer altcoins.
“So the altcoins that I had in my portfolio are likely going to do well, but they will be outperformed by newer assets.”
Among his newer top alt picks is Renzo (REZ), a liquid re-staking token for EigenLayer.
“Seeing the price action that has been taking place, I rotated some of the altcoins that are relatively old like ATOM, like Curve in my portfolio and I swapped them for newer coins. One of those newer coins is some project that I started to tweet which is Renzo.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/YouTube
Renzo is trading for $0.172 at time of writing, up slightly in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the trader believes that Portal (PORTAL), a project that aims to unite games from different blockchains on its cross-chain token platform, has a lot of upside potential this cycle.
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/YouTube
Portal is trading for $0.97 at time of writing, down 3.5% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the trader says cross-chain messaging protocol Wormhole (W) could post big gains.

Wormhole is trading for $0.66 at time of writing, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours.

Kevin O'Leary Advocates For Strict Regulatory Compliance: Implications For Digital Assets - Benzinga

“Shark Tank” judge Kevin O’Leary, renowned for his candid opinions, has recently voiced strong views on the necessity of regulatory compliance for both Chinese companies and cryptocurrencies. His remarks reveal a consistent push for market integrity and the vital role of regulation in attracting institutional investors.In a recent appearance on FOX Business’s Claman Countdown, O’Leary stated, “I want EVERY Chinese company that doesn’t comply with US stock exchange rules to be DELISTED.” This firm stance underscores his broader belief that strict regulatory adherence is essential for maintaining market integrity. O’Leary’s call for delisting non-compliant Chinese companies is part of his larger advocacy for transparent and regulated markets, which he believes are crucial for investor confidence and market stability.Crypto Regulation, Institutional InvestmentAt Benzinga’s Crypto Unlocked event, O’Leary drew parallels between his stance on Chinese companies and the need for regulation in the cryptocurrency market. He emphasized that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies need institutional investment to reach their full potential. “I want to see Bitcoin at a hundred thousand dollars. It’s never going to get there if it’s never going to be owned by institutions,” he said. O’Leary highlighted that for Bitcoin to achieve such heights, a regulatory framework that eliminates fraud and encourages legitimate investment is essential. Just as with Chinese companies, he believes that cryptocurrencies can only gain the trust and investment of major financial institutions through strict regulatory compliance.Transitioning from Chaos to StabilityDescribing the current state of the cryptocurrency market as the “Wild West,” O’Leary stressed the necessity of moving towards a more regulated and stable environment. “We’ve got to open it up, and we’ve got to get rid of the role players and the fraudsters,” he added. This transition is crucial for attracting institutional investors and fostering substantial growth in the value of cryptocurrencies.The Future of Digital AssetsThese themes will be central to discussions at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event, scheduled for November 19 at Convene 225 Liberty Street, NYC. The event will gather industry leaders to explore the state and future of digital assets, offering attendees the chance to engage with experts, network with peers, and participate in executive roundtables.Since its launch in 2022, the conference has drawn thousands of participants. The 2024 event promises an enhanced agenda and impactful discussions on regulatory compliance and institutional investment.Market Integrity and Financial HealthO’Leary’s advocacy for strict compliance and elimination of non-compliant entities aims to foster a healthier market environment. His views align with the goals of Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event, making it a timely and relevant forum for stakeholders to discuss the future of digital assets and alternative investments.In conclusion, Kevin O’Leary’s recent comments on regulatory compliance underscore the steps needed to advance the digital asset market. The upcoming Benzinga event will delve into these critical topics, providing insights into the future trajectory of cryptocurrencies and the broader financial market.Image: By Ontario Chamber of Commerce via Flickr

50 Cent's Bitcoin Earnings: A Journey from 'Animal Ambition' To Millions - Benzinga

Ten years ago, Grammy-winning rapper 50 Cent made a groundbreaking decision to accept Bitcoin as payment for his album “Animal Ambition.” This move, which initially appeared experimental, has resulted in substantial financial gains for the artist over the past decade.In 2014, 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, opted to accept Bitcoin for his fifth album, accumulating around 700 Bitcoins. Bitcoin was priced at approximately $662 per unit at that time, bringing in about $460,000 from album sales.Bitcoin’s Rise in ValueFast-forward to 2024, and Bitcoin’s value has surged dramatically. According to data from Benzinga Pro, each Bitcoin is worth $68,973. This means that the Bitcoins collected by 50 Cent are now valued at an astonishing $48 million.Interestingly, while 50 Cent initially confirmed his Bitcoin holdings, he later denied owning any in a bankruptcy filing. This contradiction has sparked discussions about the volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market.Implications for Digital Assets50 Cent’s venture into Bitcoin underscores the potential of digital assets as stores of value. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has experienced substantial growth, increasing its value more than 100 times. Despite facing several bear market cycles, including a notable downturn after the FTX collapse, Bitcoin has consistently rebounded.The artist is not alone in the music industry when it comes to embracing cryptocurrency. Rapper Snoop Dogg has also publicly supported Bitcoin and discussed his holdings, further emphasizing the growing acceptance of digital currencies among mainstream figures.Future of Digital Assets ConferenceThis story aligns closely with the themes of the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets conference, set for Nov. 19 at Convene in New York City. The event promises to gather leaders in the digital asset space and offer insights into the evolving landscape of alternative investments.Since its inception in 2022, the conference has drawn thousands of participants, and this year’s edition is expected to continue that trend with an enhanced agenda. Attendees will have opportunities to network, engage in one-on-one meetings, and participate in executive roundtables.Broader ImpactsBitcoin’s increasing value and its adoption by high-profile figures like 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg highlight the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. This shift is not just a trend but a significant development in the financial world, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin’s performance this year, with a 61% increase year-to-date, reflects the growing institutional interest in digital assets. The upcoming Benzinga event will provide a platform for exploring these trends further and discussing the future trajectory of digital assets.Now Read: Bitcoin Spikes To $72K, Then Drops $1,300 Following US Employment Report: What Happened?Image: Shutterstock

Bitcoin Steady At $71,000 as Open Interest Swells to Nearly $39 Billion - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsDerivatives traders have taken a bullish stance on Bitcoin, as open interest in the leading cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $38.76 billion, according to derivatives analytics platform Coinglass.This change in Bitcoin’s open interest represents a 6.7% increase from its previous all-time high, which stood at 36.31 billion in March earlier this year. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed their second-highest net inflows for the year earlier this week.Notably, the cumulative net inflow in Bitcoin spot ETFs crossed the $15 billion mark and currently stands at $15.56 billion at the time of writing, according to data analytics platform Sosovalue.In a note shared with Decrypt, Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick have pointed out that institutional investors are flocking to buy Bitcoin spot ETFs.“The recent recovery in inflows started in mid-May which was right around the time 13F filings started to appear for end Q1 holdings of the BTC ETFs. They showed very strong and broad holdings data. For example, Blackrock’s IBIT had 414 reported holders including large banks, hedge funds, state pension funds etc.," he wrote in the note.Case in point: Medical technology firm Semler Scientific announced that it has purchased Bitcoin worth $17 million and that the firm plans on spending another $150 million on Bitcoin in the future.Standard Chartered analysts are expecting the price of Bitcoin to cross its all-time high by the end of the week if the U.S. payroll data is favorable. Further, they forecast that the price of Bitcoin will reach $80,000 by the end of the month, barring any negative surprise in the payroll data.The British banking heavyweight has reiterated that the price of Bitcoin will be positively affected if Donald Trump wins the upcoming U.S. presidential election.The note suggests that the price of Bitcoin could reach $100,000 as the elections begin and can surpass the $150,000 mark by the end of the year if Trump wins his second term as U.S. president. If Bitcoin does manage to surpass the $150,000 mark, it will enter the elite club of financial assets that have a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion. And if it manages to do that, it will be bigger than the entire $2.8 global market cap as it stands today.Last week, Donald Trump was convicted on all 34 charges in his hush money trial. He has become the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. But despite the guilty verdict, Trump’s campaign received donations amounting to $52.8 million within 24 hours, according to a report.Users on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, are speculating that Trump will likely win the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Trump’s odds are at 56%, while the incumbent U.S. president Joe Biden’s odds stood at 35% at the time of writing.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Steam ordered to give up ‘Crypto King’ login after $280K moved via CS2 skins


A judge has ordered the owners of video game marketplace Steam to freeze the accounts of Ontario’s self-proclaimed ‘Crypto King’ after he transferred over $500,000 CAD ($430,000) worth of assets across video game platforms during his bankruptcy.
On Thursday, Ontario’s Superior Court judge Justice Black approved the order two weeks after Aiden Pleterski was found trading and selling Counter-Strike skins, specifically high-value virtual knives, in March. He spent $382,000 CAD ($280,000) on a third-party skin trading site and $207,000 CAD ($151,000) on various other platforms. 
According to CTV News Toronto, the order requires Valve Corporation to share the login details of the ‘Crypto King’s’ Steam account with bankruptcy trust Grant Thornton. Both Valve and Pleterksi have rejected repeated requests from the trust for roughly a year.

On May 15, Pleterski was arrested and charged with money laundering and fraud by Ontario police. Pleterski owes investors $40 million CAD ($30 million) he promised he would invest in crypto. 
According to the bankruptcy trust, only 18.5% in investor funds has been recovered from Pleterski since bankruptcy proceedings started in 2022. Fraud recovery lawyer Norman Groot said, “It’s quite apparent that full recovery from their losses is not coming through the bankruptcy process.” 
Grant Thornton claims Pleterski has adopted a ‘catch me if you can’ approach. The 25-year-old has reportedly failed to hand over a $360,000 CAD ($260,000) luxury watch while financing his international traveling with undisclosed Scene+ points (a spend-and-earn reward program).

Indeed, Pleterski has been streaming himself as he travels across the world, playing with $206,000 CAD ($150,000) worth of Lego and driving McLarens and Lamborghinis. He also frequently gambled while livestreaming and at one point described himself as a professional streamer who’s “unemployed with income.”
At Thursday’s hearing, the trust also requested a two-year extension to his bankruptcy. The judge allowed Pleterki’s lawyer a month to respond to the extension request so long as Pleterski gives up his Binance and Steam logins while reframing from holding a credit card or soliciting investments.

Shiba Inu: What rising whale interest tells us about SHIB's future - AMBCrypto



Shiba Inu experienced significant whale activity, raising questions about future price volatility.
Despite increased transactions, overall network activity for SHIB showed a decline.

Shiba Inu [SHIB] has recently caught the attention of major investors, despite its current price dip. The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has reported a significant uptick in whale transactions for SHIB, hinting at possible major moves.
Whale watch: SHIB’s market stir
Despite a retracement of 2.3% decline over the past week, bringing SHIB to a trading price of $0.00002526, whale activity around this altcoin has intensified. 
Santiment’s recent analysis revealed that SHIB was among a few altcoins that experienced a surge in transactions valued at $100,000 or more, an indicator often associated with substantial investor moves. 
This “Whale Transaction Count” suggests that significant capital movers are actively trading or repositioning their stakes in SHIB.
Source: Santiment
Large-scale transactions like these are crucial as they imply that high-net-worth entities or ‘whales’ are taking notable positions in the coin, which could forecast upcoming volatility. 
However, it’s challenging to determine whether these moves are accumulative buys or preparatory sells as the data does not specify the nature of these transactions.
The activity level of these whales can serve as a barometer for the altcoin’s potential price movements. A continued high transaction count could lead to increased price fluctuations in the near term.
 Santiment’s report suggests that the current spike in whale transactions might be a sign of accumulation, where investors are possibly increasing their holdings in anticipation of future price increases.
Shiba Inu’s Active Addresses decline as Open Interest grows
However, not all indicators are bullish. The number of active SHIB addresses has seen a significant decrease, dropping from a peak of over 150,000 in March to below 30,000 currently.
 This decline in active addresses could indicate waning interest or reduced overall trading activity, potentially leading to downward pressure on prices.
Source: Santiment
Meanwhile, open interest in SHIB has seen a slight increase of 2.21% over the past 24 hours, reaching a valuation of $92.22 million. 
This rise in open interest, coupled with a decrease in trading volume, which has fallen by approximately 38.52% in the same period, suggests a cautious market sentiment towards SHIB.

Despite these mixed signals, the market is on high alert for any substantial moves.
 If whale activity continues to dominate, SHIB could see significant price shifts, either retracing to support levels around $0.0000207 or, if bullish sentiments prevail, pushing towards $0.0000294 according to AMBCrypto recent report.

Why Bitcoin Hasn't Hit $100,000 Despite Huge ETF Inflows


								Despite substantial inflows into US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), with more than $1.5 billion added in just the last three days and an unprecedented 18-day streak of positive inflows, BTC’s price remains well below the highly anticipated $100,000 mark. The digital currency trades at around $71,000, a 50% increase since the ETFs’ inception but short of setting a new record high.
Charles Edwards, CEO of Capriole Investments, shared insights via a post on X addressing the community’s burning question: “Why aren’t we at $100,000 yet?” According to Edwards, the answer lies in several key factors beyond just the ETF inflows.
Why The Bitcoin Price Isn’t Rallying Higher
Edwards points out that US spot ETFs have absorbed 200% of the BTC mined since their launch in mid-January, a stark indication of robust demand. Despite such aggressive accumulation, the price surge expected by many market observers hasn’t materialized.

“The inflow into Bitcoin ETFs represents a historically significant demand, yet we’re observing a counterbalance primarily due to long-term holder distribution,” Edwards explained. From an all-time high of 57% in December 2023, the share of BTC’s total supply held by long-term holders (those holding for 2+ years) has diminished to 54%. This shift translates to roughly 630,000 Bitcoins, about 300% of the year’s total BTC purchases by all US ETFs.
“This 3% shift, while seemingly minor, represents a substantial volume of Bitcoin moving from the strongest hands in the market to potentially more speculative or short-term oriented investors,” Edwards noted. Additionally, some of this selling is not pure market exit but rather transitions from older investment vehicles like Grayscale’s BTC Trust to newer ETF products, which may distort the perception of selling pressure.

Edwards also emphasized that the effects of the halving have yet to materialize. “With the daily Bitcoin issuance dropping by 50% in April, we will likely see the delta between ETF consumption and Bitcoin mined widen a lot over the next year. It also takes full quarters for institutions to review, sign-off and allocate (at best). So the major ETF flows are likely still ahead of us,” he stated.
Market timing and macroeconomic conditions further compound the situation. Edwards pointed out that June traditionally marks a lull in financial markets, including Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, as it aligns with a risk-off sentiment among major asset managers. “Moreover, since the March peak in Bitcoin’s price, USD liquidity has been relatively flat and even slightly negative. This liquidity environment is crucial as it influences investor capacity to inject capital into risk assets like Bitcoin.”
Looking ahead, Edwards remains optimistic but cautious. He outlined three catalysts that could drive Bitcoin’s price to $100,000 and beyond: “Increased daily buying volumes from ETFs, a decrease in selling from long-term holders, and a rejuvenation in US liquidity are essential for robust price appreciation. While these factors may align in the future, the exact timing remains uncertain.”
At press time, BTC traded at $71,659.

Celestia (TIA) Maintains Bullish Momentum - What's Next?


TIA is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, finding support at key technical levels despite facing resistance from the daily Ichimoku Cloud.
Let’s closely examine the price action of TIA, one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies over the past several months.
TIA Experiences Rejection by Daily Ichimoku Cloud
The price of Celestia (TIA) is showing rejection from the upper boundary of the daily Ichimoku Cloud.
The Ichimoku Cloud is acting as resistance, with the price struggling to break above it. Additionally, the 100 EMA (Blue line) at $12.03 is serving as a mid-term resistance level.
The price is currently hovering around $10.73, indicating it is struggling to break both the Ichimoku Cloud and the 200 EMA (in Green).

The current price level of $10.73 is below the 100 EMA, suggesting resistance at $12.03. A successful breakout above the 100 EMA could lead to the price testing the 200 EMA and potentially moving above the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a bullish momentum.

The price of TIA has recovered 46% from its local low of $7.30 set in mid-April, showcasing strong bullish momentum.

Despite the recovery, the price is struggling to break through the Ichimoku Cloud and the 4-hour 200 EMA, indicating significant resistance at these levels.
Support and Resistance Zones Highlighted by Volume Profile
The chart’s volume profile on the right side represents the trading volume at various price levels over a given period.
The areas around $10.50 and $12.00 show higher trading volumes. This suggests these levels are critical points where buyers and sellers have been most active, providing strong support and resistance.
TIA Volume Profile (1D). Source: TradingView
The gaps or lighter areas in the volume profile indicate less trading activity, which, due to lower liquidity, often leads to faster price movements through these levels.
Volume Profile Shows TIA Approaching Low Liquidity Zone
The 4-hour chart indicates a bullish sentiment in the mid-term, with the price finding strong support at the lower boundary of the 4H Ichimoku Cloud. 
TIA is currently heading towards the upper boundary of the 4H cloud. However, significant resistance levels are expected at the daily EMA lines depicted in the 1-day chart.

The 4-hour chart indicates a bullish sentiment in the mid-term, with the price finding strong support at the lower boundary of the cloud. 

The 4H EMAs are anchored at the lower boundary of the Ichimoku Cloud, providing crucial support levels. It could signal an imminent price drop if the price breaks below these EMAs. Traders should place stop losses wisely below these levels, considering their leverage to manage risk effectively
Volume Profile Indicates TIA Nearing Low Liquidity Zone
The uncolored areas in the volume profile indicate regions with high trading volume. These are critical levels where significant buying and selling have occurred, making them strong support and resistance zones.

$10.40 – $10.60: This range has witnessed substantial trading activity, suggesting it is a significant support zone. The price recently rebounded from this area, reinforcing its importance.
$11.00 – $11.20: Another high volume area that the price is currently approaching. This zone is likely to act as a formidable resistance level.
The price is approaching a critical zone that could be easily broken due to its low liquidity. The $10.90 to $11.00 range is a crucial area to monitor. 

Read More: Top 10 Aspiring Crypto Coins for 2024
A breakout from this zone is likely to propel the price towards exiting the 4-hour Ichimoku Cloud or at least testing its upper boundary.
Strategic Recommendations
The price of Celestia (TIA) faces rejection from the upper boundary of the daily Ichimoku Cloud, indicating resistance. If Bitcoin reaches an all-time high in the mid-term, the upward movement is expected to continue rising to $11.50.

The 100 EMA at $12.03 is also serving as a mid-term resistance level. 
The 4-hour chart indicates a bullish sentiment in the mid-term, with the price finding strong support at the lower boundary of the 4-hour Ichimoku Cloud and the 4-hour EMAs. 
TIA is heading towards the cloud’s upper boundary, but significant resistance is expected at the daily EMA lines. 
Consider placing stop losses just below the 4H EMAs to manage risk effectively. This is particularly important if the price breaks below these EMAs, as it could signal an imminent price drop.

XRP Price Goes $3? Record Increase in Millionaire Addresses Hints at Unexpected XRP Explosion ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
According to data from the cryptocurrency data analytics platform Santiment, the number of addresses holding at least one million XRP has reached a new all-time high. This surge often precedes significant price gains for the coin.



According to Santiment’s data, XRP has recently experienced a strong upsurge, pushing it to seek a high of $0.57. But what stands out most is that the so-called “millionaire addresses” of XRP have continued to hit new record highs of over 2,013. This is one address less than the previous record of 2,014 recorded in June 2023, following a major victory by Ripple against the SEC in its legal battle to prove that XRP is not a security.



Is a new bullish rally approaching for XRP?



Historically, when similar peaks occur in the number of millionaire XRP holders, Ripple’s native coin has seen significant price increases. Last June, after reaching its all-time high of millionaire addresses, the price of XRP almost doubled in a month, rising from $0.45 to nearly $1. However, it has not managed to retest those highs since then.



The renewed enthusiasm of large investors for XRP may be due to the recent announcements made by Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, who publicly voiced objections to the SEC’s request to impose fines of $2 billion on Ripple for historic institutional sales of its cryptocurrency XRP.



Alderoty argues that regulators’ request for millions in sanctions is disproportionate since the case did not involve allegations or findings of reckless or fraudulent conduct by Ripple. Furthermore, the company achieved several significant victories in some of the key litigation issues.

&nbsp



Therefore, Alderoty believes that the SEC’s request for an exorbitant fine is another example of its intimidation campaign against the cryptocurrency sector in the United States. Meanwhile, the lawyer noted that Ripple maintains confidence that the judge overseeing the case will address this final phase of sanctions and remedies fairly and impartially without being swayed by the SEC’s excessive demands.



Although an exact date for the conclusion of the SEC’s case against Ripple is not yet known, crypto investors continue to closely monitor the outcome of this case, as its conclusion will likely trigger a series of significant events around XRP and the crypto industry in general.



Thus, while the increase in millionaire addresses is often interpreted as a significant bullish signal indicating that large investors and whales are accumulating XRP in anticipation of an imminent rally, everyone is eagerly awaiting the outcome of the case against Ripple for a clearer vision of where the cryptocurrency is heading.



At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.524 after rising by 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Could this be the start of the bullish rally Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse predicted as XRP sets its course to $3?

Keith ‘RoaringKitty’ Gill Could Reach Billionaire States if $GME Rises to $67 | Cryptoglobe


                                
Keith Gill, known on X as RoaringKitty and DFV on Reddit, could become a billionaire through his bet on the popular meme stock GameStop (GME) if the price of the firm’s shares hit $67.5, given his massive position.



According to a recent report by the Kobeissi Letter, GME’s price surged to an impressive $67.5 during Thursday’s after-hours trading session and given Gill’s substantial holdings, which include both shares and options, he would have over $1 billion in his position if the market opened with the shares at that value.



Per the shared data, if GME were to open above $67.5 his share position would be worth around $325 million, while his options would be worth around $700 million, and combined both would make him a billionaire and lead to an $850 million gain on his position.







The trading session, however, saw the price of GME plunge with data showing shares are now trading at $37. As reported, Gill’s position is so large that at one pointed it surged by over $78 million in a single day.



On Reddit, RoaringKitty shared that he owns 5 million GME shares and 120,000 $20 call options which he has been accumulating over time.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

It’s worth noting that the recent meme stock trading frenzy started after RoaringKitty returned to social media from a three-year hiatus that ended after his testimony in Congress.



RoaringKitty’s current portfolio, according to his latest updates on Reddit, is at around $586 million.







AMC Entertainment (NYSE; AMC), a movie theater chain, also experienced a significant uplift, as did various lesser-known cryptocurrencies associated with Roaring Kitty and GameStop.



Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has assured investors that the trading platform is well-prepared for the anticipated GameStop frenzy, emphasizing significant infrastructure improvements made to handle such market volatility while speaking on Fox Business.



Notably the trading platform Gill has been using, E*Trade, is reportedly considering banning the trader over potential stock manipulation according to the Wall Street Journal.

Franklin Templeton Altcoins Fund Sparks Crypto Portfolio Changes


Franklin Templeton, managing approximately $1.64 trillion in assets, is reportedly exploring the launch of a private fund for institutional investors focused on altcoins. 
This move signals a strategic expansion beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. It reflects the growing interest in diversified crypto assets among institutional investors.
Franklin Templeton Eyes Altcoin Fund
A recent report reveals that Franklin Templeton aims to provide institutional investors with exposure to altcoins through a new fund. The initiative also offers staking rewards, potentially enhancing the appeal of altcoin investments. 

While specific altcoins were not disclosed, Franklin Templeton has praised Solana’s significant growth. 

“On Solana, we see Anatoly’s vision of a single atomic state machine as a powerful use case of decentralized blockchains, lowering information asymmetry. And we are impressed by all the activity seen on Solana in Q4 2023: DePIN, DeFi, Meme Coins, NFTs, Firedancer,” Franklin Templeton said. 

Moreover, Messari reported Solana’s spot decentralized exchange volume surged by 319% to $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2024.

“Network activity, measured by non-vote transactions and fee payers, continued to rise in Q1. Average daily fee payers increased by 214% QoQ to 597,000, reaching a peak of over 2 million on March 17. The growth in addresses was largely driven by memecoin trading. Average daily non-vote transactions increased by 71% QoQ to 70 million,” analysts at Messari wrote.

Franklin Templeton’s involvement in the crypto market is already substantial, with notable projects including a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched in January. The firm also advocates for a spot Ethereum ETF, which is currently pending approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

This ongoing engagement with major altcoins underlines Franklin Templeton’s commitment to broadening its crypto asset portfolio.

“We are excited about ETH and its ecosystem. Despite the midlife crisis it’s recently experienced, we see a bright future with many strong tailwinds to push the Ethereum ecosystem forward,” Franklin Templeton wrote.

This potential move by Franklin Templeton sends a clear message to crypto analysts and investors. For instance, analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently adjusted his crypto portfolio to focus more on altcoins, anticipating higher returns. 
Michaël van de Poppe’s Portfolio Reshuffle
Van de Poppe cited the increasing interest in the Bitcoin ETF and the expected approval of the Ethereum ETF as significant market movers. He also emphasized the importance of crypto portfolio management in maximizing returns. 
As a result, he decided to drop Cosmos (ATOM) due to its recent underperformance. Despite a significant correction of up to 50%, it did not meet his expectations for recovery and growth. 
Another altcoin removed from his portfolio, Curve (CRV), experienced a swift run of approximately 130% from January to March, only to fall back significantly. Finally, despite being fundamentally strong, Polygon’s (MATIC) persistent underperformance led Van de Poppe to exclude it from his portfolio. 


“I just see less arguments of having them in my portfolio as they are underperforming heavily. I want to be positioned into coins that do not have these back holders and are a solution for a problem that we have been getting into the previous cycle and are likely to have a higher return,” Van de Poppe explained.

After seeing a listing correction and subsequent rise close to 8x against Bitcoin, Van de Poppe views Sei (SEI) as a promising investment. He expects it to rebound strongly, especially given the current momentum in the Ethereum ecosystem.
A newer addition focused on gaming, Portal (PORTAL), has experienced a significant drop but shows potential for high returns. With a fully diluted valuation of $1 billion, it aligns with Van de Poppe’s strategy of targeting promising new listings. Similarly, Wormhole (W) is another new addition to his portfolio and is expected to perform well due to recent favorable market narratives and Binance listings.

Despite the rising interest in altcoins, the broader crypto market has seen substantial shifts. 
Customers Bank, servicing major firms like Galaxy Digital, Coinbase, and Circle, has reportedly told some altcoin hedge-fund clients that it can no longer provide banking services. This comes after the collapse of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank last year, reflecting the ongoing challenges faced by crypto companies in accessing traditional banking systems

Dogecoin (DOGE) Sees Epic Surge of $1 Million Transactions, What's Going On?

Dogecoin (DOGE), the eighth-largest cryptocurrency, is experiencing a significant uptick in whale activity. In the past day, a significant surge in $1 million transactions has been seen.The recent increase in such transactions for Dogecoin suggests that large holders are either accumulating more DOGE or moving substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency for other strategic purposes.Data from blockchain analytics platforms show that these high-value transactions numbering over 150, involving amounts of over $1 million, have been reported in the last 24 hours. According to crypto analyst Ali, who cited Santiment data, "Dogecoin whale activity is on the rise. Over 150 DOGE transactions, each exceeding $1 million, have been recorded in the past 24 hours."Increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, could be contributing to the rise in large transactions. Institutions entering the market often do so with substantial capital, leading to large transaction volumes.Whales might be positioning themselves for anticipated price movements, either upward or downward, based on market analysis or news.Dogecoin price actionAt the time of writing, Dogecoin was down 1.38% in the last 24 hours to $0.161. Dogecoin has remained above the 50-day SMA of $0.1547 since late May, indicating strong demand near this level.If this trend continues, Dogecoin may surpass the short-term barrier of $0.174, which is a crucial mark to monitor. If buyers break through this barrier, Dogecoin might rise to $0.21, and then to $0.23.Conversely, if the price falls from the present level or the daily SMA 50, it may induce short-term selling. A breach below the 50-day SMA might reverse the short-term trend, sending Dogecoin to $0.14.

Robinhood’s Bitstamp acquisition could open the door for institutional clients - Blockworks


Robinhood announced on Thursday that it entered into an agreement to acquire Bitstamp.
As part of the deal, Robinhood would pay $200 million in cash and it gets the bonus of an international expansion. The deal won’t close until the first half of 2025.
There are two aspects to look at when combing through this deal and what it means for the publicly traded Robinhood. 
While the announcement buoyed shares, which jumped on the news, analysts such as JMP’s Devin Ryan didn’t boost their price targets or weighting on the stock. 
Ryan’s team reiterated a $30 price target and its outperform rating on the stock. 
“We believe owning the exchange will provide opportunities for the firm to more deeply connect into the ecosystem (e.g., trading, staking, tokenization, payments, remittance, wallet integration), and perhaps over the longer term play an even bigger role in the tokenization of assets and securities, which we believe could be quite interesting. We also see opportunities to drive more activity and better economics with existing Robinhood retail customers through the exchange,” the analysts wrote. 
Robinhood rolled out Solana staking in the EU earlier this year after making its European Union debut just last December. In February, the firm teased that it plans to focus on building out that customer base.

But Ryan’s team thinks that HOOD could open its doors to more institutional clients with the acquisition as well. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitstamp is ranked 16th on top crypto spot exchanges.
The company said it plans to onboard the Bitstamp team, and this means that it won’t have to pursue its own licenses in various jurisdictions. 
“Through this strategic combination, we are better positioned to expand our footprint outside of the US and welcome institutional customers to Robinhood,” said Johann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Crypto. 
But it’s going to take some time for these benefits to be realized financially. JMP wrote that it estimates revenues to be in the “ballpark of $100 [million]” and that’s based on “trailing 12-month volumes of $70 billion.”
Now there are other concerns, which we covered in the Empire newsletter Thursday morning. 
First is the potential lawsuit that Robinhood faces on US soil. 
In the last couple of months, the Securities and Exchange Commission served Robinhood, Uniswap and Consensys with Wells notices. Based on the Coinbase timeline from last year, if the SEC pursues a lawsuit against any of the three, we’re likely to see it filed this summer. 
Despite trying to fly under the radar, Robinhood couldn’t avoid the SEC’s ire. Last year, the company even delisted tokens after the regulatory agency listed them as securities in suits against Binance and Coinbase.

AI used for crypto crimes on the rise, Elliptic warns

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used to commit crimes in the crypto asset ecosystem, according to a new report from Elliptic.AI-crypto crimesThe report noted that criminals increasingly relied on Generative AI to create deepfakes and other deceptive materials to promote crypto scams.According to the firm:“Doctored videos – or ‘deepfakes’ – of notable individuals promoting investment scams have targeted the likenesses of Elon Musk, former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and both the 7th and 8th Presidents of Taiwan Tsai Ingwen and Lai Ching-te. Promotional deepfakes are often posted across sites such as YouTube, Tiktok and [social media platform] X.”These deepfakes usually lure unsuspecting individuals to invest in scam projects that could result in funds theft.Furthermore, there has been a notable rise in AI-related scam tokens, investment platforms, Ponzi schemes, and fake trading bots. Elliptic noted that scammers often use trendy technology and buzzwords to create tokens or investment schemes, culminating in exit scams. It added:“Beyond the creation of tokens, scammers have used AI as a means of driving up hype in fraudulent investment platforms. In particular, scammers have sought to capitalize on the potential of AI to enhance trading or arbitrage capabilities.”AI-related crypto buzzwords. (Source: Elliptic)One notable incident involved a fake AI trading bot scam called iEarn in 2023, which resulted in approximately $6 million in losses. Notably, this surge in AI trading bots prompted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to issue a warning in January.Elliptic’s report highlighted that criminals were also using large language model (LLM) AI programs to identify vulnerabilities in project codes. This finding aligns with a recent report by Microsoft and OpenAI, which indicates that cybercriminals increasingly use LLMs to enhance their operations.Moreover, AI technology is being adopted to facilitate large-scale crypto scams and disinformation campaigns. Elliptic stated:“AI can be used to accelerate and upscale this [disinformation] process by auto-generating social media posts and coding the necessary underlying infrastructure to distribute them effectively.”Despite these growing threats, Elliptic believes AI technology is still in its infancy and offers numerous benefits. Mitigating these threats requires the collaborative efforts of all stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies, crypto compliance professionals, and AI users.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Renowned entrepreneur and Bitcoin investor Lark Davies gave an exciting prediction regarding an imminent bullish run for the leading cryptocurrency. The forecast comes amid a broader crypto market rally, which saw Bitcoin (BTC) rising to over $71,000.Here's why bull run is possible Davies highlighted several factors that could propel the crypto market to reach a bull run soon. Chief among them is the increased inflows amassed from the adoption of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the U.S.Within the last 18 days, Davies disclosed that the ETFs purchased 56,150 BTC. This translates to over a four-month supply of BTC. In addition, the renowned investor believes Ethereum’s potential spot ETF launch will have a substantial influence on the market. “Ethereum ETFs are about to start trading soon,” Davies opined.Furthermore, Davies added that the continuous accumulation of Bitcoin from institutions like MicroStrategy, Block and Semler Scientific could also influence Bitcoin's future movement. “Institutions, wealth managers, and pension funds worldwide are lining up to own a piece of the Bitcoin pie. This bull run is going to be way crazier than you think,” Davies concluded.At press time, BTC is trading at $71,456, representing an increase of 0.27% in the last 24 hours. Trading volume increased by 14.5% to over $30 billion.Mixed sentiment on spot ETH ETF approval There appears to be mixed sentiment regarding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. Jan van Eck, VanEck's CEO, says the approval of spot Ethereum ETF has marked a historic shift. As previously reported by U.Today, the firm is among other applicants that have received approvals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In a contrary opinion, renowned banking giant JPMorgan claims the Ethereum ETFs could attract a much lower share of inflows than expected when it finally begins trading. The banking institution forecasts inflows of $3 billion for the ETH products this year. Nonetheless, the bank says this amount could double if staking is permitted.

Famous Analyst Markus Thielen Said Bitcoin Could Reach $83,000 and Pointed to This Date! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to a bullish forecast by 10x Research, Bitcoin (BTC) may be preparing for a significant rally that could reach $83,000 in the coming days.
Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Could Rise to $83 Thousand
Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, suggests that Bitcoin is on the verge of completing a major bullish price formation on the daily chart.


A breakout above $72,000 would confirm a breakout from the inverted head and shoulders pattern, which is characterized by three price troughs, with the deepest in the middle.
This pattern typically indicates a downtrend reversal and signals an uptrend following a breakout.






“It's only a matter of time before Bitcoin reaches an all-time high. The head and shoulders pattern indicates an imminent rally towards $83,000, with the resistance line breaking over the next few days. The ideal time to break this resistance is either today, Friday, June 7, or on Friday, June 7th,” Thielen said. “It is next week, Wednesday, June 12,” he said.


The bullish outlook comes ahead of critical US economic data that could impact expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut.
Economists polled by Bloomberg estimate the economy added 180,000 jobs in May, nearly matching April's gain of 175,000.


While the unemployment rate is expected to remain at 3.9%, the median forecast for average hourly earnings is for a 0.3% increase from April, leading to a 12-month wage increase of 3.9% for the second month in a row.
Weak economic data could strengthen the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut, increasing upward momentum in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.





Some investment banks predict that the central bank may renew liquidity expansion with an interest rate cut in July.

In the first full month after halving, who mined the most BTC? - Blockworks


It was no secret that miners would see their BTC production numbers decline in the first full month after the Bitcoin halving.
After all, that is the reality of the event that occurred on April 19. Per-block mining rewards were systematically slashed from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.
But some companies saw bigger drops in BTC production than others, with one in particular appearing to win the month (in this category, at least). 
Bitcoin mining giant Marathon Digital mined 616 BTC in May, leading its biggest publicly traded competitors. 
The company actually saw a 32% month-over-month increase in the number of blocks won, CEO Fred Thiel said in a statement. This meant Marathon’s May BTC production declined just 27% — from 850 BTC in April. 
Others saw more substantial decreases in the 40-plus percent range. 
Core Scientific had a month-over-month drop of 44% — from 803 BTC in April to 447 BTC in May.
The company — like other miners — has signaled its future focus on supporting high-performance computing (HPC) services to help combat the lower mining rewards.   
Core Scientific is dedicating 200 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure to that cause via a 12-year deal with CoreWeave, a cloud provider that then proposed to buy the bitcoin miner. Core Scientific rejected that bid. 
Core Scientific is seeking out other clients for an additional 300 MW or so of capacity slated for HPC uses, CEO Adam Sullivan told Blockworks.
“Our new HPC contracts transform and expand our hosting business and earnings power with stable, predictable, high-margin and long-term revenue that will provide balance to our bitcoin mining business and the more volatile nature of bitcoin pricing,” he added.

CleanSpark mined 417 BTC last month, down 42% from 721 BTC the month prior.
The company had said it intends to be one of the most active acquirers in the industry post-halving. It agreed to buy 75 MW worth of mining sites in Wyoming for $18.75 million last month.
“As we continue to grow our hash rate, we are on a trajectory to rapidly recover our production to pre-halving levels,” CEO Zach Bradford noted. 
Australian miner Iris Energy’s bitcoin production in May was 230 BTC — 36% less than the month before.
Meanwhile, Riot Platforms mined 215 bitcoins in May, down 43% from 375 BTC in April.
The Texas-based miner did however collect $7.3 million worth of power and demand response credits during the month. The company is among those with the option to sell their rights to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to balance the grid by reducing their energy consumption. 
Riot CEO Jason Les previously told Blockworks that Riot would have more windows to curtail power in a declining hash price environment. 
“We view our contracts as being a hedge against declining mining break-evens after halving because of our ability to sell power anytime the price of power exceeds mining break-even amounts,” Les added.
Bitfarms, the company that Riot recently tried to acquire, mined 156 BTC last month — down 42% from April. 
Terawulf’s BTC production dropped 44% month over month to 186 BTC in May.
Singapore-based Bitdeer saw less of a drop than most other miners — generating 184 BTC in May, a 31% month-over-month decrease.
That showing came in a month during which stablecoin issuer Tether bought roughly 18.6 million shares. The company generated $100 million in gross proceeds from the share issuance and intends to use that for data center expansion and ASIC-based mining rig development.
Hut 8, another large public miner, had not reported how many BTC it mined in May as of Friday morning. Neither had Stronghold Digital Mining, which signaled last month it was not ruling out selling the company as part of a “formal strategic review process.”

Here's the Percentage of Top Crypto Assets' Supply in Profit


																Following the recent rally of the broader crypto market, a large percentage of the circulating supply of most cryptocurrencies is currently in profit.
Market intelligence platform Santiment has revealed that bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are the top dogs in terms of long-term investment profitability, surpassing assets like Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA).
Crypto Assets in Profit
The percentage of a cryptocurrency’s supply in profit is calculated by summing the token’s current value and its worth when it first originated on the blockchain.
For a deeper understanding, Santiment explained that a bitcoin mined and first introduced on the blockchain at $60,000 would be profitable at the time of writing because BTC was trading at $71,290 at press time. Conversely, a coin mined at $73,000 would not be in profit because BTC is currently worth less than that amount.
Using the methodology, Santiment found that 98.3% of all circulating bitcoins are currently in profit, meaning 1.7% of the crypto asset’s supply is at a loss.




Following BTC is ETH, which has 95.1% of its circulating supply in profit. At the time of writing, data from CoinMarketCap shows ETH was changing hands at $3,811. LINK and Elon Musk’s favorite memecoin, DOGE, followed suit, with 86.8% and 82.2% of the circulating supplies in profits, respectively. The cryptocurrencies were worth $17.53 and $0.15, respectively, at the time of writing.
Ripple’s native token and ADA also have a substantial portion of their supply in the money. For the latter, approximately 78.8% of its circulating tokens are in profit, while the former has just over half of its supply (53.5%) in the green. At press time, CoinMarketCap data shows the duo trading at $0.52 and $0.48, respectively.
MATIC Sees Low Profitability
While BTC and ETH record massive growth and have substantial percentages of their circulating supply in profit, cryptocurrencies like Polygon’s MATIC are lagging. Santiment revealed that the portion of the digital asset in profit is a measly 35%, despite the level of development and number of users flocking to the network.
The on-chain intelligence platform said MATIC’s low investment profitability is likely linked to the cryptocurrency’s introduction to the market amid the 2019 bear cycle. Santiment noted that the launch time made the asset start with a bit of a handicap. At the time of writing, the token was worth $0.71, down 10% in the past year.

Bitcoin On The Verge As Global Liquidity Nears New $100 Million ATH


																Philip Swift, the founder of the on-chain analytics platform LookIntoBitcoin, recently highlighted the significant increase in global liquidity, which just hit a new all-time high (ATH). Swift suggested this was a crucial indicator of how Bitcoin can rise in this bull run. 
The Most Important Indicator For Bitcoin
Swift claimed that the global liquidity was the “most important” chart in this bull run while revealing that it had just hit a new ATH. The chart he shared showed that the global liquidity was now at $94 trillion and approaching the $100 trillion mark. Based on his analysis, this development could also lead to new ATHs for Bitcoin.

Source: Look Into Bitcoin
Global liquidity was around $90 trillion when BTC hit its previous ATH of $69,000 in the 2021 bull run. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price has risen above that level since global liquidity, thereby confirming the correlation between this global liquidity indicator and Bitcoin’s price. Swift claimed that Bitcoin’s rise is “inevitable” as long as global liquidity keeps trending. 
Swift mentioned that BTC had a “long way to go” after it hit a new ATH of $73,750 in March. He made reference to the MVRV z-score indicator, which showed that the flagship crypto was still well below its fair value. In a recent X post, the crypto founder suggested that Bitcoin would at least rise above $100,000 before the market top can be said to be in. 
Swift claimed that the Bitcoin cycle top indicators were continuing to climb higher. These top indicators were the delta top, terminal price, and top cap, which were at $137,579, $148,390, and $364,541, respectively. 
Source: Look Into Bitcoin
Meanwhile, like Swift, crypto analyst Tarekonchain recently highlighted the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator and mentioned that Bitcoin was still far from its peak. Based on this, the analyst predicted that BTC could still achieve new highs in this cycle and possibly rise above $100,000. 
BTC On The Brink Of History
Crypto analyst Rekt Capital mentioned that Bitcoin could soon make history if a breakout happens soon enough. He claimed that if that happens, this will be the fastest Bitcoin has ever broken out from a post-halving Re-Accumulation range. A successful breakout from this range will send Bitcoin into the “parabolic phase” of the cycle, when it is expected to reach new highs and potentially rise above $100,000.

Interestingly, Standard Chartered Bank predicted that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 even before the US Presidential election takes place in November. The bank further predicted that BTC could reach $150,000 by year-end if Republican candidate Donald Trump emerges victorious at the polls. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $71,000, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Norwegian authorities help Sky Mavis recover $5.7M from Ronin bridge heist

Sky Mavis, the developer behind Axie Infinity, successfully recovered approximately $5.7 million from the Ronin Bridge exploit with the Norwegian government’s assistance.In a June 7 statement, the firm stated:“The Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime (Økokrim) has successfully frozen and returned 5.7 M USD in stolen assets from the Ronin bridge incident.”Ronin bridge, an Ethereum sidechain for the play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, was exploited in 2022 for 173,600 Ethereum, worth over $615 million at the time. Since then, the firm has been working to recover the funds with little success.Meanwhile, the attacker, allegedly the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group, has moved a substantial amount of the stolen ETH through crypto mixing tool Tornado Cash.$40 million frozenThe firm said various law enforcement agencies have frozen a total of $40 million associated with the incident. It added:“These assets will take some time to recover and we don’t have enough information to give guidance around a specific timetable for recovering and returning this separate pool of assets.”These recoveries were achieved through the collaborative efforts of various agencies, including the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Økokrim, and blockchain forensic firm Chainalysis. Sky Mavis emphasized the importance of coordination among law enforcement, legal teams, accountants, and blockchain experts in retrieving the stolen assets.Sky Mavis plans to allocate around 15% of the recovered funds to cover recovery costs, with the remaining 85% being returned to the Axie Infinity Treasury.Meanwhile, the asset recovery did not improve Axie Infinity’s AXS token price performance or that of Ronin’s RON. According to CryptoSlate’s data, the digital assets were down 1.09 and 2.65%, respectively, over the last 24 hours.Mentioned in this articlePosted In: Featured, HacksLatest Alpha Market Report

San Francisco-Based Crypto Exchange Kraken Mulls $100,000,000+ Pre-IPO Funding Round: Report - The Daily Hodl


								One of the world’s largest and oldest crypto exchanges is reportedly contemplating a final funding round before possibly going public.
Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports that San Francisco-based Kraken is mulling conducting a pre-initial public offering (IPO) round after receiving inquiries from potential investors.










The fundraising, which will likely aim to raise more than $100 million, may be completed by the year-end, according to the sources.
Bloomberg says the exchange is looking for a “marquee” company to join its board and help it kick off a successful IPO by as early as next year.
The sources say talks between Kraken and potential investors only involved verbal exchanges of terms and valuations and do not have formal documentation.
Kraken has considered doing an initial public offering for years now but this did not push through because of the previous crypto downturn and the company’s regulatory issues with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
News of the company reconsidering an IPO emerges amid a bull market that could see crypto prices reach new all-time highs and bring the exchange $1 billion to $2 billion in revenue this year.
Kraken declined to comment on its purported fundraising and IPO plans.
“We are always exploring strategic paths toward Kraken’s Mission: accelerating the global adoption of crypto. We remain fully focused on investing in this goal.”

3 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Consider in June 2024 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Outpacing the erosion of money via inflation is not enough for some investors. Among many candidates in this category, from dividend to growth and blue-chip stocks, they typically involve safe, slower growth.



But what about companies perceived as bad calls, from this safe perspective? Because their stocks are suppressed, they have a higher potential for more significant gains. Yet, they still offer some fundamentals that are difficult to dismiss.



Here are three stocks that are riskier but have the potential for higher rewards.



Boeing (NASDAQ: BA)



Whether it is new whistleblowers, close-call landings and mishaps, or a botched NASA launch, there is hardly a month without negative Boeing news. This continued feed suppressed BA stock, far from its all-time high of $430 in March 2019 to $191 per share.



Yet, this price is now above the 52-week low of $159, which was reached at the height of Boeing’s fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). The reason for that is simple: There is no market substitution for this type of wide-moat company that could tackle the scale of military contracts, commercial flight, eVTOL, and space rocket deployment. 



While Boeing whistleblowers point to the company’s de-prioritization of quality controls in favor of racial/gender accounting, the company’s corporate culture is one election, or one CEO, away from a turnaround potential. In the meantime, its entrenched status is not at risk of erosion, which is why such non-business luxuries were implemented in the first place.



BA stock is down 24% year-to-date. But given Boeing’s fundamentals, analyst consensus for the next 12 months points to an average BA price target of $215.43, with a ceiling of $270 vs. the bottom of $140 per share.





Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)



Like Boeing, Elon Musk’s wealth-building company is no stranger to FUD.  Although Tesla is not a wide-moat company, it holds EV dominance in key US and EU markets. By avoiding the trap of unionization, Tesla continues to hold the edge over legacy automakers like Ford Motors.



Effectively ceding the pure EV market to Tesla, Ford Motors shifted to hybrids, with some success in Q1 sales growth. Tesla’s excursion into the SUV market, and subsequent recall of Cybertrucks, didn’t help the FUD amid the encroachment of Chinese automakers like BYD and Li Auto.



Nonetheless, Tesla’s core platform, Model 2, will not be deployed in 2025. So far, the company’s entire history has been geared toward popularizing EVs as luxury vehicles from the cumbersome days of specialty vehicles. The next-gen Model 2, priced at $25k alongside being the platform for robotaxies, is yet to become Tesla’s bread and butter.



It is fair to say that this interim 2-year period will either lay the groundwork for Tesla’s failure or success. But if it is the latter, the gains should be substantial from the presently muted TSLA stock. 



Given Musk’s successful SpaceX venture from a technological perspective, investors are counting on that scenario. From the all-time high of $409 in November 2021, TSLA stock is priced at $177 per share, under the 52-week average of $220. Since the end of February, TSLA stock has been moving sideways, having lost 28% of value year-to-date.







Baselode Energy (OTC: BSENF)



Investors willing to take the uranium plunge would be betting on this Canadian company finding new uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin, particularly the challenges of overcoming extracting issues in underground sandstone mining. 



Above that issue, even Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock and key facilitator of ESG, admitted that “the world is going to be short power” because of generative AI demand. Nuclear power is by far the densest form of energy and the cleanest with modern building designs, offering zero air/carbon output.



While uranium is not renewable, just 1 kg of uranium is equivalent to the energy from 2.7 million kg of coal. Baselode has four main projects for uranium extraction—Catharsis, Bear, Hook, and Shadow—of which Catharsis is in the drilling stage. Depending on the exploration success of other projects and the extraction from discovered uranium trioxide ores in ACKIO, Baselode could end up powering entire nations.



Unlike other uranium stocks that have skyrocketed, the penny BSENF stock is down 33% year-to-date, owing to technical challenges and stock dilution in February to fund operations. As of the end of March, the company has nearly three years’ worth of runway based on the cash burn rate reported in May. But if Baselode hits uranium motherloads, shareholders could see triple-digit returns in the next few years.

ChatGPT-4o sets new price target for ADA as Cardano signs partnership in Argentina


    The Cardano Foundation has announced a significant partnership with the government of Entre Ríos Province in Argentina.



This move aims to enhance blockchain adoption in the region and could potentially impact Cardano’s native token, ADA, which has been facing challenges in gaining traction recently.



According to the Cardano Foundation, Rogelio Frigerio, the governor of the Entre Ríos Province, and Rafael Fraga, LATAM Lead for Business Development at the Cardano Foundation, signed the agreement to formalize the partnership. 











The initiative will focus on promoting blockchain adoption in the Entre Ríos Province, aligning with Argentina’s broader push to advance its cryptocurrency infrastructure.



Recently, the National Securities Commission of Argentina partnered with El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets to explore Bitcoin (BTC) adoption and crypto regulation. 



This broader initiative aims to leverage Argentina’s robust technology sector to enhance the efficiency and scope of its crypto services,as reported by Finbold.



Potential impact on ADA’s price



To gather insights regarding the price impact of this partnership, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s latest and most advanced AI tool, ChatGPT-4o.



ADA price prediction. Source – ChatGPT-4o



According to ChatGPT-4o, in a conservative scenario, ADA could reach $1.00 if the crypto market experiences steady but moderate growth, driven by gradual adoption from the partnership in Argentina.



An optimistic estimate sees ADA potentially reaching $2.00 with positive trends and widespread implementation of Cardano’s blockchain solutions.



In a highly bullish scenario, ADA could surge to $5.00 or higher, fueled by strong adoption, significant market momentum, and overall positive sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market.



Factors influencing ADA price



ChatGPT-4o also highlighted several factors likely to impact ADA’s price, including partnership developments, market sentiment, technological advancements, regulatory environment, adoption rate, and broader economic conditions.



The recent partnership with the government of Entre Ríos Province in Argentina is expected to drive adoption and potentially increase ADA’s value.



Continuous upgrades to the Cardano blockchain enhance investor confidence and user attraction. 



Recent data from Cardano developer IOHK, released on May 17, shows the number of smart contracts on the network has reached 46,060, with 171 projects launched.



ADA 7-day price chart. Source –  Finbold



At press time, Cardano is priced at $0.49, reflecting a 5.06% increase in 24 hours. 



Still, ADA continues to trade below the $0.50 resistance zone, and reaching the $1 level would be significant for the asset’s growth.

Why Is Bitcoin Stuck At Resistance Despite Record ETF Inflows? - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD continues to trade sideways despite record inflows into Bitcoin Spot ETFs, leaving many market observers scratching their heads. This apparent disconnect between bullish sentiment and price action has sparked debate within the cryptocurrency community.ETF Inflows Don’t Guarantee Price Surges:James Van Straten, Lead Analyst at Crypto Slate, emphasizes the broader market forces at play. “Yup the market is way bigger than the ETFs.” He highlights the significant accumulation of Bitcoin (71,000 BTC in the past 30 days) despite record ETF inflows. However, he acknowledges that “many cohorts are in distribution as the price climbs higher.” This suggests profit-taking by some investors may be offsetting the buying pressure from ETFs.Internal Selling May Be Dampening Rally:Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas offers a different perspective. “This is not ETFs doing, obv bc they buying like crazy lately, it’s bitcoin holders selling or leveraged flushers or whatever.” Balchunas suggests that existing Bitcoin holders or leveraged traders might be selling, dampening the impact of ETF inflows.He further observes a recurring pattern: “Time and again ETFs go on flow-a-thons and its met with selling from other holders.”Also Read: Ethereum ETF Demand May Be Muted Compared To Bitcoin ETFs, Analysts SayTransparency Concerns Surface:Frank Makrides, a commentator, raises concerns about transparency. “can you please explain to me how we have had record amounts of fund flows into the $BTC ETFs and we are still range bound?” He questions the role of major institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and their market makers (e.g., JPMorgan) in managing these inflows.“It seems to me that @BlackRock @Fidelity & their market makers @jpmorgan should show us exactly what they’re doing with their funds – @SECGov ” Makrides’ tweet highlights a desire for greater transparency within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.The Bigger PictureLudwig Wittgenstein offered a broader view on the situation, comparing it to the patience exhibited by Roaring Kitty in his famous GameStop play.He said, “Crypto participants can’t stand a ‘chop’ for more than three seconds, running from one narrative to the other.” This suggests that the crypto market’s impatience and frequent shifts in focus contribute to the lack of sustained upward momentum.These dynamics and their implications for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market will be key discussion points at the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.

Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE) recently implemented a significant cost-cutting measure: it laid off staff at its European headquarters in Hilversum, the Netherlands. This move is part of a larger plan to reduce costs by $2 billion and the company’s global workforce by 2%.

In a February memo, CEO John Donahoe mentioned that the EMEA layoffs would occur on different timelines than North America due to local labor laws.



While the exact number of layoffs in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa was not specified, the cuts are part of the overall 2% global workforce reduction. 750 employees were laid off at Nike’s global headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon.

Ripple CTO Issues Important Warning to XRP Army, 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Makes Stunning BTC Price Prediction, SHIB and ADA Explode with Whale Activity: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Here are the top three news stories over the past day presented to you by U.Today.Ripple CTO issues crucial warning to XRP communityRipple CTO David Schwartz recently addressed his X followers with an important warning. In his post, Schwartz shared a screenshot from X user @3YearLetterman showing a direct message from a malefactor pretending to be a member of the X Support Team. The scam message informs the X user who received it that their account is purportedly under investigation for copyright violation, and that they have 24 hours to complete a form with feedback, otherwise the account will be suspended. The Ripple CTO urged the XRP community and those who follow him on X not to fall for this fraud, explaining that the link to a so-called "form" leads to a phishing site that will "collect your login and personal information.""Rich Dad Poor Dad" author makes stunning Bitcoin price predictionIn a recent X post, Robert Kiyosaki, renowned investor and author of bestselling book "Rich Dad Poor Dad," has shared his latest call on the Bitcoin price fo4 the near future. "Bitcoin will be $350,000 by August 25, 2024," Kiyosaki wrote; however, there is a catch to this bold prediction. The author further added: "It’s a prediction. It’s speculation, it’s an opinion, but it’s not a lie. It’s sucker's bait, but it’s not a lie because any prediction about the future is not a lie," potentially implying that no one can know for sure what the future holds for BTC or any digital asset in general. Kiyosaki then continued his post by saying that he is currently increasing his Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana stashes, adding, however, that he does so not because of being "certain" about these cryptos but due to being confident of "the incompetence of our leaders."Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano explode with whale activityShiba Inu and Cardano have both recently seen a significant rise in large-scale transactions. According to data from Santiment reports, the cause for this surge is mainly the increased interest from "whales," or investors making transactions exceeding $100,000. This week, the number of such large transactions for SHIB and ADA has more than doubled, in comparison to the average for 2024. As can be seen on a chart attached to Santiment's X post, the current figure for such massive transactions for the ADA token sits at 875, and for the SHIB token, it is 321. However, even the day before, the numbers were much lower - around 455 for Cardano and 81 for Shiba Inu. At the moment of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000025, down by 2.84% over the past 24 hours and for ADA at $0.4798, up by 4.09% over the same period.

Bitcoin Price Shakes Off Fed Jitter Following Hot Labor Market Reading - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe price of Bitcoin bounced back Friday following stronger-than-expected jobs data in the U.S., which could potentially compel the Federal Reserve to delay cutting interest rates.The Labor Department said that the unemployment rate increased slightly to 4% in May, but that job growth had also accelerated amid the most restrictive interest rates in more than 20 years. Economists forecast that employers would add 180,000 nonfarm payroll positions, but the report indicated that 272,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy last month.Immediately following the report’s release, Bitcoin dipped to $70,700 from around $71,800, according to CoinGecko data. However, the asset’s price has edged up to $71,050, as of this writing, showing a minor 0.4% decline over the past 24 hours.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that inflation had come down substantially from a multi-decade high in 2022, despite the strength of the labor market. Previously, policymakers believed some softening there may be necessary to bring inflation down to their target of 2%, with lower job demand easing upward pressure on wages.“Job growth was remarkably strong in May,” Grayscale’s Head of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt in a statement, adding that it “likely further trims the odds of Fed rate cuts this year.”Still, Pandl believes that the Fed will cut rates in the intermediate term, following a loosening of monetary policy from the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank over the past week. According to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, the prospect of the Fed holding interest rates steady through year’s end increased from 5.5% to 11.3% after the report’s release.Still, the market sees a 50% chance that the Fed cuts rates in September, which would likely accelerate economic growth through reduced borrowing costs.Higher interest rates typically weigh on the value of so-called risk assets, including stocks and crypto, as the payouts for holding cash or U.S. Treasuries become relatively more attractive. Despite the report’s implications or the Fed’s potential delay to cutting rates, Pandl believes “Bitcoin will retest its all-time high in the coming months.”Meanwhile, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said on Twitter (aka X) that Bitcoin “has become highly sensitive to interest rate expectations.” In 2022, macroeconomic data—and associated jitters—could send Bitcoin swinging around 10% in any direction on a given day.Shifting expectations on rate cuts in April dented Bitcoin’s price alongside rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Regardless, the Fed will telegraph its next move during its June policy meeting next week.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

$100,000 Bitcoin Incoming by the End of the Year if This Happens, Says Billionaire Mike Novogratz - The Daily Hodl


								The chief executive of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital says that Bitcoin (BTC) could hit six figures this year if one key event occurs soon.
In a new interview with Bloomberg Television, Mike Novogratz says that if Bitcoin flips the $73,000 level into support he expects the king crypto to reach $100,000 before the end of 2024.










“If we take out the $73,000 in the next week or so we’re going to end the year at $100,000, somewhere around there or even higher. Markets create ranges. When the top of the range breaks, you have a nice extension. And so if the bottom of that range started around $40,000, so $40,000 to $70,000, this $70,000 goes to $100,000. And so that’s a good enough target.” 
Novogratz also says that there is reason to believe more crypto regulatory clarity will be coming out of Washington, D.C., which could act as a tailwind for Bitcoin.
“D.C. has finally agreed in principle that crypto legislation has to happen, that it should be bipartisan. We still have a couple holdouts, but the last few weeks have been unbelievably positive in pushing the Democrats forward. They don’t want it to be a political issue. And so that which was a headwind is becoming a tailwind. It’s not a full tailwind yet… 
We’re getting the regulatory clarity. And even though it’s not perfect, we got enough that people now realize this is coming. And why is that important? And what does it mean? So if SAB 121, this arcane accounting bill, in time gets overturned, it allows Bank of New York and State Street and others to get into custody. If the infrastructure bill, FIT21 bill, gets approved that allows Goldman Sachs and Citibank and all these other people to start doing sales and trading. And so as you bring those institutions in huge money follows.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $71,021 at time of writing, nearly unchanged in the last 24 hours.

'We Must Crash Solana': Andrew Tate Embarks on Meme Coin Spending Spree - Decrypt

Controversial right-wing internet personality Andrew Tate is at again, with his latest ploy to farm online engagement as he awaits trial for rape and human trafficking charges: shilling Solana meme coins. On Friday, the former kickboxer and self-proclaimed misogynist—who once disavowed crypto as a scam—began promoting various Solana tokens and posting racially incendiary statements on Twitter in rapid succession, creating a characteristically chaotic social media storm.The havoc began when Tate first posted, early Friday, that he would “diamond hands” $1 million worth of random assets if he received a certain number of retweets on the post. “Diamond hands” is internet parlance for holding an asset long-term, regardless of price movement, due to conviction in the asset.In short order, the post hit Tate’s engagement target, and the social media influencer posted “I WILL CRASH THE SOLANA NETWORK”—implying that he planned to buy up so many tokens on the chain that it crashed. (Solana currently executes about 1,900 transactions a second, according to Solscan.)Tate then invited the degen hordes to shill their “junk” tokens at him, saying he would pick a select number to sweep up. He soon claimed to have bought $10,000 of various Pump.fun Solana meme coins, including one mocking a Twitter user Tate denigrated and one disparaging pop singer Madonna. He also appeared to buy into a Germany-themed Solana token only after the token’s team agreed to refer to him as “Fuhrer,” the title strongly associated with Adolf Hitler. Tate appears to have spent nowhere near that promised $1 million on investments yet, however. While he has routinely made lofty claims about his wealth and crypto investments in recent months—an essential component of his playboy image—his situation became considerably more precarious last year, when Romanian authorities accused him and his brother of rape, human trafficking, and forming an organized crime group to sexually exploit women. In March, British authorities issued a separate arrest warrant for the Tate brothers on charges related to rape and sexual assault. Romanian authorities agreed to extradite the influencer only after the conclusion of his trial in their country.  Tate is currently in Romania awaiting trial. He is barred from leaving the country.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Sell signal for two overbought cryptocurrencies this week


    The cryptocurrency market is currently in a state of flux, influenced by broader economic factors. Recent data showed a surprising increase in U.S. job growth, far exceeding expectations.



This suggests the economy is coping well with higher interest rates, reducing the likelihood of rate cuts, which affects the flow of money into riskier investments like cryptocurrencies.



In light of this economic backdrop, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies that are currently overbought and may present a good selling opportunity. 







Based on CoinGlass’s 24-hour relative strength index (RSI) heatmap on June 7, the average daily RSI is 54.70, indicating a neutral market. 



However, cryptocurrencies that deviate significantly from this average, either by being overbought or oversold, are likely to correct back towards the mean.



Binance Coin (BNB) 



At press time, Binance Coin (BNB) is priced at $700.30, with a slight price drop of 0.39%. BNB’s RSI values over various time frames show it is overbought, especially over the past 24 hours. 



The 24-hour RSI for BNB is 75.56, which is above the overbought threshold of 70. This indicates strong buying pressure that may not be sustainable.



Crypto Market RSI 24-hour Heatmap:BNB. Source: CoinGlass



The 1-week RSI of 82.52 suggests a prolonged overbought condition, pointing to a potential price correction.BNB recently reached an all-time high, highlighting possible overvaluation and market saturation.



Ordi (ORDI)



ORDI, the first token minted using the BRC-20 standard, has also shown significant price movement. Currently, ORDI is priced at $62.888, reflecting an 8% increase. ORDI’s RSI values also suggest it is overbought. 



Crypto Market RSI 24-hour Heatmap:ORDI. Source: CoinGlass



The 24-hour RSI for ORDI is 74.65, indicating it has been overbought recently. ORDI has surged nearly 17%, reaching just below $57.5, its highest price since early April. 



This rapid increase, combined with high RSI values, suggests that ORDI might soon see a price correction as the market stabilizes



Both BNB and ORDI are exhibiting high RSI levels, signaling that they are currently overbought and may be poised for a price correction.



However, it is important to note that an overbought RSI does not necessarily guarantee an imminent correction. 



This status often follows a period of strong performance and can be sustained during prolonged bull markets. 



Therefore, while the technical indicators suggest caution, traders should also consider the underlying fundamentals of each cryptocurrency before making investment decisions.

Polkadot Can Target $10 Next, but Here's the Catch (DOT Price Analysis)


																Polkadot faces a significant challenge in reclaiming a decisive resistance region encompassing the $7.5 mark, the 100-day moving average, and critical Fibonacci levels. This resistance range can potentially halt upward pressure in the short term.
Technical Analysis
By Shayan
The Daily Chart
A comprehensive daily chart analysis highlights Polkadot’s prolonged struggle to breach a crucial resistance zone over several weeks. This resistance includes:

The static resistance level at $7.5
The 100-day moving average at $7.6
The price range between the 0.5 ($7.4) and 0.618 ($7.8) Fibonacci levels

This formidable range is likely accompanied by significant supply and selling pressure, capable of resisting buyers’ upward momentum. In the event of a rejection, the consolidation phase is expected to expand, with the price retracing slightly towards the $6.5 support region.
Conversely, if buyers successfully overpower sellers, a notable short-squeeze event could transpire, propelling the price impulsively toward the $8 threshold.
Source: TradingView
The 4-Hour Chart
On the 4-hour chart, Polkadot’s price has formed an ascending wedge pattern amid the recent multi-month consolidation phase. This pattern typically indicates a continuation of the initial bearish movement if breached from its lower threshold.
Following a rejection from the significant $7.5 resistance level, the price declined, reaching the pattern’s lower boundary. However, upon reaching this point, the momentum waned, leading to a period of consolidation with minimal volatility. Nonetheless, the price is on the brink of breaking below the pattern’s lower boundary. A valid breakout could trigger a cascade towards the $6.5 mark.
Conversely, continuing the current consolidation phase within the pattern is the most probable scenario, with the price aiming for the wedge’s upper boundary around $8.
Source: TradingView
Sentiment Analysis
By Shayan
Polkadot is currently experiencing sideways consolidation around the $7 mark. Examining futures market metrics, particularly the DOT/USDT Binance liquidation heatmap, provides valuable insights into potential price movements and liquidity pools.
The heatmap reveals significant liquidity below the $7 level, indicating stop-loss orders and liquidation prices. The $8 area also contains substantial liquidity, acting as a resistance level. If the price approaches this zone, it may face selling pressure from participants looking to realize profits or close positions.
Nevertheless, the $10 zone consists of substantial liquidity, potentially representing the liquidation prices of short positions that drove the initial bearish movement before the current consolidation stage.
Polkadot’s price is trapped between the $7 support and $8 resistance levels, influenced by significant liquidity pools at these zones. A breakout from this range could lead to notable price movements, with the $10 region being a potential mid-term target in case of a bullish revival.

'I'm Alive': GameStop Legend Roaring Kitty Just Livestreamed-Here's What Happened - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe meme stock influencer Kieth Gill, better known online as Roaring Kitty or DeepFucking Value, opined on YouTube—carefully—on Friday about GameStop’s future as a company. It was his first livestream since 2021.“Do I have to be careful about what I saw here?” the influencer asked, while displaying a background of GameStop’s stock price on Yahoo Finance. “I wanted to remind people that I’m the one active on my accounts, of course.”The announcement of his livestream a day before had caused the firm’s share price to spike 47% over the course of the trading day to $46.55, pushing higher during overnight trading. But the stock had buckled over 30% from its closing price to below $32 before Gill’s remarks.As Gill’s livestream was scheduled to begin, over 320,000 viewers awaited the influencer on YouTube. An endless stream of messages cascaded across his channel’s chat box, often presented in all-caps styling or accompanied by gorilla, rocket, diamond emojis.Some viewers in the run-up to Gill’s appearance beckoned other users to “HODL” their positions in the firm. Others wondered whether Gill had sold his shares, or if he was okay, as the minutes ticked past noon—well after the livestream was scheduled to begin.“I kind of forget how to do this,” the influencer said as he began his livestream, appearing to wear bandages along with a sling over his right arm. “Oh shit, I’m alive—kinda,” he said, later telling viewers that the bandages and splint were for comedic purposes.“It is what it is. What am I going to do?” he said of GameStop’s lower stock price on Friday. “You post a couple memes, you post a couple of screenshots, and everyone loses their mind.”Gill said people should pay attention to GameStop’s business model, saying the retailer is in a “transformation stage” and moving away from its legacy business model of selling games and video game consoles in-store. Gill added that he believes in the firm’s management team.“He seems to be taking the right approach, given this unique situation,” Gill said of GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, who took over last September. “Let’s see where it goes from here.”Before Gill spoke, the stream displayed a raft of disclosures, of which one sentence said, “You should not treat any opinion expressed on this YouTube channel as a specific inducement to make a particular investment or follow a particular strategy.”Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Gill’s recent trading and social media behavior is subject to investigation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Massachusetts’ securities regulator.Before Gill had the chance to dawn his virtual stage, GameStop itself had news to break. The company disclosed on Friday that its first-quarter earnings were rough, and that the video game retailer’s net sales had fallen 29% to $881.8 million from $1.237 billion a year prior.The firm’s financials were a letdown compared to Wall Street estimates. Nonetheless, GameStop announced alongside the performance that the firm would sell 75 million shares in the company after raising $900 million through the sale of 45 million shares in May.Gill, who became the de facto face of retail-led movement to bet big against Wall Street short sellers through GameStop in 2021, had reignited interest in GameStop through his online return. Appearing on Twitter (aka X) first, he later began posting again on Reddit.Within the Reddit community Superstonk, Gill’s purported positions had already garnered immense interest. Holding a mix of GameStop shares and call options earlier this month, his latest “YOLO update” showed paper gains of over $382 million.Around 30 minutes into Gill’s livestream, the channel had garnered over 700,000 viewers. As the price of GameStop fell, he flashed his positions on E*Trade to viewers, which had decreased in value by around $235 million.Even amid such unrealized losses, he kept a jovial attitude for more than half a million live observers.“Do I have a lawyer in the room?” Gill read from a message posted in the livestream’s chat. “No, but maybe I should,” he responded.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Market Expert Says Altcoin Summer Is Just Around The Corner, Here’s The Timeline | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto expert Michael Van de Poppe recently predicted that altcoins would make significant upside moves. The analyst also provided a timeline for when this will happen and how parabolic the move could be for these crypto tokens. 
Altcoins Will Make A Move In The Summer
Van de Poppe mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that altcoins are ready for their upward run and will see a lot of momentum from late June until September or October. The crypto analyst added that these altcoins will reprice back to their normal values when this move occurs, alluding to the “big cascade” they have suffered since the start of the year. 

Van de Poppe has for a while now continued to hammer on how undervalued altcoins are and previously predicted that they were going to make significant moves in their Bitcoin pair post-halving. Back then, he also predicted that there would be a narrative shift to Ethereum and suggested that the second-largest crypto by market would lead other altcoins into the altcoin season. 
The analyst also believes that the Spot Ethereum ETFs could trigger this altcoin season once they begin trading. This would explain why he predicted that the altcoin season would begin in late June since Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted these Ethereum ETFs would begin trading around that period. 
Van de Poppe has also revealed that he was well-positioned ahead of this altcoin season. He once mentioned that he had swapped all his Bitcoin holdings for altcoins. In a recent X post, he also stated that he had switched his altcoin exposure towards different altcoins in a bid to enjoy a higher return on investment (ROI). He claimed that he was comfortable with his exposure and reaffirmed that there would be a “strong altcoin run.”
The analyst also provided some insights into altcoins that he might have accumulated when he listed ten undervalued tokens that he believes will make a run in this bull cycle. The tokens he listed included Chainlink (LINK), Celestia (TIA), Arbitrum (ARB), Polkadot (DOT), and Cosmos (ATOM), amongst others. 
Time To Position Ahead Of The Altcoin Season
Crypto analyst Lark Davis recently mentioned that it “could be the time to go down the risk curve” and position early for the altcoin season. He made this statement while discussing whether or not the altcoin season was starting soon. He shared data from Blockchain Center, which showed that the market is still far from an altcoin season. 
Blockchain Center has an altcoin season index that gauges whether or not it is the altcoin season. Based on the index, it is only altcoin season when 75% of the top 50 coins by market cap outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. So far, only 12 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during this period, meaning that it is still Bitcoin season.

3 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week


    Finbold identified three cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week due to the upcoming substantial token unlocks and sell-offs. These unlocks have the potential to flood the market, leading to increased selling pressure and significant price fluctuations.



Experienced cryptocurrency market participants closely monitor factors like demand and supply dynamics about the tokens and assets they are trading. By considering these dynamics, investors can make well-informed decisions that maximize profitability while effectively managing associated risks.



In particular, data from TokenUnlocksApp shows $164.76 million in potential sell-offs for the next seven days from June 7. The top two highest unlocks will happen on June 12 and June 14, releasing $160.41 million worth of tokens. These two massive releases correspond to 97.5% of the six projects, unlocking this week’s total amount.







Cliff unlocks the next seven days. Source: TokenUnlocks.App



Aptos (APT)



First, Aptos (APT), a layer-1 blockchain developed by former Meta (NASDAQ: META) engineers, will unlock 11.31 million APT worth $103.48 million. The Foundation will receive a smaller share of the unlock, with 1.33 million tokens worth $12.20 million.



Community and Core contributors will receive 3.21 million and 3.96 million tokens, totaling $65.59 million. Meanwhile, investors will realize $25.69 million with sales of 2.81 million APT.



The whole unlock will inflate Aptos supply by 2.6% on June 12, likely creating a huge selling pressure.

ImmutableX (IMX)



ImmutableX (IMX) is the second cryptocurrency to avoid trading due to a significant unlock that will inflate its supply by 1.7% on June 14. Specifically, 25.53 million IMX will be released to ecosystem development and project development.



The $56.93 million will be fully managed by the team, which represents a proportionally high share of centralized capital.

Avoid trading XRP amid Ripple sell-offs



From another perspective, Ripple has already unlocked 1 billion XRP in June and reserved 200 million tokens out of this total, plus an extra 200 million, to sell this month.



As reported by Finbold, the company has already moved 150 million XRP, which may soon land in crypto exchanges. With another 250 million tokens in its treasury account, Ripple’s activities could also create strong selling pressure on the cryptocurrency.

However, crypto traders will try to speculate on the economic effects these unlocks and sell-offs may have on price, which could bring increased volatility and worsen the potential risk-reward ratio. The market is uncertain and influenced by multiple factors, requiring proper risk management and learning when to avoid trading specific cryptocurrencies.

Why Donald Trump's Reported $33 Million Crypto Portfolio Quickly Dropped To $21M Overnight - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump has changed his stance on crypto over the past several years, from calling it a "disaster waiting to happen" in 2021 to supporting it and owning tens of millions of dollars in crypto. This new pro-crypto stance has made his crypto portfolio even larger, hitting over $33 million highs in early June. Let's look at where Trump is getting this crypto and how the value of his holdings has fluctuated recently. Don't Miss:Trump first began receiving crypto in 2022. Another company used his name to market and sell 45,000 Trump Digital Trading Cards NFTs for $99 each, earning Trump royalties in the form of ETH. The company also launched a "Mugshot Edition" of the NFTs, resulting in even more royalties for Trump. The former president has earned more than 1,900 ETH from these projects, 1,075 of which he sold in December 2023. However, the ETH in Trump's portfolio is only a fraction of his holdings. Nearly all of the portfolio comprises two memecoins: MAGA Coin (TRUMP) and Trog (TROG). These tokens sent a portion of the token supply to Trump as part of a marketing scheme, and their value has skyrocketed in 2024. MAGA Coin was the first large project to gift Trump tokens. The project started in August 2023 and sent Trump a few thousand dollars worth of tokens when it began trading. For several months, the value of these tokens stayed relatively low until 2024, when the price of TRUMP began to increase dramatically. Events like Trump's primary election successes and recent felony convictions caused the token's price to go from less than $0.01 on launch to over $17.50. At the same time, Trump's position went from a few thousand dollars to a high of over $10 million. Trending: According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here’s why it can be true.Surprisingly, TRUMP is just one of the meme coins that Trump has received. Project founders and supporters have given him over 50 other meme coins. Trog (TROG), short for Trump Frog, became Trump's largest holding in June 2024. The project gave Trump half of the supply, equating to 210 billion tokens. While the project has remained fairly small since launch, ranking outside the top 2,500 tokens by market cap, because Trump owns so much of the supply, his position has become very large in relation to the rest of his portfolio. The price of TROG has increased nearly 1,000% over the past week, allowing Trump's tokens to reach a high of over $24.6 million. When TROG hit highs on June 5, Trump's portfolio was worth over $33 million. His holdings have since fallen to around $20 million as the price of TROG fell. However, the fact that Trump held more than $30 million in meme coins is beyond surprising. Read Next:

Shiba Inu Faces 29 Trillion Token Sell Wall on Path to New Highs


							

Shiba Inu faces strong sell walls, with $0.000026 as a major resistance level.



Overcoming resistance could push SHIB above $0.00006 to a new yearly high.



Analyst Mags suggests now is an ideal time to buy SHIB despite a 43% drop in trading volume.




Multiple sell walls pose a significant challenge for Shiba Inu (SHIB), even as the broader cryptocurrency market recovers. These sell walls represent major obstacles preventing SHIB from rising further.



The $0.000026 level stands out as a key resistance area. According to IntoTheBlock data, this price point marks a substantial sell wall. Clearing this hurdle could trigger significant gains.



This level’s sell wall comprises 92,240 addresses that collectively own 29.69 trillion SHIB tokens. A successful breakout above this level could propel SHIB to a new annual high, potentially exceeding $0.00006. This scenario could ignite renewed enthusiasm and interest in the cryptocurrency, particularly among those closely following its performance.



Despite the sell walls, significant support exists, preventing sharp price declines for SHIB. According to IntoTheBlock data, 853,520 addresses are currently profitable, while 427,700 addresses hold SHIB at a loss. This support acts as a buffer against downward price swings during volatile periods.



Coin Edition previously reported on remarks by crypto analyst Mags, who asserted that now is an optimal time to buy SHIB. Mags believes the current market conditions offer investors a unique opportunity to purchase SHIB before it potentially breaks through its resistance levels.



Notably, SHIB’s trading volume has significantly decreased over the past week, falling by 43% to $397.78 million. This decline in trading activity may suggest that traders are awaiting more definitive market signals or a period of consolidation.

GameStop Tumbles 40% as Trading Icon Roaring Kitty Returns to Livestream

Solana-based meme token GME, which was inspired by the company but has no affiliation with it, almost doubled in price in less than a day before sharply paring gains on Friday. At press time it was down 50% over the preceding few hours, though still higher by more than three-fold this week.

Microsoft Limits New Windows AI 'Recall' Feature Following Privacy Backlash - Decrypt

Following weeks of criticism, Microsoft announced Friday that it will build tougher limits around the controversial AI-powered “Recall” feature that it unveiled during its annual developer conference in May. Cybersecurity and privacy experts railed against the product, calling it spyware and a potential honeypot for cybercriminals.In an update, Microsoft said it was changing how Recall functions, giving customers more control over the application. According to Microsoft, Copilot+ PC users will have to opt into using Recall, saying that the service will now be turned off by default.Additionally, enrollment in Microsoft’s Windows Hello service—the secure, biometric login feature introduced in Windows 10—is required to enable Recall, and decryption of snapshots will now require user authentication.“Even before making Recall available to customers, we have heard a clear signal that we can make it easier for people to choose to enable Recall on their Copilot+ PC and improve privacy and security safeguards,” Microsoft said in a statement.A feature of Microsoft’s new line of AI-powered Copilot+ Windows PCs, Recall uses artificial intelligence to take random screenshots of what the user is doing in order to provide a way to retrieve lost or missing data. Concerns that Recall would be able to capture passwords and other sensitive information soon followed.“We also know the best way to secure information on a PC is to secure the whole PC itself,” Microsoft said.Microsoft emphasized that Snapshots are stored locally and are not shared, and users will know when Recall is saving a snapshot. Microsoft also noted that Recall does not save snapshots of digital rights-managed content or private browsing in supported web browsers, and customers can also pause, filter, and delete snapshots at any time.“We are on a journey to build products and experiences that live up to our company mission to empower people and organizations to achieve more, and are driven by the critical importance of maintaining our customers’ privacy, security, and trust,” the firm noted. “As we always do, we will continue to listen to and learn from our customers, including consumers, developers and enterprises, to evolve our experiences in ways that are meaningful to them.”Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Court to sentence Craig Wright for lying about being Satoshi


London’s High Court of Justice, arguably the world’s most powerful copyright court, has reconvened to sentence Craig Wright for his false, perjurious claims to have written Bitcoin’s whitepaper as its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.
The courtroom was packed to hear final arguments from lawyers representing the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), which represents Bitcoin developers and companies. 
Today’s arguments aren’t about whether Wright lied — he did — but merely the punishment Wright should receive.
COPA lead attorney Jonathan Hough is obviously asking for a court injunction barring Wright from making any claim in a public forum about being Satoshi Nakamoto.
The alliance also wants the court to categorically deny any remaining legal avenues for Wright to appeal the ruling.

Moreover, COPA wants to escalate the ruling within the UK judiciary from what was essentially a copyright suit to a criminal proceeding. COPA has also asked to include Wright’s once-colleague at nChain, Stefan Matthews, as a criminal defendant for his own perjury.
COPA reminded the judge that Matthews supported Wright with false evidence, even after the court found Matthews’ evidence to be fake.
During today’s hearing, the judge voiced agreement that the court has a responsibility to impose an ‘extraordinary’ sentence on Wright due to his extensive, multi-year campaign to mislead the world about his identity. At a maximum, the court has the ability to put Wright behind bars for years.
Wright’s sentencing hearing has concluded for today, with proceedings due to continue next week.

GameStop Should Buy Bitcoin Says Scaramucci, RoaringKitty Streams For the First Time in years


																GameStop and its stock price have been the talking point of many crypto-centric and traditional finance communities throughout the past few days – not without reason.
GME’s price went on a massive rollercoaster this week, soaring by 130% and plummeting by 55% shortly after.
Many financial experts have chipped in with opinions, one of whom is the prominent BTC permabull – Anthony Scaramucci.
GameStop Should Buy Bitcoin: Scaramucci
GameStop was all the rage this week as virtually everyone who is even remotely interested in the so-called meme trading was anticipating today’s stream of Keith Gill.
Gill, who is perhaps better known by his nickname Roaring Kitty – went live on YouTube hours ago for the first time in almost four years, but we will get to that in a second.




Earlier today, GameStop filed to sell up to 75 million more shares as the price soared above $60. The market didn’t take this well, and GME tumbled by more than 50% today, currently trading below $30.
Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital came up with an interesting suggestion.
Replying to the statement above, Scaramucci said:
GameStop should buy #BITCOIN
Roaring Kitty Goes Live on YouTube
One of the most highly-anticipated events today was Keith Gill’s live stream on YouTube.
Gill, who became famous for building a massive GME position and then being a leading figure behind the stock’s massive rally back in 2020, was talking live on a broadcast that received over half a million views in a few hours.
It’s worth noting that multiple GME-inspired meme coins were trending upward before the stream. However, as the stock’s price tumbled today, so did these meme coins.
For instance, GME and ROAR declined by some 25% and 35%, respectively, throughout the stream itself. None of these are affiliated with Gill, at least not officially.
During the stream, Roaring Kitty confirmed that he’s still holding his positions and that he hasn’t opened new ones.

Ethereum Preparing For Pectra In Q1 2025: 3 Key EIPs That Will Go Live


								Ethereum developers continue to improve the network, maintaining a tradition that has been ongoing since its launch. Since the first update through Homestead, developers have implemented several hard forks, with the latest ones being Shanghai and Dencun.
Pectra Lays The Foundation For Even More Upgrades In Ethereum

The Ethereum community is eagerly anticipating the next key update, Pectra, scheduled for late Q1 2025. This hard fork, a significant enhancement after Dencun, will integrate 19 key Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), collectively addressing scalability, security, and user experience concerns.

As mentioned earlier, the Pectra upgrade is part of yet another of Ethereum’s strategic approaches to development. Over the years, developers have introduced incremental improvements while laying the groundwork for bigger updates. As it is, Pectra lays the foundation for the eventual on-chain scaling of the mainnet.
From Account Abstraction To User Experience Enhancement And Security
In a post on X, an Ethereum analyst identified several EIPs that will go live, making the mainnet more performant and secure. One of them is EIP-7702, floated by Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. The proposal will replace EIP-3074 and introduce account abstraction without compromising security. 
The account abstraction feature, a key component of the Pectra upgrade, allows addresses to function temporarily as smart contracts during transactions. This feature significantly enhances user experience and streamlines transactions.

Another proposal that will go live is EIP-7594 or PeerDAS. The Analyst notes that the upgrade will focus on roll-up scalability, further boosting the efficiency of layer-2 platforms like Base and Arbitrum. Once implemented, the network’s layer-2 solutions would process even more transactions, helping drop gas fees.

Pectra will also implement EIP-7251 or MaxEB, a key change for validators. This EIP will make staking easier and more flexible. The maximum effective balance per validator will rise from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. This means that validators will be more flexible in their operations.
Other key EIPs that will go live include those related to the EVM Object Format (EOF), and EIP-2537 will enhance security and scalability by implementing cryptographic improvements. The analyst also identified the integration of EIP-7549, which will make Ethereum more efficient by reducing the consensus overhead.

Investors target Injective, ORDI gains ahead of Bitbot launch - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Injective and ORDI soared in intraday trading today, leading the market as analysts predict the altseason is loading.
Bitbot has wrapped up its token sale just as crypto sentiment flips bullish.

Injective (INJ) and ORDI (ORDI) are among altcoins to see decent gains this week as market anticipation for an altseason rises. INJ and ORDI tokens could continue higher as investors aggressively position.
Meanwhile, crypto traders are poised as the market eyes new momentum for top altcoins, memecoins, RWA and artificial intelligence (AI) tokens among other key sectors. Also emerging as a target for traders is Bitbot (BITBOT), a new trading bot set to go live on Telegram.
Discover why investors who missed the project’s presale may jump in when tokens go live on crypto exchanges.  
Injective surges as investors bet for more gains
Injective, the interoperable Layer-1 blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi), has had a cracking 24 hours.
Trading volume has skyrocketed more than 90%, while price broke to highs of $30.92. INJ currently trades above a key resistance line and further strengthening looks likely amid various bullish catalysts.
On June 6, the project’s team released a new tokenomics paper on the native token INJ, highlighting its utility.
The news bolstered INJ price before further announcements, including integration of Japanese gaming platform Gumi as validator and launch of Injective’s first yield-bearing synthetic dollar, triggered more buying.
Injective also shared more positive developments, notably around GameFi, staking and a crypto conference in Vietnam.
ORDI soars double-digits as memecoins ignite frenzy
ORDI continues to attract attention since its debut in the Bitcoin ecosystem when it launched as the first BRC-20 token on the Ordinals protocol.
On Friday, ORDI price surged more than 11% to cross above $50.
The daily chart suggests bulls may find immediate support above $60, a scenario that opens up the all-time high of $95. It could then target price discovery with a breakout above the psychological level of $100.  
Bitbot token readies for market launch
New Telegram-based trading app Bitbot just wrapped up a stellar presale that raised over $4.3 million.
Investors who participated in the presale could soon have the opportunity to trade and potentially reap big when the BITBOT token lists on major exchanges.
While this milestone is creating a buzz in the market, there’s one thing that’s even more important for the crypto community- the launch of the world’s first non-custodial Telegram bot.
The main reason for the excitement is that the trading bot market is rapidly growing into a huge sector. Data shows bots across the market have reached over $25 billion in cumulative trading volume, while the average daily volume currently sits at over $164 million.
As bots become vital trading tools, users are now more inclined to go for not just the most innovative, but ones that offer enhanced security.
Bitbot stands out in this category with its non-custodial bot. AI integration and the availability of anti-MEV and anti-rug pull features cement its indispensable outlook.
Following the presale, the Bitbot team announced that the native token BITBOT will launch on exchanges for trading.
Meanwhile, the key product (bot) is ready for market debut with features such as trading interface, market data integration and staking. The developer team is working on the non-custodial wallet integration ahead of its launch.
What else adds to a bullish outlook for Bitbot?
Injective and ORDI’s gains, as with most other tokens registering decent gains, come as analysts predict crypto is on the cusp of a major altseason.
Pseudonymous crypto trader and analyst Moustache shared such a bullish outlook today, pointing to a technical analysis tool that traders use to identify price trends.
The Gaussian Channel indicator on the two-week chart shows a similar accumulation phase and retest pattern as seen before the last bull market.
According to the analyst, the indicator suggests crypto could be poised for its “biggest altseason” yet.
Bitbot, which could revolutionize the crypto trading market on Telegram, has the potential to be one of the outperformers.

Bakkt explores potential sale or breakup amid surge in crypto M&A activity - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bakkt is considering strategic options, including a potential sale or breakup, according to an initial report from Bloomberg citing persons familiar with the matter. The move comes amid a surge in takeover activity within the cryptocurrency sector.The sources, who asked to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the matter, revealed that Bakkt has been working with a financial advisor to evaluate its options. However, no final decision has been made, and the company may choose to remain independent.Bakkt was launched in 2018 by Intercontinental Exchange, which owns several major futures markets and the NYSE. The venture’s founding CEO, Kelly Loeffler, later served as a US Senator from Georgia for a year. Earlier this year, Bakkt faced the risk of being delisted from the NYSE after disclosing that it might not be able to continue as a going concern.Increased crypto merger and acquisition activitiesThe potential sale of Bakkt comes as consolidation activity heats up in the digital-asset sector, with crypto prices nearing record highs. While some companies are considering expansion, others are still recovering from the industry-wide meltdown that occurred two years ago. Recent examples of consolidation include Robinhood’s acquisition of European crypto exchange Bitstamp and Riot Platforms Inc.’s proposed takeover of its rival Bitfarms.Bakkt, which went public through a merger with a blank-check vehicle in 2021, reported a first-quarter loss of $21 million on $855 million in revenue. The company also recently announced a partnership with Crossover Markets to develop a crypto electronic communication network (ECN).One of Bakkt’s valuable assets is its BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services, which allows it to operate in the state. Other major industry participants with this license include crypto exchange Coinbase, stablecoin issuer Circle, and Jack Dorsey’s digital payment firm Square.Following the news of the potential sale, Bakkt shares rose 15% to $22.33 on Friday, bringing the company’s market value to around $300 million. Despite this recent increase, the stock has fallen approximately 30% over the past year.

The Crypto Market Is Missing One Ingredient Critical to Fueling Sustained Price Rally, Says Analytics Firm - The Daily Hodl


								Despite some bullish developments, the digital asset market still lacks one key ingredient that’s critical to fueling a sustained price rally, according to the analytics firm CryptoQuant.
CryptoQuant notes that demand is up for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).










“Bitcoin demand growth in permanent holders added 70,000 Bitcoin in the last 30 days. Large investors’ demand is up 4.4% monthly. Additionally, large investors are injecting $1 billion daily into Bitcoin, resembling 2020’s pre-rally activity…
Ethereum’s demand has also increased. Post-May 20th, ETH demand spiked due to spot ETH ETF approvals in the USA. Daily purchases by permanent holders rose to 40,000 ETH, with large investors holding 16 million ETH.”
Source: CryptoQuant/X
However, CryptoQuant notes that stablecoin liquidity needs to recover to fuel a sustained crypto rally.
“The growth in the market capitalization of Tether’s USDT, a proxy for fresh liquidity in crypto markets, has continued to decelerate and is now growing at the slowest pace since February 11. Price rallies are generally accompanied by an acceleration in stablecoin liquidity growth.”
Source: CryptoQuant/X
USDT is the top stablecoin by market cap and aims to maintain a 1:1 peg to the US dollar.
Bitcoin is trading at $70,812 at time of writing and is up nearly 4% in the past seven days.
ETH is trading at $3,809 and is up 1.5% in the past week.

Biggest Wave of Crypto IPOs Coming if Crypto Prices Continue Up (Analyst)


																As bitcoin prices approach another all-time high, the crypto industry is preparing for a potential wave of initial public offerings (IPOs), according to Bloomberg.
If crypto asset prices continue rising, the next 18 months could see the biggest wave of crypto-related IPOs on record, said Matthew Kennedy, a senior market strategist with IPO researcher Renaissance Capital, in an interview with Bloomberg on June 6.
He added that as many as 15 companies could go public if market momentum continues.
Crypto IPO Avalanche
The analyst added that even if BTC stays where it is at around $70,000, it would still spur more crypto companies to go public.
“If Bitcoin stays on its current trajectory, I am sure that would open the floodgates. If it stays at its current level, that would also support more public issues.”
Overall sentiment about crypto changed dramatically with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024, and the further green light of Ethereum ETFs four months later.




Crypto companies such as blockchain provider Chia Network and stablecoin issuer Circle have confidentially filed or submitted draft registration statements for IPOs, which could potentially happen as soon as this year. Additionally, trading platform eToro is also considering an IPO, while Animoca Brands has several potential IPO candidates waiting for 2025 or 2026.
Despite battling SEC charges, U.S. crypto exchange Kraken has long had ambitions to go public and is currently in talks to raise a pre-IPO round of capital. On June 6, CryptoPotato reported that the exchange aims to raise $100 million before the move.
Institutional investor interest in crypto is high, with nearly 40% of family offices actively investing or exploring crypto investments, reported Bloomberg. Additionally, a record 43% of US retail investors are likely to buy crypto in the next year, according to a recent Motley Fool survey.
Crypto Market Projections
While crypto market capitalization has remained flat over the past couple of days, bitcoin has been in the driving seat and has held on to gains to keep it above $70,000 and just 3.4% away from its all-time high.
Earlier this week, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki predicted that BTC would reach $350,000 by late August this year.
Meanwhile, analysts at Secure Digital Markets said, “bitcoin appears poised for a potential surge towards historic highs, with a mere 4% gap remaining.”
A move into six-figure territory for BTC is indeed likely to catalyze crypto companies to go public.

HULK Celebrity Memecoin Pumps and Dumps in Alleged Rug Pull As Hulk Hogan Claims His Accounts Were Hacked - The Daily Hodl


								Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan says that posts made to his account promoting the Solana (SOL)-based memecoin HULK yesterday were not from him.
HULK investors are reeling today after the celebrity memecoin based on Hulk Hogan’s likeness pumped to an over $17 million market cap yesterday before crashing to its current market cap of roughly $8,000, according to CoinGecko.










According to Mashable crypto reporter Matt Binder, Hogan’s X account promoted the HULK memecoin through several posts yesterday. During that time, the token pumped to a multi-million dollar market cap before crashing down to earth. Hogan later claimed the posts were not from him.
Source: Hulk Hogan via Matt Binder/X
According to Binder, there were also several red flags about the HULK posts on Hogan’s account.
“There were signs that something was off with HULK.
For example, this tweet included a video of Hulk Hogan seemingly endorsing the memecoin to prove it was legit.
But the video is actually from a Dec 2023 video promoting a karaoke night & makes zero actual references to crypto.”

Ethena Expands USDe Into Aave As ‘Asset Matures’ - The Defiant

Users can now deposit stETH, weETH, ETH and WBTC on Aave to borrow stablecoins into Ethena USDe or sUSDe.Ethena Labs, issuer of the fourth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, continues to broaden USDe’s reach in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and has integrated with the industry’s largest lending platform, Aave.According to Ethena’s team, users can now deposit USDe and loop their position with other stablecoins on Aave, and deposit stETH, weETH, ETH and WBTC on Aave to borrow stablecoins into Ethena USDe or sUSDe. Users will also unlock long delta exposure to tokens such as ETH while providing liquidity into Ethena.Additionally users will be able to earn Sats for posting USDe collateral (20x multiplier), sUSDe collateral (10x, although it needs to be confirmed via a governance vote), stETH, ETH, rETH, and weETH collateral to borrow GHO into USDe (10x) among other bonuses.'More Mature'“After a quarter, the asset is more mature and has been deemed acceptable to be onboarded with caps and inside isolation mode,” Marc Zeller of the Aave Chan Initiative said. He told The Defiant there was no pushback from the community “at all,” and that risk parameters are sound.His words come as a surprise, given Zeller authored a proposal in Aave’s governance forum to revoke the collateral status of DAI on Aave, when MakerDAO caused DeFi community members to clash over adding USDe as collateral in early April.Climbed the RanksThe integration is yet another power move by Ethena. Despite triggering some short-term PTSD by how its yield-bearing architecture works–through a unique blend of native staking returns, and average funding paid to shorts–users have been flocking to the protocol and its stablecoin USDe.USDe has quickly climbed the ranks and now sits in fourth place among all stablecoins by market capitalization. It has grown 42% in the past 30 days, rising from $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion.USDe Market Cap - CoinGeckoBy joining Aave, Ethena unlocks the largest lending ecosystem in the industry. Aave holds $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), which accounts for 35% of the sector, according to DefiLlama.The Ethena team explained today on X that the current borrow rates on USDC for Aave “compare favorably” to the borrow costs observed on the MorphoLabs USDe and sUSDe vaults and may provide a cheaper option to access levered exposure.Borrow rates for USDC on Aave sits at 12.8%, whereas USDe on Morpho is currently at 15.4%.

Time to Ditch Meme Stocks? | Bankless


Meme Dilution? GameStop bull “Roaring Kitty” was briefly a billionaire on paper last night after the price of GME surged to nearly $70, but a stock split announcement this morning reversed his fortunes and those of retail traders following his bet! How much abuse will investors take until they turn to crypto?Roaring Kitty tweeted out an image of a green Uno reverse card this weekend before subsequently disclosing his monstrous GME position made up of 5M GME shares and 120k contracts of $20 June 21, 2024, GME calls – igniting hopes for an aggressive short squeeze and a massive pump in price.Yesterday, his YouTube account scheduled a livestream for today at 12 PM EST, which revealed little information other than a seemingly auspicious green candle and included a caption from The Babadook stating, “I’ll wager with you, I’ll make you a bet,” leading traders to speculate what his next moves would be.Plenty of market participants had understandably positioned themselves for bullishness, expecting whatever statements or actions Kitty made during the stream to catalyze another move up in price.Unfortunately for bulls, the GameStock Corporation prudently chose to capitalize on the hype by announcing the issuance of 75M shares during earnings this morning, and no new developments came from Kitty’s stream, pouring cold water on the rally.
Considering the immense flexibility corporations have in deciding to issue new stock and the contrary goals they may hold to meme stock investors, many have called into question the idea of participating in meme mania via traditional financial assets.Unlike stocks, which can be easily diluted by their issuers, many crypto tokens have hard-capped supplies or known issuance schedules.Although the supply of many tokens is known, or can at least be projected with some degree of certainty, newer memecoins have heavily concentrated supplies and have not withstood the test of time, providing little confirmation of a truly decentralized holder base and increasing the risk that buyers get dumped on.Alternatively, more established memecoins such as DOGE, possess strong guarantees of decentralization, demonstrated by their historically resilient communities which have stuck around through multiple cycles.
Despite the carefully crafted Roaring Kitty persona intended to portray Keith Gill as “just another retail investor” who enjoys cold beer, talking about basketball, and is optimistic on the long-term future of GameStop, Gill was formerly a Chief Compliance Officer at an investment advisory firm and previously bore the honorifics of CFA charterholder and FINRA licensed securities broker.Frenzy-driven, leverage-juiced buying can certainly drive up price in the short-term, but even GME is bound to trade in line with fundamentals as holders eventually cash out. Stocks represent ownership in a business, which are ultimately driven by the pursuit of maximizing value for shareholders, leading companies to raise cash via share sales as the market prices diverge from a realistic valuation.For followers of the Kitty – who seemingly has no plans at the moment other than expressing his belief in the long-term future of GME through short-dated options – it is unlikely that a major bounty awaits on the other side of this rainbow, potentially leading participants to pack it up and migrate to the crypto casino with whatever remaining funds they possess.

Bitcoin Peak of $120,000 By Late 2024, Major Alt Season To Follow: Bitfinex - Benzinga

Analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex on Friday outlined a potential Bitcoin BTC/USD peak of at least $120,000 during the current market cycle, which they expect to continue until late 2024 or early 2025.This prediction is based on historical patterns and on-chain indicators, which suggest a correlation between Bitcoin’s halving event and its subsequent price peak. While some analysts project higher price targets, Bitfinex emphasizes the importance of reacting to market movements rather than relying on long-term predictions. They also acknowledge the growing investment in alternative crypto assets, potentially influencing Bitcoin’s dominance.Metrics Suggest Room For Growth:The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a key metric used to gauge market sentiment, currently sits at 2.56. Historically, Bitcoin market tops have occurred when this ratio exceeds 3.2.This suggests there may be room for further price appreciation before a potential correction.Altcoin Season On The Horizon:The Bitfinex report predicts a significant altcoin season coinciding with Bitcoin’s peak. Sectors poised for strong performance include Decentralized Finance (DeFi), fueled by ongoing innovation and adoption. Additionally, AI and meme coins are expected to remain prominent narratives throughout the cycle. Real-World Assets (RWAs) are also highlighted as a potential growth area.Also Read: Bitcoin Spikes To $72K, Then Drops $1,300 Following US Employment Report: What Happened?Potential Challenges For The Market:The report identifies several factors that could trigger a crypto winter, a period of prolonged market decline. These include:
Regulatory Crackdowns: Increased government scrutiny and stricter regulations could dampen investor confidence and lead to sell-offs.



Macroeconomic Factors: A significant global economic downturn or major financial crisis could negatively impact the crypto market.



Market Saturation: As prices reach unsustainable levels, a natural correction driven by profit-taking and market saturation is expected.
On-Chain Indicators Provide Guidance:While acknowledging the limitations of long-term price predictions, Bitfinex analysts emphasize the importance of using historically relevant metrics. They highlight key on-chain indicators such as the MVRV ratio, hash rate stability, and realized cap HODL waves to gauge market sentiment and investor behavior.Looking Ahead:The Bitfinex report offers a valuable perspective on the potential trajectory of the cryptocurrency market. With Bitcoin poised for continued growth and altcoins positioned to capitalize, investors face both exciting opportunities and potential challenges.Interested in delving deeper into the future of Bitcoin, altcoins, and the evolving regulatory landscape?

Rune Christensen Explains Why He Wants to Remake Maker and Kill DAI

Yeah, but again it comes back to whether it has some kind of legitimate use. The point is if you're making it easy to do bad things with this technology. There is no privacy on the blockchain, right? Everything is totally transparent. You have Chainalysis monitoring everything. Mixers thwart that. The best example of all is the banking system, because this is happening all the time at a much greater scale. You can be fully anonymous in crypto if you're just smart enough. But in the banking system, it's actually pretty easy because you just need to bribe a few corrupt bankers or something like that. It's pretty straightforward. So the thing that would get risky for us, even though I think, again, that there is a moral obligation to figure out how to do this in a way that doesn't just disproportionately benefit criminals, is to build a privacy solution into a decentralized currency.

It's Time To Go Long On Bitcoin and Shitcoins: Arthur Hayes - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsRecent policy moves from global central banks suggest that the time has come to ape into Bitcoin and high-conviction shitcoins, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.Earlier this week, both the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank became the first G7 countries to lower their benchmark interest rates, which neither region has done in several years. According to Hayes, those pivotal moves will “catapult crypto out of the northern hemispheric summer doldrums.”“The trend is clear. Central banks at the margin are starting easing cycles,” the 39-year-old entrepreneur wrote in a Thursday post. “We know how to play this game… Go long Bitcoin and subsequently shitcoins.”As for his personal portfolio, Hayes said he would be rotating out of Ethena’s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe and back into “conviction shitcoins”–near-zero value tokens and meme coins—which he said he will name only after he’s done buying them.“For the Maelstrom portfolio projects, who asked for my opinion on whether to launch their tokens now or later, I say, Let’s Fucking Go!” he added.Historically speaking, both stocks and Bitcoin tend to perform well when central banks drive down borrowing costs. One example lies in Bitcoin’s climb from under $4000 to $64,000 between March 2020 and April 2021, right after the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate to 0.25%.Most analysts and market participants don’t believe the Fed will follow its global neighbors with an immediate rate cut at its June meeting, however, given that inflation is proving more persistent in the United States.Still, Hayes argues that the U.S. central bank is under immense geopolitical pressure to devalue the dollar in order to provide relative strength to the Japanese Yen. As such, a rate cut will likely arrive soon–just not during election season while inflation is such a hot political topic.By contrast, Hayes says the Bank of England will likely surprise the world with a rate cut on June 20, following orders from the United States to keep the yen strong.“Suffice it to say, the crypto bull is reawakening and is about to gore the hides of profligate central bankers,” Hayes concluded.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Iggy Azalea Insists She’s No Rug-Puller as Her Token Surges 1,000% in Week


After returning to the limelight with her headline-grabbing meme coin, Australian rapper Iggy Azalea now insists that she is no rug-puller in a recent interview with Fortune. In fact, she wants to find potential use cases for her viral Mother Iggy (MOTHER) cryptocurrency that could make it viable in the long term. Azalea intends to turn the memecoin into a stablecoin, according to her Fortune interview.  The Australian rapper, who became the ultimate it-girl of 2014 with her smash hit "Fancy" and other highly successful singles, claims that she had been casually observing crypto since 2020 before eventually launching her own coin. Azalea was forced to act after a fraudster was trying to push another meme coin by impersonating her.  The MOTHER meme coin, which was launched in late May, generated plenty of buzz because of its massive gains and Azalea's frequent social media posts that ranged from raunchy pictures to hilarious memes. On Thursday, the market cap of Solana-based MOTHER surged to nearly $250 million after a whale snapped up a large number of tokens. However, despite all the hype, Iggy Azalea's token lacks any value proposition like most meme coins. Unsurprisingly, the cryptocurrency has already attracted plenty of detractors, including none other than Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. As reported by U.Today, Buterin lambasted the new crop of celebrity meme coins due to their lack of utility, prompting a swift response from Azalea in the form of a belittling meme. However, Azalea is seemingly unfazed by all the criticism, arguing that peace is not profitable for meme coins and telling haters to get out of her way.

Shiba Inu On The Verge Of Triangle Breakout, Here's Key Levels To Watch | Bitcoinist.com


								As top coins like Shiba Inu continue to gain traction in the midst of heightened optimism surrounding meme coins, cryptocurrency analyst and trader YG Crypto has shared insights on SHIB price action, predicting a potential Triangle breakout for the digital asset.
Incoming Triangle Breakout For Shiba Inu
A Triangle pattern is represented by drawing trendlines that imply a pause in the current trend along a converging price range. The pattern is called a Triangle due to its resemblance to a triangle shape.

Technical analysts classify these as either reversals or continuation patterns of an established trend. However, even though this is a continuation, traders should wait for breakouts to move in or out of a position.
YG Crypto analysis indicates SHIB could be set for a decisive and significant price movement, citing few resistance levels to look out for. It is consistent with the general sentiment of the market, which is getting more upbeat about SHIB’s chances of making a big move soon.
SHIB could be poised for a Triangle breakout | Source: YG Crypto on X
According to the expert, a brief decline was experienced by Shiba Inu below support, which resulted in several stop-loss orders. However, the price has since rebounded, displaying a robust move on the upside as bulls are charging back, signaling an impending potential triangle breakout for SHIB.
The post read:
Shiba Inu (SHIB) took a temporary dip below support, triggering some stop-loss orders. But hold on, bulls are charging back. The price is showing a strong upward move, and a potential triangle breakout looms.
As a result, YG Crypto has pointed out some resistance levels to pay attention to between the $0.00002810 and $0.00002880 threshold. Furthermore, YG Crypto claims a decisive break above this range can indicate a substantial rise in prices in the coming days.
Delving on the next move of the triangle pattern, YG Crypto noted that the move in its entirety will probably determine whether the price can break through the aforementioned resistance zone. While a rejection at the range can result in a price reversal, a breakout from the area points to an uptrend that will likely hold.
SHIB Large Transaction Sees Uptick
YG Crypto’s bullish prediction coincides with a notable rise in SHIB’s price on Thursday as whales‘ interest has grown. However, today, the digital asset appears to have lost momentum, as SHIB witnessed a sharp decline from $0.00002615 to $0.00002502.

Santiment, a market intelligence platform, reported a surge in transactions involving the popular meme coin this week. Data from the platform shows that compared to the usual averages so far this year, the number of Shiba Inu transactions involving $100,000 or more has more than doubled this week, signaling massive accumulation from SHIB enthusiasts.
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.00002512, indicating a decline of 1.93% in the past day. Its market cap and trading volume have also seen negative sentiment, dropping by 1.93% and 32%, respectively, in the last 24 hours.

Inverted Hammer Appears On The XRP Price Chart, Crypto Analyst Picks First Target Of $0.75


																Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has revealed a bullish pattern that recently formed on the XRP price chart. The analyst also revealed how high the crypto token could rise once it makes this move to the upside.  
Inverted Hammer Forms On The Chart
Egrag highlighted an Inverted hammer that had formed on XRP’s chart while noting how bullish this was for the crypto token. He claimed that last month’s candle formation showed a 75% Inverted Hammer at the bottom, which is “super bullish” for XRP. Egrag believes this is an “amazing sign” that the altcoin could rise to $0.75 soon enough. He added that July will be a “month of fireworks” for XRP.

XRP’s possible rise to $0.75 is significant, as Egrag had previously highlighted that price level as a “critical breakout point” for XRP. Back then, he mentioned that XRP was “poised” to achieve this breakout in the coming weeks. He suggested an XRP breakout above that price level would send it to $1.5, and the crypto token could enjoy a further upward trend to $7.5. 
Crypto analyst CasiTrades also recently provided a bullish narrative for the altcoin. She stated that the crypto token is maintaining its bullish momentum and bouncing off the 0.382 retracement level. The analyst added that XRP has finally flipped a trendline that had acted as resistance for months to support.
Source: X
Meanwhile, CasiTrades highlighted $0.54 as a price level to keep an eye on, stating that XRP could encounter resistance at that level. She suggested that the coin could enjoy a parabolic move if it breaks out above that price level, remarking that it is a “crucial level to watch for a potential breakthrough.”CasiTrades previously raised the possibility of the altcoin rising to as high as $80 when it breaks out from a consolidation triangle. 
XRP Is On The Brink Of A Parabolic Rally
Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto recently suggested that XRP was on the brink of a parabolic rally. He stated in an X post that the token is currently at the level it was in 2017 and 2020, which triggered a “massive rally” for the crypto token on both occasions. In 2017, the altcoin enjoyed a price gain of 61,000% in 280 days.

The chart that Mikybull Crypto shared showed that the altcoin could rise to as high as $5. Meanwhile, crypto analyst XRP Captain claimed that the altcoin was ready for the “massive breakout.” He claimed that XRP is in the “middle of apex. ” Crypto analyst Jaydee also agreed with XRP Captain that a breakout is imminent, stating that “it’s coming,” although he claimed that “beginners” will miss out on the run.
At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.52, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Binance Launchpool Rolls Out Support for New Solana-Based AI Computing Altcoin - The Daily Hodl


								Binance is adding the token of a Solana (SOL)-powered decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) computing network to the roster of supported crypto assets on its Launchpool platform.
In a statement, the world’s largest crypto exchange says that io.net (IO) will be the 55th crypto project on Binance Launchpool, which allows users to deposit their coins into a pool of funds to earn assets from new projects.










Binance says users will be able to stake BNB and the stablecoin First Digital USD (FDUSD) into separate pools to farm IO tokens over four days starting on June 7th. IO will then be listed on June 11th.
According to io.net, it is creating an enterprise-grade decentralized computing network that allows machine learning engineers to access distributed cloud clusters at a lower cost.
The aim is to address the challenges of relying on traditional cloud service providers that have 2.5x less capacity than the estimated market demand, which causes problems such as high costs, limited choices and longer waiting times to access hardware with cloud services.
Reads the io.net website,
“We believe that compute is this generation’s “digital oil,” powering a never-before-seen technological industrial revolution. Our vision is to build IO to be the currency of compute, powering an ecosystem of products and services that enable access to compute as a resource and as an asset.”
Binance says it will attach a seed tag to IO, which indicates that the token has higher volatility and risks than other crypto assets listed on its platform.

Memecoin That’s Shot Up More Than 61,000% in Eight Months Will Go ‘Berserk,’ Says Crypto Trader - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says one meme asset that has seen tremendous gains over the last eight months will continue its upward momentum.
In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 217,000 followers on the social media platform X that memecoin MAGA (TRUMP) will go “berserk” even though it experienced a slight pullback.










“TRUMP: this is still one of my bags and this is pulled back to the .50 [fibonacci level], I think I’m going to add to my position around here. Still bullish with this overall narrative going into [the] election and TRUMP will be talked about often by mainstream media. This goes berserk later too, in my opinion.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
The trader’s chart indicates that TRUMP could hit the $18 price tag by the end of June or the start of July. TRUMP is trading for $12.43 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours. On October 7th, it was valued at $0.0199, meaning it has seen a staggering gain of 61,759% since.
The analyst goes on to mention Notcoin (NOT), another red hot altcoin, saying that it’s forming a pattern that is indicative of a top.
 “NOT: I’ve since changed my mind. The price action has calmed down and there’s a lot less volatility. I think that this looks a lot better now- you can see more of a consolidation pattern instead of huge spikes in both directions (which is more indicative of a top).”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
NOT is trading for $0.0215 at time of writing, an increase of over 300% from its price of $0.00527 set on May 26th.
Altcoin Sherpa concludes his analysis by advising investors to accumulate “shitcoins” from now until Q4 of 2024 as he believes Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance level will lower by then, paving the way for altcoins to print gains.
 “You should probably accumulate shitcoins from now until late Q4. Hard to say what the particular timing is but most altcoin/BTC pairs are going to continue to go down in my opinion, but once Q4 rolls around, expecting BTC.d to come down and for there to be some alt action.”

Norwegian Government Says It Recovered Large Amount of This Altcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


The Norwegian government has successfully frozen and returned $5.7 million in funds linked to the infamous Ronin (RON) hack in 2022. This vulnerability, which led to a staggering loss of over $600 million, remains the largest DeFi vulnerability in history.
Ronin, an Ethereum sidechain, was developed to support the popular play-to-win web3 game Axie Infinity (AXS) developed by Sky Mavis. The funds were recovered through a coordinated effort involving law enforcement, lawyers, accountants and blockchain criminal firms such as Chainalysis.


The Norwegian National Agency for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crimes (Økokrim) played a key role in the recovery of the stolen assets. In a recent post, Sky Mavis expressed her gratitude to everyone involved in the rescue effort, specifically mentioning Økokrim and the FBI in the USA.

Sky Mavis confirmed that 15% of the recovered funds will be used to cover expenses, while the rest will be deposited into the Axie Infinity treasury. They also stated that a separate $40 million worth of assets have been frozen by law enforcement authorities, but it may take some time for these assets to be recovered.





The Ronin attack, which took place in March 2022, was linked to North Korea's Lazarus Group, which is also suspected of other notable attacks, including the $100 million Harmony bridge attack in January 2023. However, Sky Mavis was unable to provide a specific timeline for the return of frozen assets at this stage.

US National Debt Hits All-Time High of $34,667,000,000,000 As CBO Warns Rising Debt Will Reduce Americans' Income - The Daily Hodl


								The US national debt just hit a new all-time high of $34.667 trillion.
New numbers from the Treasury Department’s Debt to the Penny system show the country’s national debt reached the milestone on Friday, May 31st.










That’s a $677 billion increase from the start of 2024, when the nation’s debt stood at $33.990 trillion.
The new record high comes amid a report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warning that the greater the nation’s debt, the less money Americans will earn.
“The current law debt trajectory will reduce income growth by 12% over the next three decades and 13% annually by Fiscal Year (FY) 2049. 
Rapidly rising debt could reduce income growth by 33% over the next three decades and 42% annually by FY 2049. 
Rapidly rising debt would reduce projected income by about $14,500 per person in FY 2054, in today’s dollars.”
The CBO says the reduction in household income is due to “crowding out,”  an economic theory that traces how high debt and deficits slow economic growth on national and individual level.
“…High debt and deficits carry significant risks and threats to the budget and the economy. 
High and rising debt hinders economic growth by crowding out investments, pushes up interest rates, strains the federal budget through rising interest payments, creates geopolitical challenges and risks, makes responding to new emergencies more challenging, imposes burdens on future generations, and increases the risk of a fiscal crisis.”
