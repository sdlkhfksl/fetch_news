X platform user calling himself DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) and one of the X team members has published a post, stating that “2024 will be the year of 𝕏 Payments.” This triggered an enthusiastic response from the crypto community based on this popular social media platform and average X users.Hope for DOGE payments on X arise from ashesThis announcement follows the news of X owner tech centibillionaire Elon Musk securing licenses for payment processing and money transmitter operations in three new US states. The authorities of Illinois, Oregon and New Mexico granted the necessary approvals to Musk’s company a week ago.As the list of these granted permissions grows bigger, hopes of Musk finally implementing cryptocurrency-powered payments on the X platform have been reignited. In particular, this is true about the iconic meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE), of which Musk is a loyal fan.Even before he purchased Twitter in 2022 and rebranded it as X a year later, he spoke during podcasts that DOGE seems like an ideal means of payments on the social media behemoth, as well as a way to reward content creators.DOGE price jumps 44% in anticipationSince March 20, when the aforementioned news about X securing new licenses spread around the crypto space, the Dogecoin price has shown a staggering increase by more than 44%.DOGE gradually surged from $0.1291 to the $0.1863 level where the popular meme coin is changing hands at the time of this writing.In the meantime, a recent report shows that Dogecoin open interest has reached an astounding $1.26 million. Even if Elon Musk has not been speaking openly about DOGE as of late, the analyst believes that the tech mogul and X developments remain the main drivers behind the DOGE price.In particular, it says, the massive rise of the open interest above $1.26 billion has been triggered by the obtaining of the above-mentioned new licenses for the X platform. A chart shared by the source shows that the rise in the open interest started on the day when the news came out – on March 20. If X starts utilizing Dogecoin for internal payments and for tipping, it will be a great expansion of DOGE adoption and will certainly have a tremendous impact on the meme coin’s price.

Finance Guru Reveals Why Bitcoin Is The ‘Perfect Asset At The Right Time’ | Bitcoinist.com


								Robert Kiyosaki, the best-selling author of the popular book, ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ has hailed Bitcoin as the perfect asset. Delving into the digital asset’s distinctive qualities, the financial expert offers a comprehensive comparison between BTC and traditional fiat currencies through a question-and-answer format. 
Bitcoin As The Perfect Asset
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Kiyosaki posed a series of questions about Bitcoin, accompanied by answers to each query. When he questioned his stance on BTC, the finance guru unequivocally declared himself a Bitcoin bull, affirming his admiration for the cryptocurrency. 

He characterized Bitcoin as the “perfect asset at the right time,” because of its high value and potential in today’s economic and financial landscape. 
According to the financial author, BTC could be a scam or a Ponzi Scheme. However, the same could be said about most of the traditional fiat currencies in the world such as the United States Dollar (USD), Euro, Yen and others. 
Kiyosaki has branded fiat currencies as “fake,” shedding light on the inconsistencies in the US government’s efforts to stimulate economic and financial growth. The finance expert criticized US political leaders, denouncing them as “incompetent or corrupt or both,” while outlining the economic challenges such as debt and inflation faced by the US. 
Despite his pessimistic assessment of fiat currencies, Kiyosaki has remained optimistic about Bitcoin. The financial guru has heralded Bitcoin as a strong network, highlighting that he was super bullish on the cryptocurrency because it applied Metcalf’s law, which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its user base. In other words, as more people use Bitcoin, its overall value increases. 
Kiyosaki’s Advice To The Crypto Community
In his post, Kiyosaki advises the broader crypto community against investing their funds in the US dollar, urging them instead to save in more valuable and tangible assets like silver, gold and Bitcoin. He emphasized that individuals who saved in “fake money” were at a disadvantage, highlighting the risks associated with investing in a currency vulnerable to inflationary pressures.

Further stressing his views on BTC, Kiyosaki acknowledged the possibility of the cryptocurrency’s future value diminishing to zero. However, he noted that fiat currencies could face a similar risk, highlighting the historical depreciation of thousands of fiat currencies to zero. 
As a result, the financial guru has encouraged investors to safeguard their funds by investing in real-world assets like Bitcoin. He has predicted the price of Bitcoin to soar to $100,000 within six months, anticipating the cryptocurrency to potentially rise to this value by September 2024. This forecast underscores the financial author’s bullish outlook on Bitcoin and his unwavering endorsement of the cryptocurrency’s potential.

U.S. Judge Rules SEC Lawsuit Against Coinbase Can Move Forward - The Defiant

The judge has ruled that through its staking program, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered intermediary of securities.A federal judge in Manhattan on Wednesday ruled the case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto exchange Coinbase can move forward.According to the ruling by Judge Katherine Polk, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered intermediary of securities–thanks in large part to the “well-pleaded allegations” of the Complaint by the SEC.“The Court finds that the SEC adequately alleges that Coinbase, through its staking program, engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities,” read the latest ruling.The lawsuit was filed on June 6 by the SEC, which argued that the largest exchange in the country was violating the nation’s securities rules and regulations.Coinbase WinCoinbase did score a win today, however. Polk sided with the company in dismissing the claim that the company acts as an unregistered broker by offering its Coinbase Wallet.Chief Legal Officer for Coinbase, Paul Grewal, posted on X today that the company was expecting the ruling, claiming early motions against government agencies are “almost always denied.”Grewal also called out lawmakers in Congress, encouraging the body to build on the momentum from last year regarding digital asset legislation, especially “If we want innovation to remain in the U.S.”The SEC has been on a tirade against the crypto industry, including court cases against Binance, and a number of tokens the agency called unregistered securities.The Coinbase versus the SEC case will now face a jury, although no date has been set for when court proceedings will commence. Both parties have until April 19 to propose a case management plan, said the judge.

Why is 2140 the end of bitcoin inflation? - Blockworks


It’s well known that the Bitcoin network experiences a halving of supply approximately every four years. Less appreciated is that these are set to continue for over a century into the future.
Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto programmed the year 2140 — 30 halvings from now — as the year that the block rewards (the subsidy paid to miners for processing transactions into blocks) would drop to less than one satoshi, the smallest unit of bitcoin.
The use of the term “satoshi” — equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin (or 0.00000001 BTC) — emerged organically among early Bitcoin users and developers, appearing in various forums and discussions starting in 2010 or 2011, and became widely accepted in 2013.
Read more: The Bitcoin halving is about a month away — here’s what you can expect
The halving is modeled after the physical mining of scarce resources, according to Jameson Lopp, co-founder and chief security officer at Casa.
“There’s nothing special about the year 2140,” Lopp told Blockworks. “It’s just how the nature of halvings along with the level of precision of satoshis ended up working out.”
Lopp notes that Nakamoto explained the supply schedule to Mike Hearn, a former Google engineer who became an early Bitcoin contributor, in 2009:
“My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess,” Satoshi wrote. “I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard.”
Read more: Satoshi warned against labeling bitcoin as an ‘investment’
He picked 21 million, but Satoshi added that the divisibility of a bitcoin in practice could be represented differently depending on how valuable one bitcoin gets. “For example, if 0.001 is worth one euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had one bitcoin it’s now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as one.”
For what it’s worth, 0.001 BTC is worth about 65 euros (approximately $70) today.
Why the rate of issuance would decline for 132 years, however, was never explained.
“I expect it was more of a ‘better safe than sorry’ decision to give the system decades to bootstrap,” Lopp said.
Unless the price of bitcoin (BTC) doubles every four years, each halving brings less income from block rewards to miners. So to maintain the network’s hashrate, which is important for Bitcoin’s security, transaction fees will become more important over time.
Whether that will happen in practice remains to be seen, but Lopp is optimistic.
“I expect that as we see the multi-layered Bitcoin ecosystem continue to expand, the base chain will start to look more and more like a high-value cryptographic accumulator and it will make economic sense for on-chain transactions to pay relatively high fees,” he said.

PlanB's Poll Shows Strong Belief in Bitcoin's $100k Milestone by 2024


																With the Bitcoin halving drawing near, market participants are contemplating whether the asset has reached its peak or if there’s further room for growth and when the next upward shift might transpire.
Following a breather from a powerful uptrend, Bitcoin is slowly regaining its strength again as it trades above $69k. However, market participants remain optimistic about BTC’s trajectory and are confident that the leading crypto asset will claim a milestone by the end of this year.
According to PlanB’s latest poll on X (formerly Twitter), a staggering 71.9% of respondents anticipate Bitcoin reaching $100k by 2024, demonstrating bullish sentiment.
Meanwhile, 18.1% foresee this milestone in 2025, with only a modest 5.1% expecting it in 2026 or beyond. Surprisingly, a mere 4.9% doubt that the world’s largest crypto will ever achieve the coveted $100k mark.






The result does not seem far-fetched, considering there are multiple bullish catalysts at play.
For one, the Coinbase Premium Index has also flipped positive, which is indicative of renewed interest from both retail and institutional investors in the United States.
Spot Bitcoin ETF is also seeing notable inflows while new players are gearing up to offer similar products.
For example, asset management company Hashdex announced that it was venturing into the US spot Bitcoin ETF scene by converting its futures ETF to hold spot Bitcoin primarily.
Rebranded as the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, it will predominantly allocate its assets to spot Bitcoin, with a minor portion invested in Bitcoin futures contracts.
Earlier this week, renowned author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Robert Kiyosaki, also advocated for Bitcoin as the top investment choice while simultaneously criticizing the US dollar for its fundamental flaws.

Shiba Inu Climbs To Second Spot In Crypto Searches As SHIB Rallies


                            The ever-vibrant Shiba Inu community is thriving once more as SHIB gains widespread recognition surpassing top cryptocurrency assets in the market to become the second most sought-after digital asset in the entire European continent, securing its stance in the crypto landscape.
Shiba Inu Takes Europe By Storm
XRP enthusiast and market expert Marcel Knobloch, also known as Collin Brown, reported the coin’s latest milestone on X. According to Brown, Shiba Inu has seen significant growth in its long-term investor base, taking Europe by storm by becoming the second most search crypto in the continent.
Brown noted that the milestone is reminiscent of the peak of 2021, having rallied a startling 300% in just 8 days. SHIB’s interest is not limited to Europe, and it has taken the top spot on search charts all the way from Italy to Nigeria.

As a result of the development, WazirX’s poll has crowned SHIB the king of meme cryptos. Thus, Collin Brown has urged the cryptocurrency space to watch out for Shiba Inu, noting that the Shiba pack is at the forefront of the race.
The rankings were determined following a comprehensive analysis of Google Trends data in the past 1 year in order to ascertain the cryptocurrency that, based on searches, each nation in Europe desires to invest in. After gathering collective data, the findings showed a noteworthy pattern that indicated changes in people’s interest in the crypto market.
Shiba Inu went past notable coins like Ethereum (ETH) – the second largest crypto asset, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) – the largest meme coin, securing the top pick in about 7 European countries. These include Russia, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and among others. 
Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) – the largest crypto asset remains the most searched coin in the continent acquiring top choice in about 21 European nations, such as Poland, Germany, Belgium, Romania, etc.
Latest Milestone Buttresses SHIB’s Price
SHIB’s recent achievement displays a constant rise in its interest, reflecting the trust of its community members around the world. In addition to bolstering SHIB’s standing, this ranking indicates that European investors are considering adopting the token even more.

Following the project’s landmark, the Ethereum-based memecoin has managed to secure gains of over 18% in the past week. SHIB has experienced a rebound to the $0.000030 threshold, after falling as low as $0.000025 during the start of the week. With the memecoin market demonstrating momentum presently, SHIB might be poised for more significant gains in the coming months.
Consequently, SHIB’s rise to the aforementioned price has taken advantage of the market’s general recovery and its seven-day upswing. As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.0000305, indicating a decline of 1% in the past day. Meanwhile, its trading volume and market cap have decreased by over 1% and 16%, respectively.

Casa's multi-key solution for tackling self-custody Bitcoin inheritance

Bitcoin self-custody firm Casa is rolling out an inheritance feature aimed at streamlining the transfer of assets to benefactors from deceased estates.The inheritance of cryptocurrencies can be a complicated process, even more so if the owner of the digital assets has not made any provisions for their families or designated recipients to take control.Nick Neuman, co-founder and CEO of Casa, tells Cointelegraph that the inheritance of cryptocurrencies has long been an issue for crypto-natives looking to ensure that their digital holdings are passed on accordingly.“It’s not overlooked. Many people recognize it as a big problem they want to solve but they haven’t had good tools to solve it yet, so most people either don’t have a solution, or have cobbled together something that they hope will work but don’t feel good about,” Neuman said. Casa has offered an inheritance feature to its highest membership tier in the U.S. for the past few years. Neuman said the new offering will be available to all Casa members and differs from the existing high-tier feature, allowing users to transfer Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC) holdings to benefactors.Related: Casa Releases Self-Custody Bitcoin Wallet Focused on PrivacyThe offering aims to ensure that the process of managing cryptocurrency holdings of deceased individuals is straightforward, secure and resistant to malicious actors. Neuman said that instances where inheritance plans have not been made have been “precarious and stressful,” adding:“When we’ve tried to help recover assets for people who don’t have an inheritance plan and have passed away, it has taken anywhere from 6-12 months to figure everything out. Even then, the chance of actually recovering the assets is low.”The offering hinges on a Casa’s user designating a recipient to a specific token vault in its proprietary app. The recipient then creates a free Casa account and scans a QR code provided by the vault owner, which contains an encrypted version of the owner’s mobile key. Related: Casa launches multisignature Ethereum self-custody vaultThe key can only be imported by the specified account and the recipient can’t initially use it or see the vault balance as Neuman explains:“If the vault owner passes away, the recipient can request access to the vault in their Casa app. This starts a six month timer, and sends a ton of notifications every month to the owner.”If the owner is still alive, they can reject the request in their app. If the timer runs out after six months, the recipient can use the shared mobile key and request a signature from the Casa Recovery Key for the shared vault. This will give them 2 out of 3 signatures required to access the asset.Casa's inheritance feature allows a vault owner to assign encrypted keys to benefactors to access assets after their death. Source: CasaCasa will also offer a five-key vault, where one hardware key is shared with the recipient. The small increase in friction for recipients adds increased security and resilience of a five-key vault for larger holdings.Best guess estimates pin the value of lost Bitcoin at around $140 billion, of which misplaced keys are often a cause. Since its inception in 2016, Casa has promoted multisignature self-custody in the crypto industry. Its flagship Bitcoin vault allows users to store the cryptocurrency using up to five keys for more distributed security. Casa’s service originally catered to Bitcoin “whales” willing to spend $10,000 a year on custody before opening its service to a broader base of users. The company has now added an Ether vault to its platform, with ETH holders also able to use up to five keys to secure their holdings.Magazine: ‘SEAL 911’ team of white hats formed to fight crypto hacks in real time

The USDC balances on Coinbase are increasing.

In a strategic move aimed at taking advantage of lower fees and faster settlement times, Coinbase, one of the leading crypto exchanges, is gearing up to store a greater number of corporate and customer USDC balances on Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. 
The decision comes as Base’s Total Value Locked (TVL) surpasses the impressive milestone of 1 billion dollars, indicating a significant increase in user deposits and activities within the ecosystem.

USDC Balances Increasing on Coinbase
Branzburg, vice president and head of consumer products at Coinbase, highlighted the benefits of using Base infrastructure, stating: “This allows us to manage and protect customer funds with lower fees and faster settlement times, without any impact on the Coinbase user experience”. 
The move underscores Coinbase’s commitment to leveraging innovative solutions to improve operational efficiency and provide a seamless experience to its users.
The announcement was positively received, with Base collaborator Jesse Pollak expressing enthusiasm and support for Coinbase’s decision. Pollak described the move as “grounded” and said he was excited to continue assisting Coinbase in its journey towards harnessing blockchain technology.
Base, built on the open-source OP Stack, has seen a significant surge in its Total Value Locked, reaching over 1 billion dollars. Defi Llama data reveals that user deposits on Base have more than doubled since the beginning of the month, going from 470 million dollars to over 1 billion. 
This exponential growth highlights the increasing adoption and trust in Base’s capabilities as a Layer 2 scalability solution for Ethereum.
A significant portion of Base TVL can be attributed to the decentralized exchange Aerodrome, which has seen exponential growth since the beginning of February. The surge in transaction activity on Base, especially compared to other optimistic rollups like Arbitrum, highlights the increasing traction and utility of the platform in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
While Base has seen a surge in the number of transactions, the daily transaction volume of OP Mainnet has recorded a more modest increase. This divergence in transaction activity highlights the unique value proposition offered by Layer 2 solutions like Base, which prioritize scalability, lower fees, and faster transaction settlement times.
The reason behind Coinbase’s decision
The decision by Coinbase to store a greater number of USDC balances on Base is indicative of a broader trend towards adopting blockchain-based solutions for financial infrastructures. By leveraging the capabilities of Layer 2 scaling solutions, companies like Coinbase can streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency.
Furthermore, Coinbase’s approval of Base could potentially pave the way for greater adoption by other companies and institutions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As more entities recognize the benefits of on-chain solutions like Base, it is expected that momentum towards mainstream acceptance and use of blockchain technology will accelerate.
In conclusion, Coinbase’s decision to increase USDC balances on Base underscores the platform’s commitment to innovation and efficiency in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. 
With Base’s total locked value surpassing one billion dollars and transaction activity on the rise, the collaboration between Coinbase and Base marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a more scalable, efficient, and inclusive financial ecosystem powered by blockchain technology. 
As the sector continues to mature, we expect to see further advancements and partnerships aimed at unlocking the full potential of decentralized finance.

Sam Bankman-Fried to be sentenced in FTX collapse: What to know

Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency executive, will receive his prison sentence on Thursday. If prosecutors get what they want, the former CEO of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX could serve 40 to 50 years in prison. Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?Here’s what you should know.Who is Sam Bankman-Fried?Sam Bankman-Fried, also known as “SBF,” launched the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2019, and it went bankrupt in 2022. Born in 1992 in California, he grew up in an academic family, with both of his parents professors at Stanford Law School.He earned a physics degree with a minor in mathematics from MIT in 2014. While in the program, he worked as an intern in 2013 for the trading firm Jane Street Capital in New York. It was there that he met Caroline Ellison, who later became his girlfriend. Ellison would become the CEO of Alameda Research, a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm and SBF’s first company, founded in 2017. It was later discovered that he built FTX to support Alameda’s trading business.What was FTX?Bankman-Fried co-founded the crypto exchange FTX in 2019 with American computer programmer Gary Wang. As the covid-19 pandemic later boosted cryptocurrency trading worldwide, FTX rode the wave. In 2020, FTX purchased Blockfolio, the market’s leading mobile news and portfolio tracking app, for $150 million. SBF appeared as a speaker at various crypto and blockchain conferences, attracting a large following.How did it collapse, and what happened next?In November 2022, the crypto news website CoinDesk reported on FTX’s poor balance sheet and liquidity crisis. Big names such as cryptocurrency exhange Binance opted not to provide any support to FTX or Bankman-Fried.The cryptocurrency exchange collapsed overnight, resulting in a loss of $10 billion in customer funds. This had a ripple effect on other crypto companies, throwing them into financial turmoil.Several companies with direct or indirect connections to FTX — including BlockFi, Voyager, Celsius, Genesis, and Gemini — went bankrupt in a matter of weeks. The cryptocurrency market saw its darkest period to-date, resulting in a loss of more than $1 trillion, and Bitcoin’s price dropped below $18,000.What was Sam Bankman-Fried convicted of?Once a crypto icon, Sam Bankman-Fried became a fraudster. Federal prosecutors filed both criminal and civil charges against Sam Bankman-Fried and other top FTX executives in late 2022. They were accused of misappropriating $10 billion in customer deposits and with generating false financial statements.The court appearances of FTX’s top executives attracted widespread attention — as did their romantic lives.In November of 2023, a federal jury in New York convicted Bankman-Fried of fraud for stealing at least $10 billion from customers and investors.What sentences are prosecutors and defense lawyers seeking?When he returns to court today, Bankman-Fried will be sentenced. Prosecutors are seeking 40-50 years in prison, while Bankman-Fried’s lawyers are asking for only 5-6 years in prison. His lawyers have cited medical conditions including neurodiversity and autism, making him “uniquely vulnerable in a prison population,” as well as Bankman-Fried’s desire to make “the world a better place” and his remorse over the collapse of the crypto exchange.

KuCoin, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has reported a staggering outflow of $1.78 billion from the Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains.According to on-chain analytics firm Nansen, there has been an outflow of over $842 million on Ethereum and $938 million on EVM chains over the last 24 hours, amounting to a total of $1.78 billion.Estimated from an initial $6 billion base in holdings, this represents more than a 15% drop in assets held by the exchange. According to Nansen, a look at chains beyond Ethereum and other chains like Bitcoin and Solana indicated a drop of $818 million.Since the news broke that KuCoin and two of its founders had been charged with breaking anti-money laundering rules by U.S. federal prosecutors, there has been an increase in withdrawals from the platform. The exchange also recorded outflows of stablecoins in response to the news.On Tuesday, U.S. prosecutors charged KuCoin and two of its founders for failing to comply with U.S. anti-money laundering rules. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which controls derivatives markets, filed a lawsuit against the firm on the same day.KuCoin CEO reacts"As the People's Exchange, we prioritize user asset security above all else. All operations, including deposits and withdrawals, are normal," Kucoin CEO Johnny Lyu said in a reassuring statement to users, while adding that legal matters were being handled by the legal team.Lyu added, "The challenge we're facing is not unique to KuCoin but rather typical growth and regulatory issues encountered by emerging industries. Early-stage development often sees regulatory gaps, but as the industry matures, we move towards and embrace compliance and standardization."KuCoin is one of the largest spot crypto exchanges in the world, with a daily trading volume of more than $2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The exchange holds over $6 billion in assets across Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana and other chains.

                        Crypto custody firm Copper reportedly threw a London party where attendees were served sushi off two partially-clad models.The Financial Times reported Wednesday that the private function, dubbed “The Copper Experience,” was held last week. The venue for this event, held after the Digital Assets Summit 2024, was the 5-star Mandrake Hotel in London’s Fitzrovia.Per an image the FT obtained, a red-lacquered dining room reportedly featured two individuals in minimal attire positioned on a long table, with sushi served directly on their bodies.The outlet said that the after-party invitation promised a multi-sensory experience: “Attendees will be able to entertain and explore all five senses.”Copper didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.A senior Copper employee told the FT that having scantily clad people was not the typical party set-up. They added that: “Crypto is getting a lot more civilized, so that’s not really the style.”Regulatory Headaches in UK Led Copper to Pursue Swiss Registration
Copper specializes in digital asset custody and trading services tailored to institutional investors. Its offerings include a scalable settlement network, custody-integrated staking, and automated wallet services.Notably, in 2023, the company appointed former UK Chancellor Philip Hammond as its chairman. He was reportedly not in attendance at the controversial event.Facing challenges in obtaining approval from the UK’s financial regulatory authority, Copper withdrew its application to operate in the country in 2022. Instead, it shifted focus toward securing registration in Switzerland.Male-Dominated Culture in Industry Underlines Concerns Over Event
An insider close to the company described the situation as more akin to flamboyant performance art than anything salacious. They also revealed that the models were a man and woman, clad in swimwear.The practice of serving sushi off semi-clad bodies, known as nyotaimori, has gained attention in Western countries as an exotic cultural experience inspired by Japanese traditions. This tradition, although available in certain Western locations, remains on the fringes, even within Japan’s expansive erotic entertainment industry.Despite its occasional portrayal in media and popular culture, nyotaimori dinners are not widely adopted. They are also not considered a commonplace practice, either in Japan or Western societies.The FT highlighted concerns around a prevalent culture of “crypto bros,” characterized by male dominance in major companies, as a persistent issue. This culture has been linked to governance failures, exemplified by the collapse of exchanges like FTX.Hosting a Nyotaimori dinner, which is seen as potentially objectifying, may be viewed as perpetuating this problematic culture and further highlighting governance shortcomings within the industry.

Staked Ethereum reaches weekly high: How whales played a part - AMBCrypto



Deposits on the chain have outpaced withdrawals this week.
The number of ETH staked decreased as the price of the altcoin jumped.

In three separate transactions, a whale sent 12,800 Ethereum [ETH] to the Beacon Chain on the 27th of March. According to Whale Alert, the first transfer was 6400 ETH, valued at $23.05 million.
The subsequent ones were also with the same amount.
For the uninitiated, the Beacon Chain has been a key part of Ethereum since it transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). With the chain, users can participate in governance, act as validators, and also stake their ETH.
It’s raining interest on the chain
Previously, the Beacon Chain only allowed deposits via a contract. However, the 2023 Shanghai upgrade changed that and provided validators to withdraw their staked assets.
AMBCrypto’s evaluation showed that these transactions mentioned above have had a positive impact on the staking sector.
At press time, Nansen data showed that deposits since the beginning of the week tapped a new high.
Source: Nansen
Details from our examination showed that ETH deposits were as high as 80,463. However, withdrawals could not match up as the number was 49,101 ETH as of this writing.
This difference was proof that validators, who were to deposit a minimum of 23 ETH, trusted Ethereum to produce a good yield. In total, 23.9 million ETH has been deposited since Shanghai.
Withdrawals, on the other hand, have been lower at 10.1 million.
As expected, Lido Finance [LDO] led the top entities’ cohort. However, there has been a change in the supply of ETH staked. In a previous article, AMBCrypto reported how nearly 30% of the supply was locked.
Price increases drive withdrawals
But press time data showed that the ratio has declined to 26%. This decrease could be connected to the surge in withdrawals at different times.
Furthermore, on-chain data showed that as the price of ETH increased, the deposits fell.
From the chart below, you can see that the amount of staking deposits when the cryptocurrency traded between $2,500 and $3,000 was higher than when the value was over $4,000.
Source: Nansen
This data explains that some validators were satisfied with the reward as those prices. If this trend continues, then deposits on Ethereum’s Beacon Chain might reduce as the price increases.
However, the sentiment might change considering what happened when ETH changed hands below $1,500 and when it traded above it.
In the meantime, ETH’s price was $3,585. This value was a 2.05% decrease in the last 24 hours. Despite the recent decline, there have been bullish predictions for the cryptocurrency.

Realistic or not, here’s ETH’s market cap in BTC terms

If these predictions come to pass, then it might instill confidence in validators waiting on the sidelines to lock their assets.
At the same time, those who have staked at a much lower value could view the hike as an opportunity to get their yield.

Solana's Jupiter DEX kickstarts native DAO with $137M in initial capital

Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) Jupiter is allocating 10 million USD Coin (USDC) and 100 million of its native JCP token ($127 million), worth a combined $137 million at the time of publication, to kickstart its Jupiter DAO.As announced on March 27, the budget "provides the DAO the capability to fund the ideas with USDC and have the JUP allocation for long term incentive alignment with J.U.P Catributors," developers wrote, continuing: “To ensure that the DAO will be able to execute on these crucial things over the long term, we will aim to top up the same budget on a yearly basis." For additional contributions, developers raised the following example: "If the DAO ends the year with 1.5M USDC and 50M JUP, the team will replenish 8.5M USDC from revenues and an additional 50M JUP will be transferred from the community cold wallets."At its inception, the ecosystem funds are stored in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) multisig wallet with three initial members, with plans to expand access to more custodians within the coming weeks. Parallel to the announcement, the Jupiter DAO wallet address was funded with two separate transactions of USDC and JCP. 


Jupiter is currently one of the most popular decentralized applications on the Solana blockchain, with $381.49 million in total value locked (TVL), having grown 86% month over month. The DEX accounts for approximately 8% of the Solana ecosystem’s total TVL at the time of publication. The token currently has a fully diluted market cap of $12.5 billion. With a gain of 807% in the past year, Solana has become one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. A huge part of that growth was driven by the recent memecoin craze. On March 25, Jeo Boden (BODEN), a Solana memecoin parody of United States President Joe Biden, surpassed $250 million in market cap with a gain of 54% within the past 24 hours. Related: Solana takes the lead in weekly stablecoin transfer volume

UK crypto firm Copper pictured hosting party with nude sushi servers


UK crypto firm Copper, which is chaired by the country’s former chancellor Sir Phillip Hammond, has raised eyebrows after hosting a private dinner party at a luxury London hotel that served guests sushi on two partly naked models.
Copper invited guests to the crypto conference after-party at the five-star Mandrake Hotel last week and promised that “Attendees will be able to entertain and explore all five senses,” and “Transcend the ordinary at the Copper experience.” 
The Financial Times obtained a picture of the event during which one male and one female model, seemingly dressed in thin bodysuits, can be seen semi-naked serving sushi off their bodies. 
Photo of the Copper dinner party shared with the Financial Times. 
The event is reminiscent of nyotaimori, an old Japanese custom where sushi is served to guests from the bodies of laid-down naked women. 
Crypto dinner party more ‘art’ than ‘seedy’
A person close to Copper told the Financial Times the dinner party was “a lot of razzle-dazzle . . . more performative art than anything seedy.” They said the models were “wearing swimming costumes,” and that Copper’s chairman, Hammond, didn’t attend. 
In addition, a Copper spokesperson told the Financial Times, “As part of our sponsorship of the Digital Assets Summit 2024, we jointly hosted an after-party held at the Mandrake Hotel.” It said the event “was organized by a third-party event planner and open to all delegates as part of the conference.”

Copper offers various financial entities the ability to trade crypto on exchanges. It was founded by Dmitry Tokarev in 2018 and has been chaired by Hammond since 2023.  
The firm was reported to have sent $4.2 million worth of ETH to Jonatan Zimenkov, a member of a Russian arms dealing network controlled by his father. In addition, Copper has been accused of acting as an intermediary in a shares sale to help a Russian oligarch skirt US sanctions.

Bitcoin Whales Go On $7 Billion Buying Spree, New ATH Soon?


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin whales have gone on a huge buying spree in the past week, a sign that could be bullish for the coin’s value.
Bitcoin Whales Have Scooped Up More Than 100,000 BTC Recently
As pointed out by analyst Ali in a post on X, the BTC whales have purchased more than 100,000 BTC over the last week. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” metric from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment.
This indicator tells us about the total amount of Bitcoin that the different wallet groups in the market are holding right now. The addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the total number of coins that they are carrying in their balance.

The 1-10 coins group, for instance, includes all wallets holding at least 1 and at most 10 BTC. In the context of the current discussion, the whale cohort is the one of interest. These humongous entities are typically defined as investors owning between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC.
The chart below shows how the ‘Supply Distribution’ for the Bitcoin whales has changed over the past few months:

Looks like the value of the metric has shot up in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X
As displayed in the above graph, the total amount of Bitcoin supply held by the 1,000-10,000 BTC group has registered a significant jump over the past week or so.
During this buying spree, the BTC whales have added more than 100,000 BTC to their holdings, worth upwards of $7 billion at the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency.
This latest accumulation from the whales started when BTC was trading around its recent lows, so it’s possible that these large investors believed those prices to be low enough to be profitable entry points, which is why they bought big at them.
As this buying has occurred, BTC’s bullish momentum has reignited, with its price now surging back above the $70,000 level. Given the close timing, it would appear that the whale accumulation was in part a driver for the rally.
Between the start of the year and the end of February, these humongous holders had been continuously buying more of the asset, with their holdings riding on an uptrend.
As the rally progressed further, though, these investors started falling for the allure of profit-taking as they had shifted towards a trend of net distribution instead.

With the recent buying, however, not only has the trend of net distribution reversed, but the supply of the whales has in fact also returned back to levels similar to the ones seen before the distribution had first begun.
If the Bitcoin whales can keep up this buying in the coming days, then the latest rally may be able to continue further, just like how it was earlier in the year.
Naturally, a continuation from here would mean the possibility of a brand new all-time high, as BTC currently isn’t far from setting one.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $71,000 mark, up more than 11% in the last seven days.

‘This Cycle Is Different’ - $86,000,000,000 in Institutional Money Enters Bitcoin in Just Six Months: CryptoQuant CEO - The Daily Hodl


								The head of blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant says that Bitcoin’s (BTC) current market cycle is like none other before for one key reason.
Ki Young Ju tells his 340,700 followers on the social media platform X that the level of Bitcoin investment from institutional investors is unprecedented this cycle, totaling $86 billion in the last six months alone.










CryptoQuant’s data shows an explosion in Bitcon’s Realized Cap for short-term whales, or the value of the BTC at the price they were last transacted on-chain divided by the number of bitcoins among the cohort, suggesting a massive new presence of institutional money.
“This cycle is different. Institutional funds of $86 billion entered the Bitcoin market in the past six months.”

The analyst says that the buying demand for Bitcoin appears to be outpacing the selling supply as the liquid inventory ratio indicator reaches an all-time low.
“Liquid inventory ratio reached an all-time low. Sell-side liquidity is currently much lower than historical levels relative to demand.”
Source: Ki Young Ju/X
According to the analytics expert, the liquid inventory ratio is calculated by dividing the total sell-side inventory by the 30-day Bitcoin balance change of accumulation addresses.

Bitcoin is trading for $68,760 at time of writing, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

Tether expands AI operations with global recruitment drive for top-tier talent

Tether Operations Limited, the blockchain and cryptocurrency company behind the Tether stablecoin, has announced a strategic expansion of its artificial intelligence (AI) focus alongside a global recruitment drive for “top-tier” talent for its AI division.The expanded strategic focus comes amid concerns “over the monopolization of AI technologies by Big Tech,” according to a press release from Tether. The company said its Tether Data division “is stepping forward to champion transparency and privacy in AI model development.”Tether also said the company's strategic AI expansion would build on its previous operations, including its recent investment in Northern Data Group. A company spokesperson told Cointelegraph:“Tether plans to push the boundaries of AI technology, not only making high-performance and privacy-preserving AI technologies accessible for personal use but also setting new industry standards for innovation and utility.

This Indicator Could Send Ethereum Skrocketing Above $5,000 ⋆ ZyCrypto

In crypto, prices can soar to crazy heights or plummet unexpectedly. Traders are constantly seeking reliable indicators to gauge the future trajectory of their favourite coins. Ethereum has recently been the subject of intense speculation. As it has faced market uncertainty and regulatory questions, a key technical indicator has emerged, suggesting a potential bullish rally that could send Ethereum’s price to new heights by the end of 2024.



The Mayer Multiple Indicator



At the heart of this optimistic prediction lies the Mayer Multiple oscillator, a technical tool crypto analysts use to forecast price movements with notable accuracy. Calculated as the difference between Ethereum’s current price and its 200-day moving average, the Mayer Multiple has shown a bullish signal for Ethereum.



According to data from a prominent crypto analyst, the Mayer Multiple indicates a promising outlook for Ethereum’s price trajectory. Despite recent market volatility that has seen Ethereum’s value drop to $3,300, the Mayer Multiple suggests that Ethereum could surge past the $5,400 mark before the close of 2024.



Ethereum Facing Regulatory Issues



While the Mayer Multiple paints a rosy picture of Ethereum’s future, the cryptocurrency is not immune to the challenges plaguing the broader crypto market. Regulatory concerns, particularly, come from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is reportedly investigating its regulatory classification.



The SEC’s inquiry into whether Ethereum should be classified as a security has raised concerns among investors and industry stakeholders about the potential implications for Ethereum’s future. The investigation, which involves subpoenas issued to various companies linked to the Ethereum Foundation, shows the regulatory difficulties crypto projects have to deal with.

Coinbase’s Stance Against Regulation



Coinbase took a stance against the SEC’s investigation. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, has denied any suggestion that Ethereum’s regulatory status is uncertain. Citing previous statements from senior SEC officials, including Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman and SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Grewal has solidified Ethereum’s classification as a commodity rather than a security.



In the fast-paced world of crypto, where uncertainty and volatility are the norm, investors often look to technical indicators for guidance. The Mayer Multiple’s bullish signal gives optimism to Ethereum investors, and the potential for a surge to $5,000 by the end of 2024 might still be on the cards. As challenges remain, the next few months will be crucial for Ethereum in deciding its future trajectory.

Decentralized AI Pioneers Join Forces to Launch the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a move that could potentially reshape the landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) development, three prominent decentralized AI projects – Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET – have announced their decision to merge and form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. According to a press release dated March 27, 2024, this alliance aims to create an open-source, decentralized platform that challenges the dominance of Big Tech companies in the AI sector.



The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is the brainchild of three visionary leaders in the decentralized AI space: Dr. Ben Goertzel, the founder of SingularityNET; Humayun Sheikh, the creator of Fetch.ai; and Trent McConaghy, the founder of Ocean Protocol. By combining their expertise and resources, they seek to accelerate the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) on the blockchain, ensuring that this transformative technology is accessible to all and not controlled by a select few.



One of the key aspects of the merger is the unification of the three projects’ native tokens – $FET, $OCEAN, and $AGIX – into a single token called $ASI. This new token will serve as the backbone of the merged decentralized AI network, which has a combined token value of $7.6 billion as of March 26, 2024.



The founders of the alliance believe that the development of AGI and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) should be conducted in an open, transparent, and decentralized manner. By joining forces, they aim to create an AI ecosystem that prioritizes ethics, transparency, and direct collaboration between developers and users, minimizing the influence of centralized authorities and traditional gatekeepers.



Several factors have contributed to the decision to form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, including the rapid advancements in AI technology, the significant growth experienced by the three projects involved, and the desire to establish a robust, decentralized AI infrastructure. The alliance seeks to leverage the combined strengths of SNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol to create a scalable platform that promotes ethical and trustworthy AI practices.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Furthermore, the formation of the alliance is expected to drive increased investment in AGI research and development. By facilitating the commercialization of each foundation’s technology and providing access to cutting-edge AI platforms and extensive databases, the alliance hopes to accelerate progress towards realizing AGI on the blockchain.



If the token merger proposal is approved by the respective communities, $FET will be rebranded as $ASI, with a total supply of 2.63055 billion tokens. $AGIX and $OCEAN tokens will be converted to $ASI at rates of 0.433350:1 and 0.433226:1, respectively.



The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance will be governed by a council comprising Ben Goertzel, Humayun Sheikh, Bruce Pon, and Trent McConaghy. While the three merging networks’ parent organizations – Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol Foundation, and SNET Foundation – will remain separate entities, they will work closely together within the shared $ASI tokenomic ecosystem.



The alliance has set its sights on ambitious objectives, such as developing a decentralized neural-symbolic AGI system that surpasses current large language models (LLMs) in areas like logical reasoning, scientific understanding, and creative expression. If successful, this system could have far-reaching implications for the global economy and usher in a new era of decentralized AGI and ASI.

SEC sues Coinbase for offering unregistered crypto securities

Photo: Dado Ruvic (Reuters)Cryptocurrency is decentralized — which means that it’s not controlled by any authority, such as a government or bank. Then, who regulates crypto? It’s a million-dollar question no one knows the answer to, but the U.S. legal system wants to figure it out.Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?On Wednesday, a judge ruled that the SEC can pursue its lawsuit against crypto exchange Coinbase for engaging in unregistered securities sales. U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Polk Failla  for the Southern District of New York wrote in her ruling, “The ‘crypto’ nomenclature may be of recent vintage, but the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years.”The court rejected Coinbase’s request to dismiss the SEC’s complaint.A big win for the SEC The SEC has consistently pushed crypto companies to comply with federal securities laws. Chair Gary Gensler, who once taught a digital asset course at MIT, wants crypto to become a part of the agency’s regulatory sphere. The latest ruling could be the SEC’s first victory in its fight against cryptocurrency compliance since it is also considering classifying Ether as a security.What does it mean for the crypto industry?Coinbase will continue fighting the SEC in court, which will take time. In the interim, the financial watchdog may crack down on other cryptocurrencies and crypto firms that don’t comply with the law. It is widely believed that federal law is not sufficient to regulate cryptocurrencies in general, due to the way they differ from stocks. This latest ruling may pave the way for better regulation of cryptocurrencies in the country.Meanwhile, Coinbase’s shares fell 2.5% Wednesday after the news. At the time of writing, the price was hovering around $262.

Ethereum reclaims NFT throne with US$17.02 mln in daily sales


Ethereum reclaimed its position as the top-ranking blockchain in the non-fungible tokens (NFT) market on Wednesday, with daily sales reaching US$17.02 million. 
The platform saw an increase of 39.19% in sales in the 24 hours to 2 p.m. ET, according to data from CryptoSlam. Ethereum’s all-time sales volume rose to US$43.36 billion, which is the highest in the industry.
Ethereum dethroned Bitcoin for the top daily sales spot after the latter had held the position for two days. 
This marks the second consecutive week where Bitcoin led the market on Monday and Tuesday, only to concede the lead to Ethereum by Wednesday.



Bitcoin and Solana ranked second and third for the day, respectively, with Bitcoin experiencing a near 30% decrease in sales to US$11.61 million, while Solana’s sales dipped slightly by 4.17%, totaling US$6.79 million. 
Despite the decrease, Bitcoin inches closer to US$3 billion in all-time NFT sales volume, now about US$23 million away.
It is on pace to become the fourth network in history to pass the mark.
Polygon recorded the fourth highest sales volume on Wednesday with a 6.35% increase in sales over the last 24 hours, reaching US$1.13 million.



Polygon’s sales volume reached at least US$1 million for the first time this week.
Mythos Chain, the fifth NFT network for the day had US$1.06 million in sales.
Immutable dropped out of the top 5 position on Wednesday after suffering a 20% sales slump to US$725,679.

Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Challenges Hype: Metaverse Is Still Misunderstood


																Metaverse has gained tremendous traction over the past couple of years, grabbing the attention of large companies across the world.
But Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, believes the concept of the Metaverse is still “poorly defined” and needs to have several elements to make it meaningful.
Dissecting Metaverse
During a Q&A session while speaking at the BUIDL Asia conference in Seoul, Buterin pointed out a common misconception in associating the Metaverse solely with virtual reality (VR). The Ethereum co-founder argued that VR often leads people to imagine complex environments, whereas the actual needs tend to be simpler.
He illustrated this by suggesting that what people truly desire is the functionality of a laptop without the physical device itself, essentially implying that while VR may have its utility, it doesn’t necessarily constitute a true Metaverse experience.
“To me, Metaverse is one of those things which are very poorly defined. Like a brand’s name more than a product. It feels like everyone has this abstract idea that there is a virtual universe that they can all participate in and that the virtual universe is not actually owned by anyone. But the challenge is that they often get connected to virtual reality.
But with virtual reality, the kinds of things that people actually need end up being much simpler. You basically want a laptop without a laptop. That’s super useful but not a ‘verse’.”
True Metaverse Fusion: Crypto, VR, AI
According to Buterin, a true Metaverse experience may emerge from combining existing virtual world elements, including certain aspects of crypto, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence, rather than from attempts to create a Metaverse-like environment directly.




“The thing that I expect most similar to a metaverse that actually makes sense is not something that tries to be a metaverse. But something that takes all of the different virtual world things that we already have including part of crypto, VR, AI and combining them together in the right way.”

Here’s Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7


                            A plausible explanation has emerged for why the Cardano (ADA) price has dropped below the psychological price level of $0.7. The crypto token saw a sharp correction from its monthly peak of $0.8, recorded on March 14, and has since failed to recover such a height. 
Cardano Whales Responsible For Price Decline
Data from the crypto analytics platform Santiment shows that the whale transaction count ($100,000 and above) on the network has reduced since March 14. That period was when Cardano hit a high of $0.8, which suggests that ADA whales began to take profits from then and have slowly exited their positions since then. 

Crypto whales are known to have a massive impact on the market, and prices usually drop as soon as these traders begin to offload their holdings. Moreover, this wave of profit-taking isn’t peculiar only to the ADA ecosystem; these past few weeks have been marred by investors taking profits from different crypto tokens in which they were invested. 
The flagship crypto, Bitcoin, was also not spared. Investors decided to take profits after weeks of seeing BTC make a parabolic run on its way to a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. Meanwhile, long-term ADA holders also looked to have used the opportunity to take some profits, as data from Santiment shows that a considerable amount of dormant ADA tokens were also transacted during that period.
Specifically, March 20 was a busy day for these long-term holders as 200 million ADA tokens (which had been dormant for a year) moved on that day. 
Time For ADA To Run To $1
Like the broader crypto market, Cardano looks to be recovering from this recent wave of profit-taking, although at a slower pace. For its next leg up, there is the belief that the crypto token could finally break the $1 resistance. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello recently predicted that ADA could rise to between $1.4 and $1.5 if it can break out from the $0.8 price range. 

ADA whales are likely to soon return to the fold with whale transctions higher than $100,00 expected to pick up soon enough. A spike in these trasaction count would suggest that these investors are taking advantage of ADA’s current decline to accumulate more of the crypto token. That is something that could contribute to a rise in ADA’s price depending on how bullish these investors are on ADA going forward. 
At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.6513, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Arbitrum Whales Move Millions in Tokens to Exchanges Amid Market Speculation, Triggering Mixed Community Reactions



                    
In March, a significant movement of Arbitrum‘s ARB tokens into exchanges was observed, particularly following the release of a considerable volume of vested tokens. 



Lookonchain, a blockchain data platform, reported on March 23 that four wallets had moved ARB tokens to exchanges, subsequent to a $2.32 billion token unlock on March 16. 




Specifically, 11.34 million ARB tokens, valued at $18.5 million, were deposited into Binance across four transactions.



The crypto community has been divided over these transactions. One member did not see it as a negative indicator, while another expressed skepticism about ARB’s potential to appreciate. 



This followed a previous instance where 11 whales deposited significant amounts of ARB into exchanges on March 18, after Arbitrum, a layer-2 blockchain initiative, unlocked $2.3 billion in tokens.

The allocation included 673.5 million ARB for team and advisers, with another 438.25 million for investors, all released at once, raising concerns of a potential market dump.



Subsequent to the token release, ARB’s price trajectory has been downward. From a high of $2.22 on March 13, it fell to $1.84 by the unlock date, March 16.



 The following week saw fluctuations, reaching a low of $1.48 and a high of $1.79, with a price of $1.70 at the time of reporting. 



According to CoinGecko, this marked a nearly 29% decrease from its January 12 all-time high of $2.39.



This series of events and the market’s response have hinted at a potential continuation of the bearish trend. 



Adding to the speculation, Token Unlocks, a vesting tracker, revealed that another 92.65 million ARB tokens are set to be released for advisers, the team, and investors on April 16, which could further impact the market dynamics.

FTX attorneys are pushing for several "Sam Coins" to be zeroed in its bankruptcy proceedings - but what does it mean for creditors?
                        Cryptocurrency exchange FTX is looking to declare its creditors’ “Sam Coins” effectively worthless amidst the company’s lengthy bankruptcy proceedings, court documents from a Tuesday hearing in Delaware show.FTX Declares “Sam Coins” Worthless
Lawyers for FTX Trading LTD. hired NYU Professor of Finance Sabrina Howell to conduct a valuation analysis on a number of “Sam Coins,” including Serum, Maps, and Oxygen.According to Howell’s research, Serum’s $509 million in claims should be reduced by nearly 60%, while both Oxygen and Maps should be devalued to zero given that the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange held nearly 95% of the tokens.“The customers attribute values to claims on digital assets assuming a market that never has and never will exist,” FTX attorney Brian D. Glueckenstein of Sullivan and Cromwell said.FTX Creditors Challenge NYU Professor’s “Sam Coins” Analysis
Lawyers for FTX creditors notably pushed back against the method of Howell’s analysis, with Maps Vault Attorney Jefferey Torosian calling her assessment of the digital assets’ value “illogical.”Attorney Kurt F. Glynne, who is representing nearly $250 million in claims linked to Oxygen and Maps, further criticized the data presented by FTX attorneys as “fundamentally flawed.”“Her analysis should be given no weight,” he continued.The Convoluted Journey of FTX’s Bankruptcy Proceedings
The latest FTX hearing comes just days after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey was ordered to approve the appointment of independent examiner Robert J. Cleary to investigate law firm Sullivan and Cromwell’s potential conflicts of interest in relation to the crypto exchange.Dorsey’s original February 2023 rejection of an independent examiner in the case was overruled just two months ago by a federal appeals court. Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo cited the decision’s benefits for the entire cryptocurrency sector, including bringing shady business dealings “under scrutiny” while “alerting potential investors to undisclosed credit risks in other cryptocurrency companies.”Attorney John J. Ray III, who is spearheading FTX’s bankruptcy efforts as CEO, previously opposed an independent examiner in the case, citing exorbitant costs.Bankman-Fried was convicted last November on fraud charges for misappropriating over $8 billion worth of customer funds which prosecutors argued went towards funding the FTX founder’s lavish lifestyle.Meanwhile, a number of close friends and family of Bankman-Fried have pushed U.S. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan for leniency in the leadup to his scheduled sentencing on March 28 in Manhattan federal court.Serum was trading at $0.062 as of writing, while Maps and Oxygen were valued at $0.034 and $0.013, respectively.

As The Market Regains Momentum In the Bull Market, Which Exceptional Projects Has Foresight X Identified? - Benzinga

Whenever the market transitions from a bear market to a bull market, there is a significant surge in market liquidity. For investors, how to seize the opportunity and identify the investments with the highest potential for gains during this period? Historically, VCs have been adept at implementing "counter-cyclical" strategies and discerning shifts in market sentiment. They typically capitalize on opportunities ahead of others: during bear markets, they broaden their investment scope, leveraging their advantages such as market insights and incubation resources, which individual investors may not have access to. This allows them to position themselves ahead of the curve in promising sectors and projects, ultimately benefiting from the early gains of the bull market through the wealth effect of leading tokens. Using the pivotal year of 2023 as a case in point, various concepts such as the Bitcoin BTC/USD Ecosystem, Solana SOL/USD Ecosystem, LSD Protocol, Modularity, and Re-Staking have taken center stage in succession. Whether it's the initial surge of excitement surrounding BTC Layer 2 infrastructure driven by the Ordinals, or the remarkable performance of modular new projects like SEI SEI/USD and TIA TIA/USD, many of these represent early-stage investments that leading VCs had strategically positioned themselves in. Therefore, for ordinary users, tracking the project allocation of VCs, particularly prominent ones, undoubtedly offers the most indicative direction. Essentially, the investment landscape of VCs comprises "premium seed players" filtered through their investment research and industry judgment—the more exceptional a VC's track record, the greater its reference value.

SUI Token Brushes $2 Peg in Rally Near All-Time High - DailyCoin


        
The SUI token has reached a new year-high trading price.



SUI has maintained a positive upward trend over the past months.



The crypto market is struggling to rebound following a week-long downward trend.
SUI, the native token of the Layer-1 blockchain and smart contract platform dedicated to digital asset ownership Sui, has thrived over the past months, outperforming most assets with new milestones in trading price and across its broader ecosystem. Despite the current cautious sentiment across the market, the native token has managed to buck the trend, notching healthy gains in recent weeks.SUI has continued the upward trajectory and breached its month-long price resistance to new heights. SUI Hits $2 in Fresh Rally StartOn Wednesday, March 27, SUI started its trading session on a strong note, rallying to a new year-to-date price high of $2.06.The surge marks a 17% increase in SUI’s price over the past 24 hours, bringing the token total gains over the past month to a healthy 28.3%.While SUI has quickly slipped below its newly reclaimed peg, the token’s bullish trend over the past three months, which has seen a staggering 143% upward notch in price, is fueling optimism regarding its ability to reclaim the peg and breach its all-time high trading price of $2.16.At press time, SUI is wavering at a trading price of $1.97, shedding nearly half of its gains over the past hour. However, despite this recent decline, the token price increase has outpaced most assets, many of which are struggling to recover from their week-long downward trend.Bitcoin Leads Market SlipFollowing an impressive rally to new price heights in the past weeks, the crypto market has experienced a bearish sentiment, with many assets slipping to new lows and surrendering gains.



Leading the charge is Bitcoin (BTC), which has slipped approximately 5.6% from its all-time high of $73,780. It is currently trading at $67,786, still marking a 10% rebound from its week-low.Other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have dropped by approximately 14% and 11% from their year-high trading prices, positioning both as some of the top losers of the past week. Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Binance Coin (BNB) also joined the ranks of losers, each experiencing declines of 23%, 16%, and 9% respectively.On the Flipside
Despite SUI’s upward tick, the token current price is down 10.2% from its all-time high.



The total value locked on Sui has surged by an impressive 248% over the past three months, reaching $696 million from its year-start value of $200 million.



Sui has recently debuted its first-ever global conference in collaboration with Mysten Labs. 
Why This MattersThe surge in SUI’s price aligns highlights its ability to defy negative market trends and mount up impressive gains. However, SUI’s journey to reclaim its all-time high price after over a year is not solely reliant on past achievements, and its ability to sustain the present momentum amidst market volatility will dictate its trajectory.

KuCoin and Its Founders Hit With Criminal Charges in U.S., Samson Mow Makes Bold Bitcoin ETF Prediction for This Week, SHIB Braces for Ultra Bullish Breakout: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Here are the top three news stories over the past day presented to you by U.Today.KuCoin and its founders hit with criminal charges in U.S.The United States Department of Justice has filed criminal charges against crypto exchange KuCoin and two of its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang. As stated in the indictment, KuCoin and its founders violated the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program. "KuCoin and its founders deliberately sought to conceal the fact that substantial numbers of U.S. users were trading on KuCoin’s platform," stated U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, adding that the exchange allegedly chose not to comply with U.S. law. The allegations in the DOJ's indictment also indicated that the exchange actively prevented its U.S. customers from identifying themselves as such and misled investors about its customer base. To ensure user growth, KuCoin advertised itself as an exchange where one can trade without the need to undergo KYC. Thus, KuCoin's failure to maintain the required AML and KYC programs led to it being used as "a vehicle to launder large sums of criminal proceeds," says the indictment. Gan and Tang, who are both citizens of China, are facing up to 10 years in prison.Samson Mow makes bold Bitcoin ETF prediction for this week as BTC tops $70,000Jan3 CEO and "$1 billion per Bitcoin" advocate Samson Mow has recently taken to X platform to make a bullish prediction regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs for this week. As a reminder, spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC in January, and from the very start of trading, ETFs have been grabbing enormous amounts of Bitcoin from the market. However, over the past few days, inflows into these ETFs experienced sharp outflows of more than $850 million worth of Bitcoin. Last week, Mow shared an optimistic X post, stating that he expects these Bitcoin ETF outflows to eventually become inflows again. Yesterday, Jan3 CEO reaffirmed his bullish stance, writing that he has a feeling that this week is going to be “a net inflow week,” adding a Bitcoin hashtag. Some commenters viewed this X post as being related to Bitcoin ETFs. At the moment of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $69,242, down by 1.22% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.Shiba Inu braces for ultra bullish breakout: Is SHIB price rally imminent?Since the start of the week, Shiba Inu's price has witnessed a notable increase by over 4%, returning to the $0.00003 level. Analyzing the late February-early March rally, when SHIB prices surged by about 400%, breaking through the $0.3 per token threshold and reaching highs of $0.45 before experiencing a substantial fall, a pattern emerges. Every time SHIB got close to the $0.00003 mark, buyers appeared to step in, driving prices higher. However, every attempt to break through this barrier faced resistance, which led to sell-offs. At press time, SHIB is changing hands at $0.00002994, struggling to surpass the $0.3 resistance point. Despite this setback, the SHIB price's persistent growth trajectory and the resilience indicate that, should the $0.00003 barrier be decisively surpassed, there may be a possibility of a bullish breakout.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Trade Sideways as Crypto Market Cools Down - Decrypt

The cryptocurrency market witnessed a slight cool-down today, with the total market capitalization dropping 1.14% to $2.76 trillion according to Coingecko. This minor correction follows significant movements in the market over the past few days, as Bitcoin and Ethereum face resistance at key levels.Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, has been attempting to break past the $70,000 barrier. However, this level has proven to be a strong resistance, with breakouts often followed by corrections that impact the broader crypto market. Today, Bitcoin experienced a 1.2% decline, with the coin reaching a daily high of $71,754 before correcting to $69,793. Despite the recent dip, Bitcoin's overall performance remains bullish, as it continues to recover from a flash crash on BitMEX that caused the price to plummet to $60,760.Image: TradingviewThe current daily candlestick suggests a possible correction, but the overall trend remains bullish.Bitcoin's price is trading above its EMA10, a positive sign for the coin because it signals that, at current prices, any investor that bought in the last 10 days should be in the green. With 97.7% BTC addresses being in the money according to data provided by IntoTheBlock, some short-term traders may be considering realizing their gains, while long-term hodlers may still be compelled to keep their tokens locked and see how markets behave. In terms of indicators, the recent market cooldown has brought balance to the markets. The relative strength index (RSI) stands slightly bullish at 58, indicating a well-balanced market compared to the 72 points registered on March 14, when Bitcoin was trading at a similar price. This may allow for safer bullish bets in strategies that take market sentiment into consideration.The average directional index (ADX) has dropped to 30 points, signaling that while the bullish mood persists, traders are more cautious, and upswings are not as extreme as in previous days. If Bitcoin fails to gain momentum, immediate support is found around $67,800, set by the EMA10. However, if bullish momentum continues, resistance is expected between the psychological $70K zone and the $73,794 all-time high.Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is exhibiting similar behavior to Bitcoin.The coin is currently trading at $6,543, having spiked to $3,663 before correcting to a minimum of $3,495 today. Overall, Ethereum is down 1.35% in the last 24 hours. The coin has faced strong resistance at $3,660 over the past three days, with the overall pattern showing more stability. This is not good for scalpers and day traders thinking about opening long positions.Image: TradingviewEthereum remains bullish, but the gap between the EMA10 and EMA55 is closing rapidly, which could indicate a price correction is still in play. The RSI has dropped to 52, suggesting that markets are currently indecisive, with no clear dominance from either bulls or bears.The ADX (which measures the strength of a trend) at 38. Combined with a squeeze momentum indicator—which guesses the phase of the market cycle an asset is being traded on—it shows bears are still not conceding to a price rebound. It also shows that traders may still be struggling to recover from the correction that began on March 12, which caused Ethereum's price to crash nearly 25% from $4,095 to $3,059.While both Bitcoin and Ethereum face resistance at key levels, their overall trends remain bullish. However, traders thinking about opening long positions on short timeframes must be cautious, as recent corrections are strong enough to stop the coins from continuing their path to price discovery zones once again.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

SingularityNet Confirms Groundbreaking AI Merger to ASI Token - DailyCoin


        
SingularityNet, Ocean Protocol, and Fetch.AI confirm to DailyCoin their merger.



The three AI industry leaders will establish the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance.



The Alliance aims to capitalize on the AI sector and the growth of the underlying three projects as a countermeasure against Big Tech.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) took the world by storm after it proved that it was more than just a buzzword but rather a tangible force shaping the very foundations of our current technological landscape. With projects such as ChatGPT, Dall-E, and more capturing the attention of industry giants like Microsoft and Google, the race to dominate the technology has intensified. In this fast-paced competition, decentralized entities like SingularityNet, Ocean Protocol, and Fetch.AI stand at the forefront, championing the cause of democratizing AI access for all.And what better way to do that than proposing a multi-billion dollar merger of their blockchain networks? The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI)In an official release shared with DailyCoin, SingularityNet confirmed that it is merging with leading AI protocols in the industry, Ocean Protocol and Fetch.AI, to create the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. The alliance, if approved by the respective communities, will culminate in the world’s largest open-sourced decentralized network via a $7.5 billion merger, accelerating the collaborators’ race to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).As part of the formation of the Alliance, Fetch.AI’s FET token, Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN token, and SingularityNet’s AGIX token will converge into a single $ASI token that will function across the combined decentralized AI network, providing unprecedented scale and power.



Expressing his views on the merger, Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO and Founder of SingularityNet, shared with DailyCoin: “As the AI revolution intensifies it is imperative that AGI and ASI are not owned and controlled by any particular party with their own biased interests. They should be rolled out in an open, democratic, and decentralized way. This has been the joint vision of SNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol from their inception, and for this reason, it makes total sense that our three projects come together to form a tokenomic network that has greater power to take on Big Tech and shift the center of gravity of the AI world into the decentralized ecosystem.”According to the release shared with DailyCoin, the Alliance will be led by Ben Goertzel, Humayun Sheikh, Bruce Pon, and Trent McConaghy. The underlying entities will continue to operate as separate entities but will collaborate closely in the shared $ASI tokenomic ecosystem and the operation of the Alliance.ASI’s Vision: Capitalizing on the Rise of AIWith this merger, the Alliance looks to capitalize on the rise of AI and the growth of the underlying three projects as a protest against Big Tech’s control over AI development, use, and monetization.



The collab also aims to create a decentralized AI infrastructure that seeks to turn closed-source AI systems into open networks to coordinate machine intelligence toward shared objectives.When the proposal receives majority approval from the respective communities, the following will occur:
$FET becomes $ASI with a total supply of 2.63055 billion tokens and a starting price of $2.82



$AGIX tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433350:1



$OCEAN tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433226:1



$ASI will have a total FDV of $7.6 billion USD (combined value as of March 26, 2024)
Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol CEO & Co-Founder, believes the combination can deliver on the promise of a vertically integrated stack of decentralized technologies with scale to compete globally. “The combination of our technologies creates a leader in R&D, applications, and commercialization of AGI,” Pon notes. “The unified ASI token is the glue to orchestrate all actors with common incentives. ASI tokens are used to secure the public network, as data access tokens and to unlock computation without needing traditional banking and payment rails. It is the native currency for the machine economy.”On the Flipside
OCEAN witnessed the biggest surge among the three tokens, gaining as much as 36% over the past 24 hours to trade at $1.49 as of press time following news of the merger. 



Tether Operations Limited also recently introduced its entry into AI.

Fidelity Investments filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday for a spot Ethereum ETF. What Happened: The S-1 filing, which includes staking capabilities, could be a significant development for Ethereum ETH/USD investors seeking a regulated way to gain exposure to the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. The development comes on the heels of the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year. Fidelity was among the first 11 issuers to receive approval for a Bitcoin ETF, a decision that demonstrably boosted the overall digital asset market. The fund is the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC.The price of Bitcoin soared to new highs in March 2024, reaching a record-breaking $73,000. The arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 triggered a major shift in the digital asset landscape. As Bitcoin prices surged, many began to speculate on which cryptocurrency would be next.

FTX Creditors Likely To Be Paid up to 140% the Value of Their Original Claims: Report - The Daily Hodl


								FTX’s bankruptcy estate is primed to pay its creditors more than the value of their original claims, according to the Financial Times.
Citing two people “with knowledge of the restructuring negotiations,” FT reports that the imploded crypto exchange will likely pay its former customers 120-140% of the value of their holdings on the day FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.










The increased payouts are thanks to soaring crypto prices and FTX’s 8% stake in the AI (artificial intelligence) safety and research company Anthropic. The bankrupt exchange’s administrators reportedly plan to sell two-thirds of that Anthropic stake to a group of investors for $884 million.
The size of creditor repayments hinges on whether the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) maintains its demand for $24 billion in unpaid taxes.
FTX’s legal team has also reportedly argued that the bankrupt crypto exchange owes no taxes to the IRS since it repeatedly recorded losses over its three-year lifespan.
Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty late last year of defrauding investors and mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds related to the multi-billion-dollar downfall of the exchange in 2022.
Prosecutors have recommended a prison sentence of 40-50 years for Bankman-Fried, although the former CEO’s lawyers have reportedly argued that he should serve a maximum of 6.5 years, pointing to the size of creditor repayments.

Bitcoin price falters as macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds mount

Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a moderate correction to $68,430 on March 27 after failing to break above the $71,000 mark. Data from Bitcoin derivatives data reveal a decline in bullish sentiment among professional traders over the past week, which could possibly indicate that the $69,000 level will not hold.Bitcoin spot ETF inflows will be decisive for BTC’s priceDespite a rally from $63,800 to $70,000 in the five days leading up to March 27, only $151 million in leveraged short positions were forcibly closed in the BTC futures markets. This suggests that bears remained cautious, even in light of last week's significant $888 million net withdrawal from U.S. Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).On a positive note, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience by recovering from a 17.6% drop from $73,757 on March 14 to $60,795 on March 20 without causing panic among spot ETF investors. However, some market observers argue that the primary driver behind BTC reaching a new high before the April Bitcoin halving was the unexpectedly high inflows into spot ETFs, highlighting the importance for bulls to monitor such trends.A positive for Bitcoin enthusiasts, this week saw a reversal in spot ETF flows, with a total of $418 million in net inflows recorded on March 26. Crucially, this was not due to reduced outflows from Grayscale's GBTC, indicating genuine institutional demand even as Bitcoin's price lingered just 4% below its peak. However, this does not assure professional traders that $69,000 will serve as a support level.Analysts can discern whether whales and arbitrage desks are adopting a bullish or bearish stance by analyzing aggregated positions across spot, perpetual, and quarterly futures contracts.Exchanges’ top traders BTC long-to-short ratio, 12 hours. Source: CoinglassOn Binance, the long-to-short ratio among professional traders was 1.50, favoring long positions on March 22, a figure that has slightly decreased to 1.42 currently. On OKX, the sentiment was much more bullish on March 22, with a long-to-short ratio of 3.22, a sentiment that has since diminished, with the ratio currently at 1.49 in favor of longs. This indicates a notable reduction in optimism among top traders, despite the 9.5% price increase during the period, suggesting other factors may be dampening bullish sentiment.Global economic concerns and mixed market signals impact Bitcoin price Some analysts argue that the global economic downturn is impacting Bitcoin's performance, particularly after the S&P 500 index could not maintain its all-time high of 5,320 achieved on March 21. The uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions for 2024 is causing investors to lose confidence; rate cuts are generally seen as positive for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, which reflects the expectations of the fixed-income markets, there's only an 8% chance of a rate cut at the Federal Reserve's May 1 meeting.Furthermore, analysts caution that a Fed rate cut may signal troubles rather than prosperity. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, shared his concern over the lack of earnings growth posing the greatest risk to the stock market. He also highlighted worries about the overemphasis on artificial intelligence, which has significantly propelled the stock market's recent gains.Related: Massive Bitcoin consolidation sparks sell-side liquidity concernsData on Bitcoin's top traders indicates a decrease in the preference for leveraged long positions, differing from an increase in bears’ comfort. This shift may stem from simultaneous all-time highs in diverse asset classes, including gold, U.S. stocks, Bitcoin, Japan's Nikkei 225 index, and live cattle, suggesting market anticipation of a weaker U.S. dollar against scarce resources.The diminished interest in leveraged BTC longs should not alarm investors, nor a signal that Bitcoin will trade below $69,000, as it likely reflects broader economic recession concerns and external pressures, such as the U.S. Justice Department's charges against KuCoin exchange on March 26 and the European Parliament's committee discussions on limiting cryptocurrency payments from self-hosted wallets.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The collaborations of Polyhedra Network

Polyhedra Network, in collaboration with EigenLayer and Renzo, has emerged as a pioneering force, introducing innovative solutions that enhance interoperability, security, and economic participation among chains. 
At the forefront of this innovation is zkBridge, a revolutionary protocol that facilitates secure and decentralized transmission of messages across different blockchain networks. In the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology, interoperability and security are essential for the smooth operation of decentralized ecosystems.

The collaboration of Polyhedra Network
zkBridge by Polyhedra Network represents a significant step forward in the blockchain sector, offering a decentralized solution for bridging assets across Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. 
The collaboration with EigenLayer and the integration of the Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) ezETH by Renzo further strengthen the capabilities and security of the zkBridge ecosystem. This collaboration is supported by an impressive economic participation of 1.8 billion US dollars, ensuring a solid crypto-economic security.
Bitcoin, despite its importance in the cryptocurrency space, does not have a native smart contract functionality, which poses challenges for its integration into cross-chain ecosystems. 
However, zkBridge by Polyhedra Network, in collaboration with EigenLayer and Renzo, offers innovative solutions to securely connect Bitcoin to different blockchain networks. Integrating Bitcoin into zkBridge allows other blockchains to interact securely with Bitcoin, promoting low-trust interoperability.
Thanks to EigenLayer’s double-staking mechanism, zkBridge ensures the economic security of Bitcoin’s active validation services (AVS). Validators, equipped with both ZK tokens and Renzo’s ezETH, play a crucial role in ensuring the network’s integrity. In case of malicious activities, users can initiate zkBridge requests to correct discrepancies, safeguarding the network’s integrity and users’ assets.
The slashing mechanism built into Bitcoin AVS acts as a strong deterrent against fraudulent activities, ensuring the integrity of the network. Through careful monitoring and reporting, users contribute to the detection of harmful behaviors. In case of confirmation, the slashing protocol is executed, leading to the confiscation of stakes by dishonest validators. Furthermore, rewards are distributed to stakeholders and honest users, incentivizing active participation and promoting a robust ecosystem.
Fast purposes for Layer 2 networks
Layer 2 networks offer scalability and high transaction speed, but pose interoperability issues between chains. To solve this problem, zkBridge introduces a fast bridging solution that leverages an auxiliary validation network. 
This network attests the state of level 2 networks, ensuring fast finalization while maintaining security levels comparable to native blockchain executions. By simulating blockchain executions, zkBridge achieves fast finalization, significantly reducing transaction finalization time.
The integration of zkBridge with Layer 2 networks involves the verification of state proofs by auxiliary validation networks and the validation of Layer 1 consensus for Layer 2 transactions. Batch proofs are supported to reduce gas costs, improving efficiency and scalability. Through collaboration with EigenLayer, Polyhedra Network introduces dual staking on various blockchains, leveraging ZK tokens for economic security and ecosystem growth.

DePIN platform peaq secures $15M in pre-launch round

Update (March 27 at 17:58 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that peaq is a layer-1 platform for DePINS, and Julia Pönitzsch is not a co-founder. Layer-1 platform peaq — focused on decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) — has disclosed a $15 million funding round ahead of its mainnet launch in May. The round was led by Generative Ventures and Borderless Capital, with participation from Spartan Group, HV Capital, CMCC Global, Animoca Brands, Moonrock Capital, Fundamental Labs, and other investors. Behind the peaq network is the Berlin-based startup EoT Labs, founded in 2017 by Leonard Dorlöchter, Max Thake, and Till Wendler. The peaq blockchain applies decentralization to physical infrastructure and systems, aiming to build an “Economy of Things” network. According to the company, its ecosystem is home to more than 20 DePIN projects — “already more than the likes of Solana, Polygon and other prominent layer-1s,” the company claimed in a statement to Cointelegraph. 


DePIN uses blockchain technology to incentivize people to build, own and run real-world physical infrastructure, thus distributing control across a network and avoiding centralization in any single organization’s hands. Initiatives in different industries are exploring DePIN use cases, such as energy systems for peer-to-peer energy trading, supply chains, telecommunications for internet access, and data storage for secure data management. Data from intelligence firm Messari indicates that the DePIN market valuation could reach $3.5 trillion in the next four years. The startup offers DePINs with Modular DePIN Functions, which are ready-to-use functions that allow DePINs to build and deploy their projects on the blockchain. Features available for projects include a machine tokenization platform and a DePIN Accelerator program. In 2021, peaq raised nearly $2.7 million in a seed round. The additional funds will be primarily allocated to its ecosystem expansion and further development of solutions for developers. “We will keep working on expanding the ecosystem, which will stand to benefit from more funds going into the Ecosystem Grant Program, and further developing the peaq SDK and the Modular DePIN Functions. All and all, this year is shaping up to be intense, growth-focused, and very promising, which is how we like it,” Leonard Dorlochter, co-founder of peaq, told Cointelegraph.Magazine: Inside Pink Drainer — Security analyst defends his crypto scam franchise

Asset Tokenization: A New Paradigm for Financial Infrastructure and Innovation

These examples and others, including tokenized gold, demonstrate how digital asset networks are used as the underlying digital infrastructure for distributing financial services. When viewed through this lens, we can consider what other value-add services could be delivered via digital asset infrastructure, instead of measuring the successes of these networks by the price of their native cryptocurrency.'An ideal outcome from the use of this technology would be for a faster, cheaper, more transparent and accessible financial system for all.'

This Altcoin Announces It Will Deposit Assets Into BlackRock's Cryptocurrency Fund - The Price Soars - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ondo (ONDO) announced that it will distribute a significant portion of its OUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Government Bonds) assets to the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL).
Following the development, there was a sudden increase in the price of the altcoin:










 
Until now, withdrawals from the OUSG fund have been restricted by traditional “+2 days post-trade” security closing periods, causing delays in investors getting their USD back after the sale of the underlying securities.


However, with the introduction of “+1 day after transaction day” for many types of securities, ONDO believes it has the opportunity to benefit from faster processing, one of the most important advantages of blockchain.
In response, ONDO announced that OUSG will soon offer instant investment and redemption, available 24/7/365.





Additionally, ONDO is introducing a new type of OUSG, the rUSG, with a fixed issue/redemption price of $1.00 per share. Yield will be distributed daily in the form of additional rUSG tokens via token reminting.

Why is the Price of Binance's Latest Launchpool Altcoin Soaring? Up Almost 50 Percent in One Day - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ether.fi, Binance's latest Launchpool project and a liquid restaking protocol, hit an all-time high today as the restaking craze continues to attract cryptocurrency investors.
The token, which represents the voting power in the decision-making process in the management of the protocol, rose by up to 50% to $ 7.2 in the last 24 hours.


This rise allowed ETHFI to recover from the price decline that followed its decline on March 18. After initially rising to $5 on Binance, the altcoin fell below $3 in the following days.
Liquid restaking protocols like Ether.Fi are designed to reuse Ethereum's proof-of-stake blockchain to secure other networks through the original restaking platform, EigenLayer.






According to the data, Ether.fi is the leader in the field of liquid restaking. Its total value locked (TVL) has jumped from $100 million to over $3 billion since the beginning of the year, according to DefiLlama data.
Ignas, a well-known DeFi analyst, noted that the strong price performance of the protocol's governance token, ETHFI, could boost the valuations of other liquid restaking tokens (LRT) to be released in the future. “The higher the ETHFI price, the higher the relative valuations of all other LRT governance tokens will be,” Ignas said.

Blast L2 hack prompts debate over centralization of Ethereum rollups


Yesterday’s $62 million hack of NFT-gaming project Munchables caused a stir amongst the crypto community, with calls for Blast’s core team to manually undo the damage on the centralized rollup.
Fortunately, such controversial action turned out to be unnecessary. Once it became clear that they were unable to get away with their ill-gotten gains, the rogue developer responsible for the theft returned the funds to the Blast team.

Read more: Crypto game exploited for $4.6M, hacker claims to be white-hat
As with The DAO hack on Ethereum in 2016, the incident forces us to consider the implications of interfering with what are supposed to be immutable ledgers.
The hack
Although the ‘hack’ itself was simple, it had been planned well in advance.
Before launch, a rogue developer used their admin access to assign themselves a hefty ether balance in a previous, unverified implementation of the Munchables contract.
Later, when deposits began to stream into the upgraded contracts, the exploiter’s address had plenty of ETH to drain the funds, withdrawing approximately 17,400 ETH, worth over $62 million at the time.
The developer also had admin access to a contract holding over $30 million in funds deposited by another Blast-based project, Juicebox. Centralization risk was identified as low severity in the project’s audit, and the developer’s preparations seemingly went unnoticed.
The culprit
Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT initially suspected that the developer responsible was part of the DPRK’s Lazarus Group of state-sponsored hackers, pointing the finger at a GitHub profile named ‘Werewolves0493.’

He also suggested that four of the project’s ‘developers’ may in fact be the same individual, as they were linked by on-chain transfers and through deposits to shared exchange addresses.
PixelCraft Studios’ CEO, who goes by coderdan.eth on X (formerly Twitter), shared his run-in with the same developer, who was fired “within a month.” Judging by deposits to their Binance addresses, ChainArgos believe the developer has had a handful of short-term jobs over the past 18 months.
Whether this individual was connected to Lazarus or not, attempting to infiltrate crypto teams is a known technique used by the hacking group.
The dilemma
Ever since the US Treasury’s sanctioning of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, credible censorship resistance has become an important measure of a blockchain’s decentralization. The hope is that if there’s no single entity to accuse of interacting with sanctioned addresses, then there’s nobody to prosecute. 
Likewise, though, if a US-based development team has sufficient admin powers to revert the effects of hacks or the actions of sanctioned entities, it may find itself obliged to do so. 
Precedents have been set in the past. Last year, Jump Crypto conducted a ‘counter-exploit’ to recover the 120,000 ETH lost in 2022’s Wormhole hack, worth over $300 million at the time.
Also in 2022, Binance-linked BNB Chain was halted by its validators, ensuring that the proceeds of a $600 million bridge hack couldn’t be siphoned to other, less censorable chains.
Blast itself isn’t exactly a prime example of crypto’s ‘trustlessness’ ethos, nor is it a paragon of decentralization.

Read more: Critics decry Blast as the latest sketchy scheme on Ethereum
When Blast was launched, alongside a FOMO-inducing points program, it offered ‘native yield’ on ETH and stablecoins, despite deposits simply going into a multisig wallet while the network itself was being built.
Blast’s status as a mostly experimental sandbox which doesn’t prioritize decentralization as much as other networks led some to believe that using centralized powers to manually revert unsavoury activities should be encouraged in order to make users whole.
But others argue that such a move could be seen as a sign of approval for other centralized rollups (e.g. Optimism and Base) that might be forced to censor their network activity.

The DAO
The debate brought back memories of 2016’s The DAO hack which, incidentally, involved a similar dollar amount lost (3.6M ETH, which would be worth almost $13B today).

Read more: Ethereum’s Dencun causes ‘Blast’ layer 2 outage 
The ‘hard fork’, designed to reverse the damage, resulted in a chain split leading to today’s Ethereum mainnet and the continuation of the pre-fork chain, now known as Ethereum Classic.
Given the frequency at which Ethereum users have been exposed to losses of $60 million and above since then, a hard fork to remedy a hack seems almost unthinkable.

Wealth Market Eyeing 3% Allocation to Bitcoin, Says Bitwise CIO - Benzinga

Following discussions with professional investors about their allocations to Bitcoin BTC/USD, "3% is the new 1%" according to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. "I've been speaking with professional investors about bitcoin since 2018. For the past six years, the discussion has mostly focused on a 1% allocation. That's the most that most investors would think about" Hougan wrote on X. "Boy, has that changed. Almost every investor I've spoken with has talked about a 3%+ allocation." Hougan argued the newly-launched U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds were the primary reason for the shift, de-risking bitcoin's downside. "If ‘going to zero' is off the table, 3% or 5% starts to make more sense" he said. "True institutional investors (pensions, endowments, etc.) will still eye sub 1% allocations, but for the wealth market, 3%+ is the new new thing."Read the full story at The Block.© 2024 Benzinga.com.

KuCoin drops 17% in 24 hours amidst criminal allegations - AMBCrypto



U.S. prosecutors charge KuCoin with anti-money laundering violations and misleading investors.
CEO Johny Lyu addresses regulatory scrutiny, emphasizing that KuCoin is not an exception. 

In a significant development, U.S. Federal prosecutors have leveled charges against KuCoin [KCS], a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, and two of its founders for allegedly breaching anti-money laundering regulations. 
Amid mounting fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), CEO Johnny Lyu highlighted that regulatory scrutiny is common across the cryptocurrency industry. 
He noted, 
“The challenge we’re facing is not unique to KuCoin but rather typical growth and regulatory issues encountered by emerging industries.”
Lyu in defense of KuCoin 
The charges alleged that KuCoin operated within the United States misled investors about its U.S. operations, and neglected to register with relevant U.S. government bodies.
This happened while failing to uphold an anti-money laundering program.
Additionally, Lyu highlighted the inevitability of regulatory gaps in the early stages of an industry’s development, such as cryptocurrencies. He emphasized,
“Early-stage development often sees regulatory gaps, but as the industry matures, we move towards and embrace compliance and standardization.”
Rising optimism amidst upheaval 
All these have influenced the price pattern of Kucoin. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $12.02, marking a 17.08% decline within a single day. 
Despite the recent turmoil surrounding KuCoin, Ki Young Ju’s (the founder of CryptoQuant) insights provide an optimistic perspective. 
According to him, KuCoin appears to be functioning normally amid the panic, with on-chain data indicating increased Bitcoin and Ethereum withdrawals, primarily from retail investors. 
Moreover, there are no signs suggesting KuCoin mixes customer funds, and the exchange maintains adequate reserves to fulfill withdrawal requests. 
This perspective offers stability amidst the uncertainty surrounding the exchange, highlighting the resilience of the platform amidst regulatory challenges.

SafeDAO may finally vote to make SAFE tokens transferable - Blockworks


SafeDAO, the organization governing the smart wallet platform Safe, may soon vote on the possibility of making its SAFE token transferable.
SAFE tokens, introduced in 2022, are a form of digital assets designed for governance within the SafeDAO ecosystem. Over the past two years, recipients of these tokens have been able to use their allocations to vote on proposals that affect the development and operational decisions of the SafeDAO platform.
Initially, these tokens were non-transferable; they couldn’t be bought, sold or traded on any platform. This design choice was likely aimed at ensuring that only stakeholders with a long-term interest in the platform’s success could influence its direction, rather than speculative traders.
Read more: Solana welcomes Circle’s cross-chain transfer protocol
If enacted, the decision to make SAFE tokens transferable will mark a notable shift in SafeDAO’s strategy. Allowing transfers will increase liquidity, making it possible for people to buy and sell SAFE tokens, and will widen participation in governance by attracting a larger and more diverse group of token holders.
André Geest, the head of governance at Safe, told Blockworks that this newfound flexibility could allow the project’s DAO treasury to fund interesting projects within the ecosystem. It could also enable the organization to set up a rewards program and incentivize the usage of safe smart accounts.
“The token also plays a role in this future design space,” Geest said. “When you think about security abstraction, the token could play a role in curating registries. When it comes to payment abstraction, it could help facilitate fee transfers, for instance.”
Making sure tokens are safe
An initial vote to make SAFE tokens transferable in 2022 failed after some community members said, amid hundreds of forum replies, that SafeDAO should first more clearly define its mission and operations.
Geest explained that the 2022 vote hadn’t passed due to a combination of both internal and external factors.
“It was seen that the DAO was not mature enough, in the sense that it didn’t yet have a North Star. Also, one could say that the DAO didn’t have a market fit or a product fit,” Geest said. 
Additionally, following the collapse of FTX, many participants believed token transfers should be suspended until market conditions improved.
In response, a second proposal passed, outlining five milestones the DAO should meet before SAFE tokens would become transferable — ending the SAFE claim period, ratifying a constitution and then a governance framework, voting on how funds should be spent and deciding on the token’s utility. 
Read more: Safe social recovery eases private key management
Fifteen months later, SafeDAO has finally ticked off all five of the milestones, and a Snapshot vote is slated to go live that would make SAFE transferable. 
Luuk Weber, a SafeDAO delegate with experience in multiple DAOs dating back to 2019, called SafeDAO’s milestone system the “most structured approach I’ve seen in any DAO when it comes to aligning on operating logic prior to token transferability.”

“A lot of work has gone into these milestones from a lot of people, there was really heavy lifting from all parts, I think there’s genuinely a very positive sentiment to the progress that has been made, and the progress Safe has made with the product,” Geest said. 
Outside of the DAO, Safe has continued its development of smart accounts that make use of tools like account abstraction to let users create wallets with only an email. Worldcoin uses Safe to create wallets for its users inside of the World App.

Bitcoin Whale Moves 2,000 BTC Dormant for 14 Years


																An unknown individual or entity recently consolidated 2,000 BTC mined in 2010 into a single wallet.
This consolidation, noted by developer mononautical on X, occurred on March 26, involving the transfer of 40 sets of mining rewards, each consisting of 50 BTC, into one wallet.
Bitcoin Miner’s 14-Year Hold Pays Off
Reflecting on the situation, mononautical remarked, “Imagine holding for 14 years as the value rockets from a few hundred dollars to $140 million.” Notably, at the time of mining, the rewards amounted to $600.


Responding to the revelation, another X user, @Psifour, raised concerns about the possibility of compromised key generation, suggesting either a known pool or a random origin for the rewards.




However, mononautical clarified that the miner remains unidentified, suggesting the transfer may have been a strategic move rather than a security breach. “It’s possible the keys were compromised, but it seems like this went straight to an OTC desk,” mononautical added, citing a previous instance of similar old mining wallet sweeps.
This news follows another significant Bitcoin movement over the weekend. The fifth richest Bitcoin address, which had remained dormant since 2019, suddenly sprung to life. According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham, in 2019, this address was funded with 94,500 BTC worth $6.05 billion. The Bitcoin remained untouched until recently when it was divided and transferred to new addresses.
Bitcoin Faces Sell-Side Liquidity Crisis
Adding to the discourse, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju pointed out that the consolidation indicates a “sell-side liquidity crisis waking up old Bitcoin.” Ju also suggested that the transaction pattern indicates over-the-counter (OTC) sales of the funds.
Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s latest “Weekly Crypto Report” outlined an upcoming “sell-side liquidity crisis.” The report attributed the crisis to a surge in Bitcoin demand, mainly fueled by the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. This heightened demand has drastically reduced the available supply for sale.
According to the report, Bitcoin’s liquid inventory has reached its lowest level ever in terms of months of demand, with current supply only sufficient to cover demand growth for twelve months.
It was also highlighted that when considering Bitcoin available strictly on U.S. exchanges, the supply would only be able to meet the demand for half as long, dropping to six months of demand if Bitcoin from exchanges outside the U.S. is excluded. This exclusion is based on the premise that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs will solely source Bitcoin from U.S. entities.

$7.5B AI crypto token merger scheduled for community voting on April 2

A token merger to the tune of $7.5 billion consisting of artificial intelligence (AI) protocols, SingularityNet, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, is scheduled for a community vote of approval on April 2.According to the March 27 announcement, there will be three separate community votes for each individual protocol, with completion of all voting scheduled for April 16. If the union is approved, the Artificial Superintelligence Allia(ASI) token will replace the SingularityNet (AGIX), Fetch.ai (FET), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) tokens, respectively, with ASI having a fully diluted market cap of $7.5 billion across 2.631 billion tokens. The three tokens' current combined market cap is around $5.3 billion. "If approved, it will then be possible to swap $FET for Artificial Superintelligence token at a rate of 1:1," developers wrote. "For example, if you hold 100 $FET, you will be able to swap it for 100 $ASI." The FET token will be the reserve currency of ASI, while users will be able to convert OCEAN and AGIX into ASI at a new fixed rate.An additional 1.48 billion ASI tokens will be minted with 867 million ASI allocated to AGIX holders and 611 million ASI allocated to OCEAN token holders. Therefore, Singularity and Ocean token holders will "receive 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN and 0.433350 $ASI per $AGIX" as a result of the merger. As per Fetch.ai developers:"If you have $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens on an exchange, no action is needed. We will work with each exchange to ensure a smooth conversion and your holdings will automatically be converted to $ASI tokens directly by the exchange. You won’t see $OCEAN or $AGIX on the exchange — but don’t panic! Your tokens are there, just look for the $ASI symbol."In addition, the swap mechanism will be available indefinitely for OCEAN and AGIX users holding tokens on self-custody wallets to convert their balance. As announced the same day, the novel Superintelligence Alliance will share the common goal of developing blockchain-based decentralized AI protocols, which can't be controlled by centralized parties or large stakeholders.Related: Fetch.ai announces GPU rewards for tokenholders after $100M infrastructure investment

                        Solana meme coins continue to dominate the market, and in the latest move Mew Cat Coin (MEW) has exploded after going viral on X.This article will provide an analysis of MEW’s current price trends, and look to see whether the latest incarnation of Dogecoin, represents a more promising investment opportunity.Retail meme coin traders on X are jubilant, as the viral success of MEW’s explosive rally continues to hold strong across the social network – but can price explode to hit $1Bn market cap?MEW Price Analysis: Can The New Big Cat In Town Surge to Top Solana Meme Coin Status?
As price action consolidates at lower trendline support, Mew the Cat is currently trading at a market price of $0.00134 (representing a 24-hour change of -29.87%).This comes after MEW cat coin launched at just 6 AM (UTC) on March 26, in a listing that gained rapid traction due to sudden virality amongst Solana meme coin traders on X.MEW price increased aggressively, surging +15,500% across 7 hours of sustained upside moves, to hit an all-time high of $0.0037 at 12 PM on March 26.Yet, the dramatic move saw early backers amass huge gains, and a wave of profit-taking has swept into the chart in the hours since, with price tumbling -64% as a consequence.This has left an army of 9.19k holders fighting to establish consolidation above lower support at $0.001.However, with a whopping market cap of $118M, upside movements become tough from here on out – with a 10x move now contingent on an influx of over $900m in volume.For this reason, many retail investors are shifting their attention to the viral success of the Dogecoin20 presale – which would need 10x less volume to see a 10x price boom.DOGECOIN20 Hits Viral Success: Over $10M Raised as New Investors Race to Next Dogecoin Project
Dogecoin’s recent price gains have fuelled major interest in spin-off projects, and now investors are racing to take a position in a new crypto presale with over $10m raised so far for the next incarnation of the top DOGE.Viral success triggered Dogecoin20’s explosion above $10M raised, with the presale now heading for an imminent sell-out, so don’t miss the last window of opportunity to get in as an early-bird Dogecoin20.Dogecoin20 is the next-generation version of the top coin in the vertical Dogecoin (DOGE), and investor appetite has been fuelled by the chance to buy in at just 0.0001% of Dogecoin’s market cap.To put things in perspective, if DOGECOIN20 replicates just 1% of Dogecoin’s success, and hits a $192M market cap – investors could be sat atop a 50x return.Next Generation Meme Coins: With viral traction amongst new retail investors, Dogecoin20 is poised to revolutionize the meme coin vertical in the year ahead. With over $10m raised in its first 2 week of presale, this innovative token pays homage to the OG meme coin while setting the stage for a new generation of moon boys.Innovative Tokenomics: Dogecoin20 sets the stage for success in its tokenomics; it’s a powerhouse of innovation. Featuring a capped supply and an ingenious staking mechanism, this token rewards active participation and shields against inflation, setting a new standard for meme coins everywhere.Mission & Roadmap: Leading the charge into the 2024 bull run, Dogecoin20 champions the idea of “Do Only Good Everyday.” With a roadmap focused on charity, community support, and real-world impact, this project aims to redefine the crypto landscape and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.Join the Revolution: Be part of something special.

After Months, Another Bitcoin Spot ETF Launched in the US - This One Is Different from the Others - Bitcoin Sistemi


The United States added one more spot Bitcoin ETF, bringing the total to eleven ETFs. This comes more than two months after the launch of the top ten spot BTC ETFs.
The latest addition to the list is asset manager Hashdex's Bitcoin Futures ETF, which has been trading on the New York Stock Exchange since 2022 as a futures-based fund under the ticker DEFI. The fund has now been renamed and converted to Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, which operates as a spot Bitcoin fund.


Hashdex announced in a press release that unlike other spot Bitcoin ETFs, DEFI can hold up to 5% of the fund's assets in BTC futures contracts traded on CME. According to the statement, this futures allocation will enable DEFI to more accurately track the BTC price over time and provide a more predictable fund creation/redemption process.

This approach is not new for ETFs. In fact, most S&P 500 ETFs use a similar strategy, according to the company. DEFI currently holds 5,500 BTC and a modest number of futures contracts. At 0.90%, the fund's expense ratio is lower than Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) 1.50%, but higher than the other nine spot products.

SEC Lawsuit Against Coinbase Moves Forward-How Bad Is It? - Decrypt

A federal judge overseeing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) sweeping lawsuit against Coinbase ruled Wednesday that the regulator’s arguments against the crypto exchange are largely “plausible,” permitting the case to proceed and denying Coinbase’s motion to dismiss it in its entirety.Rulings on motions to dismiss, such as today’s, are not resolutions of factual disputes. When evaluating such motions, federal judges only dismiss a case if there is not plausible evidence that a law has been violated, even when assuming all facts alleged by a plaintiff to be true.In today’s ruling, however, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Failla not only found most of the SEC’s claims against Coinbase fit for trial, but also indicated support for the agency’s broader, long standing argument about crypto: Many tokenized assets constitute securities schemes, and fall under the SEC’s purview.“The ‘crypto’ nomenclature may be of recent vintage, but the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years,” Judge Failla wrote.On two major claims, Judge Failla allowed the SEC’s case against Coinbase to proceed: that Coinbase operates as an unregistered securities exchange for retail and institutional investors, and that its crypto staking programs constitute additional offerings of unregistered securities.A third claim against Coinbase, however—that via the Coinbase Wallet, the company conducts brokerage activity—was dismissed by Judge Failla. The logic relied on by Failla to dismiss the claim was specific only to the legal definition of a brokerage and does little to aid Coinbase’s remaining case against the SEC.On Twitter, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote that he was not surprised by today’s ruling.https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1772993916146479193“We were prepared for this,” Grewal said. “Early motions like ours against a government agency are almost always denied. But clarity is the ultimate goal and today’s decision continues us on that path.”The SEC’s case against Coinbase now proceeds to discovery. Judge Failla has instructed both parties to submit proposed case management plans by April 19.When Coinbase argued the merits of its motion to dismiss the case in January, Failla appeared intrigued by arguments made by crypto industry advocates.But her ruling today may have indicated not just trouble ahead for Coinbase, but for the crypto industry’s broader, ongoing battle against federal regulators.Buried within Judge Failla’s 84-page judgment was a rejection of Coinbase’s claim that the SEC has violated federal law by failing to disclose its crypto policy. Earlier this week, the DeFi Education Fund sued the SEC on similar grounds.“The SEC is not announcing a new regulatory policy,” Judge Failla wrote today, dismissing such arguments. “But rather is simply engaging in a fact-intensive application of an existing standard—an application that Coinbase also conducted—to determine whether certain transactions involving crypto-assets meet the characteristics of an ‘investment contract.’”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Altcoins Are “Heavily Undervalued,” - Renowned Crypto Analyst


							

Michaël van de Poppe thinks altcoins are still “heavily undervalued.”



Poppe believes an upcoming Bitcoin correction will lead to an altcoin rally.



According to Poppe, the expected Fed interest rate decision will impact the market in the medium term.




Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe thinks altcoins are still “heavily undervalued.” In a recent post on X, Poppe noted that altcoins are slowly moving upward. He cited Chainlink (LINK) as one of the altcoins experiencing significant strength. However, he believes the altcoin season has yet to begin fully.







Poppe’s post on X referenced one of his recently uploaded YouTube videos, where he analyzed the altcoin market, highlighting the current pre-halving trend. The analyst compared the current altcoin market to the situation before the 2016 Bitcoin halving.



According to Poppe, although Bitcoin did not reach a new all-time high (ATH) before the 2016 halving event, the trend of that cycle remains similar to the current price development. He noted a significant impulsive Bitcoin move pre-halving, resulting in a relatable correction. 



Meanwhile, the renowned analyst believes there is still a chance for a pre-halving correction following the current Bitcoin rally. He thinks the expected correction will enable altcoins to perform significantly well. However, Poppe cited the anticipated macroeconomic data expected soon from the U.S. Federal Reserve to impact the crypto market.



In further explanation, Poppe noted that he does not expect the Fed to cut down on interest rates. He thinks that would trigger the market to drop before making its way back up. In his opinion, not cutting down on interest rates would be positive for the market in the medium term.



Poppe noted that the crypto total market cap is closing up on the ATH. He thinks after the recent surge, the wholesale metric would experience some consolidation before continuing upwards. However, the analyst acknowledged the role of Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto ecosystem. He thinks it is nearing a pre-halving peak that would trigger a capital rotation to the benefit of altcoins.

Roger Ver would support Bitcoin again if this happens


Roger Ver was one of the most vocal and important figures for Bitcoin’s (BTC) worldwide adoption in the early days.
The well-known investor and entrepreneur appeared in an interview on the Bitcoin Takeover Podcast on March 27. Among different topics, Roger Ver discussed with Vlad Costa about Ross Ulbricht’s 40th birthday, his thoughts on cryptocurrencies, and what would take Ver to vocally support Bitcoin again.
In particular, he explains that he would need to see Bitcoin being able to provide more economic freedom to the world. However, Roger Ver does not think this has been the case for the past seven years.



“As soon as I see BTC as a product that could have a chance to provide more economic freedom to the world, I would be right back there, in a moment. But, at the moment, I see projects like Monero, Zano, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and things like that having a much much bigger potential impact in freedom for the world.”
– Roger Ver

Moreover, Roger Ver explained that the cryptocurrency world has seen a move from BTC to Monero (XMR) in the darknet. This, according to him, was due to Monero’s privacy features, which help to “bring more economic freedom to the world,” in Ver’s words.

Roger Ver’s new book: Hijacking Bitcoin
The once known as “Bitcoin Jesus” has stepped away from supporting the most capitalized version of Bitcoin, BTC, in 2017. Roger Ver was, back then, one of the main supporters of the alternative, Bitcoin Cash (BCH). BCH aims to be an efficient medium of exchange, besides being a solid store of value, as the narrative behind what we currently know as Bitcoin.

“Whatever people can use as a medium of exchange is also what they want to use as their store of value.”
– Roger Ver

Interestingly, Roger Ver talked about a new book he is launching with Steve Patterson, now in pre-order on Amazon. The book is called “Hijacking Bitcoin: The Hidden History of BTC” and has already made the first place for new releases in “General Technology & Reference.” It is also possible to pay for the book using BCH.
On the notes about “Hijacking Bitcoin,” he comments:

“There is history that needs to be told. For the most part, the histories are told by the victors. The big block side, until now, has lost in terms of the Bitcoin-scaling war, but I think it’s really important for both sides to be heard. And one side engaged in a bunch of censorship and dirty and immoral tactics that are outlined in the book.”
– Roger Ver

Is Bitcoin priced by the free market?
In the discussion between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, the known freedom enthusiast slams external interference on the BTC price.
First, he says that “the free market is never done speaking,” about Bitcoin having a larger value than the alternatives. Second, he explains how, so far, there is no real “free market” dynamics in play to price Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

“It is not a free market at all. Not even remotely close. You have all these bureaucrats and politicians all over the world setting rules for this, and rules for that. BTC is allowed to have an ETF today, maybe Ethereum will next week, and Ripple is in trouble with the SEC, Bitcoin Cash is in limbo, Monero is not allowed to be listed on exchanges in half the countries around the world because it is too private. We are not even remotely close to a free market.”
– Roger Ver

In this context, Roger Ver had also said he believed the cryptocurrency market would have a lot more relevance and value today if Bitcoin had performed well as a medium of exchange.
All in all, the interview lasted for nearly one and a half hours. It was one of the longest interviews with Roger Ver in the past few years. Moving forward, the market could now expect to hear more from the “Bitcoin Jesus.”

RWA Platform Ondo Finance Will Use BlackRock's Ethereum-Based BUIDL Fund to Back Its T-Bill Token OUSG

Ondo's action marks the first example of a crypto protocol leveraging asset management giant BlackRock's tokenized fund offering, which debuted last week. The fund, represented by the Ethereum-based BUIDL token backed by U.S. Treasury bills and repo agreements, is targeted for white-listed, institutional clients and requires at least $5 million minimum allocation. While the strict requirements prohibits smaller investors to invest in BlackRock's BUIDL, it allows other platforms such as Ondo to leverage the fund for its own retail-facing offerings.

Ethereum ETF Delays as US Lawmakers Demand Clarity from SEC - DailyCoin


        
Congress demands clarity on Ethereum’s status after ETF approvals stall.



ETF decision delays prompt calls for definitive crypto regulations.



SEC asked to provide comprehensive guidance on crypto assets. 
In the crypto ecosystem, Ethereum is a key player and the biggest platform for DeFi and decentralized applications. However, its regulatory status remains uncertain, especially as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deliberates on approving ETH-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).Recent developments have seen a group of US lawmakers stepping into the fray, seeking clarity from the SEC regarding Ethereum’s classification and the broader regulatory definitions affecting digital assets.Lawmakers Demand SEC ClarityOn Tuesday, March 26, a group of Republican lawmakers, led by prominent figures in the House Financial Services Committee and House Committee on Agriculture, wrote a letter to the SEC, asking for clarity on digital assets, specifically Ethereum. The letter, signed by 48 lawmakers, directly responds to Prometheum Capital, which will offer custody services for ETH to institutional clients later this month. Lawmakers inquired whether Special Purpose Broker-Dealers (SPBD) can have custody over non-security digital assets like Ethereum.Lawmakers remarked that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC have a record of classifying Ethereum as not a security. However, they also stated that the SEC has hesitated to classify ETH, which has led to heightened uncertainty expressly.The letter also delves into the broader implications of the SEC’s regulatory approach. It emphasizes the potential negative effects on the digital asset markets. A lack of clear guidelines and consistent regulatory policy could impact Ethereum’s derivatives market and influence the broader digital asset landscape. 



The SEC’s wavering is already impacting several major institutions that have filed applications for Ethereum ETFs. SEC’s Postpones Decision on Ethereum ETFsThe SEC has recently postponed its decision on the applications for Ether (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. These delays come despite previous approvals for Bitcoin-based ETFs. Final deadlines for these decisions have been extended to May 2024, reflecting the SEC’s ongoing evaluation process and its call for public comments on these ETF applications. Moreover, recent reports revealed that the SEC is looking to classify Ethereum as a security, a move that would most likely block Ethereum ETFs. 



This postponement of the decision and the latest investigations have raised doubts among traders about the approval of Ethereum ETFs. A Bloomberg analysis put the approval odds at just 25% due to the SEC’s lack of engagement with the process. On the Flipside
Despite the calls for a new framework on digital assets, the SEC has maintained that current regulation is enough. 



SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has been a vocal critic of the agency’s approach to digital assets, spearheading the call for regulatory clarity. 
Why This MattersEthereum’s role as a foundational platform for DeFi, NFTs, and other decentralized applications makes its regulatory classification a pivotal issue for stakeholders in the crypto space.Read more about Ethereum ETF’s winning approval by the SEC: Ethereum ETF Approval Odds Dim to 25% Due to SEC’s InactionRead more about Tether’s big AI play: Tether Bets Big on AI: Can Blockchain Take on Big Tech?

AMC forgot about NFTs


There was a brief period where the movie theater and gold mining conglomerate AMC participated in the then-trendy NFT market, releasing several different collections tied in with various movies or the concept of stock ownership.
Twelve collections were initially released over 306 days, however, it’s been 527 days since the last one listed on the AMC website’s NFT page was released.
Back in this heady era, AMC proudly mentioned NFTs in its financial filings, and even claimed that it would “continue to implement innovative NFT offers to further engage and build loyalty with our guests.” 
The first NFT launch — a tie-in with Spider-Man – No Way Home — reportedly crashed both AMC and Fandango’s websites and led to chief exec Adam Aron to state that the “Spider-Man NFT is a key reason why No Way Home generated the second highest one-day ticket sales in AMC’s entire history.” 

However, it wasn’t mentioned in the next quarter’s filing and hasn’t been mentioned in quarterly filings since. 
The NFTs still exist and are still traded, albeit with varying degrees of value. Someone purchased several of the Spider-Man NFTs several weeks ago, and they were willing to pay almost $20 for each of them. Yesterday, someone also paid $10 for a Batman NFT but most collections are less liquid and traded than these.
AMC’s most recent financial statements warn that its “cash burn rates are not sustainable long-term.”
We have reached out to AMC to see if it intends to issue any new NFTs in the near future and will update this piece if we hear back.

SEC Asks Judge To Order Ripple To Pay Nearly $2,000,000,000 in Fines and Penalties - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked a judge to order Ripple to pay nearly $2 billion in fines and penalties.
The SEC first sued the payments company in late 2020 for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security.










Last summer, US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s automated, open-market sales of XRP, referred to as programmatic sales, did not constitute security offerings, contrary to what the SEC alleged.
The judge did, however, side with the SEC’s claim that Ripple’s sale of XRP directly to institutional buyers constituted a securities offering.
James K. Filan, a defense lawyer and crypto legal expert, shared the SEC’s new Motion for Remedies and Entry of Final Judgment, which was submitted to the court on Monday.
The SEC has asked the court to order Ripple to pay $876,308,712 in disgorgement, $198,150,940 in prejudgment interest, and a $876,308,712 civil penalty, which totals around $1.95 billion.
Argues the regulator,
“Ripple’s years-long, nearly $1 billion, course of violations of the securities laws alone warrants injunctions, significant penalties, and the disgorging of Ripple’s profits. Additional evidence shows the egregiousness of Ripple’s misconduct, highlighting the importance of this relief for deterrence and to ensure Ripple ceases its illegal conduct.”
Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, accuses the SEC of trading in “statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead.”
“Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple – and the industry at large. We trust the Court will approach the remedies phase fairly.”

SEC vs. Ripple Resolution Nears: Is $2B Fine the Final Stroke? - DailyCoin


        
Ripple will face a potential $2 billion fine if the SEC succeeds in classifying XRP as a security.



Both parties could still choose to settle, avoiding a definitive ruling on XRP’s status.



The court has not yet determined the verdict, and the final judgment could be significantly different.
The long-running legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs appears to be nearing its conclusion. The case concerns whether XRP, Ripple’s native token, constitutes an unregistered security. SEC Seeks $2 Billion from RippleThe SEC levied charges against Ripple in December 2020, alleging the company raised over $1.3 Billion through the unregistered sale of XRP tokens. A recent filing by the SEC in the remedies stage seeking disgorgement of $876 Million, which they believe represents Ripple’s net profits from the unregistered sales along with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty, brings the total requested in remedies to nearly $2 Billion.Ripple maintains that XRP is a utility token and not a security, and therefore, it is exempt from SEC registration. They argue that their sales to institutional investors caused no harm and that the SEC’s accusations stifle innovation in cryptocurrency. Ripple’s CLO has stated that their response to the SEC’s filing will be submitted next month and has asserted that the SEC’s statements are false, mischaracterized, and designed to mislead.What’s at Stake?For Ripple, a loss in court could have significant repercussions. A hefty fine would undoubtedly impact their finances, but more importantly, a ruling classifying XRP as a security would subject Ripple to stricter regulations and potentially hinder XRP’s adoption and use case.



While a resolution appears imminent, the final ruling and any imposed penalties remain to be seen. The court could decide in favor of either party or even settle. Here are some possibilities:
Ripple Wins: If the court favors Ripple, it would be a significant blow to the SEC’s efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry.



SEC Wins: A win for the SEC would establish a precedent for future enforcement actions against ICOs and token sales. The $2 Billion fine could be imposed, though the final amount may be less.



Settlement: Both parties could reach a settlement agreement, potentially involving a financial penalty but avoiding a definitive classification of XRP as a security.
The $2 billion figure being circulated represents the SEC’s claim, not a predetermined penalty by the court. The verdict is yet to be determined, and the final judgment could be significantly less or even entirely removed, depending on the court’s decision. On the Flipside
Even with a court decision, a lengthy appeals process could delay any final resolution for Ripple and the crypto industry.



The $2 billion fine isn’t the final judgment for Ripple; they still need to file their response, and the judge will make the final decision.



XRP community members argue that the SEC’s $2B damages claim appears excessive, considering Ripple’s $15B market cap loss at the time of the lawsuit’s filing. They assert the SEC should be accountable for investors’ losses due to its approach.
Why This MattersThis lawsuit sets a potential precedent for how the SEC regulates cryptocurrency tokens. A clear ruling will impact Ripple, XRP, and other companies dealing with token sales, influencing how they structure their offerings and potentially affecting the overall adoption of cryptocurrencies.

KuCoin Moves 2T SHIB in Strange Move as the Law Closes in - DailyCoin


        
KuCoin saw massive outflows yesterday as holders panic over DoJ charges.



Co-founders face allegations from the United States Department of Justice.



On Wednesday, SHIB reclaimed $0.00003, hovering around $18bn market cap.
The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) sent ripples through the cryptosphere yesterday, slapping KuCoin, one of the globe’s leading crypto exchanges, with serious criminal charges for alleged money laundering.Here’s What Set Off the Swirl of Huge WithdrawalsIn an official statement by the DoJ on March 26, 2024, two of KuCoin’s co-founders are accused of conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act by “willfully failing to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program,” which is aimed to prevent the exchange from being used for money laundering and terrorism financing.Naturally, the legal scrutiny has caused panic among KuCoin’s users, who rushed to withdraw their assets. Crypto whales have been spotted relocating tens of millions in popular stablecoins like Tether USD (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) to competing crypto exchanges like Bybit and OKX.Following the accelerated outflows on KuCoin, blockchain analytics firm LookOnChain spotted a 32 million USDT deposit to Bybit on Wednesday morning. According to the reserve statistics, KuCoin now holds approximately $6.137B in digital assets, including over $1bn of Bitcoin (BTC) and 3.37T, or $104.95 million of the popular Japanese guard dog-embossed Shiba Inu (SHIB).2T SHIB Leaves KuCoin Amid Mounting Legal TroublesAmong a flurry of hefty whale transactions, a gargantuan 2 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) transfer was seen by Whale Alert. The 2T SHIB transfer immediately raised eyebrows in X, as cryptocurrency traders witnessed a $62,232,000 SHIB transfer on-chain.Surprisingly, this transaction wasn’t attributed to cryptocurrency whales relocating their crypto stashes due to fear and uncertainty. On the contrary, the cryptocurrency address is tied to KuCoin’s platform, as it’s labeled ‘KuCoin 20’ on EtherScan blockchain explorer.



Further investigation by DailyCoin showed that Shiba Inu is the second largest asset in the ‘KuCoin 20’ account. Worth $63,109,626 at the time of publication, the only larger crypto assets in this hot wallet are over $100 million of KuCoin’s KCS token.On the Flipside
The 2T Shiba Inu transfer amounts to up to 59% of KuCoin’s total 3.37T SHIB reserves.



Most cryptocurrency exchanges tend to shift massive amounts of reserves for maintenance.
Why This MattersKuCoin is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, with nearly 10 million monthly visitors. The criminal charges against the platform’s co-founders resembled last year’s, when the DoJ fined Binance $4.3 billion for similar offenses.Read DailyCoin’s trending crypto stories:

Bitcoin evangelist and financial journalist Max Keiser has commented on the recent news of the court rejecting Coinbase’s request to drop the SEC suit against them. The only achievement of the exchange’s legal team here is that the court agreed to exclude the Coinbase Wallet from the list of subjects of the SEC’s lawsuit. Keiser supports SEC against Coinbase and altcoinsKeiser tweeted that “SEC is right”, again reminding his army of followers that all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin, are “unregistered securities”, including XRP and ETH.SEC is correct. Anything not #Bitcoin is an unregistered security, including ETH & XRPCoinbase was slammed with a legal action by the SEC in the summer last year for allegedly allowing users to trade unregistered securities. For the Securities and Exchange Commission all altcoins are considered securities and only Bitcoin and Ethereum have been proclaimed commodities. However, recently discussions again began rising inside the SEC about whether the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum is a commodity indeed. All Bitcoin maximalists, including Max Keiser and Samson Mow, believe ETH to be a security, a heavily centralized crypto.As for XRP, the case of the SEC against Ripple about this coin has been going since December 2020. Last year, Ripple scored a major victory in mid-summer, when the federal judge ruled that XRP sales on the secondary markets do not qualify as securities sales. The regulator also dropped charges against Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen and the company’s chief executive Brad Garlinghouse.In the latest, development, the SEC demands that Ripple pays $2 billion in remedies to them to cover all the fines and damages caused.

Ripple Legal Saga: Pro-XRP Lawyer Challenges SEC Allegations, Raises Validity Concerns - Coin Edition


							

Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan questions SEC’s allegations, citing lack of evidence and validity.



SEC claims Ripple’s discounts caused $480 million in harm to investors, stirring legal tensions.



Concerns mount over Ripple’s reputation and compliance amidst regulatory scrutiny and legal battles.




In the ongoing legal saga between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Pro-XRP lawyer, Bill Morgan, has stepped forward to provide insights into the potential impact of the regulatory body’s recent allegations. As tensions continue to rise, Morgan’s analysis sheds light on the challenges Ripple faces through legal scrutiny.







Morgan’s comments revolve around the SEC’s accusations aimed at Ripple, particularly concerning the crypto firm’s ‘alleged’ preferential treatment towards institutional investors.



Source: Bill Morgan



The SEC’s latest brief alleges that such preferential discounts given by Ripple could have resulted in harm amounting to a staggering $480 million for investors left out of these arrangements. 



Morgan has expressed reservations about the stance taken by the SEC. He believes that it is necessary to scrutinize the evidence behind the allegations and questions the validity of the SEC’s assertions. He highlights the apparent lack of evidence regarding the causation of the alleged wrongdoing. 



Morgan is also concerned about the potential damage to Ripple’s reputation among institutional investors. The revelation of selective discounts raises questions about the company’s compliance with regulatory standards, particularly regarding disclosure requirements. Such issues could further complicate Ripple’s legal proceedings and erode investor trust in the company.



The SEC has escalated its efforts by appealing to Judge Torres for a final judgment against Ripple. The regulatory agency is seeking a range of punitive measures, including permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties totaling nearly $2 billion.

Samsung tops Apple in AI smartphone race with Galaxy AI updates

Samsung’s free-for-now AI smartphone features will get an update on Thursday, putting the South Korean electronics giant even further ahead of Apple in the race to bring generative AI to cell phones.Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?Samsung first launched Galaxy AI on its Galaxy S24 smartphone in January. The AI software (which leverages Google’s AI chatbot Gemini) offers live translation when users make phone calls, so they can select the language they’re speaking and the language they want their voice to be translated to in real time. There’s also AI photo editing capabilities and “circle to search,” which lets people quickly look up information about an element within a picture. Now the AI features, which come at no cost until 2025, will be available on more Samsung phones — the S23 series, S23 FE, Z Flip 5, and Z Fold 5.Google was the first to debut a smartphone with AI tools with the Pixel 8 Pro in December. But Apple has yet to release an iPhone powered by AI features. The tech giant is reportedly in talks with Google parent Alphabet to use Gemini for iPhones, and it’s also considered leveraging OpenAI’s model. Apple also quietly acquired the Canadian startup DarwinAI earlier this year as it prepares to launch iOS 18 (probably in September) with generative AI features.Apple’s AI push comes as it’s falling behind in the smartphone market. iPhone sales fell 24% year-over-year in China to start 2024.Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan noted  the muted sentiment for Apple during a recent visit to China to meet with supply chain company executives. “This is the first trip over approximately 20 years we have been doing this where smartphones were barely a part of the conversation,” Mohan wrote in an email to investors Wednesday.Apple is facing other challenges, too. The company is being sued by the Department of Justice for allegedly violating antitrust law, and it’s getting investigated by the European Union over similar concerns about allegedly anticompetitive practices. Not to mention the company shuttering its electric vehicle project and its stock underperforming other tech giants in the so-called Magnificent Seven. It’s safe to say Apple has had a rough 2024 so far. A push into AI could give it a boost.

Bitcoin Miner Sued Over Pollution Despite Cleanup Claim - DailyCoin


        
A Pennsylvanian community group sues Bitcoin miner Stronghold Digital Mining.



The community group alleges environmental damage caused by the mining process.



Stronghold claims its activities are helping the local environment. 
The environmental toll of Bitcoin mining continues to be a flashpoint, with critics denouncing the crypto industry’s intensive use of fossil fuels and wasteful draw on electricity supply. This debate is playing out in Pennsylvania, where a community group called Save Carbon County has sued Bitcoin miner Stronghold Digital Mining over claims the firm is polluting the local environment. Yet, Stronghold insists its operations are cleaning up the local area.Bitcoin Miner Stronghold Digital in Legal Hot WaterIn a blow to Bitcoin mining, Save Carbon County has filed a lawsuit against Stronghold Digital, alleging the company’s mining operation is polluting nearby communities by burning waste coal and old tires to power the energy-intensive mining process and releasing mercury into the local waterways.The community group is seeking compensation and punitive damages from the company, as well as a court order to stop the alleged pollution.The lawsuit also names Pennsylvania as a defendant, along with related entities, including the state governor, Josh Shapiro, on the basis that the co-defendants are complicit in violating the state’s constitutional duty to protect the environment by enabling Stronghold Digital’s activities through issued permits and tax incentives.Stronghold Digital stated that its facilities clean up land and water using coal waste from historic mining in the region. The company claimed to have reclaimed over 1,050 acres of formerly blighted land.



This latest case has reignited the debate on Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. Still, industry groups including the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) argue that proof-of-work mining creates an inconsequential impact.BTC Mining Has Minimal Environmental ImpactThe BMC continues to contend that Bitcoin mining is not as environmentally damaging as critics claim. In its latest report for the first half of 2023, the council stated that the Bitcoin network is using 59.9% sustainable energy sources, up from 58.9% in the previous period covering Q4 2022.On the matter of wasteful electricity usage, the BMC claimed the Bitcoin network used just 0.21% of global energy in the first half of 2023, a slight increase from 0.17% in Q4 2022. The council argued that this demonstrates Bitcoin’s minimal burden on worldwide power grids.



The BMC consists of independent Bitcoin miners who voluntarily share their operational data to increase transparency in the mining industry. The organization aims to educate the public on the benefits of BTC mining.On the Flipside
The BMC‘s membership represents a fraction of global miners, meaning its data may be unrepresentative.



Proponents of energy-intensive proof-of-work mining claim it is superior to proof-of-stake as it is more decentralized, and more secure due to the prohibitive cost of attacking a proof-of-work system.
Why This MattersWhile crypto proponents may tout economic opportunities as a result of Bitcoin mining, this case lays bare the tension between those financial incentives and environmental costs. A ruling favoring the community group could encourage more challenges against miners operating in residential areas and spur tighter regulations around emissions and energy sources.The Biden administration pushes energy tax to curb Bitcoin mining activity.

Is KuCoin The Next FTX? CryptoQuant's CEO Has The Answer


								On Tuesday, the US Department of Justice announced criminal charges against the global crypto exchange KuCoin and two of its founders, Chun Gan (also known as “Michael”) and Ke Tang (also known as “Eric”). The charges, related to conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, have stirred concerns among users and investors about the future of the Seychelles-based exchange, echoing fears reminiscent of the FTX collapse.
Is KuCoin The Next FTX?
According to the official press release by the Southern District of New York, the indictment accuses KuCoin and its founders of deliberately failing to implement an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program. This negligence allegedly facilitated the use of the platform for money laundering and terrorist financing activities.
Moreover, the exchange is accused of not maintaining necessary procedures to verify customer identities and failing to report any suspicious activities.

Despite these serious allegations, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju provided a contrasting view, focusing on the exchange’s operational and financial stability. Through a statement on X, Ju highlighted that, from an on-chain perspective, KuCoin’s Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) reserves seem unaffected by the surge in withdrawals, primarily by retail users.
Ju remarked, “On-chain wise, Kucoin is fine. BTC and ETH withdrawals surged, driven mainly by retail users, with a small impact on the overall reserve. They appear to not commingle customers’ funds and have sufficient reserves to process user withdrawals.”

This reassurance comes at a crucial time when the memory of FTX’s downfall, triggered by liquidity issues and allegations of misusing customer funds, still lingers in the minds of the crypto community. Ju made a clear distinction between the reserve management practices of KuCoin and FTX, underscoring the organic nature of KuCoin’s BTC and ETH reserves in contrast to the problematic handling of funds by FTX.
“Kucoin’s BTC and ETH reserves appear organic, unlike those of FTX. They don’t commingle customers’ funds,” Ju stated and shared the Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange reserves charts by CryptoQuant.

Ju contrasted these charts with the one’s from FTX, noting “Here are FTX reserves for comparison. FTX commingled customers’ funds with their funds; you can see a lot of bulk deposits/withdrawals in the charts. It doesn’t look organic.”

As of now, KuCoin hold 5.949 BTC and 99.358 ETH, according to CryptoQuant’s data. The total balance of KuCoin’s portfolio across multiple chains is valued at $4.764 billion, according to Scopescan data.
At press time, the KuCoin token (KCS) traded at $11.42, down -20% since the news broke.

Crypto gaming store Elixir Games announced Wednesday that it has raised $14 million in seed funding to build out a decentralized gaming ecosystem that will launch this year.Final Fantasy developer Square Enix took part in the round following a partnership announced with Elixir last year, plus the Solana Foundation and Shima Capital also participated. Square Enix isn't exclusive with Elixir, however, as it recently announced an investment in competing crypto gaming launcher HyperPlay just last week.The funding will support the development of Elixir's launcher platform that currently hosts over 130 games with more than 500,000 registered users. It will also finance the upcoming rollout of the ELIX token to power Elixir's products and services, as well as the debut of the Launchpad & Incubation Program for crypto game developers."Today marks a growth moment for Elixir Games, fueling our mission to revolutionize the global gaming ecosystem," said Carlos Roldan, CEO of Elixir Games, in a press release. "This achievement reflects our commitment to innovation, unity, and excellence in Web3 gaming."Last year, Elixir expanded further into gaming by acquiring LitLab Games, the Spanish studio behind the auto-chess game CyberTitans. The company has a slate of launches planned for 2024, kicking off with the ELIX token release followed by the Elixir Launchpad to unlock premium platform features and initial game offerings.Elixir will launch a season pass campaign beginning on April 4, with some $750,000 worth of prizes available through game tournaments and other promotions.Editor’s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.
