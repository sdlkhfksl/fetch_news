Cryptocurrency exchange OKX announced that OKX plans to launch spot trading on its platform for Venom Network's VENOM Token.
OKX to Launch Spot Trading for Venom Network's VENOM Token
Venom Network has had a tumultuous journey. Venom, which initially presented itself as a Layer 1 blockchain platform regulated by the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), later abandoned its operations in Abu Dhabi and declared its foundation dissolved.



In particular, the Venom Foundation had previously announced that it had made a significant investment of $1 billion in Web3 companies with Iceberg Capital.
The announcement of OKX's integration into VENOM spot trading marks a potentially important step for the project as it tries to gain a foothold in the cryptocurrency market despite past difficulties.

Ripple (XRP) Whales Mobilized in South Korean Stock Exchanges! 30 Million XRP Withdrawn from Upbit! Are preparations being made? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Whale Alert, a crypto transaction monitoring platform, has detected a significant movement in the XRP market. As reported by CoinMarketCap, approximately 30 million XRP tokens worth $19 million were withdrawn from Upbit, South Korea's leading cryptocurrency exchange.
Rise in XRP Prices Triggered 30 Million XRP Transfer
The withdrawal was directed to an undisclosed address labeled “r3ow”, known for its history of processing large XRP transactions. Currently, only 978,122 XRP tokens remain at this address, indicating a rapid distribution to various destinations.




Such significant withdrawals from exchanges often indicate strategic asset management and potentially reflect bullish sentiment among investors. Conversely, movements towards the stock markets can typically indicate a selling trend.






Although a significant rise in XRP price has been witnessed in recent days with gains exceeding 10%, the token's current trajectory indicates a minor pullback.
Withdrawals have not changed the situation significantly, but remain stable, especially considering XRP's recent performance amid market volatility.


The increase in trading volume, combined with the withdrawal from Upbit, underscores a growing interest and activity surrounding XRP amid broader market volatility.

Three Heavy Industry Stocks to Buy as US Gov. Prepares $6.3 Billion in Grants - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



The US and China are heavily subsidizing the historic transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The Biden admin has committed to have at least 50% of new car sales be electric by 2030. Through private-public partnerships, like the EV Acceleration Challenge, battery manufacturers alone are poised to invest $100 billion to pursue that goal.



The ultimate goal is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Most recently, Biden administration insiders told Bloomberg that $6.3 billion worth of grants will be awarded to decarbonize American heavy industry. From cement and glass products to metals and paper, these industries make up nearly 25% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).



The Department of Energy (DOE) is purportedly to announce on Monday that the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) will be in charge of allocating the funds. Under the ESG umbrella, which companies could benefit from Biden’s latest decarbonization move?



Century Aluminum (NASDAQ: CENX)



Year-to-date, Century Aluminum is up 7.5%. In addition to aluminum products, the company manufactures carbon anodes that are heavily used in lithium-ion secondary batteries and fluorides. In October 2023, Century signed a 3-year contract with Santee Cooper to use Mt. Holly.



The electricity provider will provide the aluminum smelter with 295 MW of power until December 2026. On the decarbonization front, Century announced its intent to partner with MX Holdings to establish a new joint venture this month. The venture aims to produce advanced alloys from recycled content with the aid of a low-carbon secondary billet.



In the latest Q4 2023 earnings, Century ended the fiscal year with $2.18 billion in net sales, leaving a $43.1 million net loss. That is unsurprising, given that cyclical trends and fluctuating aluminum prices bind the sector. Yet, the company beat the market forecast of negative $0.23 earnings per share at positive $0.3 EPS for the quarter.



Based on three analyst insights pulled by Nasdaq, the average CENX price target is $13 vs the current $12.84 per share. However, this does not fully account for the potential for the decarbonization grant.





Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF)



This flat-rolled steel producer follows the same trend as CENX, having gained 7.7% value year-to-date. In addition to flat-rolled steel and iron ore pellets, the company generates revenue from renting real estate property. The company has made great strides in decarbonization, making it a likely grant candidate.



Cleveland-Cliffs integrated natural gas instead to ditch coal injections in steel production. By 2023, the company had already reduced 32% of emissions, ahead of planned 25% by 2030. The company is also involved in carbon capture via the Burns Harbor project, aiming to capture up to 2.8 million tons of CO2 annually.



In January, Cleveland-Cliffs finalized its cutting-edge hydrogen injection trial at the Indian Harbor facility. For the full year 2023, the company ended with $22 billion in revenue and $2.3 billion cash flow from operations, ending the year with $399 million net income vs. $1.3 billion in 2022.



For Q4 2023, Cleveland-Cliffs also beat the market estimate at negative $0.05 vs. the $0.07 EPS forecasted. Based on 10 analyst inputs pulled by Nasdaq, the average CLF price target is $19.32 vs. the current $21.30 per share. The high estimate is $24 vs. the low forecast of $11.41 per share.







Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE: KMB)



Texas-based Kimberly-Clark manufactures a wide range of paper-based products, from hygiene to workplace. Over one year, the company’s KMB stock broke even at -1.8% returns. To achieve its net zero goals, the company committed to a decade-long Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) last November to power its operations with wind.



In May 2022, the company received the Net-Zero Award at the first-ever UK Paper Industry Gold Awards. This was largely fueled by the PPA with Octopus Energy in 2021 to build onshore wind farms in Scotland. In March 2024, Kimberly-Clark received the World’s Most Ethical Companies recognition by Ethisphere. 



For fiscal year 2023, the company yielded a 7% year-over-year gross profit increase to $1.7 billion while increasing its operating margin by 150 bps. Kimberly-Clark’s net income largely remained the same at $509 million vs $507 million the year prior. Of the last four quarters, only the last Q4 failed to beat the EPS forecast at an estimated $1.53 vs the reported $1.51 earnings per share.



Based on 18 analyst inputs pulled by Nasdaq, the average KMB price target is $125.55 vs. the current $125.05. The high estimate is $145, while the low forecast is $110 per share.



Would highly dense nuclear power be better suited for net-zero goals? Let us know in the comments below.

                        The San Diego federal court has ruled that Silvergate Bank must face a class-action lawsuit filed by FTX users which alleges that the bank aided fraud at the exchange and its associated trading firm, Alameda Research.Despite Silvergate’s attempt to dismiss the case in June, a federal court judge denied the motion on Wednesday in the US District Court for the Southern District of California.Judge Denies Silvergate’s Motion to Dismiss Lawsuit Over FTX Fraud Allegations
In a court order on March 20, Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro denied Silvergate’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The judge ruled that the FTX users allegations were sufficient, asserting that Silvergate was aware of FTX’s fraud but benefited from it and unjustly enriched itself at the expense of FTX users. However, all these allegations were denied by the bank.The court found that Silvergate had a duty of care to FTX customers, mainly because of its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) which was designed to facilitate fund transfers to crypto exchanges. The judge emphasized that a crypto exchange like FTX was virtually impossible before establishing SEN.However, in its motion to dismiss, Silvergate argued that it did not owe FTX customers a duty of care and that its dealings, as alleged in the lawsuit, were not a substantial factor in the exchange customers’ inability to withdraw funds. The bank further stated that any alleged harm was primarily the fault of FTX and its co-founder, Sam Bankman-Fried; the judge found these claims unconvincing.Notably, Silvergate provided banking services to FTX and Alameda, processing transfers and accepting deposits that directed FTX customer funds to Alameda’s account since FTX initially lacked a bank account. The judge noted Silvergate’s strong incentive to continue these operations due to its reliance on the exchange for business growth.Furthermore, the order noted that Silvergate’s income surged from $7.6 million to $75.5 million annually after it began banking FTX, with revenue generated from translation fees and interest deposited into FTX-related accounts. The order stated that it was foreseeable that allowing the exchange customer funds to be deposited into non-FTX accounts would lead to fraud and harm to the owners of those funds.Silvergate argued that if it had denied FTX’s transfers, the exchange would have found another bank, a claim the judge deemed highly speculative, given the limited number of banks willing to service the crypto industry.However, the judge dismissed these arguments as “highly speculative,” noting that Silvergate was one of the few banks willing to service the crypto industry.Three Lawsuits Against Silvergate Consolidated Over Allegations of Aid in FTX Fraud
The judge’s approval came more than a year after the lawsuits were initially filed in February 2023. In April 2023, United States District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the Northern District of California decided to consolidate the three lawsuits against Silvergate. Each lawsuit accuses Silvergate of aiding investor fraud by the collapsed crypto exchange FTX.Four former investors brought these cases and remain separated from other federal cases against FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. However, they will be combined by the litigants’ mutual agreement, according to a report from Law360 on April 19.The order stated, “The Silvergate cases involve common questions of law and fact, as they name common defendants, arise from the same alleged course of conduct, and assert overlapping causes of action, such that the Silvergate cases are appropriate for consolidation.”FTX filed for bankruptcy in November of the previous year, causing liquidity problems for Silvergate. Following a bank run, Silvergate disclosed its plans to “voluntarily liquidate” assets and shut down operations about a month later, in March 2023. Additionally, the bank faced a class-action lawsuit in January for securities law violations.Bankman-Fried was found guilty of seven fraud and money laundering charges last November as part of the FTX court case. His sentencing date is March 28.

Ethereum Statement from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse! "Like XRP, ETH Will Also Win!" - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the reaction of the cryptocurrency market grew against the investigation launched against the Ethereum Foundation in the USA and the SEC's efforts to classify ETH as a security, the latest statement came from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.
At this point, Ripple CEO expressed his support for Ethereum in the face of the investigation launched against the Ethereum Foundation and the campaign launched by the SEC to classify ETH as a security.


While referring to the SEC's defeat against Ripple, Garlinghouse emphasized that the SEC constantly loses in the courts.
In addition, stating that the SEC constantly fights with the cryptocurrency industry, Ripple CEO said that the SEC always loses in the end.





Garlinghouse finally pointed out that he was sure that the SEC would lose against Ethereum as well and said:

“The SEC picked a fight with the cryptocurrency industry but ended up losing badly in the courts.
They now struggle with regulators like the CFTC and lag behind their international counterparts.
“When will the SEC realize that it will lose against ETH just like it lost against XRP?”

Bitcoin 2024 Halving Explained by Revolut's Karl Devin | Cryptoglobe


                                
As the world of cryptocurrency gears up for Bitcoin’s much-anticipated halving event in April 2024, investors and enthusiasts alike are speculating about its potential impact on the market. Karl Devin, a key figure in the Strategy & Operations (Crypto) team, sheds light on the significance of this event and what it could mean for the future of Bitcoin.







Bitcoin’s programmed scarcity mechanism, known as halving, is a cornerstone of its design and a key factor in its potential value proposition. Halving events, which occur roughly every four years, directly slash the reward for Bitcoin miners in half. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems. By adding verified transaction blocks to the blockchain, they earn newly created Bitcoin, and the process itself maintains the network’s security.



The first halving in 2012 reduced the reward from 50 BTC to 25 BTC per block. The most recent cut, in May 2020, brought the reward to 6.25 BTC. The next halving will further decrease it to around 3.125 BTC.



This engineered scarcity is at the heart of Bitcoin’s appeal as a potential long-term store of value. With only 21 million Bitcoins ever coded into existence, halving progressively chokes off the supply of new coins entering circulation. This dynamic aims to mirror the finite nature of precious resources like gold, where increased scarcity can potentially drive higher prices as demand grows. Additionally, by gradually reducing mining rewards over the long term, halving helps ensure network security remains incentivized and profitable, attracting the necessary computing power to keep the Bitcoin network robust.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Devin points out that, historically, Bitcoin’s halving events have been followed by significant price surges, as the reduced supply coupled with increasing demand drives up the cryptocurrency’s value. Devin notes that these events underscore Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against inflation, particularly during times of extensive monetary expansion by central banks and governments.







However, Devin cautions that predictions surrounding the 2024 halving event are largely speculative, and the actual outcome remains uncertain. While many experts anticipate a positive impact on Bitcoin’s value due to the reduced mining rewards and consequent scarcity, he reminds us that the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and unpredictability.



Moreover, he goes on to say that the effects of Bitcoin’s halving event may extend beyond the primary cryptocurrency, potentially influencing the valuation and interest in other digital currencies. As Bitcoin often serves as a benchmark for the broader cryptocurrency market, he believes that its performance following the halving could have far-reaching implications.



As investors eagerly await the 2024 halving event, Devin advises a cautious approach, suggesting a retrospective analysis in early 2025 to fully comprehend its effects. He reminds readers that past performance does not guarantee future results, highlighting the inherently speculative nature of cryptocurrency investments.

                        Meme Coin markets have become the fastest-growing opportunity in finance this month, and retail investors are now scrambling to find new meme coins to secure big profits.The frenzied meme coin season was triggered early in 2024, when the now iconic Solana meme coin DogWifHat (WIF) token exploded onto a multi-billion dollar market cap.In the weeks since crypto markets have gone parabolic as millions of investors around the world race to find new meme coins to make it big.Biggest Meme Coin Market Rug Pulls – March 22
However, with the statistics showing that the majority of Solana meme coin launches lose investors money – is this a smart money game for schmucks? Let’s unpack some of today’s biggest rug pulls.Rug Pull #1 – Based Wojak (BOJAK)
In a return to classic ERC-20 meme coin architecture, BOJAK is an intrepid meme coin setting out to make it big in a double-edged play on 2023’s memorable WOJAK token – rebirthed (at least in name) into the BASE blockchain trend.However, despite a massive influx of $1.14m in 24-hour trading volume, and surging up a whopping +53,687% at its peak – BOJAK has almost completely bled out over the afternoon – leaving more than 2,000 holders in despair.Rug Pull #2 – Pnut (PNUT) 
Next up, a new Solana meme coin called PNUT – a ticker play on the word peanut – briefly exploded on Raydium DEX markets with a +145,228% rally to an all-time high suckering in almost 2,000 traders.Yet, a near-complete retracement has seen the majority of PNUT holders left underwater, with prices collapsing -97.5%, leaving PNUT market cap low at $332k.Rug Pull #3 – Shrek (SHREK)
Last but not least, another Solana meme coin that witnessed a seismic rug pull today is the Shrek token – a light-hearted play on everyone’s favorite Ogre.Amid impressive $2.3m trading volumes, SHREK shot up an initial +62,482% – to reach lofty heights around $0.034 – before falling victim to a tumultuous -98.75% drop that has left 1,190 holders short-changed.Looking For A Safe New Meme Coin Play With Big Potential Returns?
Then look no further than the viral Dogecoin20 presale, which has exploded in just three days to hit a jaw-dropping $6M raised.With DOGE20 hitting terminal velocity throughout today, the Dogecoin20 presale looks poised for an explosive weekend ahead as investors rush to position for early-bird advantage in the fastest-growing meme coin presale.A replica play on the biggest meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), the real appeal of Dogecoin20 lies in the opportunity to buy the next DOGE at just 0.0001% of Dogecoin’s market cap.Stop a second to imagine the possibilities – if DOGECOIN20 replicates just 1% of Dogecoin’s success, and hits a $192M market cap – investors could be walking away with life-changing 50x returns – all without the overhead risk of a rug pull as seen in straight to DEX launches.Viral Success Amongst Meme Coins: Dogecoin20, is making waves across crypto as the explosive growth of the presale accelerates towards $7.5m in its first week. In what could be a sell-out play, this innovative token pays respect to the biggest meme coin while onboarding a new generation of moonboys.Skyrocket Tokenomics: Dogecoin20 is an upgrade on your usual token; with tailor-designed tokenomics driven by a powerhouse of innovation. Features such as a capped supply and an ingenious super high yield staking mechanism hint at the skill of the development team.Mission & Roadmap: Dogecoin20 embodies the ethos of “Do Only Good Everyday.” With a supercharged roadmap focused on philanthropy, community building, and tangible real-world impact, this project aims to redefine the crypto landscape and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.Join the Revolution: Be part of something special.

COIN's Ancillary Businesses Will Help Drive Growth: JMP Securities

“Still, relative to the growth opportunity in the exchange and custody offerings, we see a just as exciting of an opportunity in the development of blockchain use cases today and expect Coinbase to participate in much of that continued evolution,” the authors wrote.Those opportunities include participation in the tokenization of real-world assets, such as its recently announced partnership with Blackrock (BLK), activities in payments such as its venture with stablecoin issuer Circle and Web3 development and decentralized apps (dapps), as well as staking, the report said.Coinbase can participate in much of the future growth and innovation in the sector by working with TradFi firms looking to become involved with digital assets rather than competing with them, the report added.The broker continues to see spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) adoption as a significant catalyst for the market, however, “ETF flows will not come on a smooth line, particularly with some transitory selling related to GBTC.”

Polygon (MATIC) Labs has unveiled a new tool for developers.



The tool dubbed DApp Launchpad promises to simplify the dApp development process for EVM chains.



Polygon (MATIC) Labs urged developers to consider launching on Polygon.
Over the past year, the Polygon (MATIC) Labs team has been working hard, releasing new features, tools, and technological feats at a staggering rate. Barely a month after the firm announced the development of a new zero-knowledge proving system in partnership with StarkWare, developers of the Starknet protocol, the firm is back again with a new tool promising to unlock DApp development at scale.Polygon (MATIC) Labs Unveils DApp LaunchpadTo make the development of DApps easier and faster, on Thursday, March 21, Polygon (MATIC) Labs announced the release of the dApp Launchpad, describing it as a command-line interface to abstract the complexities of building DApps on EVM chains.At the core of the dApp Launchpad are three main features. These features include an automated environment setup allowing developers to get started with the actual coding with minimal fuss, seamless front-end and smart contract integration that automatically allows smart contract changes to reflect on the front-end, and DApp deployment through a single command.Beyond the benefits for developers, Polygon (MATIC) Labs also seeks to use the tool to bolster activity in its multichain ecosystem.Polygon (MATIC) Lab Talks up the AggLayerCentral to Polygon’s growing multichain ecosystem is an interoperability protocol dubbed the Aggregation Layer, or AggLayer, promising to unlock unified liquidity for Layer 2 chains either built with Polygon’s proprietary stack, the CDK, or using its newly launched Type 1 prover with “near-instant” and “atomic transactions.”In February 2024, version 1 of the AggLayer went live, offering users a taste of what the protocol can do. Regarding the AggLayer benefits, Polygon (MATIC) Labs urged developers to build on Polygon.“Building a dApp today on Polygon PoS, one of the most adopted chains in the world, or choosing to launch on the performant Polygon zkEVM chain, means developers will tap a future constellation of aggregated blockchains and all the network effects that entails.”The Polygon multichain ecosystem has already seen interest from over 20 projects, most still in development. Popular names include Astar, Manta Pacific, and Flipkart.On the Flipside
Despite Polygon’s technological advancements, the price of the network’s native token, MATIC, continues to concern investors. Over the past few days, the asset’s price has slipped below the keenly watched $1 price level.
Why This MattersThe newly launched dApp Launchpad promises to encourage the development of more novel crypto tools. At the same time, abstracting away the complexities of DApp development could minimize bugs and reduce the chances of hacks.Read these for more on Polygon:Polygon (MATIC) Labs To Guide Web3 Gaming Bets for $100M FundPolygon (MATIC) Back Below $1, Just a Healthy Correction?

Fantom (FTM) Jumps 180% In 4 Weeks: Just The Beginning?


                            Over the past 24 hours, Fantom (FTM) has emerged as the standout performer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, registering a remarkable 13.5% gain. This surge is part of a broader rally that has seen the FTM price soar by 180% over the last four weeks, propelling it from $0.42 to $1.20. This upward trajectory has significantly boosted Fantom’s market capitalization to $3.3 billion, positioning it as the 41st largest digital asset worldwide. Here’s why this might be just the beginning:
#1 Sonic Upgrade: The Catalyst for Fantom’s Rally
The anticipated Sonic upgrade is central to Fantom’s recent success. Designed to enhance the Fantom technology stack, Sonic introduces major scalability improvements without necessitating a disruptive hard fork. Key components of the Sonic upgrade include:

Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM): Aims to significantly boost transaction throughput.
Carmen Database: Promises to reduce storage requirements by up to 90%.
Optimized Lachesis Consensus: Improves upon the existing consensus mechanism for enhanced performance.

With these enhancements, Fantom targets a throughput of over 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), marking a substantial leap in scalability. Importantly, the upgrade ensures that existing Fantom Opera smart contracts and tools remain fully compatible with the Sonic mainnet, which is scheduled to launch in Spring 2024.

Recent testnets have demonstrated Sonic’s potential. The closed testnet, focused on ERC-20 swaps, achieved an impressive ~4,000 TPS with ~1.3-second finality. Furthermore, a reconfiguration to process only ERC-20 transfers led to a groundbreaking ~10,000 TPS at ~1.6-second finality, showcasing the capabilities of next-generation decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and wallets.


Reflecting on Sonic’s impact, Reflexivity Research highlighted, “Fantom Sonic unlocks new possibilities for the Fantom ecosystem, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, blockchain games, high-frequency applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT).”
The research firm added that another cornerstone for Fantom is its exemplary 99.9% uptime. “Fantom’s novel solutions position it as a frontrunner in the development of decentralized networks,” Reflexivity Research stated.
#2 Andre Cronje: The Innovator’s Promise
Andre Cronje, the founder of Fantom and one of the brightest minds in the crypto industry, has been instrumental in driving innovation within the ecosystem. Cronje recently underscored his commitment to advancing the crypto space, stating, “The number 1 dex on Base, and the number 1 dex on Optimism are both built with code I wrote and pioneered. Stick to where the innovators are, post Sonic I will be adding some new primitives to crypto.”

#3 Coinbase Announcement: A New Milestone
Another factor driving today’s price rally is probably today’s Coinbase International announcement that it will launch Fantom perpetual futures on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced, set to commence on or after 9:30am UTC on March 28, 2024. This move by Coinbase is expected to further enhance Fantom’s liquidity and accessibility, contributing to its growing appeal among investors.


#4 Technical Analysis: FTM/USD
The bullish momentum of Fantom price is apparent in the weekly FTM/USD chart on Binance, signified by the latest candlestick closure above the key exponential moving averages (EMAs) of 20, 50, 100, and 200 periods. This week’s candlestick represents a notable increase of approximately 50% from the intra-week low.
Fantom’s ascent has propelled its value beyond the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, situated at $0.9176. This bullish breakout suggests the market may target subsequent Fibonacci levels, with $1.38 (0.382 Fib) acting as an intermediate psychological and technical resistance, followed by $1.76 (05 Fib), and potentially extending towards the golden ratio at $2.13, which corresponds with the 0.618 Fibonacci level.
On the flip side of this bullish scenario, should a correction occur across the broader crypto market, immediate support for FTM can be anticipated at the $0.92 level. Stability at or above this threshold could reaffirm bullish market control. Conversely, a downward breach could intensify selling pressure, possibly leading to a retest of support around the $0.56 mark.

In an industry founded on technological innovation, the projects with the most staying power are ones that nurture and pioneer the development of blockchain’s utility potential.After all, to drive adoption, which is the endgame for every player in the industry, crypto projects have to interact, integrate and dovetail with other emerging technologies.It’s in the intersection of blockchain, VR and AI that we find the concept of “Web3”, a term describing a future decentralized iteration of the internet driven by these technologies.There in Web3 is 5thScape, the world’s first crypto, VR, and AI ecosystem.While every crypto project is technically a Web3 project, a few, like 5thScape go a step further into the future: into the metaverse.Like Web 3, the metaverse is another term for an envisioned internet shakeup.The metaverse essentially refers to the applications and features of Web 3 that people will interact with in a virtual reality space.And as a tokenized gaming platform, 5thScape promises to be at the forefront of the metaverse.Participation is easy, gamers simply buy and hold tokens to get access to the platform, where they will be able to game and stream for free.Furthermore, the project team took development back to first principles and designed all the software and hardware in-house.5thScape’s 5SCAPE Tokenomics
5SCAPE has a market cap on launch of $15 million and is currently priced at $0.00215, although this is due to rise 15% to $0.00248 when the third round begins in under two days. Eighty percent of the total token supply is up for purchase in the presale. When it concludes, 5SCAPE’s fixed listing price will be $0.01, giving the token a possible prelaunch upside potential of over 365%. 5thScape is also fully audited with KYC and the team behind it are transparent.Those who join the community over on the project’s socials channels can stay informed of tasks to claim even more 5SCAPE rewards before the protocol launches.Interested?

Outflows from Bitcoin ETFs Continue! To what extent do purchases cover sales? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


On March 22, Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed significant net outflows, with money being withdrawn for the fourth consecutive day. Total net outflow reached $93.85 million, reflecting investor sentiment amid ongoing market volatility.
Bitcoin Spot ETFs Experience Significant Outflows Amid Volatility
Leading the outflows was Grayscale ETF GBTC, which recorded a staggering single-day net outflow of $358 million.


This brings GBTC's historical net outflow to $13.63 billion, marking a significant shift in investor position regarding Bitcoin.
In contrast, amid outflows, BlackRock ETF IBIT emerged as the Bitcoin spot ETF with the highest single-day net inflow.






IBIT exhibited the opposite trend in investor behavior, with a significant net inflow of $233 million. With this latest inflow, IBIT's total net inflow reached $13.32 billion. Fidelity, on the other hand, made a net inflow of 2.9 Million dollars.
The contrasting movements between GBTC and IBIT highlight the different sentiments prevailing in the market. While some investors appear to be withdrawing from Bitcoin-related assets, others are taking advantage of the market downturn and increasing their exposure. However, it is necessary to know that most of the outflows in GBTC are also due to high transaction fees.


Bitcoin's recent price fluctuations and uncertainties regarding regulatory developments have contributed to volatility in the cryptocurrency market.
Such dynamics often prompt investors to re-evaluate their positions and adjust their portfolios accordingly.

Internet Computer (ICP) Set to Reach $15 on This Day


The Internet Computer (ICP) price has been consolidated since the beginning of the year, and the recent recovery is set to continue this consolidation.
This ascertains one outcome: the altcoin will more than likely hit $15 before the end of the month.
Internet Computer Price Climbs Back Up
Internet Computer price fell to the low of $10.91 over the past two weeks before beginning a recovery in the last few days. As the cryptocurrency made its way back into consolidation, bullish signals began arising.
Relative Strength Index (RSI) can be seen back up above the neutral line of 50.0 after falling into the bearish zone for the first time since October 2023. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
Internet Computer RSI. Source: TradingView

Readings above 70 indicate overbought conditions, suggesting a potential reversal or correction. Whereas a reading below 30 indicates oversold conditions, suggesting a potential upward reversal.

The indicator’s presence above 50 is a bullish signal, indicating that a further rise is likely.
ICP Price Prediction: Further Upside on the Cards
In addition to the RSI, Internet Computer price is also observing a similar signal from the Ichimoku Cloud. This indicator is a comprehensive indicator in the technical analysis used to gauge momentum, trend direction, support and resistance levels, and potential reversal points.

In the case of ICP, the indicator forms a bearish crossover owing to the recent decline. However, following the recent recovery of 22.56% in the last three days, ICP has made it back up above the cloud.
ICP/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView
When the price is above the cloud, it’s considered bullish, suggesting the altcoin has room for growth. If the support level of $12.91 is maintained, the Internet Computer price will be able to make its way up to $15. Since this would warrant a 14% rally, the chances of this happening are by the end of the month.
Lack of Optimism Might Interfere
Despite the bullish signals, the investors are not indicating much confidence in this rise. This is evident from the lack of bullish bets on Internet Computer prices. The Funding Rate at the moment, despite being positive, is at a multi-month low.
Internet Computer Funding Rate. Source: Coinglass

A positive funding rate shows that investors are still pining for an increase. However, a declining positive funding rate shows this sentiment waning. Thus, if the altcoin witnesses a negative funding rate, it would hint at a potential drawdown. 

This would invalidate the bearish thesis and pull ICP down to $10.97, which would result in a correction to $10.

Akon’s cryptocurrency and city have failed - enter Idris Elba


In 2020, Akon, the bestselling Grammy-nominated musician, made a bold and ultimately absurd claim that he was going to build a Wakanda-style city in Senegal. The mockups were glorious: slim, shiny, curved skyscrapers, new museums, and forested boulevards, all in the heart of a country where 36% of people live below the poverty line.
Part of the scheme relied on ‘Akoin’ – a cryptocurrency created in 2018 and boasting the slogan “One Africa. One Koin.” The crypto, along with the city, was intended to unite Africa behind a greater vision and an accessible, digitized economy.
However, these dreams of a futuristic, Frank Gehry-inspired cityscape in Senegal and a unified African currency soon became nightmares not just for Akon but for everyone.

Unpaid loans, delistings, and lawsuits
Despite Akon going from media outlet to media outlet and podcast to podcast extolling the virtues of Akon City and Akoin in 2019 and 2020, the projects themselves soon began to falter.
First, a lawsuit was brought against Akon by his former business partner, then Akon blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for delays, and finally, Sapco, the entity that purchased the land for the city, failed to pay hundreds of individuals who sold their land nearly a decade before.
Akon is still suggesting that the city will be developed — at least partially — by 2026, yet the reality on the ground is looking less and less like Wakanda and more like any other failed urban project.
Meanwhile, Akoin has been delisted from every exchange where it was once available for purchase. Refunds have been handed out to buyers, the Akon City website has been taken down, and Akon has stated on Cameo (the website where celebrities are paid by people to record personalized videos) that he will do no crypto-related requests.

Idris Elba enters the chat
So, now that it’s clear that a new, ridiculously structured city in a poverty-stricken country requires experts and those with the money and means to get the project across the finish line, actor Idris Elba has decided to start his own new city just off the coast of Sierra Leone. Again, a country where a significant portion of the population lives below the poverty line.
The dream is, once again, a rather large one and the attempt to construct an ‘eco city’ looks to be largely reliant on the goodwill and intentions of artists, venture capitalists, and governments. It’s unclear exactly what lies in store for the small island of Sherbro, as no plans have yet been unveiled, but Elba has told journalists that, “the character of the island hopefully will remain intact.”
The move is slightly troubling, as Elba has previously narrated and starred in what can only be described as a propaganda film for the gold industry — an industry that regularly destroys and annihilates entire ecosystems to mine for the precious metal, often at the expense of locals.
A majority of gold mining takes place in poverty-stricken regions desperate for cash, where regulation and human safety are ignored. The gold ‘documentary’ fails to address these issues and concerns in any meaningful way.
Regardless, Elba has suggested that the city will take decades to plan and construct — a much more realistic vision than the one intended for Akon City — and hasn’t planned any silly tokenized currency to accompany it.

Top Ethereum L2s Ready To Ship Major Upgrades - The Defiant

Starknet, Optimism, and Polygon are all working on major upcoming upgrades.The Layer 2 sector is booming, with many of Ethereum's leading scaling solutions preparing to ship major upgrades.On March 20, Starknet announced a new roadmap for 2024, prioritizing increasing throughput and performance over the coming months.Starknet will introduce transaction parallelization with its 0.13.2 version upgrade in Q2 2024. The network will simultaneously execute transactions, speeding up both finality and throughput.“ERC-20 transfers from different users, for example, will be executed concurrently instead of sequentially,” Starknet said.Starknet will follow up by integrating a Cairo-native sequencer and virtual machine with its 0.13.3 version in Q3 to unlock further scalability gains by reducing transaction latency. Starknet is also planning future upgrades introducing volition — allowing dApp data to be stored on Starknet rather than the Ethereum mainnet, in addition to data and batching compression.“One of Starknet’s main goals for the coming months is to improve network performance — specifically throughput — in order to support the expected rise in the number of users and developers on the network,” Starknet said.Starknet’s updated roadmap follows the project launching support for EIP-4844 — the main fee-saving upgrade included in Ethereum’s recent Dencun fork — as part of its 0.13.1 version. The new version also coincided with the introduction of gas subsidies intended to bring transaction fees down to the levels anticipated following the launch of other fee-saving mechanisms set to go live in the future.Average transaction fees on Starknet have dropped by 97% since the upgrade went live, according to GrowThePie.Polygon prepares to introduce EIP-4844Polygon will introduce support for EIP-4844 with its upcoming Feijoa upgrade, which is scheduled for May.Polygon noted that its zkEVM rollup is expected to enjoy fee savings of up to around 65% following the upgrade, while EIP-4844 is unlikely to have a significant impact on its PoS Chain’s fees.DeFi AlphaPremium ContentLooking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community.DeFi Daily | WeekdaysDeFi Alpha Letter | WeeklyDefiant Podcast Transcript | WeeklyInbox Dump | SaturdayWeekly Recap | SundayStart for freeFeijoa will also introduce support for KZG commitment verification through EIP-2537 as part of Feijoa.Optimism to introduce fault proofsOn March 18, deployed fault proofs on the Sepolia testnet, describing its code as comprising the first “open-source, permissionless, feature-complete fault proof system” in the Ethereum ecosystem.Fault proofs enable permissionless validation across any chain leveraging Optimism’s OP Stack. “This means that withdrawals of ETH and ERC-20 tokens from OP Stack Chains can be initiated without involvement from any trusted third party,” OP Labs said. “It also means that invalid withdrawals can be challenged and removed by any user that wants to participate in the protocol.”Fault proofs will next go live on OP Mainnet, pending governance approval. OP Labs said future upgrades will negate the need for Optimism's Security Council to act as a centralized safety net backstopping fault proofs, furthering the protocol’s decentralization.“Stage 1 still includes a safety net allowing us to block withdrawals and override dispute game results to protect the bridge during the system's nascent stages,” OP Labs tweeted.Espresso closes Series B roundIn other Layer 2 news, Espresso Systems, the development team behind the Espresso marketplace for shared sequencers, announced the completion of a $28 million Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz.“This round of funding will enable us to scale our team and bring a production-ready implementation of Espresso to the ecosystem,” Expresso said.Espresso’s marketplace allows rollups to “sell the right to build their blocks” to the highest bidding block proposer. This bolsters the decentralization of Layer 2s by eliminating reliance on centralized proprietary sequencing systems.Both block builders and L2s generate revenue through the marketplace, with bidders spanning Layer 1 proposers, rollup sequencers, and other block proposers.“Fragmentation and centralization are two of the biggest obstacles in Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap,” Espresso tweeted. “Apps scattered across the plethora of L2s lose the composability they are used to enjoying on the Ethereum Layer 1. Shared sequencers address this problem.”The round also featured participation from leading L2 teams including Offchain Labs, Polygon, and StarkWare, demonstrating a vote of confidence in Espresso’s marketplace from the Layer 2 sector.Express will launch its fifth testnet deployment next month.

ESMA's resource constraints hinder the EU's crypto regulation efforts

The European Union (EU) faces a significant hurdle in establishing a robust regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) grapples with resource constraints. This obstacle potentially puts the EU at risk of lagging behind other global markets in adopting cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.ESMA’s resource challengesESMA, the Union’s premier regulatory authority tasked with overseeing Europe’s complex financial landscape, is confronted with resource constraints that hinder its ability to effectively regulate cryptocurrencies. Verena Ross, the chairperson of ESMA, has acknowledged the issue, citing the agency’s numerous additional responsibilities and mandates in recent years without corresponding increases in resources.Ross stated, “Resources is an issue for ESMA generally because we have had a large number of additional responsibilities and mandates given to us over the last few years, and not always necessarily with a lot of additional resources.”One notable consequence of ESMA’s resource constraints is the delay in meeting the European Commission’s deadline for assessing the potential inclusion of crypto assets within Ucits funds, a popular investment vehicle among European retail investors. This delay, as noted by Ross, could extend the timeline to the end of 2024 or even early 2025.EU falls behind in crypto oversight amid global trendsWhile the EU struggles with regulatory challenges, other global players, notably the United States, have embraced cryptocurrencies with open arms. The regulatory agility in the US has led to the proliferation of Bitcoin ETFs, attracting significant investments since January 2024. This contrast highlights the EU’s comparatively sluggish pace and rigid regulations, potentially leading to capital flight as funds seek more innovation-friendly environments overseas.Moreover, the lack of harmonization in regulations within the EU poses significant challenges for businesses operating across member states. For instance, Jupiter Fund Management’s experience illustrates the disparities in regulations, with their Irish Ucits fund compelled to abandon a planned crypto investment due to stringent Irish regulations, while Spain allows exposure to such assets through exchange-traded products.Addressing these challenges requires swift action from EU policymakers to streamline regulations, foster innovation, and ensure the region remains competitive in the rapidly evolving global crypto landscape. Failure to do so risks further exacerbating the gap between the EU and its counterparts, hampering economic growth and investor confidence in the region.Urgent need for a transparent regulatory frameworkThe convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrencies underscores the urgent need for a transparent and cohesive regulatory framework within the EU. The emergence of US-based ETFs and the UK’s openness to comparable offerings accentuates this necessity. ESMA recognizes the interconnectedness between crypto assets and the traditional financial sector and emphasizes the importance of getting the Ucits review right.Verena Ross emphasized, “What we’re seeing happen is just an increased interconnectedness between crypto assets and the traditional financial sector and various products.”Addressing ESMA’s resource constraints is imperative to ensure effective crypto regulation within the EU. With a limited staff of merely 300 and an unchanged budget from the previous year, ESMA must prioritize tasks rigorously. This may involve strategic staff allocation and potentially retraining existing employees to specialize in crypto regulation. Additionally, a phased rollout of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation could alleviate the implementation burden for both ESMA and member states.EU must address ESMA’s resource challenges to foster innovation, protect investors, and maintain competitiveness in the global digital economy. A well-funded and empowered regulatory watchdog is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

                        Traders use platforms like DEXScreener to find the top crypto gainers today. Source: DEXScreener’s X AccountWith major cryptocurrencies struggling on Friday as focus returns to heavy and largely GBTC-driven spot Bitcoin ETF outflows, traders looking to turn quick exponential profits continue to flock to the on-chain shitcoin markets as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin (BTC) was last around 2.5% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap, and trading in the mid-$63,000s.Other major cryptos Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) dropped as much as 5% over the same time period.As per Zerohedge, GBTC is now down to 356,000 BTC from 619,000 BTC just two months ago.Traders having been dumping GBTC since it converted into a spot ETF.That’s because of its 1) comparatively high fee (of 1.5%), 2) traders who bought GBTC at a big discount to NAV in 2023 before it converted to an ETF taking profit and 3) bankrupt crypto companies (like FTX, Celsius and BlockFi) liquidating holdings.While GBTC sell pressure could persist in the short-term, this is unlikely to be a long-term headwind to the market.Major cryptos are thus likely to recover and hit new highs later this year, with Bitcoin bulls eyeing $100,000.But in the meantime, impatient traders looking to turn faster profits will continue to enter the on-chain markets.On-chain markets refer to the market for digital assets that have been issued directly on top of an existing blockchain.For example, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.These tokens can then be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEX), and also perhaps on centralized exchanges if they get big enough.They are often referred to as meme coin (or shitcoin) markets and virtually anyone can issue a token at any time.As a result, these on-chain markets are replete with scams and pump-and-dump schemes.But shitcoin markets are the only place to find tokens that can rally in the 50-100x region.Here are a few of the top crypto gainers today on Solana that traders will be monitoring, as per DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayStop ($STOP)A just-launched anti-racism token called Stop ($STOP), which appears to be campaigning against racist tokens being launched on Solana, is up 130,000% in the past 24 hours, as per DEXScreener.The token’s market cap was last $2.2 million, with $120,000 in locked liquidity.It has also seen an impressive $9.5 million in trading volumes since its launch.But just because the token seems innocent and well-meaning, that doesn’t mean it isn’t a scam.Traders must always do their due diligence in the on-chain shitcoin markets. Most tokens are scams or pump-and-dump schemes.Doege ($DOEGE)A fun alternative version of Dogecoin called Doege ($DOEGE) is pumping on Solana on Friday.It was last up 35,600% in 24 hours as per DEXScreener.But its market cap remains modest at just $800,000, with $100,000 in locked liquidity.It seems to have decent community support though, with 563 “rocket” votes on DEXScreener versus 28 “shitcoin” and “40” red flag votes.Thicc ($THICC)A shitcoin called $THICC has pumped up 130% in 24 hours, reaching a market cap of $2.7 million.That’s according to DEXScreener, which puts the token’s 24-hour volumes at a massive $30 million.Moreover, over 10,000 unique wallets have traded the pair, an impressive feat.But investors should never ape into a coin purely because of impressive numbers. Always do your own research first.Crypto Alternatives to Consider
Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy.An innocent-looking project could easily turn out to be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower.A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is getting involved in crypto presales.The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price.These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing.While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales—unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision—savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more.With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market.Here are 14 of the presale projects with the highest potential.See the 14 Cryptocurrencies

Montenegro prosecutor objects to Do Kwon extradition

Montenegro’s Supreme State Prosecutor has challenged the High Court’s decision to deport Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs, to South Korea. The objection stems from a jurisdictional dispute, suggesting the court may have exceeded its powers. The Supreme State Prosecutor’s stance underscores a critical review of the extradition process, pointing towards a potential overreach in the High Court’s authority. This development adds a layer of complexity to Kwon’s ongoing legal battle following his arrest in March 2023 for allegedly using counterfeit documents.The controversy arises amidst efforts to hold Kwon accountable for the collapse of Terraform Labs in May 2022. The incident led to a staggering $40 billion loss in the crypto market, triggering a global outcry for justice. Kwon faces charges in both the United States and South Korea, with his extradition from Montenegro being a focal point of international legal proceedings. The Supreme State Prosecutor’s report highlights procedural errors in the extradition process, emphasizing the exclusive right of the Justice Minister to make such decisions.The Supreme State Prosecutor’s intervention questions the procedural integrity of the extradition decision. It suggests that the High Court acted beyond its legal bounds, sparking a debate over the appropriate jurisdiction for such a critical matter.The challenge to the High Court’s ruling highlights the delicate balance between judicial authority and the procedural norms governing extradition cases. This objection by Montenegro’s highest legal authority has put the spotlight on the extradition process’s adherence to legal protocols, especially in high-profile cases involving significant financial implications and international relations.Moreover, the international community closely watches the unfolding legal drama, given its implications for cross-border legal cooperation and the fight against financial crimes in the digital age. The case of Do Kwon and Terraform Labs has become a touchstone for regulatory and legal frameworks dealing with cryptocurrency markets. As Kwon awaits the resolution of his extradition case, the legal principles at stake go beyond individual accountability, touching upon broader issues of jurisdiction, international law, and the challenges of policing the digital frontier.The Supreme State Prosecutor‘s challenge to the High Court’s extradition ruling sets the stage for further legal scrutiny. It brings into question the division of powers within Montenegro’s legal system and the roles of different authorities in extradition cases.This development could potentially delay or complicate Kwon’s extradition to South Korea, adding another chapter to the already intricate legal proceedings. With Han Chang-joon, Kwon’s associate, already deported to South Korea, the contrast in the handling of the two cases underscores the legal complexities surrounding international extradition requests.As the legal community and international observers await further developments, the focus remains on the principles and procedures that govern such extradition cases. The involvement of the Supreme State Prosecutor not only highlights the challenges in executing international legal requests but also signifies the importance of due process and jurisdictional clarity.The case against Do Kwon continues to unravel, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of legal systems and the intricacies of international law. Montenegro’s response to this jurisdictional challenge will be closely monitored, as it could have far-reaching implications for extradition law and the international legal order.

UN adopts AI safety and security resolution sponsored by the US - Crypto Briefing




The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has adopted a global artificial intelligence (AI) resolution on March 21, aiming to promote “safe, secure, and trustworthy” AI development while ensuring it does not threaten human rights.The eight-page document, co-sponsored by over 120 countries, was adopted without a vote, representing unanimous support among all 193 UN member states. The resolution calls for member states and stakeholders to refrain from deploying AI in ways that are inconsistent with international human rights laws.The UNGA acknowledged the varying technological advancements across countries and called for efforts to bridge this development gap. The resolution also encourages governments to develop safeguards, practices, and standards for AI development, and it calls on specialized agencies and UN-related agencies to address issues surround the technology.
“Critically, the resolution makes clear that protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms must be central to the development and use of AI systems,” said U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in a statement.
The United States played a key role in the adoption of the resolution, serving as the primary sponsor after four months of negotiations with other countries. Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the importance of creating and strengthening international rules on AI and other technologies, calling the resolution a “historic step toward establishing clear international norms.”The UN’s global resolution follows other recent efforts to regulate the rapidly growing AI industry. The European Parliament voted in favor of an AI Act on March 13, which aims to set governance standards for the region. The European Commission also launched an inquiry into the use of AI by major online tech companies based on a separate Digital Services Act on March 14.Under the Biden administration, AI and other emerging technologies such as crypto have seen both support and scrutiny. In the US, President Joe Biden signed an executive order in October 2023 that addresses various safety and security issues related to development and use. The administration also went on to approve an inquiry into Bitcoin mining, citing its India also introduced requirements related to AI in March ahead of the country’s national elections.

HECO Chain exploiter anonymizes $145M of Ether on Tornado Cash in 8 days

A crypto wallet address linked to the HECO Chain exploiter transferred and anonymized nearly 40,392 Ether (ETH) on the crypto-mixing protocol Tornado Cash in eight days.According to crypto investigator PeckShield, the HECO Chain exploiter made 19 outbound transfers to Tornado Cash addresses in an attempt to make approximately $145.7 million worth of stolen Ether nearly impossible to trace.Source: PeckShieldThe majority of the funds were sent to a single Tornado Cash address, while one transaction of 0.2 ETH worth $699 was sent separately to a different address in Tornado Cash.In its largest transaction, the HECO Chain exploiter sent 11,300 ETH worth roughly $39.5 million in one transfer. Crypto hackers often resort to routing their loot through Tornado Cash to anonymize the ownership of the funds.

Solana to outpace Ethereum in consumer applications - Former head of growth

The Solana blockchain will overtake Ethereum in terms of consumer applications, Matty Taylor, the co-founder of Colosseum and former head of growth at the Solana Foundation, told Cointelegraph in an interview:“Solana will continue, as shown over the last year, to outpace Ethereum in terms of getting consumer applications and end-user experiences to the level of Web3 in terms of utilizing the chain’s performance to create fast and user-friendly applications.”There are currently 1,668 decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network, over three times more than the 477 in the Solana ecosystem, according to data from Alchemy. Solana has often been touted as a so-called Ethereum-killer for having superior transaction throughput and faster transaction finality than Ethereum.The downfall of FTX and the bear market that followed was a crucible moment for the Solana ecosystem, which acquired more and more developers despite the falling price of the Solana (SOL) token. According to Taylor:“Over the last three to four months as we came out of the bear market, everyone realized that Solana as a network had gone through an important crucible moment that most L1 ecosystems had gone through, [like] Mount Gox with Bitcoin…The 2020 bear market was that crucible moment, but Solana came out much stronger than ever and there's more developers building.”Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $49.7 billion, which is over 10 times bigger than Solana’s $4.01 billion TVL, according to DefiLlama data.Ethereum/Solana TVL Chart.

JPMorgan Analysts Warn: Bitcoin's Sharp Correction May Not Be Over | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a tumultuous week for cryptocurrency markets, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant correction, plummeting by over 15% before staging a rebound following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday. 







However, as an article by Will Canny for CoinDesk pointed out earlierntoday, JPMorgan (JPM) analysts caution that the sell-off may not be over, as market positioning still appears overbought, according to a research report released on Thursday.



The report, authored by a team led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, highlights the considerable optimism prevalent in the market regarding the prospect of prices rising significantly by the end of the year. A significant component of this optimism stems from the belief that Bitcoin demand via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will persist at the same pace, even as the supply of bitcoin diminishes following the upcoming halving event.



The bitcoin halving, a quadrennial occurrence where miners’ rewards are reduced by half, is expected to take place on 20 April 2024. This event has historically been associated with increased market anticipation and price volatility.







However, JPMorgan’s analysts point out that the pace of net inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs has slowed down considerably, with a significant outflow recorded in the past week. This development challenges the notion that the spot bitcoin ETF flow picture will be characterized by a sustained one-way net inflow.







The report suggests that as the halving event approaches, profit-taking is more likely to continue, particularly given the current positioning backdrop that still appears overbought, despite the correction witnessed in the past week.



The recent outflow from spot bitcoin ETFs raises concerns about the sustainability of the market’s optimism and the potential impact on bitcoin’s price trajectory. If the trend of slowing inflows and increased outflows persists, it could indicate a shift in investor sentiment and potentially lead to further price corrections.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Moreover, the overbought positioning mentioned in the report suggests that the market may be due for a more significant pullback, as investors look to lock in profits ahead of the halving event. This profit-taking behavior could exacerbate the downward pressure on bitcoin’s price in the short term.



For a more optimistic outlook, it is worth looking at what Anthony Pompliano is saying.



In a solo podcast episode, Pompliano, Founder of Pomp Investments, explored the intricacies of the potential Bitcoin supercycle. Pompliano emphasizes the significance of understanding Bitcoin’s historical cycles and the impact of halving events, which have historically preceded substantial price increases, showcasing the asset’s resilience and growth potential.



Pompliano acknowledges the unique aspects of the current Bitcoin cycle, such as deviations from past patterns and unprecedented drawdowns. However, he argues that these anomalies highlight Bitcoin’s underlying strength and adaptability, hinting at the possibility of an impending supercycle.



Pompliano challenges the notion of Bitcoin as merely a beneficiary of low-interest rates, asserting that its behavior aligns more with global liquidity trends. He explains how, despite efforts to tighten financial conditions, increased global liquidity has propelled Bitcoin’s price upward.



The transformative impact of spot Bitcoin ETFs on market accessibility and institutional adoption receives significant attention in Pompliano’s discourse. With over $60 billion in ETFs contributing to Bitcoin’s visibility and legitimacy, these financial instruments have played a crucial role in broadening the investor base.



Pompliano remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, acknowledging the market’s cyclic nature while believing in the asset’s potential for significant price appreciation. He encourages investors to educate themselves on Bitcoin’s foundational principles, market dynamics, and expert analyses to foster informed decision-making.

Ripple CEO challenges SEC over Ethereum security status

Ripple‘s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has publicly voiced his opinion on the ongoing legal efforts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to classify Ethereum (ETH) as a security. Taking to the X platform, Garlinghouse remarked on the SEC’s past legal challenges within the cryptocurrency sector, noting the commission’s historical difficulties. He referenced the SEC’s attempts to regulate the crypto industry, including its notable legal dispute with Ripple over XRP. Garlinghouse highlighted the SEC’s failure to win its case against XRP and questioned when the commission would acknowledge its potential defeat in trying to classify ETH similarly.The debate around Ethereum’s classification has intensified following Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal‘s public defense of ETH. Grewal’s comments, supporting the argument that Ethereum does not meet the criteria of security, have added weight to the discussion. This comes in the wake of the SEC’s unsuccessful bid to categorize XRP as a security, a decision finalized by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in July 2023.SEC expands oversight with crypto lawsuits surgeThe legal journey of XRP sheds light on the complex regulatory landscape facing cryptocurrencies in the U.S. In 2020, the SEC accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security. However, after a protracted legal battle, Judge Torres ruled that XRP itself is not a security. Furthermore, she found that many of Ripple’s transactions involving XRP did not constitute investment contracts. Despite this, Ripple faced a partial setback when the court concluded that its institutional sales violated U.S. laws. The ramifications of this violation are pending, with the SEC scheduled to file a brief on remedies.The SEC’s endeavors extend beyond Ripple, aiming to bring the broader U.S. crypto industry under its regulatory scope. The commission has initiated lawsuits against several exchanges and has labeled various cryptocurrencies as securities, such as SOL, MATIC, and ADA. Its latest move to categorize Ethereum as a security has surprised many, given previous statements by SEC officials indicating that Ethereum falls outside the commission’s regulatory domain.Ethereum ETF hopes dampened by SEC actionsThe potential classification of Ethereum as a security carries significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. In 2018, Bill Hinman, the former director of corporate finance at the SEC, stated that ETH was not considered a security. This stance facilitated the treatment of Ethereum as a commodity, with futures contracts listed on CFTC-registered exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). A reversal of this position could hinder the launch of a spot-based Ethereum ETF, a development eagerly anticipated by crypto enthusiasts.Expectations for an Ethereum ETF had been high, with predictions of approval by May 2024. However, the SEC’s recent actions have dampened hopes for a timely launch. The outcome of the SEC’s legal campaign against Ethereum remains uncertain, with potential consequences for regulatory approaches and the future of cryptocurrency investments in the U.S.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s statements reflect broader industry concerns about the SEC’s regulatory strategies. As the legal landscape continues to evolve, the crypto community watches closely, understanding that the outcome of these disputes could shape the regulatory and operational environment for years to come.

Bitcoin Investment Analysis with Kiyosaki and Schiff


                                Kiyosaki vs Schiff Towards Bitcoin and Self-Custody Importance                                In recent discussions about investment strategies, two well-known figures have offered contrasting perspectives on Bitcoin and how investors should approach it. Robert Kiyosaki, famous for his bestseller "Rich Dad Poor Dad," Book and Peter Schiff, a well-known advocate for gold, offer contrasting opinions highlighting the opportunities and challenges facing cryptocurrency investors.Kiyosaki on Bitcoin vs Schiff on Bitcoin ETFsRobert Kiyosaki, the author who brought us Rich Dad Poor Dad, is telling us to jump on the Bitcoin train while we can. He's basically saying, "If you've got the cash, grab as much Bitcoin as you can." Why? Well, he's looking at what's happening in China and around the world and seeing that now might not be the best time to put your money in traditional stuff like stocks and bonds. Instead, he's all about real assets like gold, silver, and especially Bitcoin.Simply, According to Kiyosaki, this is not the time to invest in traditional assets like stocks and bonds but rather to focus on tangible assets such as gold, silver, and the increasingly favored Bitcoin.On the other hand, Peter Schiff, an important gold advocate and economist, has raised concerns about the limitations of owning Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Schiff highlighted the issue of liquidity limitations during non-trading hours, emphasizing the frustration of being unable to trade during market crashes or significant price movements. Schiff's warnings also extended to the vulnerability of Bitcoin ETFs to risky trading behavior, which could worsen market volatility.To know why Bitcoin ETFs are Beneficial, read our coingabbar blog.The Importance of Self-CustodyBut here's where it gets interesting. People who love Bitcoin are saying, "Hey, why not just hold onto your own Bitcoin instead of going through an ETF?" It's like keeping your cash in your own pocket instead of depending on a bank. You have more control, especially when things get wild in the markets.Schiff's criticism of Bitcoin ETFs has sparked discussions about the importance of self-custody in the cryptocurrency space. Many Bitcoin supporters argue that owning Bitcoin directly, without depending on third-party custodians like ETFs, provides greater control and security.James Seyffart, an ETF analyst, acknowledges that liquidity challenges are not unique to Bitcoin ETFs but apply across various asset classes. This highlights a broader issue in the ETF market rather than a specific flaw with Bitcoin.Simon Dixon, CEO of Bank To The Future, emphasizes the convenience and control of self-custody, especially compared to traditional assets like physical gold. He suggests that owning Bitcoin directly is simpler and more accessible for investors.Bryce Clark, an entrepreneur, echoes Dixon's sentiments, advising investors to take charge of their crypto assets and avoid trusting intermediaries like ETFs.Dave Weisberger, a digital assets advocate, sees the shift towards digital assets as unavoidable, highlighting the benefits of 24/7 trading, quick settlements, and decentralized control.Key Takeaways for InvestorsThe advice from Kiyosaki and Schiff, along with the focus on self-custody by Bitcoin supporters, provides important lessons for investors.	Bitcoin as a Digital Gold - Kiyosaki's support of Bitcoin as a digital store of value highlights its growing acceptance among mainstream investors seeking alternatives to traditional assets.	Risks of Bitcoin ETFs - Schiff's view stresses the importance of understanding the risks associated with ETFs, particularly in volatile markets.	Self-Custody and Control - The call for self-custody resonates with investors looking to have direct control over their cryptocurrency holdings, emphasizing security and independence.	Navigating the Digital Economy - As the financial landscape evolves towards digital assets, investors are encouraged to stay informed, exercise caution, and explore options that align with their risk tolerance and investment goals.Overall – What You Need to KnowUltimately, what we can gather from these discussions is that it's crucial to make smart choices and stay on top of your cryptocurrency investments in today's digital world. Both Kiyosaki and Schiff may have different views, but they highlight the importance of being well-informed and taking an active approach to managing your investments.Looking at the bigger picture, these conversations show how investment strategies are constantly changing and becoming more diverse. Kiyosaki encourages us to grab opportunities in Bitcoin and other tangible assets, while Schiff reminds us that having control and self-custody over our investments is key in the digital asset world.Also read - PINK Memecoin Launched by Polkadot on Parachains

Worldcoin Implements Features Allowing Users to Custody Their Data Exclusively on Personal Devices - The Daily Hodl


								A privacy-focused altcoin that uses eye-scanning artificial intelligence (AI) technology is implementing a new custody feature that will allow users to store their data on personal devices.
In a new blog post, Worldcoin (WLD), created by OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, says that the change will increase Worldcoin’s utility in general and is a step toward “solidifying the project’s user-centric architecture.”










“Personal data custody, or Personal Custody, means that the information (images, metadata and derived data) generated at the orb and used to generate the iris code during World ID verification is held on your device. This approach gives you control over the flow of this data – not just deletion, but any future use prior to being deleted.”
According to Worldcoin, since the end result of the new feature is a package of encrypted data that resides on a user’s device, that same information will be deleted from the project’s orb.
“Since all data is encrypted by your public key, the end result of this process is a collection of encrypted data packages that reside exclusively on your device. 
Your information is always deleted from the orb once it has been sent to your device, and the use of double encryption within the end-to-end encryption envelope is a safeguard to protect the confidentiality and privacy of your data in the event your device is compromised.”
Earlier this month, Worldcoin was ordered by the government of Spain to stop collecting data after many users complained about privacy issues.
WLD is trading for $8.22 at time of writing, a 1.3% increase during the last 24 hours.

Short squeeze alert: 2 cryptocurrencies with pump potential next week


The cryptocurrency market has cooled down in the past few days after weeks of high volume and volatility. Despite that, open interest levels continue at yearly highs, fueling the threat of short squeezes in some cryptocurrencies.
A short squeeze happens when a significant amount of traders carrying short positions are forced out through liquidations when the underlying asset reaches a pre-determined price region. Essentially, the higher the market’s open interest in a cryptocurrency, the higher the chances of squeezing downwards or upwards.
Finbold gathered data from CoinGlass on March 22 and spotted two cryptocurrencies to watch for next week.


Short squeeze alert for Ethereum (ETH)
In particular, Ethereum (ETH) has seen an increase in short positions, which created significant liquidity pools to the upside.
The $3,700 zone has the larger amount of liquidations in the weekly time frame, making it a possible target. However, a short squeeze could drive ETH’s price to as high as $3,900 – a 15% pump from $3,380.

Notably, the derivative market open interest in Ethereum reached record levels on March 14 and continues to hold strong. As of writing, over $13 billion in contracts remain open for the second-largest cryptocurrency.

Potential pump for Chainlink (LINK) next week
In the meantime, Chainlink (LINK) also shows record volumes in futures, signaling potential volatility and liquidations are on the edge.

As for liquidations, a short squeeze could pump LINK to above $20 per token. This is where the largest liquidity pools lie for Chainlink and would reflect gains superior to 10% from current prices.

Nevertheless, these liquidation levels do not guarantee any further price action and traders can close their short positions before being liquidated.
As observed, opening leveraged short positions exposes traders to liquidations and incentivizes the market to go in the opposite direction of what most speculators are biased toward.

	                    The open-sourcing of Worldcoin Orb software invites scrutiny into the project's data privacy claims around its iris-scanning technology. 
Image by Andrew Throuvalas, Midjourney.
                        The Worldcoin Orb has open-sourced some of its eyeball-scanning machinery in a bid by founders to verify its claims to data privacy, according to a Friday blog post.Developers can now review the software components of the Worldcoin Orb on Github, where it has been made publicly available under a MIT/Apache 2.0 dual license.Understanding the Worldcoin Orb
The reveal adds to the organization’s pre-existing hardware and iris recognition repositories made available in January 2023 and December 2023 respectively.“Their public availability marks significant progress in making the Orb’s image processing transparent and its privacy claims verifiable,” the Worldcoin Foundation wrote.Worldcoin (WLD) is a crypto project designed to distribute digital tokens to every human being on the planet, creating the foundation for a universal basic income scheme.Doing so requires verifying “humanness” – that each user of the network is actually a one-of-a-kind person, and not artificial intelligence (AI) or a duplicate.Hence, the foundation is spreading a vast network of Worldcoin Orbs throughout the globe, where wanting network participants can peer into the orb, have their iris scanned, verify their identity, and receive tokens.Ensuring Data Privacy Through Open-Source
However, given the ominous nature of “orbs” and “eyeball scanning,” its founders – including Sam Altman – received massive criticism from the crypto community for what seemed like a massive privacy invasion/surveillance tool.According to the Foundation, privacy and security were top priorities in the Orb’s construction, “One privacy-critical step is sending individual data from the Orb to World App for a feature called ‘Personal Custody’. Individuals can use this self-custodied data, for example, for Face Authentication in World App,” they stated.The Foundation added that it may reduce the frequency in which users must visit the orb to re-verify their identity in the future.A white-box audit report by Trail of Bits found that the Orb collects no personally identifiable information from its users besides an Iris code. It also said that it collects no information from users’ devices that have the World App installed.“Further audits are underway and, combined with open sourcing, reflect the Foundation’s aim to maintain a continuously high level of transparency around privacy and security,” the Foundation stated.The WLD token has risen $3.45 to $8,16 over the past three months. In February, the foundation revealed that World App’s daily active user count has crossed 1 million.

Ethereum Insider Unveils Ethereum Founders’ Fraudulent ICOs - Coin Edition


							

Steven Nerayoff unveils the alleged “deceptive evolution” of the Ethereum blockchain.



The Ethereum advisor alleges that Ethereum founders are manipulating the crypto community with fraudulent ICOs.



Nerayoff adds that Ethereum would have been the base of crypto if his ICO proposal had been implemented.




Steven Nerayoff, a former advisor to the Ethereum blockchain, has recently raised his voice against the alleged “deceptive evolution” of Ethereum. In his latest X post, Nerayoff slammed Ethereum founders, claiming their “greed” as the sole reason for SEC’s recent probe into Ethereum and the ETHGate conspiracy theory.







Nerayoff, who has blamed Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and co-founder Joseph Lubin several times for the blockchain’s mischievous journey, once again attacked them. He asserted that Ethereum founders’ ultimate aim is to make the “revolutionary project” nothing more than a “deceptive database controlled by a few to manipulate many.” He added,




Ethereum is built on deceit and lies, and they think you’re all dumb enough to not be the wiser. Well, I am, and I am saying to all of you, don’t allow this to happen a day more. The Ethereum house of deceit must fall once & for all!




In a November post, Nerayoff hinted at a possible truth in the ETHGate theory, arguing that Buterin and Lubin had confidential dealings with the Securities and Securities Commission (SEC) to influence the regulator to frame favorable rules. In a subsequent post, Nerayoff accused Buterin and his team of defrauding the crypto community.









Nerayoff, in his recent revelations, unveiled the fraudulent Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) by Vitalik, which altered Nerayoff’s ICO proposal. He stated,




When I architected the ICO and implemented it with Ethereum, I did this to help them bring Ethereum to life. I saw the endless possibilities of positive change and none of the negatives that they had up their sleeves. My invention was to avoid legal and regulatory issues.




The Ethereum insider added that the blockchain would have been the “base of crypto” if his invention was followed. As per his post, Ethereum founders skipped some significant steps and replicated his ICO proposal, giving rise to fraudulent ICOs.

Solana the ‘Most Popular Blockchain Ecosystem’ in 2024 So Far, According to New CoinGecko Analysis - The Daily Hodl


								Ethereum’s (ETH) leading challenger is dominating global investor interest among blockchains examined by crypto data aggregator CoinGecko.
According to CoinGecko, smart contract platform Solana (SOL) is by far this year’s top blockchain based on an analysis of the web traffic shares of 58 blockchain ecosystems from January 1st to March 18, 2024.










“The Solana ecosystem has emerged as the most popular blockchain ecosystem so far this year, accounting for 49.3% of global crypto investor interest in chain-specific narratives.”
From trading at a low of $101.48 on January 1st, SOL peaked at $209.86 this month. The asset is currently changing hands for $178.77.
CoinGecko says SOL’s rally back to the 2021 highs and the strong performance of key ecosystem project tokens, such as the asset of oracle network Pyth Network (PYTH) and the memecoin dogwifhat (WIF) fuel Solana’s lead.
Ethereum ranks as the second most popular blockchain with 12.73% of investor interest share. The top smart contract platform is followed by crypto exchange Binance’s BNB Smart Chain ecosystem with 5.4%.
“Overall, the 20 most popular blockchain ecosystems represent a combined 97.4% of investor interest towards chain-specific narratives. The remaining 2.6% of interest is spread across another 38 blockchain ecosystems, including the Near Protocol ecosystem which narrowly missed the top 20 ranking.”

                        Cryptocurrencies are no longer on the fringe of finance, and some parents are exploring them as an investment to build their children’s future nest egg.A recent survey found that nearly half (45%) of US parents who own cryptocurrency are already investing it in their children’s future, with 40.6% more planning to join soon.CouponBirds surveyed 1,046 parents in the US between January and March this year, exploring their views on investing in crypto for their children.The top reason for these parents to buy crypto for their kids was the potential for future growth. However, education and currency debasement were also found to be significant motivations.A majority said they approach these investments on a “set it and forget it” basis, intending to leave it untouched until their children are ready to take control.Source: CouponBirdsDanny Baer, a wealth director at Bitcoin life insurer Meanwhile, suggested that instead of viewing Bitcoin as a quick way to make money, it’s wiser to consider it a long-term investment.He explained that from a historical perspective, each Bitcoin price dip has been higher than the previous cycle’s peak. This suggests the asset has been on a 15-year bull run.Long-Term Investment Opportunities
The long-term potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is a topic of debate. While some believe they could become mainstream, there’s no guarantee. However, due to the market’s volatility, experts generally recommend crypto as a long-term investment, ideally held for at least a decade.Identity.com executive director Phillip Shoemaker said the key to investing in Bitcoin is to make frequent, smaller purchases. You buy it, store it safely in a hardware wallet, and then hold onto it for the long term.“You do this with assets like Bitcoin, however, not the more speculative coins,” he told Cryptonews. “But this is one of those things that people should be doing. Gold is a good investment, but Bitcoin is dwarfing all this stuff. So, yes, I would recommend this.”Portfolio Diversification
Cryptocurrency’s rollercoaster price swings, potential security breaches, unclear regulations, and its relatively new existence create a challenging investment landscape.Kelly Ferraro, CEO at River North Communications, said that parents should carefully consider their own risk tolerance before investing. They should also ponder the investment’s long-term time horizon and how it would contribute to diversifying their child’s overall portfolio.For a smart approach, consider talking to a financial advisor and investing a manageable amount as part of a diversified portfolio.“Understanding the legal and tax implications of crypto investments in their region is vital,” she said.“Ultimately, the decision should align with the family’s financial goals, risk appetite, and commitment to ongoing education about the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.”Role of Scarcity in Bitcoin’s Value
Investors should consider Bitcoin’s finite supply, a key differentiator in today’s environment of seemingly limitless central bank money printing, as contributing to its value.Frank Corva, senior digital asset analyst at Finder, advocated for investing in Bitcoin on behalf of children, calling it an “excellent move.” He also predicted a massive price surge for Bitcoin, predicting it could hit $1m by 2030, thanks to its “perfect scarcity.”“Assets like ETH and SOL do not have a hard cap, which makes them a bit more questionable as long-term investments,” he said.Corva added that parents should consider their comfort level with self-custody. Unlike traditional investments, they will need to manage digital assets using a hardware wallet like Trezor. This requires technical knowledge and strong security practices.Negligible Consequences of Small Percentages
The future of cryptocurrency, like any investment, is difficult to predict with certainty. Years or decades from now, it’s unclear how the market will have evolved.Yet, diversifying your money across different assets can potentially improve returns. Limiting risk is equally important, according to Stephen Kates, principal financial analyst at RetireGuide.com.“There is little harm in small, low-single digit percentages within a given investment strategy,” he said. “Any parent who wants to gift or purchase Bitcoin for their children should consider that it should not make up the majority of any investment strategy.”Kates added that seasoned traders swear by position sizing and risk management. Mastering these skills is the ultimate weapon in your trading arsenal.

3 cryptocurrencies under $0.10 to buy next week


As the cryptocurrency market prepares to end the week with many of its assets trading in the red after a period of significant bullishness, some of the best investment opportunities for the week to come are still available at a low price threshold of under $0.10 per wholecoin.
Indeed, Finbold has analyzed the crypto sphere to arrive at the list of several digital assets that are currently changing hands at a price below ten cents apiece and which could represent some of the best purchase choices for crypto traders this week.
#1 Radix (XRD)
In particular, the first is Radix (XRD), the crypto asset of the layer-1 blockchain serving as an interconnected platform for developers of powerful decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which has recently announced the launch of Project Ignition designed to boost liquidity for major cryptos on its platform.



Indeed, Radix recently emerged with strong technical analysis (TA) growth signals that suggest a ‘strong buy,’ and the token is currently trading at the price of $0.0682, advancing 14.78% in the last week during which the majority of the market underperformed, and gaining 42.55% on its monthly chart.

#2 Izumi Finance (IZI)
Meanwhile, the crypto asset of the liquidity-as-a-service (LaaS) platform, Izumi Finance (IZI), is eyeing massive gains in the near future, as it has recently announced a partnership with Build On Bitcoin (BOB), the hybrid layer-2 network connecting Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) security and liquidity.

Bolstered by the strong positive sentiment around this partnership, as well as many others, IZI has increased by 11.97% in the past week, as well as adding up to the monthly advance of 33.99%, currently trading at $0.01933, as per the most recent chart information retrieved on March 22.

#2 Nervos Network (CKB)
Finally, Nervos Network (CKB), a Proof-of-Work (PoW) platform that allows developers to create dApps deployable on various blockchain systems, continues to work hard on developing its network, including by bringing more people on its team.

Thanks to its exceptionally positive indicators and price performance above the multiple moving averages (MA) in recent days, the CKB price has managed to grow by 10.16% in the last week and as much as 110.48% across the past month, reaching the price of $0.0211.

Conclusion
Overall, the above cryptocurrencies under $0.10 might, indeed present good opportunities for purchase this week. However, it is important to do one’s own detailed research and carefully weigh all the risks before investing a significant amount of money into any of them.

U.Today presents you with the top three news stories over the past day.Major Bitcoin ETF warning made by Samson MowThis week saw astonishing outflows from spot-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, with $742 million leaving the ETFs within three days. As suggested by experts, the primary cause for these outflows is yet another massive withdrawal of Bitcoin from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC); investors are exiting Grayscale as it charges significantly higher fees than its competitors on the ETF market. Among those who reacted to the outflow news was Samson Mow, CEO at Jan3 and "$1 billion per BTC" advocate. In his latest X post, Mow expressed his optimism regarding the future of Bitcoin and its price surge, writing that he believes in withdrawals eventually turning back into inflows. Thus, he advised the Bitcoin community to "plan accordingly."Litecoin (LTC) gets major core upgrade; Here's implicationAs recently shared by the Litecoin Foundation team on the X platform, Litecoin has undergone a core upgrade, bringing a number of significant improvements to the LTC network. Litecoin Core v0.21.3rc3, or Litecoin Core 0.21.3 release candidate, is a new minor version release, including new features, various bug fixes and important security updates. Among the noteworthy changes brought on by the core upgrade are major security enhancements that strengthen Litecoin's security measures against possible attacks and vulnerabilities. The latest release contains fixes for CVE-2023-33297, which allows an attacker to cause a remote bandwidth and CPU denial of service, an attack that has been exploited in the wild. The upgrade demonstrates Litecoin's dedication to improving its functionality and technology, marking a crucial milestone in the project's ongoing progress.Shiba Inu receives adoption boost with major new exchange's addition of BONEIn a recent X post, Gate, a major crypto exchange, revealed plans to boost the trading potential of BONE, Shiba Inu ecosystem's token.

US government asks for court approval to sell private jets tied to Sam Bankman-Fried

Prosecutors in the United States government’s case against Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried proposed a court order to sell two private aircraft before the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings against the former FTX CEO.In a March 22 filing with U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said the government sought to execute an interlocutory sale of two planes tied to FTX and SBF “to prevent their devaluation.” Prosecutors argued in October 2023 that the Bombardier Global and Embraer Legacy aircraft were subject to forfeiture due to their ties to Bankman-Fried’s criminal case.It’s unclear what price tag the government intends to use for the aircraft, which cost $15.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively, according to October 2023 court filings. Prosecutors said they intended to reimburse up to $1.8 million related to maintenance and upkeep and $183,000 for delivery of the Legacy, assuming the proceeds from the sale were sufficient.Source: Byron YorkAccording to Williams, prosecutors reached an agreement with FTX and related parties to have the Embraer Legacy delivered to a Florida airport where the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) can begin proceedings for a sale “in a timely fashion.” The USMS already has custody of the Bombardier Global following a February 2023 warrant.Related: FTX victims will ‘never’ be whole thanks to SBF’s ‘dumpster fire’ — John RayThe luxury jets are just a few of the assets tied to Bankman-Fried subject to forfeiture following his criminal conviction. A March filing listed assets including Robinhood stock, fiat currency in U.S. dollars, cryptocurrency in Binance and Binance.US accounts and political contributions SBF made during his time as FTX CEO. Bankman-Fried and his attorney, Marc Mukasey, did not object to the aircraft sale.  The former FTX was convicted of seven felony counts in November 2023 and is behind bars while awaiting a March 28 sentencing hearing. Prosecutors have recommended that SBF serve 40 to 50 years, while his attorneys have asked a judge to impose a 6.5-year sentence.Magazine: Can you trust crypto exchanges after the collapse of FTX?

Ethereum Dencun upgrade lowers transaction fees for L2s

A week on from the launch of Dencun, Ethereum’s latest update appears to be meeting expectations and, in some instances, surpassing them.Dencun launched on March 13 with the promise of ushering in a new era of faster and cheaper transactions. Ethereum has historically struggled to ratchet up the speed of its base layer in line with demand, so Dencun shifts focus by scaling with the aid of layer 2s.According to Brian Gallagher, co-founder of Partisia blockchain, the update is not a minute too soon as competition from rival blockchains threatens to erode Ethereum’s market dominance.“The timing for Ethereum to launch its Dencun update [couldn’t] wait any longer,” Gallagher told Cointelegraph. “It’s undeniable that Solana is growing its market share away from Ethereum, particularly in the new token launch, on-chain DEX [decentralized exchange] swaps and NFT [nonfungible token] arenas, where retail traders tend to hang out.”Gallagher added, “It is simply far too expensive to make on-chain transactions still on Ethereum, so alternatives like Solana are rising up to the occasion.”As Gallagher points out, the comparison of fees is not currently flattering for Ethereum. Typical fees on Ethereum are anything from $1–20. This starkly contrasts Solana, where fees are a fraction of a cent. As recently as March 5, fees on Ethereum soared above $30. Ethereum fees are a longstanding problemEthereum’s scaling issues are nothing new. The matter first grew acute when transaction fees rose from under $1 to the $5 mark in September 2020, then above $20 at the end of 2021 and through into 2022. On April 30, 2022, the average fee soared to an all-time high of $197. Previous upgrades to the Ethereum network have attempted to improve the speed and scalability of Ethereum’s base layer. The most significant of these was the Merge, which occurred on Sept. 15, 2022, and completed Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.The Merge may have made Ethereum more energy efficient, but if there were any small reductions to transaction fees, they weren’t to last. By March 2023, fees were beginning to creep upward once more.Recent: Bitcoin price retraces 30 days ahead of halving in historical patternDencun is different. Instead of attempting to make Ethereum’s base layer more scalable, Dencun focuses on improving interactions with layer 2s, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, making them cheaper. In theory, Dencun’s improvements should incentivize and encourage users to shift traffic from Ethereum’s layer 1, spreading the traffic to other networks.Source: Optimism/While Dencun is still in its infancy, the early feedback is encouraging. Dencun promised to drop fees on layer 2s by a factor of 10. Data from Dune Analytics shows it has succeeded in that aim and, in some cases, even surpassed it. According to L2 Fees, transaction costs on Optimism and Arbitrum are now below $0.01.Reasons to celebrate DencunWith Dencun delivering right out of the gate, there is a palpable sense of excitement among many within the Ethereum community.Nick Johnson, the founder and lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), is among those lauding the development. Johnson told Cointelegraph: “The Dencun upgrade ushers in a new era for Ethereum, in terms of economic sustainability. For so long, layer 2 developers have incurred costly transaction fees that have hindered accessibility to the network. The ENS developer team is looking forward to improved accessibility for Ethereum.”As for those layer 2s Johson referenced, the buzz from their camps has been noticeable.Arbitrum took to X to declare Dencun, “One of the biggest upgrades to support layer 2s in scaling Ethereum,” while Optimism said, “Today is going to be a good day.”Given that Dencun has already lowered transaction costs by more than 90%, the general mood of positivity appears justified.Source: ArbitrumMore to doDencun may have succeeded in its initial goals, but the market will determine what happens next. For Dencun to truly succeed, Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync Era, Loopring, Polygon and others will need to pry users away from the Ethereum base layer.Recent: Greens’ push to end German cryptocurrency tax exemption sparks debateThe early signs are encouraging here, too. Data from GrowThePie shows that transaction volume on Arbitrum has increased by 145% in the last seven days, while Optimism has increased by 144%. On-base transaction volume has increased by 203% over the same period.Gallagher says that with Dencun up and running, the focal point over the longer term “will be on DeFi [decentralized finance] and how this upgrade potentially increases speed and lowers cost. If it fails to lower costs significantly, then I believe market share will continue to grow on other chains that are faster and more affordable.”Given that Dencun is yet to be tested against everything the crypto market can throw at it, Gallagher’s note of caution is a reminder against complacency. But for the moment, Ethereum’s latest upgrade looks like a job well done.

Ripple CEO Predicts Setback For US SEC In Ethereum Case, Similar To XRP | Bitcoinist.com


								The legal battle between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ethereum (ETH) has transformed into an intriguing case within the entire cryptocurrency landscape, with several experts predicting possible outcomes regarding the dispute.
Ripple CEO Warns US SEC’s Inevitable Defeat Against Ethereum
As the battle wages on, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple Labs Brad Garlinghouse, has revealed his optimistic insights on the case, while sharing a daring prediction in favor of the Ethereum ecosystem. His positive insights came in light of reports that the SEC is attempting to classify Ethereum “as a security” through its legal dispute with the digital asset.

Brad Garlinghouse has predicted that the US regulatory watchdog is most likely to “lose its war against Ethereum” – the second largest cryptocurrency asset. According to Garlinghouse, the Commission’s several “attempts to include the cryptocurrency industry in legal battles have resulted in severe court losses” over time.
As a result, the agency is now “lagging behind its foreign counterparts” and “competing with other regulators” such as the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
The Ripple CEO then posed a question, “When would the SEC realize that it would not be able to continue fighting to categorize Ethereum as a security, as it did with XRP?”
It is noteworthy that Coinbase submitted self-certifications with the CFTC on March 7, which could pave the way for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC) futures Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), if the CTFC has no complaints against it.
Consequently, the SEC’s prospects of overturning the “Programmatic Sales of XRP” ruling might be impacted by the categorization of these aforementioned tokens as commodities by the CFTC. This could be one of the reasons why the SEC could be fighting the CFTC.
Ripple’s Partial Victories Against The SEC
Ripple first secured a partial win in its lawsuit with the agency when Judge Analisa Torres declared in July last year that programmatic sales of XRP do not meet the requirements of the third prong of the Howey Test. Also, three months later, the SEC’s request for an interlocutory appeal against the programmatic sales order was denied by the US Judge.

Due to the order, the SEC will be unable to file an appeal until the conclusion of the ongoing SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. It is believed that the resolution of this dispute may have a profound impact on the US regulatory landscape and the cryptocurrency landscape as a whole.
The long-running legal dispute between Ripple and the US SEC began in 2020 when the Commission accused Ripple of selling XRP to US investors as an unregistered security. However, the lengthy battle is slowly approaching its climax as the grand trial is scheduled to take place by April 23.

The Shiba Inu team lead, known by the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama, seems to be continuing with his travels around the globe. The SHIB community keeps watching his location tags changing on X/Twitter.The most recent one has raised a heated and rather humorous discussion among members of the SHIB community. Here’s where the mysterious Shytoshi Kusama has been spotted this time around.Kusama heads for the Maldives, here's potential reasonJapanese SHIB army member @kuro_9696_9696 has tweeted to spread the word about Shytoshi Kusama’s new location – the Maldives.On March 19, he was spotted in New York City thanks to X, and prior to that, in March, his location tags on Twitter included Japan, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico and several cities in the U.S. SHIB’s lead developer Kaal Dhairya has also been moving around – his location tag showed Dubai.Last year, one of Kusama’s location tags showed that he visited Niseko, Japan. At about the same time, he published a message in Discord saying that he was taking a chance to relax and enjoy himself “just like everyone else.” The SHIB community concluded that Shiba Inu lead and Ryoshi's partner in building SHIB was finally on vacation. Since the Maldives is also known as a popular resort destination, odds are that Shytoshi Kusama is also relaxing on the beach at the moment. In the comments thread, some users giggled at Kusama moving from one country to another so fast, saying things like: “I’m convinced Shy’s a pilot or he’s flying on Shiba airlines” and “Since Shytoshi is a Saiyan, he can fly at high speed.”SHIB burn rate plungesAccording to data shared by Shibburn, within the last 24 hours, the SHIB army has succeeded in disposing of a large SHIB amount: almost 10 million. This is much smaller than was burned on Thursday though. The overall burn rate has plunged by more than 70%.The two largest burn transactions on this list carried 4,111,000 and 4,000,000 SHIB to unspendable blockchain addresses.In the meantime, activity on layer-2 blockchain Shibarium, which allows the SHIB army to conduct their personal SHIB burns, has dropped significantly recently. At the time of this writing, this metric has reached a low of 48,730 transactions.

Bitcoin In 'Danger Zone' Ahead Of Halving: Trader Warns Of Potential Price Drop - Benzinga

Even as Bitcoin nose-dived nearly 4% on Friday slipping down to $64,000 levels, the decline comes amid warnings from a pseudonymous crypto trader, who has indicated that the largest digital currency has officially entered the “danger zone,” a period historically associated with pre-halving price retracements.According to Rekt Capital, “It's been two days since Bitcoin officially entered the ‘danger zone' where historical pre-halving retraces have begun.” With the halving event approximately 26 days away, Bitcoin has seen a significant pullback of nearly 18% since last week. The trader highlights the uncertainty surrounding whether the bottom of this retrace has been reached, but emphasizes the potential for further downside within this critical time window.Drawing parallels with past cycles, Rekt Capital notes, “In 2016, Bitcoin performed its pre-halving retrace approximately 28 days before the halving.”Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Coinbase UK CEO Pinpoints Bitcoin’s Rise, Calls Coin A Viable Alternative For Millions In Benzinga Interview“In 2024, Bitcoin performed its pre-halving retrace approximately 32 days before the halving,” the trader added. The analysis points out a pattern of initial strong reactions followed by further retracements, as observed in the 2016 cycle, suggesting that Bitcoin may need to maintain its current highs to avoid a repeat of past downturns.Looking ahead, Rekt Capital speculates on the timing of Bitcoin’s next bull market peak, stating, “Bitcoin tends to perform a bull market top 266-315 days after it breaks its old all-time high.” Given that Bitcoin broke its previous all-time highs last week, the analyst predicts the next peak could occur between late November 2024 and late January 2025. Extending this forecast further, adjustments for the duration beyond old all-time highs could push the bull market peak to mid-December 2024 or mid-February 2025.Read Next: Global Money Transfer Revolution?

Ethereum Surprise Shift: 420,000 ETH Lands on Exchanges

According to crypto analyst Ali, nearly 420,000 Ethereum (ETH) have been transferred to various crypto exchanges over the past three weeks. This steady shift of ETH, valued at approximately $1.47 billion, has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike.The influx of such a large volume of Ethereum to exchanges is noteworthy because it can imply a variety of strategies by holders. Typically, large-scale transfers to exchanges can suggest that investors are preparing to sell, potentially leading to a price drop. However, the ETH token shift remains a subject of speculation. The move could be a response to recent market recoveries, with investors looking to take profits. It may also be related to institutional investors or large holders, known as "whales," adjusting their portfolios in anticipation of future market movements.The total value of the ETH moved, around $1.47 billion, might be substantial enough to impact the market. Ethereum's price has been subject to volatility in recent weeks, and movements of this scale can contribute to price fluctuations.At the time of writing, ETH was down 4.75% in the last 24 hours to $3,345, mirroring general market declines and down 10.21% weekly. ETH remains significantly down from highs of $4,093 attained on March 12.ETH long-term investors remain steadfastAccording to a recent analysis provided by Lucas Outumuro, Head of Research at IntoTheBlock, the amount of ETH in wallets that have been holding for over a year continues to hit new highs.  Despite reports of the SEC attempting to reassess Ether's classification as a security and decreased odds of an ETF being approved, ETH's long-term investors appear not to be selling.Overall, ETH investors remain optimistic following the Dencun upgrade. This week saw the biggest amount of ETH exchanged on Mainnet since May 2022. ETH's daily average volume has been on an upward trend, similar to the early bull market in 2020-2021.In contrast to the last bull market, layer 2s (L2s) have dominated, with the total number of transactions on Base, Optimism and Arbitrum being more than double that of Mainnet. The number of ETH on L2s recently crossed 10 million for the first time, having doubled since last year.

Tether Adds $5.25B in Market Cap Liquidity: Is It a Good Thing? - DailyCoin


        
The surge in Tether’s market cap has pointed to a growing demand for stablecoins in the crypto space.



Stablecoins have provided stability in the volatile crypto market and have acted as a safe haven for investors.



The growth of Tether liquidity has outpaced Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting a deeper pool of stablecoin capital.
The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a surge in liquidity, fueled by a significant increase in the market capitalization of Tether (USDT), the leading stablecoin in the ecosystem. Since the beginning of March, Tether’s market cap has climbed by over $5.25 billion, indicating a growing demand for stablecoins within the crypto space.Tether Market Cap’s Upward TrendThis rise in stablecoin funding is a positive sign for overall market health. Stablecoins pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar provide stability within the often volatile cryptocurrency market. They act as a safe haven for investors seeking to enter or exit positions in other cryptocurrencies without converting back to fiat currency. This readily available pool of stablecoins helps meet the buying and selling demands of Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins. For context, the combined growth of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) this month falls short of the increase in USDT liquidity. Despite significant growth, these Bitcoin ETFs have only attracted less than $4 billion in net inflows. This highlights the deeper pool of stablecoin capital currently available, potentially fueling further accumulation of both Bitcoin and altcoins on cryptocurrency exchanges.Tether’s current market capitalization is $104 Billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This represents a steady rise from around $98.65 billion at the start of March, with a brief consolidation period masking the overall upward trend. Is Tether the Backbone of Crypto Trading?However, concerns continue to linger regarding Tether’s reserve backing. Despite these controversies, Tether has undeniably played a crucial role in establishing stability and facilitating large-volume trades within the crypto market. USDT’s dominance is evident, as it forms a trading pair with most altcoins across various cryptocurrency platforms.Looking beyond its role as a stablecoin issuer, Tether Holdings, the company behind USDT, is actively diversifying its operations. They are venturing into Bitcoin mining and development, with significant investments in the sector. On the Flipside
Tether has a history of facing criticism regarding the transparency of its reserves.



While stablecoins offer stability, a sudden surge in USDT issuance could theoretically impact overall market volatility.



If Tether faces issues or loses its peg to the dollar, it could have a cascading effect on the entire crypto market.
Why This MattersThis surge in Tether’s market cap, surpassing the combined growth of Bitcoin ETFs, suggests investors are increasingly comfortable using stablecoins for crypto purchases. This ample liquidity pool could fuel further growth in Bitcoin and altcoin prices, potentially leading to a significant bull run in the broader cryptocurrency market.To learn more about how Tether’s USDT on Celo drives mainstream crypto adoption, read here:How Tether’s USDT on Celo Drives Mainstream Crypto AdoptionTo learn more about Tether (USDT) reaching a market cap of $100 billion, read here:USDT Hits $100B Market Cap as Stablecoins Match Market Rally

Anonymous crypto wallets now illegal in the EU


In a recent regulatory development, cryptocurrency payments of any size using unidentified self-custody crypto wallets are now illegal in the European Union (EU). This decision is part of a set of new anti-money laundering laws (AML) in the continent.
The majority of the EU Parliament’s lead commission approved the prohibition on March 19, according to Patrick Breyer’s post.
Notably, Dr. Breyer is a member of the European Parliament for the Deutsch Piraten Partei and one of the two leaders who opposed this approval. Gunnar Beck was the other Parliament member who voted against it, representing the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

EU’s new AML: Cash and crypto payments made partially illegal
In particular, the new anti-money laundering law prohibits certain thresholds for cash payments and any anonymous crypto payment. On that note, any cash payment above €10,000 will become illegal, while also anonymous cash payments above €3,000.
The prohibition for payments made in cryptocurrencies will be specific to unidentified wallets operated by providers (hosted wallets). This includes any self-custody wallet provided by mobile, desktop, or browser applications.
Furthermore, the now-approved AML package will apply after three years from its entry into force, according to Dillon Eustace. However, the Ireland law firm expects these laws to become fully operational before the usual enforcement timeline. 
Patrick Breyer’s position on making anonymous cash and crypto payments illegal
Breyer is skeptical about the effectiveness of fighting crimes through these laws. Moreover, he highlighted how anonymous payments are a fundamental human right, needed to achieve individual financial freedom.

“Generally prohibiting anonymous payments would at best have minimal effects on crime, but it would deprive innocent citizens of their financial freedom. (…) We have a right to pay and donate online without our personal transactions being recorded.”
– Patrick Breyer

From another perspective, the Piraten Partei’s representative pointed out to the negative economic and social effects of prohibiting sovereign payments.

“This EU war on cash will have nasty repercussions! For thousands of years, societies around the world have lived with privacy-protecting cash. With the creeping abolition of cash, there is a threat of negative interest rates and the risk of banks cutting off the money supply at any time. Dependence on banks is increasing at an alarming rate. This kind of financial disenfranchisement must be stopped.”
– Patrick Breyer


What do EU citizens think about AML prohibiting cash and crypto payments?
Historically, European citizens have already shown resistance against cash payment prohibition of any kind. Patrick Breyer described a “great public outcry” in 2017 when the Commission consulted the public about limiting cash payments.

In his words, “More than 90% of responding citizens spoke out against such a step. Respondents considered paying anonymously in cash an “essential personal freedom” and that “Restrictions on payments in cash are ineffective in achieving the potential objectives (fight against criminal activities, terrorism, tax evasion).”

Additionally, the shadow economy expert Friedrich Schneider believes these measures would have “only minimal lowering effects on crime.”
Conclusion
In conclusion, the new anti-money laundering law will effectively prohibit cryptocurrency payments through self-custody wallets.
Essentially, most crypto networks operate in permissionless networks, where anyone can generate a cryptographic private key, gaining unlimited access to the system. This is one of the core value propositions of cryptocurrencies, as a more accessible, free, and fair approach to finances, which makes no distinction of any kind on its users. 
Experts and freedom advocates consider this recent approval a tough hit against financial freedom and fundamental human rights. On X (formerly Twitter), commentators talk about the resemblance to the dystopic society introduced by George Orwell in the best-seller “1984.”
European citizens and entrepreneurs now wonder if the EU Parliament will have the political strength needed to sustain this approval moving forward.

Silvergate to face lawsuit over alleged FTX exchange fraud

In a significant development within the cryptocurrency banking sector, Silvergate Bank is set to face a class-action lawsuit. This follows allegations from FTX users that the bank played a role in facilitating fraud at the exchange and its affiliate, Alameda Research. The lawsuit received a boost when, on March 20, a federal court in San Diego, under Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro, dismissed Silvergate’s motion for dismissal filed in June. The court found that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged Silvergate’s awareness of FTX’s fraudulent activities. Moreover, they argued the bank unjustly enriched itself at the expense of FTX users, a claim Silvergate vehemently denies.Judge Montenegro’s ruling emphasized that Silvergate’s Exchange Network, primarily designed to facilitate fund transfers to crypto exchanges, played a pivotal role in FTX operations. This network, the court noted, was instrumental in the functionality of crypto exchanges like FTX, making Silvergate’s involvement critical to the allegations. The judge highlighted that Silvergate processed transfers and accepted deposits, channeling FTX customer money to Alameda. This, according to the court, was a clear indication of Silvergate’s deep entanglement in the operations and alleged fraudulent activities of FTX and Alameda Research.Court’s findings and Silvergate’s defenseThe lawsuit against Silvergate outlines the bank’s integral role in the operational dynamics between FTX and its users. According to the court’s findings, Silvergate not only processed financial transactions but also accepted deposits that facilitated the alleged fraud. The court pointed out that FTX customers were initially directed to wire money to Alameda’s account due to FTX’s lack of a bank account, further implicating Silvergate in the alleged scheme. The judge underscored that Silvergate had a vested interest in continuing to service FTX and Alameda, given its business model’s reliance on the adoption of the FTX exchange platform and app.In response to the allegations, Silvergate had argued that it did not owe a duty of care to FTX customers, suggesting that its actions were not a substantial factor in the customers’ financial losses. The bank posited that any refusal to process FTX’s transfers would not have prevented the exchange from finding alternative banking services, a claim the judge deemed speculative. This defense was part of Silvergate’s unsuccessful attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, which the court found lacked sufficient merit to warrant dismissal at this stage.Silvergate faces scrutiny after FTX bankruptcyThe lawsuit against Silvergate emerged against the backdrop of the bank’s collapse in March 2023, which occurred approximately five months after FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. The legal battle underscores the intricate relationships and dependencies within the cryptocurrency banking sector. It also highlights the potential for financial institutions to face legal scrutiny for their roles in facilitating or enabling the operations of crypto exchanges, especially those later found to be involved in fraudulent activities.This case gains further significance with the conviction of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried in November on charges of fraud and money laundering. With his sentencing scheduled for March 28, the lawsuit against Silvergate adds another layer to the complex narrative of legal and financial fallout following FTX’s collapse. As the legal proceedings against Silvergate proceed, the case is set to offer critical insights into the responsibilities and liabilities of banks in the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry.

Insights from RWA Report 2024 Showcase USD Hegemony in Crypto - Coin Edition


							

Tether (USDT) holds a 71.4% market share, followed by USDC and Dai.



Non-USD stablecoins constitute only 1% of the market.



Market cap surged from $5.2B in 2020 to $150.1B in 2022, with gradual growth since.




In a recent revelation from the Real World Asset Report of 2024, the crypto market witnesses a significant dominance of USD-pegged stablecoins staying at the forefront of real-world asset (RWA) adoption within the digital economy.



The report’s key findings suggest that majority of the RWA market is currently occupied by stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. Topping the charts are Tether (USDT), boasting a staggering $96.1 billion market capitalization, closely trailed by USDC with $26.8 billion, and Dai at $4.9 billion. 



Notably, Tether maintains a commanding 71.4% market share keeping up its position within the space. USDC still struggles to reclaim its lost ground following a brief de-pegging incident during the US banking crisis of March 2023.



Diving deeper into the landscape, the report unveils a stark reality of minimal diversification beyond the USD-pegged stablecoins. Alternative fiat-backed stablecoins, such as Euro Tether (EURT), CNH Tether (CNHT), Mexican Peso Tether (MXNT), EURC (EURC), Stasis Euro (EURS), and BiLira (TRYB), collectively constitute a mere 1% of the market share. 









Furthermore, the report sheds light on the trajectory of stable asset market capitalization over the years. From a modest $5.2 billion at the outset of 2020 the stablecoin market rose to an unexpected $150.1 billion peak in March 2022, however, then declining amidst market fluctuations. 



The year 2024 marks a resurgence of the stablecoin witnessing a 4.9% growth in market cap from $128.2 billion at the inception of the year to $134.6 billion as of February 1.

5 Technologies That Could Be Worth $220 Trillion By 2030, Cathie Wood's ARK Predicts: 'The Time Is Now' - ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS:ARKG) - Benzinga

ARK Investment Management LLC predicts that five disruptive technologies could reach a total market value of $220 trillion by 2030. According to the latest white paper, “Platforms Of Innovation – How Converging Technologies Should Propel A Step Change In Economic Growth,” the Cathie Wood-led investment company explores the ascendance of five critical technologies: Artificial Intelligence, Energy Storage, Robotics, Multiomics, and Public Blockchains.These innovations are not merely advancing in isolation. Instead, they are converging, setting the stage for an explosive increase in productivity and economic development.“Our technological forecasts suggest that the time is now — that a new era of accelerating macroeconomic growth will begin this decade,” says ARK chief futurist Brett Winton, who authored the report. Five Catalysts Of Economic Transformation
Artificial Intelligence (AI): Now seamlessly integrated into various sectors, AI is set to turbocharge productivity worldwide. The growth in the AI industry is captured by ARK’s flagship fund, ARK Innovation ETF ARKK. 



Energy Storage: Innovations have leveled the playing field for electric vehicles, making them as economical as traditional gas-powered cars.



Robotics: The proliferation of technologies from reusable rockets to autonomous delivery bots marks a new era in automation. This market is monitored through the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF ARKQ 



Multiomics: Advancements in this field are revealing new dimensions of life and health, promising breakthroughs in biology and medicine. These innovations are tracked by the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF ARKG 



Public Blockchains: Led by the widespread adoption of Bitcoin BTC/USD, blockchain technology challenges the conventional financial order, poised to redefine finance. 
Winton’s analysis predicts that the convergence of these technological platforms will catalyze a step change in market value and economic growth. By 2030, the market value of these disruptive innovations could soar to an estimated $220 trillion, up from the current $19 trillion, marking an average annual growth rate of 42%.Projected Annual Growth Rates (2023-2030)
AI: 37%



Energy Storage: 50%



Public Blockchains: 48%



Robotics: 78%



Multiomic Sequencing: 39%
Drawing parallels with Tesla‘s ascent to a $600 billion market cap, the white paper highlights the potential of innovative companies. Currently, only a small fraction of S&P 500 companies (less than 2%), representing more than 35% of its market cap, exceed this valuation. Looking ahead, ARK Investment expects these technological advancements to push real GDP to $170 trillion by 2030 and further to $470 trillion by 2040.Cryptocurrency: Beyond A Digital AssetThe white paper also sheds light on cryptocurrencies as potential stabilizers for renewable energy grids. According to Winton, bitcoin mining should foster “the economic installation of large-scale renewable energy and battery systems, which, in a virtuous cycle, should increase the security of the Bitcoin blockchain.”By 2030, the valuation tied to Public Blockchain innovations is expected to reach around $40 trillion.“Cryptocurrencies—and, to a lesser extent, smart contract protocols—are likely to compete with fiat currencies,” ARK stated.

                        Max Howell, the founder of the decentralized technology protocol tea Protocol, sat down for a chat with Cryptonews’ Matt Zahab, to discuss his highly popular Homebrew system, as well as the much-anticipated tea Protocol.He talked about the massive importance of properly compensating developers to create and maintain open-source software so they can work on it full-time, and how tea aims to help that goal.The famous developer also touched upon commercial open-source, the impossible attempt to merge open-source and capitalism, and what open-source is in its essence.In this episode, Howell discussed:
compensating developers to create open-source software;
90% of all publicly traded companies utilizing open-source software across their business units;
relationship between open-source software and capitalism;
the emergence of commercial open-source;
open-source vs. closed-source AI.
VIDEOYou can watch the full podcast episode above or read what Howell told Matt below.The First Big Success
Howell achieved quite a feat early in life.He told Cryptonews that in the mid-2000s, online music service Last.fm offered him a job.It was while he was there that he wrote Homebrew in 2009, a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on macOS and Linux. Tens of millions of developers around the world use it.At Last.fm, the team was using Mac. But at that time, the state of the developer tooling was lacking.“I came from a Linux background where I was used to all these awesome package managers that had amazing feature sets and worked really well,” Howell said.So, after complaining about it at the pub after work, he decided to “do something about it.”Three months later, he open-sourced his product on GitHub. Interestingly, nobody noticed it for a while, so he started “doing some self-evangelism.”“One day, I woke up and found that I had a bunch of people interacting with my code,” Howell said.Homebrew has become “a massive success” and quickly. But this created a different career problem. The then 26-year-old Howell thought that everything should move like Homebrew did or he should give it up.When Homebrew became “extremely popular,” the developer was able to leave his job and work on the product full-time.This eventually led him to create tea Protocol, a decentralized technology protocol that enables open source developers to be rewarded for their software contributions.Open-Source Software and Capitalism
It’s been 15 years since Howell created Homebrew. For most of his career, he’d take up jobs to earn and save money so he could quit and work on open source.He stated tgat “there’s something really wonderful about working on open source. And there’s nothing else that compares in the corporate world.”However, the major problem with it is that there’s no way to work on it full-time in a capitalist society.And while Howell has no issue with capitalism per se, “it really doesn’t map onto open source at all.”There are people doing “commercial open source” nowadays, but it’s not really open source per some of the usual metrics. The main purpose of open source is to solve a problem that is very specific and often unrelated to revenue models.Therefore, people have tried to come up with solutions so that some of the open source developers and maintainers can work on it full-time.Notably, not many realize how important this is. People need to be paid for maintaining such widely used systems.“People building in Web2 realized that open source was the way to bootstrap entire businesses,” Max Howell said, adding:“You could build 95% of your product using freely available open source solutions that are performing and well-maintained and perfectly solved the niche they were trying to solve. Then do 5% of your code as the proprietary bit on the top and make fortunes.”Furthermore, some 70% of enterprise software is built on top of open source, he said.And this is not an issue on its own. The open-source tools are there to be used. But the fact remains that somebody still needs to properly maintain the solutions on which 95% of products are based.There is Money, But Very Little Goes to Developers
Open source is everywhere now. It’s “been to Mars, it’s on the bottom of the ocean, it’s in every computer, every phone,” Howell said.There is “a lot of money” in the software and the internet realms, “but very little of it has ended up trickling back to these people that are maintaining these core pieces of infrastructure.”And you regularly hear about people burning out and rage quitting, he added.“What’s happened as a result of trying to shove capitalism on to open source is you’ve ended up with people treating it like a charity, where the only thing they can expect is the goodness of people’s hearts to throw them five bucks so they can buy a coffee,” said Howell.Developers earning from donations, Patreon, or GitHub sponsors do not receive much either. Upon speaking to many prominent developers, Howell found that the top-earning person makes $24,000 a year. And this man worked on very popular packages.A couple of years ago, Howell was looking once again for something fresh in the space in terms of working on open source full-time. He wasn’t able to find anything that would ensure that.“So in a moment of inspiration, I realized that maybe the person who was going to solve the problem had to be me.”He started exploring technologies he hadn’t looked at before and realized that there was an opportunity with blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies.These could be tools to create something new open source that doesn’t fit onto a standard capitalist model.While commercial open source introduces agendas in order to find a revenue model, Howell aimed to build a system that “recognized what is open source, why it works, and then didn’t change anything about that.”The only thing the system needed to do is fix the problem of providing sufficient rewards.Max Howell approached some crypto venture capitalists in 2022 and subsequently raised 17 million for tea Protocol, with Binance Labs as the lead investor.10.5 Million Projects Over Multiple Decades Ranked
Tea Protocol revealed its Incentivized Testnet on February 21. It plans to launch the mainnet on June 12.Commenting on how and which developers get incentivized on tea, Howell explained that there is a system called Proof of Contribution.It’s a novel consensus mechanism designed to quantify the impact of all projects across all open-source ecosystems.An oracle ranks all 10.5 million projects created over the past 20-30 years and assigns them a teaRank between zero and a hundred. “Everything above a teaRank of 25 is going to get automatic rewards if they onboard to our system,” Howell said.In the three weeks since the testnet launch (between the launch date and the podcast recording), tea saw more than 5,000 open-source projects onboard. And the onboarding process is intentionally made simple.Max Howell told the viewers that “we’ve had over half a million people sign up at this point. And as a result, we have over half a million wallets created on the tea Protocol, and so far, 89% of them are active on the protocol as well.”The goal is to enable developers to work on open source projects more, and if possible even full-time.When it comes to tokenomics, the gas fees are paid with TEA tokens. Paymasters facilitates that.There is also staking, allowing people to “find a project that you think is interesting, […] put some token down, and then earn rewards off of the project.”Therefore, the project is shifting the view of open source from charity to “an incredibly valuable ecosystem that props up the whole internet.”Incentivizing Open Source Security
Another relevant aspect, the developer said, is that until now the incentives for open source to keep their technologies secure just weren’t quite there.What tea is doing is incentivizing whitehats to report any security vulnerabilities they find in a confidential manner via the smart contracts available on the protocols.If that vulnerability is legitimate, the project must fix it within a certain amount of time. Otherwise, they risk a slashing event where people staking against that project are also slashed.Notably, many projects are severely underfunded.

Analysts Rise Bitcoin Price Target Amid Tech Breakthroughs


Analysts have notably increased their price target for Bitcoin (BTC), citing a surge in technological innovations as a pivotal catalyst. 
As Bitcoin establishes new benchmarks, the financial ecosystem attentively observes the transformative impact of Layer 2 (L2) solutions on the cryptocurrency’s scalability, security, and decentralization.
Tech Advancements Will Push Bitcoin Price
Muneeb Ali, the CEO of Trust Machines, has played a crucial role in advocating for Bitcoin’s L2 technologies. He is confident that Bitcoin’s scalability challenges are on the cusp of a revolutionary breakthrough thanks to these L2 solutions. 
This development aims to enhance Bitcoin’s transactional efficiency. It also represents a strategic move to ensure Bitcoin remains at the forefront of the competitive blockchain industry.

“L2s move fast. Bitcoin is not going to change much. L2s are innovative and open to making rapid changes. After a while it becomes part of their culture. These days, I’m seeing “XYZ ecosystem” have a cadence of one major upgrade every six months: That would be very healthy for Bitcoin,” Ali said. 

Furthermore, the introduction of the Ordinals protocol, the emergence of BRC-20 tokens, and the sophistication of smart contracts through BitVM, have significantly contributed to the revitalization of Bitcoin’s free economy. This shift from a store of value to a viable ecosystem reflects a broader acceptance and use in daily transactions.
Elastos’ announcement of the BTC Oracle also marks another milestone in Bitcoin’s technological evolution. This initiative aims to enhance cross-chain operability, allowing Bitcoin to be used across various blockchains. The BTC Oracle and BeL2 are expanding Bitcoin’s utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) and beyond, emphasizing decentralization and privacy.


“By empowering every EVM compatible blockchain to use smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, the industry can unlock incredible innovative and economic potential for the crypto ecosystem via staking ELA and getting Bitcoin rewards,” Jonathan Hargreaves, Global Head of Business Development & ESG at Elastos, added. 

The synergy between these technological advancements and the market’s response has been overwhelmingly positive. In fact, analysts from Bernstein have raised their year-end price target for Bitcoin to $90,000. The decision came from the entry of a new bull run, robust Bitcoin ETF inflows, and aggressive expansion by miners. 
Indeed, this revised forecast reflects the optimism stemming from the technological leapfrogs in Bitcoin’s infrastructure and signals confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value and utility.

“With a new Bitcoin bull cycle, strong ETF inflows, aggressive miner capacity expansion, and all-time high miner dollar revenues, we continue to find Bitcoin miners compelling buys for equity investors seeking exposure to the crypto cycle,” analysts at Bernstein wrote.

                        The Floki price has dived by 7.5% today, sinking to $0.0002272 as the wider crypto market slips by 2% in the past 24 hours.Today’s loss means that FLOKI is also down by 10% in the past week, although it’s a sign of how strong the coin has been that it holds onto a 23% gain in a fortnight and a whopping 600%.Such performance suggests that the meme coin remains in the middle of a growth phase, ready to pick up from where it left off once the current correction has ended.Floki Price Prediction as FLOKI Drops 7.5% – What’s Going On?
FLOKI’s chart is consistent with pretty much every other major token in the market today, with its indicators continuing to show a loss of momentum.Its RSI (purple) has declined from nearly 70 yesterday to 50 as of writing, with its direction pointing to further selling pressure.Source: TradingViewLikewise, its 30-day moving average (yellow) has flatlined after rising a little this morning, with FLOKI’s price bouncing down from its resistance level (red).If there’s one thing that’s encouraging it’s that the meme token’s trading volume remains elevated at around $750 million, up from a very lowly $30 million less than a month ago.This shows how far FLOKI has come in the past couple of weeks, and with liquidity staying high it could easily rebound in the very near future.At the moment, it seems that many whales have been selling, although the start of this month did see some larger withdrawals from exchanges.In other words, FLOKI is still a popular token among traders, and should push back up quickly as the market regains some impetus.This could happen sooner than some bears may think, with the market preparing for the next Bitcoin halving, while also looking forward to the possibility of Ethereum ETF approvals.Such factors could help precipitate a bull market in the next few months, with FLOKI benefitting more than other alts due to its status as a volatile meme token.In terms of fundamentals, there’s also the upcoming Floki 2024 roadmap release, which is actually happening today.This release could help prompt another little rally for FLOKI, although it’s possible that its spike earlier this morning is the only response will see to the roadmap today.Regardless, the Floki price should reach $0.00030 by the end of spring.Alternative Meme Tokens for Big tallies
FLOKI will continue to rise and fall throughout this year, and while it continues to show potential, it may not be the best meme token in 2024 for huge gains.Such gains may come from newer tokens that could rise as they list on exchanges, with new ERC-20 token Dogecoin20 (DOGE20) being one of the most promising new meme coins around.Promising to deliver a bullish update on the Dogecoin formula, its presale has already raised more than $5 million.Given that the sale has been running for just over week, this figure is impressive, with investors attracted by DOGE20’s fundamentals.It aims to offer a stronger version of Dogecoin’s ‘Do Only Good Everyday’ ethos, with the token set to provide regular support to charitable causes and community projects.In addition, its use of the proof-of-stake Ethereum blockchain also makes it much more environmentally friendly than the original Dogecoin, which remains a more energy-intensive proof-of-work blockchain.It also boasts superior tokenomics, featuring a hard cap of 140 billion tokens, in contrast to the infinitely inflationary supplies of many established meme coins.This capped supply seems all the more bullish in light of DOGE20’s staking system, which will provide higher rewards to holders who stake earlier and for longer.VIDEOAll of these features arguably make Dogecoin20 more promising as an investment vehicle than many of its rivals, with investors able to join its sale at the official Dogecoin20 website.They can buy DOGE20 at $0.000206 per token, with the price rising by $0.000002 with each successive stage of the sale.Once the sale ends, DOGE20 will list on Uniswap and then on other trading platforms, where it could rally big.Buy Dogecoin20 Now

VeChain Declares Meatless and EcoNex Winners in Hackathon


							

VeChain has announced Meatless and EcoNex winners of its recent hackathon at the University of Cambridge.



The hackathon awarded winners a portion of $30,000 and an opportunity to access additional funding.



Meatless and EcoNex additions to the VeChain ecosystem could boost VET’s value.




VeChain, an enterprise-grade L1 public blockchain, has announced Meatless and EcoNex winners of its recent hackathon hosted at the University of Cambridge. VeChain hosted the hackathon in partnership with Web3 educational mobile app EasyA and with participation from Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a global consulting firm.



The hackathon aimed to encourage the development of the VeBetterDAO, a VeChain-powered sustainable ecosystem for incentivizing enterprises and individuals with the B3TR incentive token for positive impact.









The hackathon awarded winners a portion of $30,000 in prize money and an opportunity to access additional funding. The panel of judges determining the winners of the exercise include Dr. Bernhard Kronfellner, Partner and co-lead of the digital asset and blockchain group at Boston Consulting Group, and Mark Miller, CEO & Co-Founder of Manta Ray EV. They assessed the participants on their ability to address the developer tracks outlined for the hackathon, namely, X-2-Earn sustainability applications leveraging the B3TR token.



As a winner in the hackathon, Meatless incentivizes people to make sustainable food choices by rewarding them with B3TR. Doing so allows the application to combat unsustainable food production at no cost to food manufacturers. The project achieves this by indirectly subsidizing their products while enabling sponsors to have an attributable direct impact. 



On its part, EcoNex rewards users with the B3TR token as an incentive for opting for eco-friendly commuting options. The application aims to combat the effects of urban congestion, including higher commute times, loss of productivity, excessive fuel consumption, and a significant carbon footprint.



Crypto community members consider Meatless and EcoNex significant additions to the VeChain ecosystem. Their impact on VET, the VeChain ecosystem’s native token, remains to be seen and would depend on the projects’ development and adoption.

Cyber Heist of Over $145 Million in Ether Laundered Following Heco Bridge Exploit | Cryptopolitan

In a dramatic unfolding of events that underscores the persistent vulnerabilities within the cryptocurrency sector, hackers behind the 2023 Heco Bridge exploit have successfully laundered an astonishing $145.7 million in ether. The operation, conducted over a mere eight-day period through the cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash, highlights the sophisticated strategies employed by cybercriminals to evade detection and the ongoing battle against illicit financial flows in the digital asset space.The initial breach: A blow to blockchain securityThe saga began with a significant security breach of the Heco Bridge, a crucial conduit for transferring funds between the Ethereum blockchain and the Heco Chain, managed by the HTX Exchange (formerly known as Huobi). In November 2023, attackers orchestrated a heist that siphoned off approximately $111 million in various cryptocurrencies, including ether, USDT, USDC, and HBTC. The swift movement of these stolen assets across decentralized exchanges for conversion into other cryptocurrencies was a calculated attempt to muddy the waters and obscure the origins of the illicit funds.The exploit not only exposed the vulnerabilities inherent in cross-chain bridges but also set the stage for a complex laundering operation that would further challenge the cryptocurrency industry’s security measures and anti-money laundering protocols.A sophisticated laundering scheme unveiledThe revelation of the laundering operation came to light through the diligent analysis of on-chain data by PeckShield, a blockchain security and data analytics firm. According to their findings, the perpetrators transferred roughly 40,391.8 ETH (equivalent to about $145.7 million) to Tornado Cash, a platform known for its ability to anonymize the trail of cryptocurrency transactions. The move was executed within an alarmingly short span of eight days, showcasing the exploiters’ proficiency in utilizing privacy-enhancing technologies to conceal their tracks.Tornado Cash’s role in the scheme has once again sparked debate over the ethical and legal implications of cryptocurrency mixers, which, while designed to protect user privacy, can also serve as tools for laundering the proceeds of crime. The incident arrives amidst heightened scrutiny of Tornado Cash, whose developer, Alexey Pertsev, faces serious allegations of facilitating the laundering of $1.2 billion in illegal funds.The Ripple effects: Additional exploits and legal entanglementsThe aftermath of the Heco Bridge hack revealed further complications, including suspicious transfers amounting to $23.4 million that bore the hallmarks of the initial exploit. These findings suggested an additional breach of HTX itself, prompting the platform to undertake measures to secure assets and reassure its user base. HTX advisor Justin Sun’s confirmation of the attack and the promise of full compensation for affected users underscored the severity of the situation and the platform’s commitment to rectifying the fallout.Moreover, the legal challenges facing Tornado Cash and its developer, Pertsev, highlight the complex interplay between innovation, privacy, and regulatory compliance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Pertsev’s upcoming trial in the Netherlands for charges related to money laundering and financial crimes emphasizes the growing legal scrutiny of technologies that, while innovative, may inadvertently facilitate illicit activities.ConclusionThe laundering of over $145 million in ether following the Heco Bridge exploit serves as a stark reminder of the sophisticated threats facing the cryptocurrency industry. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, so too do the strategies employed by cybercriminals, necessitating a proactive and comprehensive approach to security and regulatory oversight.

Based on on-chain data, a Bitcoin whale that has been accumulating on Bitcoin's dip has made a significant purchase, acquiring 673 BTC.According to Lookonchain, a Bitcoin whale withdrew 673 BTC worth $45.2 million from Binance in recent hours. Withdrawals from exchanges might indicate a desire to buy, while deposits indicate an intent to sell.The said BTC whale, according to Lookonchain, has consistently bought Bitcoin on the dip. On March 21, Lookonchain reported that the whale had accumulated 4,451 BTC worth $294.6 million from Binance at an average price of $66,195. Bitcoin has been extremely volatile since reaching an all-time high of $73,797 last week. Bitcoin has fallen about 13% from its recent all-time high as demand for fledgling spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds cools, with the worst three-day outflow since the products debuted on Jan. 11.Bitcoin began to recover late Wednesday, boosted by policy decisions made at the most recent U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. The U.S. central bank kept interest rates unchanged and hinted at further rate cuts this year.Bitcoin recovered above $68,000 on Thursday, but bulls were unable to extend the rally, with BTC reaching lows of $64,525.At the time of writing, BTC was extending its declines, down 3.48% in the last 24 hours to $64,796 after hitting intraday lows of $64,529.Eyes peeled for BTC price recoveryIn the days ahead, eyes are peeled for a recovery of the BTC price after testing key support levels. Bitcoin might consolidate and then form a base for a potential upward move. In this scenario, key resistance levels will be closely monitored, with a breakout likely to trigger further buying interest and propel Bitcoin toward higher price targets.In the event of a rebound, the first indicator of strength would be a move above $65,270. If this occurs, BTC may reach $69,000, the final obstacle before challenging its current all-time high of $73,797.A rebound from the current level might face selling pressure at $65,270. In the case of further selling, BTC may fall to the 50-day SMA ($57,614), where bulls are expected to buy aggressively.

Ripple CEO States SEC Will Lose Against ETH, Just Like with XRP - DailyCoin


        
Ripple’s CEO and Coinbase’s CLO have criticized the SEC’s aggressive stance towards Ethereum.



The SEC has been looking to classify Ethereum as a security, a move that would tighten regulations.



There has been a disagreement between the SEC and other regulatory bodies like the CFTC on handling crypto.
The relationship between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the cryptocurrency industry has come under renewed scrutiny following comments from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Industry Leaders Back EthereumGarlinghouse took to social media platform X to express his belief that the SEC is likely to lose its ongoing legal battle against Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. This statement comes amidst reports of the SEC’s increasingly aggressive stance towards Ethereum. The regulatory body has reportedly launched an effort to classify Ethereum as a security, a move that would subject it to stricter regulations. The Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit organization overseeing Ethereum’s development, is also facing scrutiny from the SEC.However, Garlinghouse isn’t the only critic of the SEC’s approach. Industry leaders like Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, have spoken out against the misinformation surrounding Ethereum’s classification as a security. Grewal emphasizes Ethereum’s vital role within the crypto economy and highlights the inconsistencies in the SEC’s proposed regulations. Adding another layer of complexity, the SEC appears to be clashing with other regulatory bodies, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This creates confusion and uncertainty within the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Additionally, recent letters from U.S. senators urging the SEC to limit cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) suggest a potential political motive behind the SEC’s actions.Is the SEC Stifling Crypto Progress?The ongoing conflict underscores the fundamental differences in perspective between the SEC and the crypto industry. The industry desires regulations that foster innovation and growth while ensuring investor protection. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, has even called for Congress to halt funding for the SEC’s current approach, deeming it ineffective. The legal battles between the SEC and crypto companies like Ripple are far from over. The outcome of these disputes will have a significant impact on the future regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States. As the situation unfolds, it’s clear that a clear and consistent approach to digital currency classification and regulation is needed to navigate this evolving technological landscape.On the Flipside
Ethereum’s switch to a proof-of-stake model could strengthen the argument for classifying it as a security, as staking rewards could be seen as akin to dividends.



The CFTC’s classification of Ethereum futures as a commodity contradicts the SEC’s security stance, creating confusion for businesses.
Why This MattersIndustry leaders are uniting against the SEC’s aggressive stance towards Ethereum, fearing stricter regulations could stifle innovation, create market confusion due to conflicting regulatory bodies, and potentially be politically motivated. This battle for Ethereum’s classification as a security could set a precedent for the entire cryptocurrency industry.To learn more about the regulatory hurdles surrounding Ether ETFs in the US, read here:Coinbase CEO Demands Ether ETF Approval: “Follow the Law”To learn more about why XRP was not included by Coinbase for futures trading, read here:Coinbase Snubs XRP for Futures Trading: Why Was It Left Out?

U.S. SEC Asking for More Millions, Dozens of Lawyers to Beef Up Crypto Oversight

Executive branch budget proposals are gathered into a single push from the White House for its spending priorities, with more detail about how exactly the agencies want to spend the funds they're requesting. Then Congress gets its turn, sometimes embracing some of the president's wishes, and sometimes ignoring them. But even when lawmakers put together a plan for final consideration, the process can get derailed by politics, as the U.S. has seen in the current federal budget effort, which has flirted repeatedly with failure and government shutdowns. Congress is currently evaluating a budget for 2024, after several false starts and continuing resolutions.

Shiba Inu’s BONE Gears Up for $1 As Gate.io Opens Up Margin - DailyCoin


        
A popular centralized exchange adds BONE as a borrowable digital asset.



BONE inked 55.7% in 30 days, hitting a monthly high of $1.54 on March 5.



Only one out of the TOP 5 exchanges listed BONE despite amplified requests.
Shiba Inu’s alternative token, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), received a substantial boost following Gate.io’s listing of BONE on Margin trading. Gate.io, the 12th largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, answered the popular demand by adding BONE as a borrowable asset on the platform’s Margin trading offerings.According to the official statement, BONE is available for Margin trading with up to three times leverage. The news served a 10% boost for BONE’s price, reaching daily heights of $0.966 on March 21, 2024, but later facing a market correction to hover above $0.90. The previously claimed resistance line at $0.90 has successfully transformed into a support cluster.SHIB’s Continuous Quest to Speed Up BONE’s AdoptionThe vibrant and proactive community of Shiba Inu custodians, popularly known as the SHIB Army, have contributed to BONE’s adoption via multiple listing campaigns across social media. While X is flooded with polite request messages asking top crypto platforms like Binance and KuCoin to list Shiba Inu’s BONE, these two exchanges haven’t responded yet.Moreover, the SHIB Army accelerated the BONE listing campaign since the developer team renounced the Shibarium’s gas fee token’s smart contract. This fulfills the promise of BONE capped at a limited supply, as the SHIB community previously voted to halt BONE’s minting despite its rising demand due to the inception of Shibarium Layer-2.According to trading statistics, nearly 20% of all BONE trading is taking place on OKX, which is currently the world’s third-largest exchange. However, no other TOP 5 crypto exchanges have listed BONE, despite the piling requests on Shiba Inu’s social media. Shiba Inu’s BONE trades at $0.9195 at press time, gaining 5% over the past seven days.On the Flipside
While Margin trading expands the trader’s potential to capitalize on gains, the magnified risks ascribed to leveraged trading in comparison to Spot trades include a lack of token ownership.
Why This MattersShiba Inu is developing a self-sufficient ecosystem via Shibarium L2, in which BONE plays a crucial part as the gas & governance token.Discover DailyCoin’s trending cryptocurrency news:Bitget’s Gracy Chen Joins UN to Promote Gender EqualityCoinbase Snubs XRP for Futures Trading: Why Was It Left Out?

Coinbase surge triggers ARK Invest's $52M profit-taking move

ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, has recently made significant moves in its investment portfolio, selling off a substantial portion of its holdings in Coinbase amid a surge in the stock’s price. ARK divested 199,526 Coinbase shares from its exchange-traded funds (ETFs), totaling approximately $52.3 million based on Coinbase’s closing price that day.ARK profit-taking strategy amid Coinbase’s record highsThe decision to sell comes as Coinbase’s stock price reached multi-year highs, surpassing $270 for the first time since December 2021. This move follows a pattern of profit-taking by ARK, which has been gradually reducing its exposure to Coinbase since early 2023. Despite the sell-off, Coinbase shares have experienced remarkable growth, with prices up nearly 250% over the past six months.This recent sale marks one of the most significant divestments of Coinbase shares by ARK in 2024. Before this, ARK offloaded 270,365 Coinbase shares on March 11 and made its largest sale of 499,149 shares on February 16, when Coinbase traded at around $190 per share. In addition to Coinbase, ARK has also been actively selling shares of Block (SQ) and Robinhood (HOOD) to rebalance its portfolio and comply with regulatory requirements.ARK’s portfolio adjustments and market resilienceARK’s decision to sell shares of Robinhood was partly driven by compliance needs, as the fund’s holdings in HOOD approached the regulatory threshold of 5% of the portfolio’s total weight under Rule 12d3-1. This rule prohibits ETFs from acquiring more than 5% of the value of their total assets in certain securities. By selling off shares of Robinhood, ARK aims to ensure compliance while maintaining a diversified portfolio.Despite ARK’s divestment, Coinbase continues to attract investor interest, with its stock price showing resilience and stability. The recent surge in prices reflects growing confidence in the company’s prospects and the broader cryptocurrency market. As ARK adjusts its holdings, investors will be closely watching for further developments and potential shifts in strategy.ARK’s proactive portfolio management in evolving marketsARK Invest’s decision to sell $52 million worth of Coinbase shares underscores the firm’s proactive approach to portfolio management and risk mitigation. While the sale may signal profit-taking in response to rising prices, it also reflects ARK’s commitment to maintaining a balanced and compliant investment portfolio. As Coinbase’s stock continues to perform strongly, ARK’s strategic moves highlight the dynamic nature of the investment landscape and the importance of adaptability in navigating market trends.ARK Invest’s recent sale of Coinbase shares is a notable development in the evolving cryptocurrency investment landscape, reflecting both profit-taking and strategic portfolio adjustments. As market dynamics evolve, investors will be watching closely for further insights into ARK’s investment strategy and its implications for the broader market.

Encouraging participants in the crypto market to seize buying opportunities during downturns, he outlined his short-term objectives for 12 coins. He anticipates these coins will demonstrate remarkable price rebounds in the next three to four months following recent declines.



At the forefront of the list is Bitcoin (BTC), with Crypto Scofield projecting a surge to $150,000. This forecast suggests a potential 125% increase, considering BTC’s current price of $66,400.



Following closely is Fetch.ai (FET), which the analyst predicts will reach $22 in the short term. This target signifies almost tenfold growth, given FET’s current trading price of $2.5. Notably, FET has been a standout performer this bull season, soaring by over 544% since last November.



Another token for which the analyst projects nearly ten-fold growth was Injective (INJ), which established a new all-time high at $52.75 eight days ago. In particular, Crypto Scofield expects INJ to continue its momentum and rally even to $350 by July. 



Meanwhile, some market participants have contested this $350 target as they consider it overambitious. Notably, INJ has witnessed a staggering 787.65% gain since last year. The recent dip has brought its price to around $37.39.



Furthermore, Crypto Scofield is also extremely bullish about Oasis Network (ROSE) and COTI tokens, which currently hover around $0.14 and $0.19, respectively. The analyst believes a $1 target for both assets by July is realistic.



Additionally, the analyst considers the FLOKI meme coin’s potential to attain $0.005 in four months. Notably, FLOKI is one of the best-performing meme coins this season, growing by over 600% in the last 30 days.



Other coins Crypto Scofield has identified with the potential for a remarkable comeback in the short term during this recent dip are VeChain (VET), Fantom (FTM), OCEAN, Render (RNDR), and Zignaly (ZIG).

Renowned Finance Author Reveals Why You Should Buy As Much Bitcoin As You Can | Bitcoinist.com


								Robert Kiyosaki, the author renowned for his best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” has identified Bitcoin as a real-world asset, urging investors and the broader crypto community to shift their focus from stock investments and prioritize accumulating Bitcoin. 
Buy More Bitcoin Before It’s Too Late
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Kiyosaki advised investors to focus on stacking up more Bitcoin now more than ever. Citing the dilemma China’s stock market currently faces, the finance expert has suggested that investors seize the opportunity to buy as much Bitcoin as they can afford before “the biggest bubble in history goes bust.”

Kiyosaki has claimed that China is in “trouble” because the government had borrowed funds to buy more stocks to potentially inflate the stock market artificially and stabilize the country’s economic challenges. The finance author criticized China’s decision, labeling it as a “Foolish” and “Desperate” attempt. 
According to the author, the problem’s root lies in a global decline in consumer spending. He advised against investing in stocks and bonds at this pivotal time, arguing that the stock market was set to crash and the current economic situation was not conducive for traditional investments.
Instead, he recommends investing in real assets such as gold, silver and Bitcoin, which are historically considered safe havens in times of economic uncertainty. 
Supporting the declaration to buy more BTC, popular crypto analyst and BTC enthusiast, Michael van de Poppe agreed to Kiyosaki’s advice, albeit with a time limit of two years. Poppe revealed that following the anticipated crypto bubble, typically debt collapses and liquidity flows back into the dollar and other fiat currencies.
This scenario often leads to a currency devaluation and a subsequent rise in the stock market. He suggests that investors capitalize on Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum by acquiring more of the cryptocurrency. However, he also underscored the value of diversifying investments into the stock market as Bitcoin’s bullish trends fade. 
Finance Guru Praises BTC’s Fixed Supply
In another X post, Kiyosaki lauded praises for Bitcoin, describing the cryptocurrency as a unique investment opportunity due to its fixed supply. As a popular Bitcoin advocate, Kiyosaki is renowned for his preference for investing in tangible assets such as gold, silver and BTC. 

According to the finance guru, there were certain drawbacks involved in investing in gold and silver, noting that as the prices of these assets grow, their supply also increases. However, the reverse was the case for Bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency has a predetermined maximum supply of 21 million coins. 
This scarcity is a key factor driving Kiyosaki’s appreciation for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, as it implies that no matter how high the price of Bitcoin goes, the total supply will remain limited.

ETF Outflows Continu - Decrypt

ETF Outflows ContinuDespite Bitcoin's decline, several alternative cryptocurrencies remain robust. Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase's premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin's all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana's (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.

Alert For Apple Mac Users: Your Cryptos Could Be At Risk


								A newly identified vulnerability in Apple’s M-series processors could have dire implications for crypto users, with the potential to compromise the private keys essential for securing digital assets. This flaw, which resides deep within the microarchitecture of these chips, was first reported by Ars Technica and detailed in a paper published by a collective of researchers from top US universities.
Mac Users Beware: This Is Crucial For Crypto Owners
The vulnerability stems from a side channel in the chip’s data memory-dependent prefetcher (DMP), a mechanism designed to enhance computing efficiency. However, this feature inadvertently allows for the extraction of secret keys during cryptographic operations, a process that is fundamental to the security of cryptocurrencies and other digital transactions.
“The DMP […] uses the data values in order to make predictions […] if a data value ‘looks like’ a pointer, it will be treated as an ‘address’ […] the data from this ‘address’ will be brought to the cache, leaking over cache side channels,” the researchers explained, underscoring the inadvertent risk posed by this hardware optimization.

Dubbed “GoFetch” by its discoverers, this attack method does not require administrative access, raising alarms about the ease with which bad actors could exploit this vulnerability.
According to the team, “We don’t care about the data value being prefetched, but the fact that the intermediate data looked like an address is visible via a cache channel and is sufficient to reveal the secret key over time.” This discovery is particularly concerning for cryptocurrency holders, as private keys are the linchpin of security for digital wallets and transactions.
The implications of GoFetch are vast, affecting not only traditional encryption protocols but also those designed to be resistant against quantum computing attacks. This puts a wide array of cryptographic keys at risk, including RSA and Diffie-Hellman, along with post-quantum algorithms like Kyber-512 and Dilithium-2.
The researchers reported that “The GoFetch app requires less than an hour to extract a 2048-bit RSA key and a little over two hours to extract a 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman key,” highlighting the efficiency and danger of this attack vector.

Mitigation of this vulnerability poses a significant challenge due to its hardware-based nature. While software-based defenses can be developed, they often come at the cost of degraded performance, particularly on devices with older M-series chips.
“For developers of cryptographic software running on M1 and M2 processors […] they will have to employ other defenses, almost all of which come with significant performance penalties,” the researchers noted, indicating a difficult road ahead for both developers and users.
Apple has yet to make a public statement regarding the GoFetch findings, leaving the tech community and crypto users eagerly awaiting a response. In the meantime, the researchers advise end users to look out for software updates that specifically address this vulnerability.
Given the manual and slow process required to assess an implementation’s vulnerability, the crypto community is faced with a period of uncertainty and heightened risk.
At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $63,396, down 5.1% in the last 24 hours.

3AC's Kyle Davis Defiant: No Apologies, Despite Media Backlash - DailyCoin


        
3AC co-founder Kyle Davis refuses to apologize during an interview on the Unchained podcast. 



Mainstream media backlash ensues.



Davis doubles down, saying he will never apologize for losing billions.
The failed high-risk trading strategies employed by Three Arrows Capital (3AC) represented a major domino in the onset of crypto winter. Co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davis were complicit in the crypto hedge fund’s bust in mid-2022, leaving a trail of devastation. In the aftermath, the pair evaded creditors and were even briefly jailed in Singapore for failing to cooperate with probes into 3AC’s implosion.Davis faced a grilling during a recent interview on the Unchained podcast but refused to say sorry for what had happened. The unapologetic stance quickly drew backlash, with the Daily Mail running a scathing piece labeling Davis a “brazen on-the-run coward” for grinning while discussing the events. But rather than bend to the backlash, Davis doubled down by saying he would “never apologize.”3AC Co-Founder Blames CreditorsIn response to the Daily Mail backlash, Davis doubled down in refusing to apologize once more, explaining that he wasn’t grinning; he simply has “big teeth.” Davis added, “We were traders who devoutly believed in up only forever,” before switching tracks to blame 3AC’s creditors for agreeing to lend funds on a “high-risk thesis.”The Daily Mail is a British tabloid that has an upper-middle-class readership with an average age of 56. The comments to the Daily Mail’s article slamming Davis were largely anti-crypto, highlighting society’s divergence when it comes to cryptocurrency.One commenter took the opportunity to question the point of digital assets, saying “crypto “currencies” or anything deriving from them are not assets. They are no more than an inefficient medium of exchange [sic].” Another commented that cryptocurrency is not a bona fide investment, rather it is a “fake currency.”“Not sure why anyone would ever 'invest' in crypto. It is a fake currency made up by some stranger on an imaginary exchange which he runs,” remarked the Daily Mail commenter. While no-coiners harbored deep skepticism about crypto, industry figures, some of whom had direct dealings with 3AC, took an even more scathing view of Davis’ bravado.Crypto Industry Figures Not ImpressedWhile Davis boldly expressed his position on the mainstream media backlash, crypto industry figures promptly joined in, adding their voices to the chorus of criticism. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes tweeted “F*ck your apology,” while calling out Davis’ failure to cooperate with the liquidators overseeing 3AC’s bankruptcy process.BlockTower Capital founder Ari Paul took an even harsher stance, accusing Davis of fraud, theft, and lack of ethical behavior. Paul’s killer blow came as he wrote “Don’t apologize for failing as a trader, apologize for the lying and stealing.”LayerZero co-founder Bryan Pellegrino claimed that Davis had tried desperately to get the firm to hand over its entire treasury to 3AC on the promise of high returns just days before the crypto hedge fund’s stunning collapse.On the Flipside
The British Virgin Island Court ordered a freeze on the 3AC co-founders‘ assets in December 2023, as liquidators Teneo attempted to recoup funds for creditor re-distribution.



The co-founders were in Dubai before being jailed in Singapore in September 2023, but their current whereabouts are unknown.
Why This MattersDavis’ brazen refusal to take responsibility is a slap in the face to the investors who lost billions. This saga highlights the need for more oversight to protect investors from seemingly unaccountable individuals.Read about Zhu’s “magical” experience in Singapore prison here:3AC’s Su Zhu: “I Had the Best Sleep of My Life in Prison”Find out more on renewed concerns over Ethereum’s securities status here:SEC Reignites Ethereum Debate Yet Again: Security or Not?

Grayscale GBTC Outflows in Focus on Bitcoin Price (BTC) Slides to $64K

The weak price action comes as U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs have suffered what's now four consecutive days of net negative flows. To be sure, nearly all the funds continue to see inflows, but each day this week, they've not been nearly enough to offset massive outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). On Thursday, GBTC saw $359 million in outflows, leading to $94 million in outflows for the entire fund group. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) garnered the lowest daily inflow in its history, data compiled by BitMEX Research shows.

Telegram Game on Brand-New Ethereum Layer-2 Scaler Blast Exploited for $4,600,000 in Reported White Hat Hack - The Daily Hodl


								An unknown entity has exploited a Telegram-based game that runs on the newly launched Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 scaling solution Blast Network.
In a post on social media platform X, the team behind the game Super Sushi Samurai (SSS) says token transfers are paused after an attacker exploited a vulnerability that allows exploiters to double their tokens by transferring their holdings to themselves.










“We have been exploited, it’s mint related. We are still looking into the code. Tokens were minted and sold into the LP.”
According to security firm CertiK, $4.6 million worth of tokens were affected by the attack. It turns out though that the incident is a white hat rescue.
Source: Certik/X
In a white hat rescue, the hacker exploits a protocol to show that the project has a vulnerability. SSS says it has already communicated with the exploiter.
“We’re working with the white hat on the safe return of funds. An update and post-mortem will follow.”
Blast, which launched its mainnet a few weeks earlier, has also been facing criticism from the crypto community. In November, Polygon Labs developer relations engineer Jarrod Watts warned about the risks of the platform.
“By sending money to the Blast contract, you’re basically trusting 3-5 strangers to stake your funds for you. You won’t be able to withdraw that money at any point in time unless those 3-5 people decide to do the right thing in the future. Again, there’s no bridge here.”

BlackRock Launches Ethereum Fund, Could #SOL Be Next?


							

BlackRock launches an Ethereum-based tokenized fund to enhance asset liquidity.



Strategic investment in Securitize strengthens BlackRock’s position in digital assets.



Additional support will come from BNY Mellon, Anchorage Digital Bank NA, BitGo, Coinbase, and Fireblocks.




As a step in the finance and crypto industries, BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, has recently launched a fund for tokenized assets on the Ethereum network.



Named the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, it runs with the BUIDL token that is fully collateralized with cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. This approach ensures daily yield distribution to token holders through blockchain technology.



Additionally, BlackRock has made a strategic investment in Securitize to power up its position in the digital asset space. Securitize, a firm that performs tokenization and transfer agent functions of the fund, is the one in charge of it while the details of the investment process remain confidential.







The fund, registered last year in the British Virgin Islands, is a significant extension of BlackRock’s delving into the digital assets field. Through the Securitize experience in tokenizing real-world assets (RWA), the fund will be a manifestation of the novel age of financial instruments, which are designed to promote the liquidity and effectiveness of assets.



The joint effort between BlackRock and Securitize was alluded to in the previous regulatory filing, which led to widespread speculation about the possibility of the development of a tokenized fund. According to a press release, BNY Mellon will custodize the fund’s assets. Additional support will come from Anchorage Digital Bank NA, BitGo, Coinbase, and Fireblocks, creating a robust ecosystem for the fund’s operations.



This development is a continuation of BlackRock’s deepening foray into digital assets, as stated by Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets. Mitchnick emphasized the company’s focus on solving client issues through digital asset solutions, highlighting the significance of this launch in BlackRock’s digital assets strategy.










We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients, and we are excited to work with Securitize.




In parallel developments within the crypto space, speculation is mounting over the potential approval of a spot Solana ETF, following the pathway laid by the spot Bitcoin ETF. The progression towards such approvals is expected to begin with the incorporation of a Solana futures ETF, mirroring the precedents set by Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs. This approach aims to pave the way for the eventual approval of a spot Solana ETF, indicating a growing integration of traditional finance (TradFi) with altcoin markets.

EU Parliament Outlaws Anonymous Crypto Payments: Details


								The majority of the EU Parliament’s lead committees approved a new legislative move to ban anonymous crypto payments has ignited a firestorm of debate, marking a pivotal moment in the regulation of digital currencies within the bloc. This comprehensive package of anti-money laundering measures, extending beyond cryptocurrencies to include significant restrictions on cash transactions, represents one of the most assertive regulatory efforts seen in the global financial landscape.
The Legislative Framework
Under the new legislation, anonymous cash payments in commercial transactions are limited to amounts under €3,000, with a complete prohibition on cash transactions exceeding €10,000 in business contexts. The legislation casts a wide net over digital financial transactions as well, specifically targeting anonymity in crypto payments.
Any transaction involving cryptocurrencies to wallets managed by service providers, known as “hosted wallets,” is now required to be fully traceable, eliminating anonymity for even the smallest transactions.
The EU’s legislative bodies assert that these measures are critical in the fight against money laundering, financing of terrorism, and tax evasion. However, the sweeping nature of these laws has raised serious concerns about privacy rights and the fundamental freedoms of EU citizens.
MEP Dr. Patrick Breyer of the Pirate Party, a staunch critic of the legislation, has termed the EU’s approach as “financial paternalism.” In a detailed blog post, Breyer vehemently opposes the outright ban on anonymous payments, arguing it does little to curb crime while significantly infringing on personal liberties.


He asserts, “Generally prohibiting anonymous payments would at best have minimal effects on crime, but it would deprive innocent citizens of their financial freedom.” Breyer’s comments underscore a broader concern among critics that the legislation could disproportionately affect ordinary citizens under the guise of combating illegal activities.

Highlighting the importance of anonymity for political and social activism, Breyer points out, “The medicines or sex toys I buy is nobody’s business. To collect donations, dissidents such as the late Alexei Navalny and his wife are increasingly reliant on anonymous donations in virtual currencies worldwide.”
This perspective sheds light on the potential repercussions for privacy and freedom of expression, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach to regulation.
Crypto Community’s Reaction
The crypto sector, known for its emphasis on privacy and decentralization, has responded critically to the EU’s regulatory measures. Daniel “Loddi” Tröster, host of the Sound Money Bitcoin Podcast, highlighted the practical challenges and implications of the new laws, particularly focusing on the KYC requirements for transactions to hosted wallets.
“As KYC is required when opening accounts on the crypto exchange anyway, there are no major changes here for the time being (for most providers). However, there are restrictions in other areas. Hosted wallets are likely to include the following: Alby, blink, Wallet of Satoshi…,” he remarked.

These wallets have no KYC thus far. For example, the users of Wallet of Satoshi, have not yet gone through a KYC process. In future, the transfer of Sathois to this wallet would therefore require a KYC process.
Tröster further elaborates on the impact on donations and the broader implications for cryptocurrency use within the EU. “What initially gives me a lot more ‘stomach ache’ are donations. Anyone who wants to donate anonymously can no longer do so with the new regulations,” he states, articulating concerns over the stifling effect these rules might have.
Notably, self-custody to self-custody transactions are not affected by the new law. “It may have been understood that no prevention/regulation is possible here,” Tröster stated.
Enforcement Challenges
Skeptics of the legislation question its effectiveness and enforceability, given the inherently decentralized and borderless nature of crypto. They argue that the global internet infrastructure and the technical capabilities of digital currencies to facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries could significantly hinder the EU’s regulatory efforts.
“Virtual Assets can technically be transferred directly from one person to another without using intermediaries, which makes them impossible to regulate,” Dr. Breyer highlights, challenging the practicality of the EU’s approach.
Moreover, the criticism extends to the potential overreach of the EU in attempting to regulate a global phenomenon through regional legislation. The inherent flexibility and global reach of cryptocurrencies suggest that users may find ways to circumvent these regulations, raising questions about the ultimate effectiveness of the EU’s measures.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Witnesses Epic Whale Activity Spike Amid Coinbase Outflows


Today, the crypto space observed notable activity within the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem, particularly involving substantial transfers of SHIB tokens. A transfer totaling $11.9 million in SHIB was noted, directed toward the address "0xB22." This movement places "0xB22" among the top three wallets by SHIB volume received within the past 24 hours.This transfer originated from the address "0xdaA," which had been accumulating SHIB tokens over the preceding five days. Further examination reveals a trend spanning eight months, with significant quantities of SHIB tokens moving between various unknown wallets before reaching the destination at "0xB22."Of particular interest is the suspected association of these transactions with addresses believed to be linked to DV Chain, a recognized liquidity provider and market maker in the crypto space. Although no direct confirmation of DV Chain's involvement exists, the simultaneous presence of smaller transfers from Coinbase Prime wallets adds complexity to the situation.Source: EtherscanCoinbase Prime, a platform catering to institutional clients, raises questions regarding the scale and nature of SHIB movements observed. While connections to Coinbase Prime addresses are not inherently suspicious, the magnitude of these transactions may warrant attention within the community.This uptick in whale activity occurs amid heightened volatility on the broader cryptocurrency market. As Shiba Inu holders monitor the market, the focus remains on understanding the implications of this whale activity and its correlation with the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency's price trajectory.

Bitcoin Struggles at $66K; Ripple's XRP Defies Bearish Momentum (Market Watch)


																The cryptocurrency market has failed to recover as swiftly as many expected it to, and Bitcoin’s price seems to be struggling to break above $66K definitively. Most of the altcoins are also trading in the red, with two notable exceptions.
Bitcoin Fails at $66K
As seen in the chart below, Bitcoin’s price was unable to retain its bullish momentum that took it all the way to $68K.
BTC has since retraced, declining by more than 2% on the day, trading where it’s currently at around $65,500.
The sentiment is currently mixed, with many believing that there’s more pain to come. The other end of the spectrum is analysts who claim that this is nothing but a normal correction following months of “up only” action. Meanwhil, spot Bitcoin ETF flows continue to be negative for the fourth day in a row.

Are Spot Bitcoin ETF Buyers "Noobs" And Panic Selling?


								Billions have been channeled to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light in mid-January. However, on-chain analysis indicates that some of these spot ETF investors might, after all, be less experienced than initially assumed.
Spot Bitcoin ETF Investors Acting Like “Noobs”?
Taking to X, Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, shared the Bitcoin Network Flows data and picked out crucial leads to suggest that some spot Bitcoin ETFs are shaken out too quickly by the market. 
Bitcoin Network Flows | Source: Willy Woo on X
In a post, Woo pointed to a $1.6 billion outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs when prices crashed on March 5. During this dip, the network had inflows worth $1.1 billion. This outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs and a marked influx of cash to the mainnet could mean that some investors choose to redeem and get hold of the underlying coin, explaining the capital injection. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a simple and accessible route to Bitcoin investment. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which speculate on future prices, spot Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin directly. This means investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of buying and holding the coins themselves. 
All they need to do is purchase shares of spot Bitcoin ETFs from issuers like BlackRock. A specific amount of Bitcoin backs each purchase.

However, as on-chain data shows, by redeeming their shares when prices fell, investors choose to self-custody their coins instead of allowing the issuer, through its partners, to control their coin’s private keys. United States SEC filings show that most ETF issuers rely on Coinbase Custody as their primary custodian.
 This regulated third party safeguards billions worth of Bitcoin backing each share of spot Bitcoin ETF in circulation.
Grayscale Outflows Increasing, BTC Facing Headwinds
The apparent shakeout and inflow directly into the mainnet as Woo shares appear to confirm previous studies. In a report, CoinDesk noted that a big chunk of early spot Bitcoin ETF demand was likely driven by retailers. 

Their investigation found that the average trade size for one ETF hovered around $13,000. This finding reinforces the “retail investor” narrative. Even so, the actual purchasers of spot Bitcoin ETFs will be confirmed when made public.

For now, there is no fresh capital going into spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to Lookonchain data on March 21, Grayscale and the other issuers reduced over $700 million from their holdings. CoinMarketCap data shows that BTC remains below $70,000 and is under pressure.

“Imminent” Supply Shock Could See Bitcoin at $500K by Q4 2025


							

According to George of CryptosRUs, a supply squeeze is imminent for Bitcoin soon.



George noted that the effect of upcoming macroeconomic events will favor Bitcoin.



The analyst believes Grayscale’s diminishing supply will promote the upcoming Bitcoin squeeze.




According to George of CryptosRUs crypto YouTube channel, a supply squeeze is imminent for Bitcoin soon. George noted that Bitcoin has slowed down over the past several days, but it does not mean market participants should give up on the pioneer cryptocurrency. He believes coming events will regenerate an active market for Bitcoin.



In a recently uploaded video, George argued that the effect of upcoming macroeconomic events will favor Bitcoin. The CryptosRUs analyst highlighted the proposed interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve as a signal for an imminent Bitcoin supply squeeze. He further noted that other top economies plan the same thing and would implement rate cuts.









To explain this, George cited Switzerland, one of the top economies to implement rate cuts this year. He considers it a confirmation that several other top economies have concluded plans to revitalize their economies soon. The analyst believes it would encourage liquidity flows, with a significant volume flowing into assets, including Bitcoin.



Another factor George thinks will contribute to the supply squeeze is the ETFs. In his analysis, he predicts the outflow seen on Grayscale is bound to slow down based on a diminishing supply. According to him, that would have a massive impact on the Bitcoin supply squeeze, especially with the newly launched ETFs creating more inflow.



The analyst noted that Grayscale sold half of its ETF supply in eleven weeks, suggesting they would soon run out of volume. According to George, that would be a significant moment for the supply squeeze, especially with the other ETFs injecting more money into the Bitcoin ecosystem.



For prediction, George believes Bitcoin has more room for growth and could rally to $500,000 by the end of 2025. The flagship crypto traded for $65,191 at the time of writing, recovering from a recent dip to $60,760, according to data from TradingView.

Don't buy Bitcoin on this day!


Crypto traders know that many factors affect investing in cryptocurrencies. Timing your Bitcoin (BTC) purchase right can get you more value for the same amount. At the same time, the opposite is true: bad timing can mean that you just wasted a part of your money that you did not have to.
Today’s article will discuss the worst day you can pick to buy Bitcoin, explain why you should avoid buying crypto coins on this day, and provide other relevant information on how to properly time your Bitcoin investments.
Volatility of Bitcoin
Bitcoin price, like that of all crypto, is notoriously volatile. Compared with stocks and bonds, it can swing wildly and frequently within a short time.


The main reason for this is the cryptocurrency’s relatively young age, as it has not yet gained universal acceptance, as well as market demand, trader sentiment, regulation, and the state of the global market.
Therefore, the patterns of change and price cycles are chaotic, and attempting to time the market is tricky. If you want to deal with BTC, you need to be prepared for these fluctuations.
Which factors determine the price of Bitcoin?
Despite the unpredictability of Bitcoin price, there are key factors that can determine the worst possible day to buy BTC. These include:
Price movement patterns
Careful research on how Bitcoin price changes can yield the best and worst times to buy the crypto token. One way to determine this is to perform technical analysis, which studies historical price data for the asset. Alternatively, you can consult chart patterns and trading indicators to forecast future price swings. 
Support and resistance levels are another strategy that can provide you with pressure points on certain price levels. These can tell you the potential times when selling pressure overwhelms buying pressure, which is when you definitely do not want to buy Bitcoin. 
Finally, you can track price trends using moving averages, which are technical indicators that smooth out day-to-day price fluctuations to reveal a possible pattern over a specific period of time. Depending on the time frame, you will want to use different moving averages, which are then used to signal a bearish crossover when you should definitely not buy Bitcoin, as its price will likely go down.
Global crypto market trends
You should always consider the wider market sentiment when you decide to buy Bitcoin. Bad news and negative developments in the world of crypto will likely bring down the value of these assets, which can be a good time to buy if you expect the market to rebound. On the other hand, positive news can ripple through the community, raising confidence in the token and driving up the price. It is crucial to stay in the loop regarding Bitcoin, which means following press releases, news sources, and crypto social media platforms and forums. 
Quarter-year patterns
Some traders claim that Bitcoin displays different price patterns depending on the season or quarter of the year. While historical performance is a fickle and notoriously unreliable indicator, sifting through past data can uncover potential regular movements that can help you determine when to buy and sell crypto.
For example, some analysts claim that Bitcoin price tends to follow the price of other assets and commodities and peaks during the pre-holiday and holiday seasons, which are November and December. The reasoning is that gift-buying and seasonal shopping sprees increase demand for cryptocurrency, which is then higher than the rest of the year. If this is true, this is a bad time to buy Bitcoin.
Day of the week effect
The day-of-the-week effect is an alleged phenomenon in which traders can predict price shift patterns depending on the day of the week. While concrete academic and practical research is very limited on this topic, some studies and experiments have demonstrated that certain days of the week are better for buying BTC than others.
Some historical data shows that the price of Bitcoin is higher during weekdays than on weekends, which can indicate reduced crypto trading activity and investor fatigue that leads to a decrease in demand. The weekend is a time of less volatility due to lower trading volumes, so less opportunity to get a good deal. 



When is the best time to buy bitcoin?

From Reddit users doing their own experiments to university bloggers, there is a broad consensus that Bitcoin price tends to be the highest during the early days of the week, specifically on Tuesday. If this is true, you should not buy Bitcoin on Tuesday. However, relying on technical indicators and daily research is always better than apocryphal stories online, especially if sufficient and reliable studies do not back them. To compare, check out our research for the best day to buy Bitcoin here.

A factor to consider when buying Bitcoin – dollar-cost averaging (DCA)
Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a common investment approach aimed at solving the issue of timing purchases, including Bitcoin. By spreading out trades over regular intervals, DCA annuls the effects of short-term price fluctuations and allows you the opportunity to acquire BTC over time.
Some advantages that DCA provides include:

Eliminating the risk of bad market timing;
Smoother market entry and negation of short-term BTC price instability;
Potentially lowering the average cost you pay for the same value.




Dollar-cost averaging
Lump sum investing


Investment strategy
Purchases at regular intervals over time
A one-time lump sum investment


Timing consideration
Timing the market has less effect
Timing the market is a major factor


Risk management
Helps mitigate short-term price fluctuations
Factors in immediate market conditions


Psychological impact
Less effort and stress associated with market timing
May lead to bad calls if the timing isn’t done right


Table 1: Comparison of dollar-cost averaging vs. lump sum investing
The bottom line: Is now a bad time to buy Bitcoin?
Many factors determine the day you should NOT buy Bitcoin, as the market is highly complex and volatile. You should factor in market trends, repeated price movements, quarter-year patterns, and the day-of-the-week effect. However, if you tend to trust the rumors, just skip Tuesdays.
Jokes aside, always do your research and keep informed about the global trends in order to find out the best and worst possible days to purchase Bitcoin. You will have much more confidence in your decisions, and, ultimately, your crypto investing results will be better if you ground your strategy on solid foundations.

XRP Set For Rapid Rally, Target At $5 In The Short Term


                            XRP continues to maintain its spot as one of the leading cryptocurrency assets in the crypto market today after witnessing a notable rally starting the day at the $0.64 price mark, putting it in the limelight.
Although the price of XRP is still lagging behind its all-time high level of $3.30, some analysis indicates that it may soon start to rise toward its peak. Following the recent rise, several analysts anticipate XRP will rally even further and reach unprecedented heights in the upcoming months.
Short-Term Price Target Set At $5 For XRP
Jake Gagain, a cryptocurrency expert and trader, has made a daring prediction for XRP, noting that the asset could reach a new peak in this bull cycle. The analyst forecast delves into the crypto asset’s potential to move higher before and after the Bitcoin Halving event, which is expected to take place in April.

Gagain asserts that “XRP is one of the top crypto assets today.” However, “unlike other notable coins,” the coin achieved its all-time high record of $3.30 over 6 years ago.
Furthermore, Gagain claims that the token was unable to reach a new peak in the 2021 bull run due to its legal disputes with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
In December 2020, the SEC charged Ripple with raising over $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP in an unregistered securities offering, which Gagain believes was the reason for the coin lagging behind in 2021. Another factor considered by Gagain was the massive number of tokens that “developers were dumping “on a monthly basis.” 
However, if the company manages to win the lawsuit, Gagain believes XRP could hit a new all-time high at the climax of the present bull cycle. As a result, the crypto analyst is placing his price target at the $5 threshold after the bull run ends.
According to Jake Gagain, the Bitcoin halving event is just around 30 days away, and the market is already showing strong momentum. Specifically, the entire crypto market cap is at $2.5 trillion, indicating an over 4% increase in the past day after a slow week.
Gagain also addressed a few other leading crypto assets in the market, predicting massive gains before the halving. These include Bitcoin (BTC) – the biggest digital asset, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA).
$1 Target For April In Progress
Another crypto analyst optimistic about XRP is Dark Defender, predicting that a “$1 price mark by April is in progress.” This suggests that the coin could attain this level before the halving occurrence.

Dark Defender highlighted that as of February 28, the asset was trading at $0.58. Meanwhile, he expects XRP to be pegged at “$0.6462 by March 1, $0.77-$0.92 on March 13, and $1 by April.”
Given the new peak of $0.75, he believes the Fibonacci Levels in the short term will be at $0.9772-$1.5048, $2.3172. He expects his April targets to develop “if XRP maintains the $0.58 Orange Support level, which performed admirably.”

SoundHound AI Inc.'s Executives Cash Out as Stock Continues to Slide - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



SoundHound AI Inc. (NASDAQ: SOUN), a prominent player in the voice-enabled AI and conversational intelligence technology sector, has recently been in the spotlight due to significant insider selling activities and stock price volatility.



The company’s top executives, including the CEO, COO, and VP of Engineering, have sold many shares, raising questions about their confidence in the firm’s prospects. This insider selling coincides with a noticeable downturn in SoundHound AI stock price.



Insider Selling at SoundHound AI Inc.



In a series of transactions on March 19, 2024, critical insiders at SoundHound AI Inc., a leader in voice-enabled AI and conversational intelligence technologies, sold their shares. Michael Zagorsek, the Chief Operating Officer, disposed of 24,105 shares at an average price of $8.37, resulting in a total sale value of approximately $201,718.85. Meanwhile, Keyvan Mohajer, the company’s CEO and 10% owner sold 48,837 shares at the same price point, amassing about $408,837.79 from the transaction. 



Further sales underscored the trend, with Majid Emami, Vice President of Engineering, selling 17,041 shares at an average price of $8.3656, which netted approximately $142,558. This sale was particularly noted to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to vesting shares from restricted stock units granted to Emami. Additionally, Eric R. Ball, a company director, liquidated 90,000 shares at an average price of $5.94, collecting around $534,810.





SoundHound AI Inc. Continues Downturn in Premarket Trading Friday



SoundHound AI Inc. witnessed notable volatility in its stock price in recent trading, underscoring the fluctuating investor sentiment surrounding the voice-enabled AI and conversational intelligence technology firm. The stock closed at $6.68 on Thursday, experiencing a sharp decline of $1.25, or -15.76%. This downturn continued in pre-market trading, where it was already down by $0.64, or -9.58%, at the time of writing.



The movement marked a significant shift from its previous close of $7.93, despite opening slightly higher at $8.00, only fluctuating between $6.65 and $8.42 throughout the trading day. This trading pattern reflects the broader challenges and investor perceptions facing the tech company in a highly competitive market.



The company’s stock performance over the last year has been equally tumultuous, with a 52-week range between $1.49 and $10.25. This illustrates the high volatility and potential risk associated with SoundHound AI’s shares. On the most recent insider transactions date, SoundHound AI Inc.’s market capitalization stood at approximately $2.066 billion.

                        Meme coin FLOKI appears to have rebounded from a March 19 bottom of $0.000165 as it trades today at $0.000225, a hefty appreciation of about 36%, according to figures taken from CoinGecko. Like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu before it (SHIB) and BONK and DogWifHat (WIF) after it, FLOKI is based on the eminently memeable Shiba Inu.However, FLOKI’s inspiration and IRL namesake is a Shiba Inu with a famous owner: Elon Musk.In terms of overnight gains, DOGE and SHIB firmly outpaced FLOKI. The largest meme coin by market capitalization, DOGE, blew up by about 4.7% overnight. SHIB posted more modest 24-hour gains of about 1.2%.FLOKI’s performance is more in line with the broader market, though. In general, crypto is down today. Market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum both shed 2.5% while FLOKI dropped 7.7% to post heavier overnight losses than any of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.Over on FLOKI’s trading chart, we can see that it is currently trading at a new support level that it found after a sharp but volatile rally in early March.FLOKI is roughly the same price as its 30-day moving average, and with a relative strength index (RSI) reading of 49 there is likely to be more selling throughout the day but the price is altogether stableSource: TradingViewAs FLOKI Rebounds, GBTC Gains Momentum
Meme coins are a whimsical game.The rapid nature of their price movements, which often exaggerate the gains and losses of market leaders like Bitcoin, make them into a bit of an investment gamble, often with higher stakes involved.That’s why prudent investors limit and spread risk and diversify their portfolios with more useful (although perhaps less funnier) projects.However, in assessing projects to speculate on, two considerations reign supreme: utility and upside potential.Green Bitcoin (GBTC) just raised $7.6 million over a two-week-long presale because early investors think it checks those two boxes.GBTC has a hardcap of 21 million, a clear nod to its inspiration, Bitcoin. Limiting the number of tokens in circulation creates value through scarcity.However, GBTC’s use of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain over Bitcoin’s less energy-efficient proof-of-work mechanism makes it cleaner and greener than its inspiration.Green Bitcoin touts itself as a “gamified green staking” project. Essentially, token holders participate through the staking platform, where they earn GBTC rewards by predicting Bitcoin price trends.Holders can stake their tokens for up to six months to earn even bigger rewards.Staking is a fundamental part of Green Bitcoin’s tokenomics. By reducing GBTC’s circulating supply, staking helps drive the price over the long term.Anyone can get involved by simply visiting the official Green Bitcoin website and connecting a crypto wallet.1 GBTC presently costs $1.1062, with the price due to rise in a little over six days.There are still a few weeks left of the presale, and the token could rally sharply by the time it’s listed on major exchanges.Get in early and Buy Green Bitcoin Now

$25 Billion XRP Surge: What Happened?

XRP's real trading volume surged to a whopping $25 billion in the last 48 hours. But the reasoning behind it is not clear. Let's try to break it all down.From the real volume chart, it is clear that there has been a steady rise in trading, but recently, things really took off. A jump this big makes you think, why now? One reason could be that the market is getting out of correction mode, and when that happens, large caps like XRP often see a lot of action.XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewXRP's price has been bouncing up and down, but there was a moment when it shot up higher than it had in a while. This is what traders call a "higher high." It means that, for a moment, people were willing to pay more for XRP than they have in recent times.The key levels to watch now are the support around $0.50, where the price has bounced back before, and the resistance near $0.60, which is like a ceiling that the price has to break through to keep climbing.Now, for a bit of guesswork as to why this might be happening. It could be that investors are getting more confident about the future and starting to buy more XRP, despite the fact that the asset remains suppressed. If this trend keeps up, we could see XRP's price climb higher, especially if it breaks past that resistance level. But as always with cryptocurrencies, it is a wait-and-see game. There is always a chance that prices could swing the other way, so it is important to keep an eye on the market.A sudden surge in XRP's volume could mean a lot of things, but one thing's for sure: XRP might be finally getting ready for a proper reversal. However, growth of underlying metric does not necessarily means growth of an asset's price.

Vitalik Says Ethereum Must Achieve Mainstream Adoption Within Five Years - The Defiant

Buterin pointed to stablecoins and non-financial applications like social and identity as key opportunities for Ethereum to reach new users.Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder and chief scientist, believes the next five years will be critical in determining whether the network can achieve mainstream adoption.Speaking during an interview at the ETHTaipei conference on March 20, Buterin predicted that the next half-decade will prove whether Ethereum is ready for “real-world” adoption.Buterin said stablecoins have emerged as the leading use case for crypto in recent years. Indeed, stable tokens facilitate frictionless payments, protection from price fluctuations and inflation for users residing in countries with volatile fiat currencies, and a popular on-and-off ramp to the broader web3 ecosystem.Buterin asserted that low fees and high-quality user interfaces are critical to ensure that stablecoins continue to reach new audiences.“Historically, Ethereum has not had those things, but, over the next five years, Ethereum will start to have those things,” Buterin said. “We’re already seeing Layer 2s… starting to get there... I expect Ethereum to be a very leading player in helping to make stablecoin accessible to people in a way that actually is open, actually is decentralized, and actually doesn’t require trusting fragile third-parties.”Buterin’s comments came a little over one week after Ethereum’s highly-anticipated Dencun hard fork went live, ushering in a huge reduction in Layer 2 transactions through the activation of EIP-4844.Data from GrowThePie shows the average transaction fees on leading L2s plummeting by up to 98% since Dencun’s deployment, making Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem competitive with low-cost Layer 1s like Tron and BNB Chain while inheriting the decentralization of Ethereum’s base layer.Tron and BNB Chain, networks that offer low fees at the expense of adopting a highly centralized network architecture, currently dominate on-chain stablecoin activity.A recent report from the Brevan Howard hedge fund found that 49% of weekly active wallets using stablecoins resided on Tron at 2.41 million, followed by BNB Chain with 1.37 million users or a 28% dominance. Ethereum came in third with just 379,769 or a 7.7% market share.Data from DeFi Llama also suggests Tether (USDT) on Tron boasts a 70% dominance with $104 billion of the on-chain stablecoin sector’s $148 billion market cap.Non-financial applicationsButerin also predicted that “‘non-financial applications” will have a significant “impact” as a vehicle driving mainstream adoption, noting the success of decentralized social platforms including Farcaster and Lens.“There is a big desire to have alternatives to things like Twitter and Facebook at the moment,” he said. “Farcaster has] managed to be used by non-crypto people in a way that a lot of other applications have not. I think that’s an important success to build on and for other applications to try to replicate.”Vitalik also highlighted the growing interest in decentralized identity and proof-of-personhood protocols on Ethereum amid the backdrop of increasing concerns regarding the rise of artificial intelligence.“One of the big challenges that people are worrying about right now is how to prove that an account on some platform is a person, as opposed to being a bot,” Buterin said. “The big risk I see is that when people need to solve that problem, people will jump to centralized solutions, and centralized solutions… are going to have very bad risks in terms of excluding all kinds of people.”Buterin also noted that prominent ideas underpinning the ethos of web3 are also beginning to penetrate the mainstream. He cited the upcoming initial public offering from Reddit, the popular social media platform, which will give highly active users including contributors and moderators “the ability to participate on the same terms as institutional investors.” Reddit likely drew inspiration from the airdrop model that rewards early adopters of web3 dApps.Expanding Ethereum’s validator ecosystemLooking forward, Vitalik emphasized his excitement for Verkle Trees, which will be implemented as part of Ethereum’s next hard fork, Pectra. Buterin noted that technical barriers are persistently cited as a major factor discouraging ETH holders from staking.“With Verkle Trees, as a node, you would not have to store the state locally. And with EIP-4444: History Expiry, you would not have to store most of the history locally,” Buterin said. “The amount of data that you would need to be a node would decrease from multiple terabytes to... being able to run a node in RAM.”Vitalik continued that the future introduction of zk-SNARKs will reduce the data burden for nodes even further.“In the long term, running a node will feel like… a few very simple computations that will be very easy to do as a background process on any computer, maybe even a phone, even inside a browser,” Buterin said. “There’s a pre-existing technology roadmap to get to that point.”

Optimistic Trends for Floki Inu



Despite recent market downturns, Floki Inu’s valuation exhibits potential recovery signs, notably after a drop to an intraday low. The emergence of a hammer candlestick pattern, combined with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) standing and positive readings from the Awesome Oscillator (AO), hints at an upcoming positive shift in its price trajectory. 








Should the buying momentum persist, Floki Inu is expected to solidify its current level as a support base, possibly aiming for a higher Fibonacci retracement mark, although it faces significant resistance ahead. Alternatively, an increase in selling pressure might push the price down further, potentially negating the optimistic outlook and prompting additional sell-offs. 



Anticipated Price Adjustment for XRP



XRP’s journey has been rocky, marred by ongoing legal entanglements and asset liquidation by Ripple, casting a shadow over its market valuation. Despite a recent uptick, XRP’s growth is relatively subdued when compared to its peers. Presently, technical indicators suggest an imminent price correction, with the currency at a crossroads, influenced heavily by overarching market moods. 







BlockDAG: Pioneering the Crypto Mining Sector And Much More



BlockDAG is at the forefront of the presale domain, introducing its groundbreaking X-series mining rigs, which are set to transform the cryptocurrency mining industry with their energy efficiency and superior performance. The product range, from the X1 (mobile mining app) to the X100 models, caters to various mining needs, offering substantial daily BDAG coin yields.




Currently in its third presale stage, BlockDAG’s coin price is expected to soar, predicting a substantial return on investment by the end of the presale phases. The initial enthusiasm from investors is evident from the swift accumulation of $6.8 million and the fast selling out of batch 3 presale. The presale is leading to a grand $2 million giveaway, engaging the community and rewarding participation.







Additionally, over 4.3 billion BDAG coins have been sold already, as the project still in the third batch of a total 45 in presale. The technology behind this blockchain is a hybrid and highly effective one (recently revealed in a video keynote displayed at Shibuya Crossing, Tokyo), characterized by the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) that help with all the questions related to transaction speed and Proof-of-Work (Pow) which ensures that questions as security, decentralization and scalability are heavily guarded.



Concluding Thoughts



As the cryptocurrency industry evolves, Ripple’s XRP faces a looming price correction amidst regulatory challenges. Floki Inu, however, presents a hopeful scenario for investors, contingent on sustained buyer interest. 



BlockDAG stands out with its presale momentum and the transformative potential of its mining technology, promising amazing returns (the latest keynote specified potential returns already reaching 5,000x). These developments signify a dynamic phase in the cryptocurrency market, highlighting opportunities amid uncertainties.

Shorthanded EU Struggles in Crypto Regulation Risk Falling behind Global Standards | Coinspeaker



EU’s securities watchdog ESMA struggles to keep pace with crypto regulations as ESMA confronts resource constraints.

Establishing a robust regulatory frame­work for cryptocurrencies remains a significant obje­ctive for the European Union (EU). Howe­ver, the European Se­curities and Markets Authority (ESMA) confronts a substantial impedime­nt due to resource constraints. As a result, the EU risks falling behind othe­r markets in embracing cryptocurrencie­s and blockchain technology.
Overse­eing Europe’s complex financial landscape­ is a primary endeavor for ESMA, the­ Union’s premier regulatory authority. Ve­rena Ross, the este­emed chairperson, acknowledges this challenge, highlighting the several additional responsibilities and warrants assigned to the agency in recent years.




“Resources is an issue for ESMA generally because we have had a large number of additional responsibilities and mandates given to us over the last few years, and not always necessarily with a lot of additional resources, […] That has certainly created some challenges for us”, Ross said in a recent interview.
One­ such consequence is the­ delay of the Europe­an Commission’s October 2023 deadline for asse­ssing the potential inclusion of crypto assets within Ucits funds – a wide­ly favored investment ve­hicle among European retail inve­stors. However, as acknowle­dged by the Chair, Vere­na Ross, resource constraints have required a significant delay, pote­ntially deferring the time­line to the end of 2024 or e­ven early 2025.
EU Struggles with Crypto Regulation Challenges
The European Union lags be­hind when it comes to crypto oversight. Me­anwhile, America embrace­s digital assets with open arms. Bitcoin ETFs soared state­side, netting $11 billion since January 2024. This regulatory agility allows US investors easy e­ntry into the crypto world – a stark contrast to Europe’s glacial pace and rigid re­gulations. Capital flight looms as funds seek gree­ner, pro-innovation pastures overse­as.
Furthermore, the lack of harmonization regulations within the­ European Union poses significant challenge­s. Jupiter Fund Management’s experience serves as a prime example. While their Irish Ucits fund was forced to abandon a planned crypto investment due­ to harsh Irish regulations, Spain permits e­xposure to such assets through exchange­-traded products.
The Urgency for Action
The growing convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurre­ncies underlines the­ pressing need for a transpare­nt and cohesive regulatory frame­work within the European Union. The e­mergence of US-base­d ETFs and the UK’s receptive­ness to comparable offerings acce­ntuate this developme­nt. ESMA acknowledges this interconnectedness and stresses the importance of getting the Ucits review right.
“What we’re seeing happen is just an increased interconnectedness between crypto assets and the traditional financial sector and various products,” Ross said
With mere­ly 300 staff and a €75.2 million budget unchanged from last year, ESMA is forced to prioritize tasks rigorously. This may involve strategic staff allocation potentially retraining existing employees to specialise in crypto regulation. Additionally, a phased rollout of MiCA could ease the implementation burden for both ESMA and member states.
The EU needs to address ESMA’s resource constraints to ensure effective crypto regulation. A well-funded and empowered watchdog is crucial for fostering innovation, protecting investors, and ensuring the EU remains competitive in the global digital asset landscape.

U.S. SEC's Gensler Says Crypto Firms Skip Public Disclosures by Dodging Registration

Gensler, whose tenure atop the agency has been marked by a legal crusade against what he argues is a largely noncompliant industry, suggested that digital assets businesses are among those seeking to "whittle away at the SEC's disclosure regime," which requires companies to register securities and provide information to investors about them.

Worldcoin makes Orb software open-source, implements ‘personal custody’

The Worldcoin Foundation announced in a blog post that it has open-sourced components of the software running its iris-scanning Orbs, making it publicly available. According to the announcement the core components of the Orb software can be accessed on GitHub under an MIT/Apache 2.0 dual license. The new open-source components “complement” hardware it previously released. The release includes code on the Orb which is crucial for capturing images and securely transferring them to the product's app. Worldcoin said that its publicly available software and iris recognition repositories mark “significant progress” in creating transparency for the Orb’s image processing, along with verifiable privacy claims.In addition to open-sourcing more of the software behind the infamous metallic, eye-scanning Orb, Worldcoin revealed another privacy feature called “Personal Custody.” This new feature allows individual users to self-custody their data given over to Worldcoin through a data package signed with the Orb’s private key and then encrypted with a user-provided public key before it is transferred to the user's mobile phone. The developer said this means that users will “always remain in control of their data,” and only the individual can decrypt this biometric data. Worldcoin said:“Once the encrypted data is sent from the Orb to the individual’s World App, no unencrypted copies of this data exist anywhere.” According to the developer, the feature could potentially reduce the number of times users would need to return to an Orb to verify their World ID. Related: Data privacy and security concerns worry nearly half of tech industry consumers: ReportThis update to Worldcoin comes as the company faces scrutiny from global regulators over privacy concerns. On March 21, the Kenyan government denied a request from the United States government to revoke its suspensions of the Worldcoin project. The government said it would ban Worldcoin activities in the country until it can be assured of its safety for the Kenyan people and integrity of financial details are provided.On March 18, Worldcoin posted on its blog that it operates “lawfully in all of the locations in which it is available” and is fully compliant with all laws and regulations governing data collection and data transfer.However, earlier in March, it received more pushback. This time, the Spanish Agency for the Protection of Data demanded that Worldcoin stop collecting and processing data locally and issued a temporary ban on its operations.Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the firm behind artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot ChatGPT. OpenAI is also currently facing scrutiny for its decision not to open-source its code for its AI models.

We Asked AI to Predict March Madness Winners-Here's Our Bracket - Decrypt

March Madness is upon us, with the western sports world obsessed with analyzing and picking how the NCAA men's basketball tournament will unfold—a task that the sports league says has odds of one in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808. Of course, the 1:9.2 quintillion odds assume a 50-50 probability for each matchup, no better than a coin flip.Each team and game brings countless variables, and that's what makes March Madness predictions so engrossing for fans (and oddsmakers). It's a lot of information for humans to process, but how about artificial intelligence?Beating the oddsAfter the first eight games, fewer than 2.5% brackets remain perfect, the NCAA says—the biggest "bracket buster" on day one was third-ranked Kentucky losing to #14 Oakland U, 80-76 on Thursday.In fact, if every single person who has ever lived on Earth since the dawn of time filled out a different bracket, there would still be a 99.9999999883% chance that nobody would pick every winner. If you had drafted a unique bracket every second that has elapsed since the Big Bang, there would still be effectively zero likelihood of a perfect score.Against that, you have a comparably great chance of winning a lottery.Enter AINobody has picked a perfect bracket so far. No human, that is. Machine learning has long been enlisted to aid in the endeavor, but now AI has advanced at an explosive rate.Google—a company not typically keen on promoting betting or gambling—has been researching and sharing findings related to March Madness predictions for years. The tech giant has an entire section dedicated to teaching how to use Google Cloud to analyze NCAA basketball data. This allows folks to dig into various variables, compare game performance metrics, download comprehensive player and team stats, and more.Google has even been an official partner of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, sharing data analysis tools for America's biggest annual sports spectacle as a use case for AI in big data analysis in 2020.Picking an AI to pick winnersAI has since advanced at an explosive rate, and there are manifold ways to harness artificial intelligence for bracketology: you could process reams of data according to your own methodology, trust another's work, or even train your own model from scratch.We opted for the lazier path and consulted ChatGPT. Among the many basketball-savvy GPTs available, we picked "March Madness Bracket Buster Bot" because it was the only one to show a real statistical analysis behind its predictions.Spoiler alert, the bracket was busted after day one.East:
Florida Atlantic vs. Northwestern: This could be tight, but I'm leaning toward Northwestern with their balanced play. Correct!
Illinois vs. Morehead St.: Illinois' seed suggests they're the team to beat in this one. Correct!
Washington St. vs. Drake: Washington St. seems poised to pull through with their strong seeding. Correct!
Iowa St. vs. South Dakota St.: Iowa St.'s seeding and stat line say they'll dance on. Correct!
BYU vs. Duquesne: BYU might just have the edge with their dynamic offense. Wrong.
UConn vs. Stetson: The power's definitely surging through UConn here, and I'd expect them to advance.
San Diego St. vs. UAB: San Diego St. has the defensive chops to shut down UAB.
Auburn vs. Yale: Auburn should dominate this academic showdown on the court.
West:
North Carolina vs. Wagner: North Carolina's history and stats say they'll advance. Correct!
Dayton vs. Nevada: Dayton's consistent play all season makes them the pick here. Correct!
Arizona vs. Long Beach St.: Arizona's ranking and stats make them the clear favorite. Correct!
Mississippi St. vs. Michigan St.: Mississippi St. has a good chance, but it’s going to be a nail-biter. Wrong.
South:
Texas Tech vs. NC State: Texas Tech's higher seed points to victory. Wrong.
Houston vs. Montana: Houston is the team to beat with their impressive seed.
Wisconsin vs. James Madison: Wisconsin is the favorite here, thanks to their powerful lineup.
Duke vs. Vermont: Duke is likely to show why they're a perennial powerhouse.
Midwest:
Gonzaga vs. McNeese St.: Gonzaga's pedigree in March Madness should see them through. Correct!
Kansas vs. Sanford: Kansas should have no trouble advancing past Sanford. Correct!
Creighton vs. Akron: Creighton's higher seeding should be the difference-maker. Correct!
Texas vs. Colorado St.: Texas' stats suggest they'll round up a win here. Correct!
Tennessee vs. Saint Peter's: Tennessee's impressive seed and stats make them the pick. Correct!
South Carolina vs. Oregon: This could be a toss-up, but South Carolina might just sneak by. Wrong.
Second, and third, opinionsOther AI models provided different results, though many of them agreed on certain outcomes, like BYU beating Duquesne—which didn't pan out yesterday. The unpredictability of humans prevails again. Duquesne certainly beat the odds scoring its first win in half a century, with many of ESPN’s stats favoring BYU by a large margin.Image: ESPNWe also checked Kaggle.com, a platform for data science competitions and an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners, to see if there was something out there for "bracketologists"—and indeed there was. A machine learning model published by Nishaan Amin analyzed 153 MB of data files with dozens of charts and thousands of statistics and information. The repository has been checked over 4,000 times until today.This lets you adapt the model and analyze what you consider important, fitting your style. The owner shared its own predictions.The model says UConn will win the tournament after beating Purdue, but it hints that Connecticut has a chance to beat Purdue before the finals.The model also provides an upset bracket simulation with different parameters and results for those who like alternatives:Of course, predicting human behavior—whether for bracketology, sabermetrics, or technical analysis—is an inexact science. Models analyze past performance and make predictions in "ceteris paribus" conditions: the most likely outcome if everything happens under the exact same circumstances as before.A machine learning model can analyze huge amounts of data and find patterns that may be hidden before our eyes, understanding the relationship between hundreds or even thousands of variables. But no model or methodology can foresee extraordinary circumstances like an Elon Musk tweet tanking the whole crypto market, someone having an existential crisis and market-selling a huge crypto position, a team riding high off their fans' energy, a star player's untimely injury, or a hungover squad fresh off a massive rager.So AI won’t solve the problems that only time machines can. In the end, that's what makes sports so compelling: the underdog stories, the stunning upsets, the unknown variables that defy the odds. We already failed on our first day after picking BYU. But sometimes David beats Goliath, slinging a stone to take down an armored giant. That probably happened in March.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Trezor says phishing, not SIM swap, compromised X account

SatoshiLabs, the company that designs and markets Trezor crypto hardware wallets, has issued a detailed explanation of an incident that led to the posting of fraudulent presale token announcements on its official X account.The company said the security breach was caused by a phishing attack, not a SIM-swap attack, which it suspected at the time.SatoshiLabs emphasized that it does not use a mobile device for two-factor authentication, instead opting for more secure methods of authentication.Despite these precautions, attackers made a series of unauthorized and misleading posts, including requests for users to send funds to an unidentified wallet address alongside harmful links, which sent users to a bogus token presale site.Independent blockchain sleuth ZachXBT notified his 528,000 followers on X of Trezor’s suspected breach in a March 19 X post.The official X account of hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor published a series of posts directing users to fraudulent presale token offerings. Source: TrezorSatoshiLabs disclosed that it detected unauthorized entry into its X account on March 19. It now suspects it to be a sophisticated and premeditated phishing attack planned by hackers over several weeks.Once SatoshiLabs became aware of the breach, the deceptive posts were promptly identified and removed, limiting damage. The company said:“We want to stress here that the security of all our products remains unaffected. This incident has in no way impacted or compromised the security of Trezor hardware wallets or any of our other products.”Investigations indicate that starting on Feb. 29, the attackers posed as credible entities in the cryptosphere. They maintained a convincing social media presence and engaged in seemingly authentic discussions.Related: HECO Chain exploiter anonymizes $145M of Ether on Tornado Cash in 8 daysUnder the guise of a well-established X account with thousands of followers, the impersonator contacted SatoshiLabs’ public relations team, suggesting an interview with the CEO. Following this, a meeting was arranged, during which the impersonator shared a malicious link disguised as a Calendly calendar invitation.A team member was prompted for their X login credentials by clicking the calendar link, raising suspicion. However, the meeting was rescheduled. In the next session — pretending to be facing technical issues — the attacker succeeded in linking their Calendly to SatoshiLabs’ X account.Trezor suffered a security breach in January that exposed the contact information of nearly 66,000 users. According to the firm’s website, the wallet maker has sold over two million hardware wallets since it launched in 2012.

2 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week


Meme coins surged for impressive gains year-to-date, dominating most of the cryptocurrency market’s top performances in 2024. However, the results cooled down in the past week while cryptocurrencies faced a major correction, threatening further losses.
Over $230 billion was wiped in a day from March 18 to March 19. The overall sentiment drastically changed from ultra-bullish to slightly bearish, which can put an end to the meme coin’s hype.
In this context, Finbold selected two cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week, among the previously most traded speculative tokens.


Pepe (PEPE)
Pepe (PEPE) has seen over 500% gains in the last 30 days, from $0.000000115 on February 22.
Now, PEPE loses momentum, back to a 55 Relative Strength Index (RSI), similar to one month ago. A bearish divergence appears to be surging in the daily chart, as the price remains high despite the strength loss.
Currently, PEPE has a market cap above $3 billion and no solid use cases besides price speculation and being a meme. There is price support at $0.000005927 but no other meaningful support between that and $0.000000115, for a 98% drop.
PEPE/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView (Finbold)
Dogwifhat (WIF)
Second, Dogwifhat (WIF) had an even greater performance, attracting retail investors to the Solana (SOL) blockchain. WIF is up nearly 600% in 30 days while testing support at around $2.0 per token.
Like PEPE, dogwifhat investors may finally decide to realize part of their massive profits, which could create a liquidity shock. Losing the current region would potentially drive the price to its month-over-month lows at $0.29, for an 86% crash.
WIF/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView (Finbold)
Why investors should avoid trading meme coins?
The most dangerous aspect of trading meme coins is that, without further use cases, prices can engage in a death spiral once the hype goes away. Notably, investors usually deploy capital to these tokens in the expectation of selling for higher prices for the next buyer.
This behavior is described as “The Greater Fool Theory” by finance experts.

“The Greater Fool Theory is the idea that, during a market bubble, one can make money by buying overvalued assets and selling them for a proﬁt later, because it will always be possible to ﬁnd someone who is willing to pay a higher price. An investor who subscribes to the Greater Fool Theory will buy potentially overvalued assets without any regard for their fundamental value. This speculative approach is predicated on the belief that you can make money by gambling on future asset prices and that you will always be able to ﬁnd a “greater fool” who will be willing to pay more than you did. Unfortunately, when the bubble eventually bursts (which it always does), there is a large sell-oﬀ that causes a rapid decline in the asset values. During the sell-oﬀ, you can lose a great deal of money if you are the one left holding the asset and cannot ﬁnd a buyer.”
– Harford Funds blog post: “The Greater Fool Theory: What Is It?”

This purely speculative demand works well while the market is bullish and prices can go up quickly, as observed. Nevertheless, sentiment shifts erase the demand, and investors can initiate a run, panic-selling the coins to avoid losses. In these events, the price drop can be faster than the previous pump, with low chances of recovery.
Yet, cryptocurrencies are unpredictable, and further support from celebrities or other news could fuel more greed and a rally continuation. On that note, investors should avoid trading PEPE and WIF in a zone of possible huge retracements, while higher prices are still possible.

Ripple's CTO Schwartz teases future possibilities with tweet

Ripple‘s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, recently stirred a curiosity within the XRP community with a cryptic tweet, leaving enthusiasts speculating about its potential significance. The tweet, featuring a mathematical problem yielding the solution “5,” prompted a flurry of interpretations, particularly regarding its implications for the future price of XRP.Following the enigmatic tweet, numerous XRP enthusiasts engaged in spirited discussions across social media platforms, particularly X, formerly known as Twitter. Many interpreted the numeric solution of “5” as a veiled prediction hinting at XRP’s price potentially reaching $5 in the foreseeable future. This interpretation gained traction, especially considering Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which could significantly impact XRP’s market dynamics.Ripple’s legal challenges with the SEC have been a focal point for both investors and enthusiasts. In a pivotal victory last year, a federal judge ruled that XRP sales on secondary markets do not constitute sales of securities. This ruling provided a boost to XRP’s value, briefly propelling it to $0.71. Furthermore, recent developments within the cryptocurrency regulatory landscape, including the approval of Grayscale’s spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) alongside others, have contributed to the evolving market sentiment surrounding XRP.As of the latest market data, XRP maintains its position as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently trading at $0.63214. Despite experiencing a 6.05% increase in value over the past 24 hours, a subsequent decline has moderated this growth to 4.91%.Schwartz ventures Into trading bot developmentIn a notable departure from his role as Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz has recently revealed his immersion into the world of algorithmic trading. This venture takes the form of a trading bot specifically crafted for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Representing a significant pivot within Schwartz’s career trajectory, this endeavor underscores his ongoing commitment to innovation and exploration within the cryptocurrency sphere.The trading bot, meticulously designed by Schwartz, draws inspiration from the mechanics of the XRP Ledger’s Automated Market Maker (AMM). This algorithmic approach aims to leverage market dynamics and liquidity to optimize trading strategies, potentially yielding favorable outcomes in an ever-evolving market environment.Schwartz’s decision to embark on this project reflects his deep-rooted understanding of blockchain technology and its practical applications beyond Ripple’s core operations. By harnessing the principles underlying the XRP Ledger’s AMM, Schwartz seeks to replicate its success in facilitating efficient and seamless transactions within centralized exchanges.Schwartz’s impact and future trajectoryMoreover, this initiative underscores Schwartz’s proactive stance toward embracing emerging trends and technologies within the cryptocurrency landscape. As the industry continues to evolve rapidly, characterized by dynamic market conditions and regulatory developments, Schwartz’s foray into algorithmic trading signifies a strategic move towards diversification and innovation.While acknowledging the early stages of development, Schwartz remains optimistic about the potential of the trading bot. He envisions it as a tool for empowering traders with enhanced efficiency and sophistication, ultimately contributing to a more robust and resilient cryptocurrency ecosystem.David Schwartz’s cryptic tweet and subsequent ventures into trading bot development have ignited speculation and interest within the XRP community. As enthusiasts eagerly anticipate potential price movements and technological advancements, the broader cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve amidst regulatory developments and market fluctuations. With XRP maintaining its position among the top cryptocurrencies, the community remains poised for further developments and opportunities in the digital asset space.Schwartz’s tweet and ongoing initiatives reflect the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where innovation and speculation intersect, shaping the future trajectory of digital assets like XRP.

Ethereum leads NFT sales despite market dip


Ethereum retained its position as the leading blockchain in non-fungible token (NFT) sales for the third consecutive day to close the week, CryptoSlam data shows.
Ethereum sales dipped by 63% on Friday, falling from Thursday’s US$32.81 million which was boosted by a single CryptoPunk NFT selling for US$16.38 million.
Following Ethereum, Bitcoin and Solana ranked second and third, with sales volumes of US$7.99 million and US$6.10 million respectively in the same period.
Bitcoin experienced a 23% decrease in sales volume. This is the first time Bitcoin NFTs fell below US$10 million this week. 



Solana sales fell 7.62%.
These figures reflect a market that, while experiencing a general downturn, still sees fluctuations in activity across different blockchains.
BNB Chain had one of the strongest performances on Friday with a 12% sales increase to US$1.22 million. Its “lucky start” collection accounted for US$668,236 of those sales.

TICKER Presale Ends in $900K Theft by French Developer - DailyCoin


        
The project behind the TICKER token is in trouble.



The problem arose after the team completed a presale event.



A French developer faces scam allegations.
Popular blockchain detective ZachXBT has exposed an alleged crypto scam involving French developer Jolan Lacroix, who faces accusations of stealing nearly $1 million from the TICKER token presale event.The TICKER team launched a presale on March 16 and touted an elaborate token distribution plan, reserving 71% of the tokens for presale/airdrops, 24% for liquidity pool (LP,) 4% for errors, and 1% for early contributors. However, things took a different turn once the Token Generation Event (TGE) and presale were over.French Developer Accused of “Rugging Everyone”According to a recent X (Twitter) thread shared by ZachXBT, after raising 877 ETH ($3.19M) during the presale event, the TICKER team sent 15% of the TICKER supply to Jolan Lacroix, the developer tasked with assisting the project in distributing the airdrop.Instead of facilitating the airdrop, the developer reportedly sold 13% of the token’s supply for $900,000, “rugging everyone supporting the project.” The developer then began laundering the proceeds by bridging all of the ETH from Base to Ethereum via Orbiter Finance. This was followed by bridging everything to Solana via Mayan Swap & Allbridge.While it’s typical for most rug-pull scammers to lay low by going dark, Jolan allegedly taunted the people he stole from.“Jolan then went to X/Twitter to address the allegations and confirms he controls the stolen funds while saying he is “not sorry” for his actions taunting the people he rugged in three posts. The posts are no longer available as he deactivated his account.” ZachXBT wrote.ZachXBT further explained how Jolan later turned into an NFT collector and a memecoin trader using the stolen funds. The developer allegedly bridged $536K back to Ethereum, where they spent 46 ETH ($161K) on Milady & Milady derivative NFTs and started trading memecoins.Following the development ZachXBT has urged victims to come forward and file reports with law enforcement, promising to share the personal details of the developer with any of the affected people via DM.Read how another crypto project faced exit scam allegations:Humanized AI Faces Exit Scam Accusations After Going DarkStay updated on why MEXC faces more controversy:Why MEXC Faces Yet More Controversy, This Time in Hong Kong

$200,000,000 To Be Handed Out in US State With Zero Strings Attached - If New Guaranteed Income Proposal Passes - The Daily Hodl


								A US state is advancing a bill that would allocate $200 million to give to residents with no strings attached.
Representative Athena Hollins co-authored bill HF 2666, which seeks to create a guaranteed income program in Minnesota.










The bill has already advanced through a House committee, reports Minnesota Public Radio.
If the bill passes, $100 million would be allocated this year with an additional $100 million in 2025 to fund the program.
All households living at or below 300% of the federal poverty level would be eligible to apply.
Depending on demand, each household is expected to receive $350 to $1,200 every 30 days for 12 to 24 months.
Hollins says she expects the program to significantly impact the lives of participants while also benefiting communities across the state.
“So we’ve seen across the country, the studies that have been done on this, it shows that people end up having better jobs. They have better mental health outcomes. Studies done with people with young children, their children have better performances on testing and in daycares. 
Just across the board, we see an increase in health, well-being, economic development across the board.
And then the reality is, that money also flows back into local communities. And so, that’s what we’re really trying to do, is make sure that the communities where this help is needed across the state get to have access to it, and then hopefully bolster those local communities.” 
Funding for the program would come from the state’s general fund.

Spot Ether ETF Approval Faces Delays Amid Financial Institutions' Strategy Gaps



                    
The anticipated green light for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might face delays beyond their final decision deadline in May. 



Robby Greenfield, CEO of Umoja, a smart money protocol, highlighted to Cointelegraph the challenges large financial institutions face due to a lack of a clear strategy towards these ETFs. 




He pointed out, “What makes it difficult for institutions to position themselves advantageously with Bitcoin, Ether and cryptocurrencies generally is that they can’t facilitate the same market manipulating functions as with previous commodities. 



“You can’t create paper Bitcoin like you can create paper gold.” Several prominent firms, including BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, are in the race to launch an Ether ETF.



Despite these efforts, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart anticipates a rejection of the current Ether ETF applications in late May, referencing a March 19 post on X. 




This expectation follows the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent postponement of its decision on the Hashdex and ARK 21Shares spot Ether ETFs, with a final verdict due by late May.



The unique challenges posed by the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies like Ether complicate the development of institutional strategies for ETFs, though Greenfield believes approval is inevitable.

He asserts, “Whether it gets approved in May or in December, it’s inevitable… I wouldn’t understand why it wouldn’t be approved, particularly given that even the SEC’s perspective on Ether has been increasingly one of it being a commodity rather than a security.” 



The SEC has set specific deadlines for the decision on applications from various companies, ranging from May 23 to August 7.



Moreover, the hesitance of large institutional players to dive into decentralized finance (DeFi) stems from infrastructure inadequacies, which also deter traditional retail investor participation. 



Greenfield emphasizes the need for more accessible investment strategies and infrastructure to bridge this gap, especially for retail investors who, despite owning a significant portion of global assets under management, face limited wealth creation opportunities. 



To this end, Umoja has raised an additional $2 million, bringing its total seed funding to $4 million, aiming to democratize access to asset management strategies. 



Greenfield underscores the importance of catering to retail investors, who are projected to hold a larger share of global assets in the coming years, according to World Economic Forum estimates.

Pakistani university launches country’s first metaverse-based classes

Information Technology University of Lahore in Pakistan has launched the nation’s first virtual reality-based classes in the metaverse.The new courses will imitate the traditional classroom experience via virtual reality headsets and motion tracking, according to a report from local Pakistani news outlet Samaa. Per the report, ITU Lahore’s head of the computer sciences department, Ibrahim Ghaznavi, said ITU expects the initiative to improve the academic abilities of students participating in the metaverse experience. Online courses began at the university in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the shift to metaverse technology comes as virtual reality applications for education have begun to find their footing throughout the globe. Related: Metaverse for education: How virtual reality can help schools and collegesThe ITU Lahore program was reportedly developed in partnership with support from the University of Denmark. It may also take inspiration from the university’s spiritual alma mater, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ITU Lahore was founded in 2012 with the stated intention of emulating MIT’s success in the field of technology and engineering. It has various partnerships with other noteworthy universities and corporations, including Harvard and IBM. While the past decade has seen the rise of virtual, mixed and augmented reality headsets and support technologies, much of the early excitement surrounding the start of the metaverse era was dedicated to the gaming sector. Unfortunately, as several aggregators such as Steam player counts and Oculus sales figures indicate, the metaverse hasn’t gripped gamers in quite the same way as the creatio of other transformative gaming technologies such as handheld consoles and cloud computing have. However, recent analysis shows that the metaverse for industry, medicine, education and marketing is heating up, with many applications finding their way into consumer headsets and browsers. Tim Berners-Lee, the person largely credited with creating the World Wide Web, recently predicted that spatial computing — displaying and operating computer applications in three-dimensional, augmented reality — was the future of the Web. “You can go do things with a VR headset, and then when you take the VR headset off, you could do it with a huge screen,” Berners-Lee told CNBC in an interview, adding that multimodal support would be key to adoption. “Whenever you move, you can grab your phone and the experience will be as one. It should very smoothly go between different devices.”

Bitcoin Troubles Far From Over As More Carnage Looms, JPMorgan Analysts


                            Despite optimism about Bitcoin’s future trajectory heading into the Bitcoin Halving, analysts at JPMorgan have raised concerns that things may not go according to everyone’s expectations. They believe that a storm still lies ahead for the flagship crypto token before any massive move to the upside. 
Further Bitcoin Pullbacks Are To Be Expected
According to a Bloomberg report, JPMorgan strategists have warned that Bitcoin could still experience further pullbacks following its recent decline. They alluded to the recent net outflows recorded by the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which underscored the current bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

These strategists, led by Nikolaos Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, also highlighted the sustained open interest in CME Bitcoin futures as another bearish signal for Bitcoin’s price. They further argue that Bitcoin “still looks overbought” and expect further price dips leading up to the Halving event in mid-April. 
Meanwhile, these JPMorgan analysts emphasized the decline in net inflows into Spot ETFs, noting that this proves that a sustained one-way net inflow is not possible. Therefore, they expect investors in these funds to keep taking profits heading into the Bitcoin Halving. This wave of profit-taking is also more likely, considering that Bitcoin “still looks overbought despite the past week’s correction.” they claimed. 
This recent research note by JPMorgan further reaffirms their bearish sentiment towards Bitcoin’s price despite the flagship crypto exceeding expectations. Last month, the bank predicted that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $42,000 after April as “Bitcoin-halving-induced euphoria subsides.”
Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, also echoed JPMoragn’s sentiments when he suggested that Bitcoin’s recent rally didn’t show enough strength. Aslam believes Bitcoin could fall below $50,000 if the Halving event “fails to really keep the momentum going.”
What Could Happen After The Halving Event
Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital recently provided insights into what could happen after the Havling event while elaborating on the four phases of Bitcoin Halving. According to him, there is usually a re-accumulation period after the Halving, which could last for up to five months. 

During this period, he noted that many investors get “shaken out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving.” Rekt Capital added that this time could be different since it is the first time this re-accumulation could develop around the new all-time high (ATH) area. 
Therefore, he believes this “Re-Accumulation Range may simply take the shape of a regular sideways range and may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation.”

Google integrates Ethereum Name Service data for search - Crypto Briefing




Multinational tech firm Google appears to have integrated the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for the results on its search engine. The crypto address data appears to be sourced from Etherscan, an Ethereum block explorer.An initial investigation conducted by crypto news and research platform CryptoSlate confirmed the integration. According to the tests done, several ENS addresses, including Vitalik.eth, which belongs to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.The search results displayed address details such as the Ethereum balance and the timestamp of the last transaction, with data collected from Etherscan.At the time of writing, no official statement from ENS has been published, although Brantly Millegan, a former member of the ENS development team, shared his discovery of the integration on X.Google has been involved in crypto for some time now. A previous update from Google enabled users to check Ethereum address balances directly through the search engine. During the days leading to the Ethereum Merge event in September 2022, a countdown timer was uploaded by Google to help track the update whenever a user searches for “Ethereum” or “Ethereum Merge”Despite Google’s previous forays into crypto, it includes significant investments in crypto firms such as Dapper Labs through GV (Google Ventures), its financial arm. According to data from CryptoRank, GV also has investments in Web3 platform and BAYC creator Yuga Labs, decentralized wireless network Helium, and Bitcoin infrastructure provider Voltage, among others. With these incursions into crypto, Google also revised its advertising policy for crypto late last year to include “Cryptocurrency Coin Trusts,” allowing investors to trade shares in trusts holding digital assets. As a result, Bitcoin ETF products from prominent asset managers like BlackRock now appear in search results for related queries.News of the Google ENS feature has positively impacted the ENS token, which gained around 6% in the 24 hours following the announcement, trading at $21.56 at the time of writing. The ENS project has recently achieved significant milestones, including becoming fully decentralized and securing a partnership with domain registrar GoDaddy to link traditional DNS with Ethereum names.

Whale Activity Backs Dogecoin's (DOGE) Surge Above $0.16: Data


																Dogecoin has emerged as one of the top-performing assets amidst market recovery from significant volatility last weekend. Trading at $0.164, the eighth-largest crypto by market capitalization, has extended its monthly gains to nearly 96%.
Coinciding with this surge, the number of transactions by DOGE whales has hit a new milestone.
Dogecoin Whales Make a Splash
Amidst renewed market activity, Dogecoin’s whale activity appears to be soaring, with transactions exceeding $1 million, increasing by more than 600% in the past month alone.
According to IntoTheBlock’s latest analysis, this spike not only indicated unprecedented growth but also marked the highest number of Dogecoin millionaire transactions since the OG meme coin topped in May of 2021, essentially heightened engagement from large investors despite market fluctuations.






While the broader market started on a relatively flat note on Friday, Dogecoin amassed almost 5% in gains over the past day. Several factors are at play.
For one, Coinbase Derivatives, the derivatives division of the American crypto exchange Coinbase, has revealed intentions to introduce cash-settled futures contract offerings for Dogecoin, in addition to Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, by April 1.
“Coinbase Derivatives will launch the first leveraged and CFTC-regulated futures contracts for Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, and Litecoin in April!”
The timing of this announcement aligns with yet another revelation from X Payments LLC – the financial branch of X (formerly Twitter) – with reports indicating that it had secured additional licenses to facilitate payment functionalities on the social media platform spearheaded by Elon Musk.
Musk, who is also known for being a vocal proponent of Dogecoin, has hinted at potential integrations with its blockchain as early as 2022.
Dogecoin’s Surging Open Interest
Data from CoinGlass revealed that Dogecoin’s Open Interest (OI) was hovering above $1.30 billion as of March 22nd. Its OI hit a new peak of $1.4 billion earlier this month when the meme coin itself was trading well over 70% down from its ATH value witnessed during the previous bull run.
If the bullish momentum continues, Dogecoin could soon break into a fresh high.

Kenya Reiterates Worldcoin Ban Despite U.S. Govt Intervention - DailyCoin


        
Worldcoin will remain suspended in Kenya.



The project was suspended last year.



A powerful nation has tried to intervene to have the suspension lifted.
Kenya remains unmoved by a push by the U.S. government to lift the suspension of Worldcoin operations in the country, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki said in Parliament.Worldcoin ran into trouble with Kenyan authorities last year after observers expressed worries that sensitive data gathered from scanning a person’s iris might be targeted by the wrong people. The project had reportedly collected data from over 350,000 Kenyans before it was suspended on August 2.Kenya Takes a Firm Position Against WorldcoinAccording to a local media report, Prof Kindiki told the National Assembly’s committee on Public Petitions that Kenya has been under pressure from the U.S. government to lift the suspension it imposed on Worldcoin operations.“They (US) think that they (WorldCoin) still have a case to set up their activities here. We have remained adamant and the decision we took will remain,” Kindiki said.When Kindiki issued a statement suspending Worldcoin’s operations last year, the minister revealed that relevant security, financial, and protection agencies had commenced inquiries and investigations into the project’s legality and authenticity.In his latest address, the minister said the suspension will remain in place until the relevant agencies are assured of the safety and integrity of Worldcoin’s activities.Besides the hurdle in parliament, Worldcoin faces a lawsuit filed at the High Court of Kenya by the office of the Data Commissioner, seeking the preservation of user information collected by the project in the country between April 19 and August 8 last year.Read about Worldcoin’s plan to upgrade its iris scanning devices:Worldcoin CEO Teases New Orb Upgrade Despite Privacy ConcernsStay updated on Worldcoin’s WLD rally last month:This Is Why Worldcoin Is up 200% in 7 Days

BlockDAG presale hits $6.8 million, Maker retraces recent gains and Starknet makes a splash - CoinJournal



                    

                    
BlockDAG has impressed analysts with a $6.8 million presale
The Maker token (MKR) has fallen off its recent $3.3k high to test support levels at $2.7k
Starknet has had a promising first month of trading

A growing number of crypto enthusiasts are making comparisons between the new BlockDAG coin and established tokens like Maker (MKR) and Starknet (STRK). The focus is on how BlockDAG‘s advanced technology potentially reshapes banking, setting a new benchmark in the industry and challenging the traditional frameworks.
Maker (MKR) Price Dynamics
The Maker token (MKR) has recently seen a whirlwind of activity with its price experiencing substantial volatility. The MKR price soared to a yearly high of $3.3k, subsequently retracting to $2.7k. This fluctuation reflects market sentiment and strategic movements within the ecosystem, with significant entities and whales capitalising on these shifts.
The Maker (MKR) price oscillations are more than mere numbers but signify the continuous recalibration of investor trust and strategy, painting a broader picture of the crypto environment’s fluidity.
Starknet’s Market Entry
Entering the crypto scene with a splash, Starknet (STRK) has navigated its inaugural market month with a modest 1.2% gain, an introduction marred slightly by a subsequent 1.6% dip. This initial performance tableau is painted against a high-expectations backdrop and market speculations, influenced heavily by a substantial STRK token airdrop.
Starknet crypto news frequently highlights this balance of anticipation and reality, sketching a portrait of a platform at its nascent stage yet brimming with potential. The Starknet crypto news marks its value oscillations and mirrors the broader narrative of Layer 2 blockchain technologies.

The Revolutionary BlockDAG Network
BlockDAG has big, bold ambitions, aiming to revolutionise industry standards by leveraging blockchain’s power for a spectrum of services, from logistics to digital identity verification. With a strategic launch that has already garnered $6.8 million from its third presale batch and sold over 3817 miners, some analysts believe BlockDAG could be on a fast track to achieving a top-50 spot in Coin Market Cap, underpinned by its robust liquidity goal of $100 million at launch.
BlockDAG leads innovation in cryptocurrency with its new BlockDAG Payment Card, providing users with a secure and easy way to handle transactions globally. This card integrates flawlessly into the BlockDAG ecosystem, empowering users to utilise their cryptocurrencies for everyday efficient transactions. It supports an array of digital currencies, including major ones like Ethereum and Bitcoin, enabling the swift conversion of cryptocurrencies into fiat at competitively low exchange rates.
The card’s versatility extends to a wide range of transactions, facilitating everything from online purchases to ATM withdrawals, all while ensuring users have access to the latest exchange rates, promoting transparency and trust in every transaction.
The strategic foresight is aimed at building a foundation of trust and stability for its community and investors, positioning BlockDAG as the emerging cryptocurrency to pay attention to. The platform’s comprehensive strategy and innovative payment solution place it in a prime position to redefine financial transactions and offer an efficient investment opportunity.
Wrapping Up
BlockDAG distinguishes itself as a frontrunner, with the potential to redefine the financial ecosystem, even as dynamics around the Maker (MKR) price and updates from Starknet crypto news capture traditional market interest. The insights reveal BlockDAG’s potential to innovate beyond the conventional, challenging the status quo upheld by Maker’s fluctuating prices and Starknet’s developments. Choosing BlockDAG means stepping into a modern financial future powered by blockchain, raising the bar for our interactions with digital currencies.

                        CryptoPunks non-fungible token (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain saw a record-breaking sale of one of its nine Alien Punks.On Wednesday, an anonymous collector purchased CryptoPunks #7804 for 4,850 ETH, or $16.38 million.This marks the second-largest CryptoPunks sale, both in terms of ETH and USD value, according to CryptoSlam data. The first most expensive CryptoPunks #5822 NFT sale took place in February 2022, valued at 8,000 ETH worth $23.7 million.Additionally, the recent sale surpassed Punk NFT #3100, which was sold early this month set at a value of 4,500 ETH or $16 million.The seller of CryptoPunks #7804 wrote on X (Twitter) that he bought the NFT in 2021 for 4,200 ETH, equivalent to $7.57 million at that time. The person has been searching for a potential buyer for over an year.Under the pseudonym Peruggia, the seller wrote on X that the sale marks “End of an era”.“I’ve long since felt like an imposter. Holding punks, and potentially NFTs a whole hostage by not elevating 7804 in the way he deserves.”Cryptopunks was launched in June 2017 by the Larva Labs studio. The most expensive NFT sale is affiliated to Beeple’s digital artwork collage titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” auctioned for a staggering $69.3 million in March 2021 by Christie’s.Is the NFT Hype Back?
NFT environment has been bleak for the past few years, however, the sale of the CryptoPunk #7804 NFT marks the beginning of an NFT revival.Per data from Statista, NFT sales volumes in 2023 were well below 2022 and 2021 numbers. However, it noted that revenue in the NFT market is projected to reach US$2,378 million in 2024.“In the NFT market, the number of users is expected to amount to 16.35m users by 2028,” the data noted.Though the market has been volatile, this recent sale could inspire investors to take another look at the NFT market. Further, it could also inspire creators to begin pumping out new projects, which eventually would make a resurgence overall.

Anglo-Italian company claims major breakthrough in Bitcoin mining


The world of Bitcoin (BTC) mining is a race against time and inefficiency. Miners dedicate huge computing power to solve complex mathematical puzzles, securing the network in the process. 
Enter Quantum Blockchain Technologies (QBT), an Anglo-Italian company, with a story that could rewrite the narrative of Bitcoin mining.
Their secret weapon
Method C represents a revolutionary approach that leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. 


Unlike traditional methods, which resemble a brute-force attack on a digital lock, Method C aims to be more elegant. It utilizes an AI oracle technology, to predict the outcome of these computations. 
The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining has been a major point of contention. A 30% reduction in computations would translate to a substantial decrease in the overall energy footprint of the network. 
For miners themselves, Method C presents the enticing prospect of lower operational costs and potentially higher profits.
From theory to reality
However, the path forward isn’t without its challenges. While the theoretical framework for Method C is solid, integrating the AI solution with existing mining rigs requires careful consideration. 
It’s akin to fitting a high-tech fingerprint scanner onto a traditional lock – a complex feat that demands seamless integration.
Despite these obstacles, QBT remains confident. The company plans to demonstrate Method C’s viability by integrating it with prototype chips and existing patent applications. 
Conversations with leading mining rig makers are happening, aiming to demonstrate real-world performance improvements.
Key milestones on the horizon
The coming months will be a period of intense prediction for QBT. 
The successful application of their Methods A and B (details yet to be revealed), alongside live comparisons demonstrating Method C’s efficiency gains, will be key milestones to observe. 
If QBT can bridge the gap between theory and practice, they have the potential to guide in a new era of sustainable, efficient, and more intelligent Bitcoin mining. 
This isn’t just a story about tech; it’s a story about innovation with the potential to reshape the future of cryptocurrency.

Exclusive Interview: Kevin Lee, CEO Gate.HK Uncovers Insights on Market Sentiment, Token Listings, and Regulatory Challenges | Cryptopolitan

In this exclusive interview, we talk to Gate.HK’s CEO Kevin Lee. Gate.HK is a leading cryptocurrency exchange with its headquarters in Hong Kong. The exchange has a diverse range of cryptocurrencies and provides its users with a secure and efficient trading environment.BackgroundHi Kevin, please introduce yourself and share your role at Gate.HKHi there! I’m Kevin; I serve as the CEO of Gate.HK, a pivotal role that allows me to merge my 18 years of diverse experience across traditional finance and the crypto industry to steer our ambitious project, aiming to obtain regulatory licenses in Hong Kong and expand the business in the city. My journey through the financial landscape has equipped me with a rich blend of insights and expertise, which I now channel into leading Gate.HK. The strategic acquisition of regulatory licenses with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is at the core of my responsibilities. This critical aspect of my role ensures that our operations meet and exceed the stringent compliance standards set forth by regulatory bodies, safeguarding our platform’s integrity and users’ trust. This focus on regulatory excellence allows us to provide secure, efficient, and innovative trading experiences that comply with global standards. Equally important to my role is cultivating a strong, vibrant community both locally and internationally. I am deeply committed to building meaningful connections with industry peers and our users, fostering an ecosystem where collaboration, support, and shared growth are at the forefront. Through open dialogues, community initiatives, and constant engagement, we aim to empower our users and stakeholders, making them an integral part of our financial inclusivity and innovation journey. As the CEO of Gate.HK, what aspects of the project are you most passionate about? As the CEO of Gate.HK, my enthusiasm for our project is deeply rooted in the remarkable and unique journey we’re embarked on. This adventure is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as we are at the forefront of a brand-new industry growing exponentially. The chance to contribute to the success and integration of cryptocurrency within the broader financial ecosystem is not just exciting; it’s a privilege that fuels my dedication every day. What makes this journey uniquely thrilling is the blend of pioneering a “zero-to-one” venture while simultaneously drawing upon the substantial resources and reputation of the Gate Group. Starting Gate.HK, from scratch just about a year ago, presented its own set of challenges and opportunities. Yet, the process has been significantly empowered by the immense support and resources provided by the Group. This unique advantage has enabled us to navigate the complexities of establishing a new entity in the rapidly evolving crypto space with confidence and strategic insight.Furthermore, the encouragement and collaboration we have received from our business partners and counterparts have been extraordinary. Their recognition of the long-established Gate brand name and willingness to support our vision and growth have been instrumental in our early successes. Our partners’ collective enthusiasm validates our efforts and propels us forward with a sense of shared purpose and optimism. Market Sentiment How would you describe the current market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong and globally? In Hong Kong, the sentiment towards cryptocurrencies is distinctly positive, reflecting the broader supportive stance of the government towards the Web3 industry with a promising top-down approach. The city’s authorities, including the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Customs and Excise Department, and the Hong Kong Police Force, are not just individually acknowledging the importance of this burgeoning sector but are also making concerted efforts to establish and enforce a coherent and comprehensive regulatory framework. This unified approach is instrumental in nurturing a secure, innovative, and investor-friendly environment, positioning Hong Kong as a premier, all-round Web3 hub in Asia and globally. Globally, my outlook is cautiously optimistic. The recent upticks, seeing coins hit new all-time highs, have been a welcome change of pace following over 18 months of a prolonged crypto winter. However, this resurgence also attracts attention from those primarily interested in speculative investments. Given cryptocurrencies’ inherently dynamic and fluid nature, we must remain vigilant and ready for potentially shorter yet more volatile cycles compared to traditional financial markets. How does the market sentiment affect the operations and strategies of Gate.HK? Market sentiment plays a pivotal role in shaping the operations and strategies of Gate.HK. Our philosophy of maintaining a cautious stance during bull markets reflects a broader commitment to prioritizing security, compliance, and accessibility in our virtual asset trading platform, irrespective of prevailing market conditions. This approach ensures that Gate.HK remains resilient and adaptable, focusing on long-term sustainability rather than short-term gains. Investing in a secure and compliant platform provides a foundation of trust for our users, which is essential in both buoyant and challenging market environments. Cryptocurrency Listing Process at Gate.HKPlease walk us through the process of listing a new cryptocurrency on Gate.HK. What are the key factors you consider when listing a new coin?In listing a new coin on Gate.HK, we rigorously adhere to Hong Kong’s regulatory framework, focusing on key factors: the management team’s background, the token’s regulatory compliance, its market supply, demand, maturity, and liquidity, as well as its technical security features and utilities. Additionally, we assess market, legal, and governance risks alongside potential risks for money laundering and terrorist financing. While this thorough vetting process may result in a more curated selection of tokens than unregulated platforms, it underscores our commitment to user protection. We continuously engage with regulatory bodies to refine our listing criteria, ensuring a secure, compliant, and accessible trading environment for our users. Regulatory Outlook How do you see the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies evolving in Hong Kong? The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong is on a path of progressive evolution. The Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) approach, which involves leveraging and adopting the existing regulatory frameworks from the securities market for cryptocurrency trading, marks a pivotal step towards establishing a more comprehensive regulatory environment. This initial phase indicates the broader journey towards more detailed and complete regulations in the coming years. Given Hong Kong’s robust regulatory infrastructure for traditional financial markets, including derivatives trading, margin trading, borrowing and lending, and prime brokerage, there’s a strong foundation to build. The SFC is poised to explore extending these regulations to encompass more than just spot trading in the future. Gate.HK is proactively preparing for these potential regulatory expansions. We are committed to staying at the forefront of regulatory compliance, ensuring we can swiftly adapt to new regulations as they emerge. This preparation involves continuous engagement with regulatory developments, investing in our platform’s compliance capabilities, and maintaining a flexible operational model that can quickly respond to new regulatory requirements. By aligning our operations closely with the evolving regulatory framework, Gate.HK aims to ensure that we can offer corresponding compliant products without delay in time-to-market when broader regulations are introduced. This forward-looking approach not only positions us to integrate new regulatory changes seamlessly but also underscores our dedication to providing a secure, compliant, and innovative trading environment for our users, reinforcing our commitment to leadership and excellence in the burgeoning crypto market. Gate.HK Upcoming Features and ProjectionsWhat new features or services can users expect from Gate.HK in the near future? In the near future, Gate.HK users can look forward to a suite of new features and services designed to enhance their experience with depositing, withdrawing, storing, and trading virtual assets. Committed to our mission of being the “Gateway to Crypto,” we aim to ensure a seamless experience across our web platform, mobile app, and API access. Additionally, we will expand our offerings to include specialized services for our VIP clients through delegated OTC traders. These upcoming features are aligned with our mission to provide comprehensive access to the crypto market, reinforcing our commitment to user-centric innovation and ease of use. Beyond platform enhancements, Gate.HK is dedicated to building a strong community presence in Hong Kong. Through hosting various events and seminars throughout the year, we aim to offer valuable education on cryptocurrencies and foster a well-informed user base. Our commitment extends to local charity work, reflecting our vision to contribute positively to the community and establish a meaningful connection beyond the digital asset space. These initiatives differentiate Gate.HK from other exchanges and reinforces our role as a leader in promoting a more inclusive and educated cryptocurrency environment.

BlackRock clearly wants to take crypto seriously. Too bad it’s forever silly. - Blockworks


Ethereum, not even once.
BlackRock has learned the hard way just how silly “crypto” can be in comparison to Bitcoin.
Working with digital assets was a breeze when all BlackRock’s fund managers had to do was max bid bitcoin on Coinbase Pro on behalf of ETF shareholders.
But Larry Fink (or whomever else in charge of BlackRock’s crypto adventures) threw a spanner in the works when they opted to launch a $100-million money market fund that exists entirely on Ethereum.
It took only minutes for Crypto Twitter™ to name an Ethereum address tied to the fund, and even less time for the wallet to be drowned in low-quality memecoins and NFTs, most of which are valued at zero.
While there is indeed $100 million USDC in BlackRock’s suspected Ethereum wallet, which aligns with its SEC filing, there’s now more — 100 other cryptocurrencies, definitely not purchased by BlackRock, sitting alongside those stablecoins. There’s tokens like Jesus Coin, Cramer Coin, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, Lery Fenk and DERANGED, and also some more offensive stuff that likely won’t get past my editor (for good reason).
Altogether, the tokens with more than zero value contribute an additional $84,000 to the fund’s portfolio. NFTs like CryptoDickbutts and KaijuKingz and goblintown add another $5,000 in value. 
Think of those contributions as guerilla marketing spend for micro-cap crypto projects: BlackRock’s Etheruem address is destined to be watched like a hawk to see how it trades crypto markets. Etherscan then doubles as a billboard for all sorts of wacky clown shows.

It’s not as though BlackRock should feel special that it’s targeted for such financially nihilistic trolling. Practically every public figure in crypto gets the same treatment. 
Brian Armstrong’s Ethereum address contains nonsense like Unicorn Candy Coin and Make Trump President Again — tokens that he had no hand in acquiring himself. 
Vitalik Buterin’s most well-known wallet contains nearly 2,000 tokens, most of them worthless, as well as more than 67,000 NFTs thrown in his direction (although there is that whole shiba inu saga which culminated in Buterin burning and donating hundred of trillions of tokens sent in his direction, worth hundreds of millions of dollars).
Shitcoins mixed up with legitimate USDC aside, BlackRock’s boffins have now been forced to deal with novel legal headaches on account of their Ethereum endeavor.
One plucky prankster tainted BlackRock’s reported wallet with 1 ETH ($3,350) washed and sent through sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash.
Read more from our opinion section: Slerf investor or not, no one deserves to lose money in crypto
It’s been illegal for US citizens to interact with Tornado Cash since the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added the smart contract protocol to its blacklist in August 2022. The mixer made the blacklist on account of its suspected usage by North Korea-linked Lazarus Group to wash stolen crypto, often coming from high profile hacks like the $625 million Ronin bridge attack two years ago.
VIDEO

All this probably isn’t what Fink was thinking of when he was hyping tokenization
The string of deposits to those addresses directly from Tornado Cash is considered something of a political protest — both pointing out the absurdity of sanctioning a permissionless protocol and highlighting the impossibility of enforcing restrictions on fungible cryptocurrencies that may have at one point touched crypto mixers.
Is BlackRock now at risk of itself being sanctioned by OFAC for holding ether washed by an illegal protocol? It doesn’t take a law degree to figure out that’s highly unlikely.
Now, BlackRock presumably has accountants and legal departments combing through the legalities of holding CYBONK and harrypottertrumphomersimpson777inu, as well as ETH of dubious origin, all in the same wallet as proper investor funds.
Should’ve just stuck with bitcoin.
Updated Mar. 22, 2024 at 2:20 pm ET: An earlier version incorrectly stated it was possible to block incoming transactions from sanctioned addresses. That’s not possible.

Starknet Expands Airdrop Eligibility, Addressing Immutable X and ETH Staker Concerns



                    
The Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Starknet has expanded the eligibility for its first round of Starknet provisions, now including two sub-categories of users who initially encountered difficulties in claiming STRK tokens. 



This adjustment comes after the Starknet Foundation, the entity behind the Starknet network, resolved uncertainties about the eligibility of certain pre-Merge ETH stakers and Immutable X users for the Starknet (STRK) airdrop scheduled for February. 




Following a detailed evaluation, eligibility has been extended to include VeVe users, non-VeVe StarkEx users mistakenly identified as VeVe users, and pooled stakers.



According to a communication shared with Cointelegraph, the new group of users now eligible for the February airdrop will be able to start claiming their STRK tokens in April. Starknet discovered inaccuracies in a list from Immutable, which incorrectly categorized many Immutable X users as VeVe users. 



This list was crucial for distinguishing between users of the nonfungible token (NFT) platform VeVe, which manages its users’ private keys, and other users. 




As a result of correcting these inaccuracies, Immutable X users who executed eight or more transactions before June 1, 2022, are now entitled to claim their airdrop.



The conversation around airdrops for VeVe users is ongoing between Starknet and the VeVe team.

Additionally, pooled ETH stakers faced hurdles in receiving their STRK due to various complications with the staking protocols. 



However, some protocols have now provided Starknet with a list of users eligible for the airdrop, which will commence in April.



Starknet also revised its unlock schedule in February, following concerns that the original plan favored early investors at the expense of retail users, leading to a more equitable distribution plan over three years. 



This change followed criticism from Starknet users who felt excluded from the STRK airdrop despite significant transaction volumes, largely because they did not meet the requirement of holding at least 0.005 ETH as of November 15, 2023.



After the STRK airdrop on February 20, substantial sell-offs by large holders led to a dramatic 60% drop in the token’s value, from a peak of $4.40 to $1.90, within just over two days. 



The struggle to recover the price of STRK continues, with it currently trading at $1.88, according to the latest CoinGecko data.

Hacker Transfers $10M from 2023 Phishing Attack to Tornado Cash: CertiK


																Phishing scams have wreaked havoc in the digital asset ecosystem and are making a comeback amidst market-wide recovery.
These attacks have grown increasingly sophisticated, leading to high-profile crypto investors, whales, and prominent industry figures becoming victims, ultimately resulting in substantial financial losses.

In its latest update on March 21st, CertiK identified a deposit of 3,700 ETH into Tornado Cash on the Ethereum blockchain.
This transfer by the hacker, valued at over $10 million, raised eyebrows due to its link with a major phishing incident dating back to September 2023. The funds were pilfered from a crypto whale.
During this phishing attack, the whale in question lost a staggering $24 million worth of staked ETH on the liquid staking provider Rocket Pool.
The hack was executed through only two transactions, with 9,579 stETH stolen in one and 4,851 rETH in another. The value of the stolen assets amounted to $15.5 million in stETH and $8.5 million in rETH at the time of the breach.
Scam Sniffer’s investigation subsequently revealed that the whale unknowingly granted token approval to the fraudsters through the authorization of “increaseAllowance” transactions.
February saw a slight decrease in losses attributed to hacks, exploits, and scams. Phishing attacks, for instance, accounted for $14.6 million out of the total $160 million lost during the month. Fortunately, $6.4 million was recovered successfully.
Scam Sniffer’s February Phishing Report revealed that many victims of phishing attacks were tricked by scams through X (formerly Twitter). Fake comments from fraudulent X accounts led unsuspecting victims to malicious websites, where they were targeted by these schemes.
Earlier this year, an anonymous individual lost $4.2 million to a phishing attack that used a falsified ERC-20 permission signature.

Stocks in Focus: Lululemon, Nike, and Tesla Slump Amid Headwinds - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE: NKE), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) opened lower and are experiencing downward pressure on their stock prices today.



Lululemon’s decline is attributed to a slowdown in US store traffic and a weaker outlook, marking its most severe slump since the pandemic’s onset. Nike’s drop followed earnings announcements and broader market movements, reflecting adjustments in market expectations and reactions to corporate strategies and performance.



Tesla’s decline is linked to reduced electric vehicle production at its China factory, highlighting demand issues and competitive pressures in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle market.



LULU Stock Drops After Reports of Slowdown in Store Traffic



Lululemon Athletica Inc. experienced a significant drop in stock price, plummeting by $88.70 (−18.52%) at the time of writing. The substantial decline is attributed to reports of a slowdown in US store traffic and a weaker outlook for the company. This marks the most severe slump for Lululemon since the onset of the pandemic, raising concerns among investors about the company’s growth prospects and ability to navigate the challenging retail landscape.





Nike Stock (NKE) Dips Along with LULU



NIKE, Inc. also faced a notable decline, with its stock price falling by $8.25 (−8.18%) at the time of writing. The drop followed the company’s earnings announcements and was part of broader market movements, where Nike was mentioned alongside Lululemon for experiencing a dip in post-earnings announcements. The stock movement reflects adjustments in market expectations and reactions to the company’s corporate strategies and performance as investors reassess Nike’s position in the highly competitive athletic apparel and footwear industry.



Tesla Dips on China Numbers



Tesla, Inc. saw a more modest decline, with its stock price falling by $3.16 (−1.83%) at the time of writing. The movement is linked to reports of reduced production of electric vehicles at the company’s China factory, highlighting the challenges Tesla faces regarding demand issues and competitive pressures in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle market. The adjustment has put the company’s shares under pressure as investors closely monitor Tesla’s ability to maintain its market share and profitability in the face of increasing competition.







Do you see Tesla making a comeback in 2024? Let us know in the comments below.

Bots are front-running bots front-running Base meme coins


Bots are front-running other bots in the hopes of front-running meme coin traders. Welcome to the degenerate world of Ethereum layer 2 tokens.
Posting to X (formerly Twitter), meme coin trader GK screenshotted four examples of traders building bots to front-run other meme coin traders’ bots.
Specifically, a bot is executing an identical sequence of layer 2 blockchain actions across various meme coins on Base, the Coinbase-operated layer 2 atop Ethereum’s layer 1 blockchain. (A layer 2 is a more centralized version of a regular, layer 1 blockchain.)

Front-running meme coins
This clever actor deposits a small amount of capital into a liquidity pool for trading newly-launched meme coins. It then waits for so-called ‘launch bots’ to detect its small liquidity deposit. 
Because these launch bots believe that a new coin has launched and is gaining attention, by virtue of its recent minting and liquidity events, the launch bot adds additional liquidity. Its owner thinks that this is a clever strategy — joining in early to possibly the next memetic rally.
The front-runner then sells into their additional liquidity, effectively front-running their attempt to front-run.
Degenerate meme coin traders
A number of targets of this type of attack have included variations on asdfasdf, Internet slang for ‘bored,’ ‘filler text,’ or ‘nothing.’ To GK, naming these tokens with ticker symbols of careless convenience — i.e. whichever lefthand keyboard characters were most readily available — indicated an embrace of degenerate trading. For a while, it worked.
Most meme coins are simply jokes and their most important attribute is usually a mascot. 
Meme coin traders embrace their own degeneracy. Its shorthand, degen, has become a crypto community membership title of endearment. Coinbase and the Bored Ape Yacht Club once planned to film three movies entitled ‘Degen Trilogy.’
Apparently, the strategy of front-running front-runners works well on Base. It might also work well on other fast, cheap blockchains. The ‘front-run the front-runners’ strategy is straightforward.

First, thanks to Base’s fast, cheap operation, low-effort creation of altcoins is easy. This allows anyone to copy a smart contract, tweak a few parameters like ticker symbol or supply, and create their own meme coin in seconds.
Second, at least while meme coins are a hot category, Base is still popular enough to attract front-running ‘launch bots.’ These launch bots scan blockchains and their layer 2s for signs of promising meme coin launches — including, to their peril, fake meme coin launches with honeypot liquidity.
Finally, after the front-running bot has rug-pulled the launch bot, a few retail traders might still occasionally buy after both bots have traded, providing a final source of exit liquidity via a long-term rally.

Front-running, like MEV, is a perennial tax on retail traders
Although GK highlighted just one front-running campaign aiming to profit approximately 0.2 ETH per token, there are endless variations of systematic exploitation of crypto token offerings. 
Coinbase, for its part, promotes Base as a low-cost and developer-friendly layer 2 solution for Ethereum. It aims to turn Base into a decentralized ecosystem, though naturally, it has prioritized Coinbase products to date.

Read more: Bored Apes puts the ‘shit’ in shitcoin
Eventually, the operators of meme coin launch bots will stop trading after they realize that even more sophisticated front-runners are front-running their attempts at front-running.
As always, when there are degenerate retail dollars up for grabs, more sophisticated traders quickly learn how to master those markets. This week, a Base trader minted low-effort meme coins, deposited a small amount of liquidity, and then rug-pulled after launch bots took the bait. Several crypto market observers found it amusing to watch.

Justin Sun affiliated TrueUSD market cap collapses 50% in 7 days


TrueUSD, the dollar-pegged stablecoin affiliated with Justin Sun, has seen its market cap collapse more than 50% from $1.29 billion on March 15 to $615 million on March 22, according to data from CoinMarketCap. 
This mass redemption of TrueUSD follows Binance’s delisting of several TrueUSD pairs on March 15. TrueUSD spent much of February struggling to maintain its peg, falling as low as $0.95.
TrueUSD’s market cap has collapsed from $1.29 billion to $615 million during March.
A review of the attestations provided by TrueUSD also seem to show that it no longer has United States treasury bills in its reserves. The remaining funds are split between approximately $200 million held “at a Hong Kong depository institution, a Swiss depository institution, and Bahamian depository institutions” and approximately $500 million held at First Digital Trust Limited.
First Digital Trust has also launched its own stablecoin, FDUSD, which has seen its own market cap fall from approximately $3 billion to $2.6 billion since March 15. Again, this is according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This contraction hasn’t affected the entire stablecoin market equally. Tether has seen its market cap grow by approximately $700 million since March 15.

ETF staking addition is ‘positive development,' says ETC Group exec

The addition of staking into spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications is a crucial milestone, according to an executive at the European investment firm ETC Group.The Ethereum staking aspect is important in the context of ETFs because it’s associated with the “difference between giving investors the price return or the total return of the asset,” ETC Group’s head of product Chanchal Samadder told Cointelegraph.According to Samadder, Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism and related network rewards make it conceptually very similar to dividends in equities. “But only shareholders who exercise their voting right are eligible to receive 'dividends,'” the exec noted, adding:“We view this as a positive development. Staking offers investors the complete economic benefits of Ethereum and leads to improved outcomes.”Despite ETC Group’s optimism about the staking addition, the approval of potential spot Ethereum ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains uncertain, according to Samadder. That is because taking products is associated with a high level of new risks and difficulty and requires enough knowledge about the Ethereum blockchain, he said.“If issuers lack deep familiarity with the technical aspects of the Ethereum protocol and do not have expertise in exchange-traded products (ETPs), it could potentially harm investor outcomes,” Samadder said.Spot Ethereum ETF filers have been rushing to amend their SEC applications to add staking recently.Financial services giant Fidelity filed a 19b-4 amendment with the SEC on March 18, seeking permission to stake a portion of the Ether ETH. If approved, Fidelity’s spot ETF would stake an undisclosed amount of its assets through one or more trusted staking providers.Related: 3 theories why the SEC may be eyeing down Ethereum: Crypto lawyerGrayscale Investments, the operator of the largest spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF by assets, proposed the addition of staking in its spot Ethereum ETF application on March 20. In a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC, Grayscale mentioned the ability of the fund to stake ETH through the trust in a PoS validation protocol among the four total proposed items.Samadder speculated that spot Ether ETF applicants didn’t add staking into their applications before due to staking complexity as well as too high tech and analysis requirements from the SEC.“It is very complex to structure a product and requires an extremely deep knowledge of Ethereum protocol, the mechanics of ETPs and the bridge between crypto and traditional capital market — this takes time.” He also suggested that there may have been a feeling that the SEC simply “wasn’t ready to properly analyze the risks associated with staking.”Magazine: Bitcoin ETFs make Coinbase a ‘honeypot’ for hackers and governments: Trezor CEO

DOGE is Setting Up For A New Upward Rally Following Recent Rebound - Coin Edition


							

Rekt Capital has spotted a developing uptrend on Dogecoin.



DOGE rebounded 24% to set up a potential upward movement.



Dogecoin is trading between $0.12 and $0.20 ahead of a confirming uptrend.




Rekt Capital, a crypto analyst on X, has spotted a developing uptrend on Dogecoin amid the current market conditions. In a recent post, the renowned analyst highlighted that DOGE has tagged the macro downtrend for a successful retest, rebounding 24%.







Explaining his analysis, Rekt Capital showed a reversal candle that formed on the DOGE/USDT weekly chart on TradingView. He revealed how the candle bounced off significant support around the $0.12650 level, reflecting a retest of that level ahead of resuming its uptrend.



Meanwhile, the analyst showed Dogecoin’s uptrend started in October 2023, when the memecoin bounced off support at $0.0574. However, the move boosted last February after DOGE surged past the $0.09617 region, changing the cryptocurrency’s sentiment into a bullish perspective. 



DOGE tested another significant resistance with the recent rally, reaching $0.20626, as highlighted by Rekt Capital. Pulling back from that level saw Dogecoin dropping by 40% before the current reversal spotted by the famous analyst.



From Rekt Capital’s plottings in the shared chart, Dogecoin has the potential to rally to $0.33825. With that, the memecoin would climb above the recent high at $0.20626 and overcome another significant resistance around $0.27817. 









Meanwhile, Dogecoin has overturned the losses incurred in 2023 and is already testing levels last reached in 2022. The flagship memecoin traded for $0.1644 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView. 



Rekt Capital’s recent post confirms his earlier prediction from last week when he spotted an initial retest after DOGE broke its macro downtrend. He thinks the memecoin is trading within a new macro range between $0.12 and $0.20 ahead of a confirming uptrend.

Reddit IPO could trigger a spike in demand for sub-Reddit memecoins MOON and BRICK, data suggests



                    

                    Key takeaways


Reddit’s stock ends trading at $50.44 per share, up by 48% on its market debut.


Sub-Reddit memecoins MOON and BRICK could rally higher on Reddit’s successful IPO. 


Reddit shares up by 48% on market debut
Social media platform Reddit finally debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company’s stock, with a ticker symbol RDDT, began trading on the NYSE on Thursday, March 21st.
By the end of the trading day, RDDT was up by 48% as investors took the opportunity to buy the company’s shares. 
Reddit attracted investors despite the company not turning an annual profit since launching in 2005. However, the company promises investors that its content will be the training ground for artificial intelligence (AI) programs.
The company also recently struck a data licensing deal with Google worth about $60 million a year. This move further convinced investors that Reddit could soon turn over its loss-making fortunes. 
With Reddit now a publicly traded company, RDDT could soon join other stocks CFDs at OANDA, making it easier for investors to take a position on the future trajectory of Reddit’s share price. 
Sub-Reddit memecoins MOON and BRICK could soar higher
With Reddit now a public company, data suggests that subreddit memecoins like MOON and BRICK could soar higher in the short term. r/CryptoCurrency Moons is one of the trending coins in the crypto market.
MOON is down by 20% over the last 24 hours. However, it is up by 70% over the last seven days. The token is used to reward active users who contribute to the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit. This is one of the most active subreddits on the platform. In October, the r/CryptoCurrency community removed moderators accused of insider trading
Meanwhile, BRICK is also up by 109% in the last seven days despite losing 21% of its value in the past 24 hours. BRICK is used for rewarding active users who contribute to the r/Fortnite subreddit. 
With Reddit’s opening day a success, these memecoins could soar higher in the coming days and weeks. Reddit is known to be home to meme investors. One notable event on Reddit was when a group of retail investors collaborated on the “wallstreetbets” subreddit to pump the shares of game retailer GameStop (GME.N). 
Reddit’s successful IPO could see investors buy more MOON and BRICK tokens, pushing the memecoins prices higher.  Despite the ongoing market correction, MOON and BRICK have shown bullish momentum in recent days.

This Bitcoin Halving May Not Result In Supply Squeeze: Glassnode


                            Glassnode has suggested that the upcoming Bitcoin halving might not result in a supply squeeze that the market may have anticipated.
Bitcoin Halving May Not Carry Same Impact Due To Spot ETFs
In a new report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed the impact the next Bitcoin halving may have on the economics of the cryptocurrency.
The “halving” is a periodic event for BTC where its block rewards (the rewards the miners receive for adding blocks on the network) are permanently cut in half.

This event is built into the coin’s code, meaning it happens automatically. The halving kicks in after every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years.
The next such event will take place sometime in the coming month. Historically, the halving has been considered an important event for the asset due to how it influences its supply dynamics.
The block rewards the miners receive are the only way to introduce new BTC tokens into circulation. Since they get tightened during these events, the cryptocurrency’s production rate slows down following them.
As such, halvings are considered bullish events, with the price increasing following them due to the constrained supply, as supply-demand dynamics would dictate.
“However, the current market conditions differ from historical norms,” says Glassnode. The reason behind that is simple; there is something now that was never there in the past: the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that buy and hold Bitcoin and allow their users to gain indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price action through them. Since the spot ETFs are available on traditional exchanges, they can be preferable for those not looking to dabble with digital asset platforms and wallets.
Thus, the ETFs have introduced a notable amount of fresh demand for the asset, with supply rapidly leaving the market and entering these funds. To put this demand into perspective, the analytics firm has compared it against the BTC amount miners issue on the chain daily.

As the above chart shows, the Bitcoin ETF flows have generally been much higher than what the miners have been introducing into circulation. Based on this, Glassnode believes “the upcoming halving might not result in the supply squeeze once anticipated.”

The report further says:
The ETFs are, in essence, preempting the halving’s impact by already tightening the available supply through their substantial and continuous buying activity. In other words, the supply squeeze usually expected from halvings may already be in effect due to ETFs’ large-scale bitcoin acquisitions.
Something to note, however, is that the ETFs aren’t certain to always be a bullish influence for the market. Should the current inflow-heavy regime flip to one dominated by outflows, the cryptocurrency could naturally witness extraordinary selling pressure.
In fact, the spot ETF netflows have been negative for Bitcoin for four straight days now, so such a trend shift may already be in action.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had recovered beyond the $68,000 level yesterday, but the coin has since declined again, falling back towards $64,200.

Ripple CEO - 'SEC will lose to Ethereum, just like it did to XRP' - AMBCrypto



The legal battle between SEC and Ripple seems to have certain remedies after almost 4 years. 
Ripple’s XRP has recorded a bullish sentiment over the last 24 hours.

Since 2020, Ripple [XRP] and the United States Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been in a continuous legal battle. At present the longstanding conflict has come to a common point with certain remedies which are yet not the final solution of the case. 
Remarking on the same, James K. Filan, a defense lawyer revealed, 
“#XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The parties have filed a joint sealing proposal “to govern sealing issues relating to the upcoming remedies-related briefing to be filed in this case.”
How is this affecting XRP’s price movement? 
The proposal was submitted to Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York, U.S. District Court, on the 19th of March. If accepted, sensitive details like Ripple’s finances and XRP sales would remain undisclosed, potentially affecting market sentiment. 
Criticising SEC’s stand, CEO of Ripple Labs Brad Garlinghouse, added, 
“The SEC picked fights with the industry and is losing badly in the Courts. They’re now fighting fellow regulators like the CFTC, and falling behind international counterparts. At what point will the SEC realize they will lose the war against ETH just as they lost against XRP?” 
Seeing the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory aspect of Ripple’s XRP, the market still seems to be on an upward trajectory highlighting positive sentiment among XRP supporters. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.6214 with a 1.2% hike over the last week. 
Will XRP still top the altcoin charts? 
Additionally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving is yet another factor that has garnered attention from investors and enthusiasts for XRP. 
Monica Long, Ripple’s president, recently emphasized the significance of 2024 in the institutionalization of cryptocurrencies. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), she highlighted,
“2024 is quickly shaping up to be the year of crypto institutionalization on a macro scale (tho worth noting that several TradFi companies launched crypto access, tokenization products, etc. in previous bear markets).”
This highlights Ripple’s ongoing efforts to bridge traditional finance and the crypto space for broader adoption and innovation. Hence, despite various speculations and the ongoing legal battle, Ripple (XRP) remains one of the top contenders in the altcoin market.

Investor Dan Tapiero Says Bitcoin Bull Market in Third Inning, Predicts 200% BTC Rally - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								Macro investor and fund manager Dan Tapiero believes the bull market cycle for Bitcoin (BTC) is still in its early stages.
The CEO of investment firm 10T Holdings tells his 114,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could soar 3x from its current value in the next year or two.










“Conservative again on BTC price. A mere 3x over next 12-24 months. Bull market just in its third inning now.” 
Since there are nine innings in a baseball game, he suggests Bitcoin’s upward momentum will continue for a while. He also says there may be price volatility, but investors should “hold on for dear life” (HODL), a term used to encourage crypto investors not to sell when prices dip.
“Third inning of this Bitcoin bull market…at least 12-24 months to go in this up-cycle. Ignore short term wiggles. It’s hodl season.”
Last month, the investor said Bitcoin’s bull market was in the second inning.
“I think we’re in the second inning of this bull market, so I’d be much more concerned and think that there [could be] problems potentially if I felt we were in the seventh inning, the eighth inning. The bullish consensus at 75%-80% – I mean that’s an issue but maybe [it] just means you have a short-term correction. We’re just getting started here.” 
The investor previously said  Bitcoin could soar to somewhere between $150,000 and $200,000 this year. And while he thinks there will be short-term Bitcoin corrections this cycle, he doesn’t envision Bitcoin ever dipping down to the $20,000 level.
“If you’re saying do I think we’re going to go back down to the $20,000, $18,000 lows in Bitcoin, I don’t see it at all.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $63,665 at time of writing, down more than 4% in the last 24 hours.

Class Action Suit Against Silvergate Bank Over FTX Fraud Allegations Moves Forward After Judge's Ruling


                        
                            Class Action Suit Against Silvergate Bank Over FTX Fraud Allegations Moves Forward After Judge’s Ruling

                        FTX users are suing the now-defunct Silvergate by claiming it abetted FTX and its affiliated trading firm Alameda Research to commit a historic fraud.According to the customers launching the suit, FTX knowingly transferred customer money into Alameda Research. FTX is currently on trial for numerous offences related to fraud and money laundering charges.Central to the case is the allegation that FTX illegally wired Alameda Research customer funds to cover the cracks in its balance sheet after the trading company made some risky crypto bets.On March 20, Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro of a San Diego federal court filed an order denying Silvergate’s motion to dismiss the case.Montenegro ruled that the customers had adequately presented a case for Silvergate knowing and participating in FRX’s fraud in their filing on March 19.“It was foreseeable that allowing FTX customer funds to be deposited into non-FTX accounts would lead to fraud and harm the owners of those funds,” said the order.The numbers ostensibly speak for themselves. According to the order, Silvergate’s annual income before taking on FTX as a client was $7.6 million. The bank’s post-FTX income was nearly ten times higher, at $75.5 million, through transaction fees and interest on money deposited in FTX and Alameda accounts.The court also ruled that Silvergate’s earlier assertion that it doesn’t owe a duty of care to FTX customers is incorrect. Silvergate’s argument rests on the fact that the bank was not directly responsible for the withdrawal freezes that spread panic when FTX began to collapse. The bank also argued that had it not dealt with FTX, the exchange would have found another bank, an assertion that the judge labeled called “highly speculative” because Silvergate “one of few banks willing to service the crypto industry.”Like Silvergate: 3AC Also Denies Wrongdoing
Another company at the heart of 2022’s industry-wide recession, dubbed “crypto winter”, came under media scrutiny this week after its co-founder denied responsibility in the collapse.Kyle Davies, the founder of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) told his interviewer in the latest episode of Unchained that he feels he has nothing to apologise for. “Am I sorry for a company going bankrupt? No, like companies go bankrupt, almost every company goes bankrupt, right?” reasoned Davies, in response to criticisms that he had shown no remorse when his company failed. In May 2022, a huge crypto project called Terra collapsed when its dollar-pegged stablecoin UST slipped its peg and spiralled down to nothing. Terra sold UST on the promise that an algorithm could peg it to the greenback by burning $1 dollars worth of a sister token called LUNA to create it. In order to redeem it, holders burned UST for equivalent amounts of LUNA. The mechanism failed, however, after too many people exited UST at once, causing the algorithm to nosedive into a hyper-inflationary spiral. At the time when Terra collapsed, 3AC had $200 million to half a billion LUNA tokens. The industry-wide contagion from UST’s historic depegging is also considered a factor in FTX’s downfall.

Trezor's security breach was traced to a meticulous phishing operation, not SIM-Swap

Trezor, a leading manufacturer of crypto hardware wallets, has disclosed details regarding a recent security breach on its official social media account, X. The breach, initially suspected to be a SIM-swap attack, has now been confirmed as a sophisticated phishing incident by SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor. Trezor’s vigilance amidst adversityDespite the breach, reassures users that the security of its hardware wallets remains uncompromised.SatoshiLabs revealed that the breach occurred, with hackers gaining unauthorized access to the Trezor X account. Upon investigation, the company determined that the breach was the result of a meticulously planned phishing attack, rather than a SIM swap, as previously suspected. The attackers, posing as credible entities within the cryptocurrency community, engaged in convincing social media interactions and discussions to establish credibility.The attackers, under the guise of a legitimate cryptocurrency account, approached SatoshiLabs’ public relations team, suggesting an interview with the CEO. During subsequent communications, the attackers shared a malicious link disguised as a Calendly calendar invitation. Trezor’s swift response and ongoing security enhancementsAlthough suspicions were raised when a team member was prompted for login credentials, the attackers successfully linked their Calendly to Trezor’s X account during a rescheduled meeting.Upon discovering the breach, Trezor promptly identified and removed the fraudulent posts, minimizing potential damage. The company emphasized that while the breach affected its social media account, the security of its hardware wallets and other products remained intact.This incident follows a security breach in January, where Trezor inadvertently exposed the contact information of approximately 66,000 users.

March 2024 Smart Money - Why Investors are Choosing 'Black Account' Exchange Token Over Shiba Inu and Dogecoin | Cryptopolitan

As we step into March 2024, a noticeable shift in investment strategies within the cryptocurrency domain is becoming apparent. Smart money, the term often used to describe investments made by those with comprehensive knowledge of the market or insider information, is increasingly moving towards the ‘Black Account’ feature offered by Option2Trade (O2T), diverging from traditional favorites such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). This pivot reflects a broader trend of seeking higher value and more strategic investment platforms. Below, we delve into the reasons behind this shift, explore the unique benefits of the ‘Black Account’, and discuss its potential impact on the crypto market.The ‘Black Account’s’ appeal is not just in its innovative features but also in its promise of higher returns, which resonates with those previously invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). As such, the movement towards Option2Trade (O2T) and away from Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) reflects a strategic realignment of investment priorities, signaling a broader shift in the cryptocurrency landscape where utility and performance increasingly dictate investment choices.Reasons for the ShiftThe transition away from meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) towards more structured investment opportunities such as O2T’s ‘Black Account’ can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the increasing sophistication of the crypto market has prompted investors to seek platforms that offer more than just speculative value. Secondly, the allure of meme coins, while still significant, has been tempered by their volatility and the maturation of investors’ strategies seeking stable and sustainable growth. Benefits of the ‘Black Account’Option2Trade’s (O2T) ‘Black Account’ stands out for several reasons, primarily due to its focus on leveraging artificial intelligence to optimize trading strategies and the exclusive benefits it offers. These include:– Copy Trading Incentives: This feature rewards experienced traders with O2T tokens for sharing their successful trading strategies, allowing novices to replicate these strategies. It fosters a symbiotic ecosystem where all participants can benefit from shared knowledge and success.– Access to Premium Social Trading Features: The ‘Black Account’ offers unparalleled access to advanced trading tools, exclusive signals, and a premium community. This access is instrumental in providing traders with the insights needed to make informed decisions, surpassing the capabilities traditionally associated with meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).Impact on the Crypto MarketThe growing preference for O2T’s ‘Black Account’ over Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) is indicative of a larger shift within the cryptocurrency market towards platforms that offer tangible, strategic benefits. This shift is likely to influence the market in several ways:1. Increased Market Sophistication: As more investors opt for platforms that provide advanced trading tools and community support, we can expect an overall increase in market sophistication, leading to more stabilized and sustainable growth across the crypto ecosystem.2. Redefining Value: The preference for features like the ‘Black Account’ challenges the crypto community to reassess what constitutes value, moving beyond hype and speculation towards utility and strategic advantage.3. Innovation Drive: The success of the ‘Black Account’ feature could drive further innovation within the crypto space, encouraging platforms to develop new ways to engage users and enhance their investment potential.In conclusion, the shift towards Option2Trade’s (O2T) ‘Black Account’ by smart money in March 2024 is a testament to the evolving nature of cryptocurrency investments. As investors increasingly prioritize platforms that offer strategic advantages and sustainable growth potential, the appeal of meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) may wane. However, this trend also underscores the dynamic and innovative spirit of the crypto market, where new opportunities continually emerge, reshaping the landscape and setting new benchmarks for success.For more information on the Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T) Presale: Use promo code O2TLaunch to get 15% bonusVisit Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T)Join and become a community member: https://t.me/O2TOfficialhttps://twitter.com/Option2Trade (O2T)

Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Unveils Predictions For 2030 | Bitcoinist.com


								Founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson has boldly predicted a revolutionary advancement in the landscape of computational power. His forecast anticipates a remarkable leap forward in machine learning capabilities in the next few years.
Machine Learning Breakthrough Expected By 2030
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Hoskinson declared that by the end of the decade, it would be possible to run machine learning models 1,000 times more powerful than Mixtral on a standard gaming Personal Computer (PC). The Cardano founder’s statement implies a substantial improvement in the capabilities of handling complex computational tasks in the realm of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

According to the crypto founder, this technological innovation will only be possible with specialized hardware and optimization techniques. By leveraging these advanced technologies, the computational power of gaming PCs is potentially set to rise to unexpected levels, enabling them to effectively handle tasks previously reserved for high-performance systems. 
Hoskinson’s prediction ushers in a potential for improved accessibility to computational power, with its implications becoming far-reaching, as various industries would potentially benefit from its applications. The Cardano founder’s proclamation also comes at a time when technological innovation and advancement, particularly in the fields of AI and machine learning are growing rapidly. 
In the advent that his predictions come to fruition, the boundaries of computational power would effectively be breached, driving innovation on a global scale and unlocking potential benefits that could come from harnessing immense computational power on consumer-grade hardware. 
Cardano Founder Excludes ADA In Projections
While making his predictions for 2030, Hoskinson failed to provide any personal projections on the future outlook of Cardano’s native token, ADA. The crypto founder has recently been focusing on the transformative capabilities of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning models within the industry. 

At the time of writing the price of ADA is $0.64, marking a 10.05% decline over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. While other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have experienced bullish rallies, ADA has remained relatively subdued.
Although Hoskinson has not provided a price forecast for Cardano, other crypto analysts have stepped in to fill the gap. According to popular crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, the price of ADA is expected to reach $1.70 following a period of consolidation between the range of $0.55 to $0.80 in the upcoming weeks.
The crypto analyst has predicted that after the upswing to $1.70, Cardano could experience a significant breakout to $5. This surge would surpass the cryptocurrency’s previous all-time high of $3.10 in 2021.

Dogecoin's million-dollar trades: Will DOGE holders see a 2021 re-run now? - AMBCrypto



The transactions reached the same peak as the time DOGE hit its ATH.
On-chain data revealed that the price might retest $0.19 again.

Dogecoin [DOGE] transactions valued at $1 million and above increased by a staggering 600% in the last 30 days, AMBCrypto discovered. But this development only scratched the surface of what has been happening with the coin lately.
Furthermore, the unprecedented move marked the highest number of million-dollar transactions since DOGE hit its all-time high in May 2021. DOGE’s all-time high was $0.73 which it reached on the 5th of May, 2021.
Source: X
Has the conditions changed?
At that time, large transactions were one of the catalysts that drove the value higher. However, the glee around Dogecoin during that period was much more than it is now.
This was because memecoins producing mind-altering gains were not as many as the number the market has now. Because of that, attention span was not as divided.
Despite the difference in circumstances, the rise in transactions could be a bullish signal for DOGE.
At press time, Dogecoin changed hands at $0.16, indicating that it was 77.38% down from its ATH. But does DOGE have the capability to surpass the price this cycle?
On different occasions, AMBCrypto reported price predictions explaining how the coin might hit $1 this cycle. However, if the coin were to repeat its performance, it would take more than a whispering campaign.
Outside of the on-chain condition, we also mentioned how Coinbase listed the coin on its futures market. For Dogecoin’s price, this could be good considering how stringent the exchange listing conditions are.
Furthermore, we decided to look at DOGE by comparing user activity in 2021 to press time. To do this, we employed the active addresses.
At press time, Dogecoin’s 24-hour active addresses had decreased to 58,400.  In May 2021, the number was around 242,000, indicating a good level of utility on the blockchain.
Source: Santiment
DOGE wants to surpass its peak
But at different times, the memecoin has crossed that number. For example, active addresses hit 794,000 in a full-blown bear market in 2022. Despite many downturns, DOGE’s price did not stop appreciating.
Therefore, it is not out of position to mention that the value might tap the ATH or cross it this cycle. This Weighted Sentiment shown by traders also aligned with this potential.
As of this writing, Dogecoin’s Weighted Sentiment had left the negative region, and risen to 0.457. The hike here, suggests that market participants were bullish on the short-term price action.
In terms of the one-day circulation, on-chain data revealed that the metric dropped. At press time, the circulation was down to 557.4 million, indicating a decrease in usage.

Read Dogecoin’s [DOGE] Price Prediction 2024-2025

A decrease also means less likelihood of widespread sell-offs. Consequently, DOGE’s price might ascend more than it has done within a short period.
In a highly bullish case, the value of the coin might revisit $0.19 one more time.

Mem Tokens Rained in the Wallet of BlackRock, the World's Largest Asset Manager! Prices Increased Due to Blackrock Effect! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Blackrock, one of the world's largest asset managers, recently launched the 'USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund' (BUIDL), which allows investors to earn US dollar returns.
The BUILD fund attracted a lot of attention, and after its launch, various meme tokens and NFTs were sent to BUIDL's wallet.


According to Spot on Chain's post, while altcoins such as DETF, USH and ROI came to the BULD fund, the prices of these altcoins increased by up to 20% due to the effect of the BlackRock wallet.
While none of these altcoin transfer transactions were made by BlackRock, the 100 million USDC that Blackrock initially transferred to its wallet is still waiting.






“After BlackRock launched the first $100 million tokenized fund on Ethereum, the fund wallet “0x13e” received various meme tokens and NFTs worth about $100 thousand: 250 thousand DETF ($20.7 thousand), 10 thousand RICO (15.7 thousand dollars), 500 thousand USH (13.9 thousand dollars)
BlackRock, in collaboration with Securitize, yesterday announced the 'USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund' ( BUIDL ) which allows investors to generate US dollar yield. “BlackRock withdrew 100M USDC from Circle for this fund 6 days ago.”

Polygon (MATIC) Price Analysis: Potential 10% Drop Ahead?


The Polygon (MATIC) price is under scrutiny as Daily Active Addresses have declined over the last eight days, hitting a seven-day Moving Average low not observed since February 27. With 51% of MATIC holders now facing losses, there’s a likelihood they might cling to their assets in anticipation of future price recoveries. 
Furthermore, the recent formation of a death cross in MATIC Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines points towards a persistent bearish trend, casting shadows over the immediate outlook for the cryptocurrency.
Polygon Active Addresses Are Declining
The number of MATIC Daily Active Addresses has seen a notable uptick in recent times, exhibiting a robust growth pattern. Specifically, from February 1 to March 14, there was a significant increase in daily active addresses, soaring from 1,946 to 3,301, marking an impressive 69.63% growth. 
This uptrend shows a growing interest and engagement within the MATIC network. However, this vigorous growth pace has shown signs of deceleration over the last eight days, a trend discernible from the seven-day Moving Average depicted in the chart below.
MATIC Daily Active Addresses. Source: Santiment.
The relationship between MATIC price movements and its Daily Active Addresses, particularly the seven-day Moving Average, has historically been tight. This correlation was displayed in the recent price surge observed from February 1 to March 14, during which the MATIC price experienced a notable increase of 41.77%.

Given the recent downturn in the Daily Active Addresses’ seven-day Moving Average, there’s an inference that MATIC price might be gearing up for a potential correction phase shortly. If historical patterns hold true, this downturn in active address growth could presage a cooling period for MATIC market valuation, hinting at an upcoming adjustment in its price trajectory over the ensuing days. 

Holders Face Losses: On-Chain Metrics Signal Bearish Trend
The current situation, with 51% of MATIC addresses being at a loss while only 44% are in profit, tends towards a bearish sentiment. Having the majority of investors underwater suggests they purchased at higher prices, leading to diminished buying enthusiasm and potentially stalling any upward price momentum. 
This situation might also prompt those at a loss to sell as soon as prices recover, introducing selling pressure at certain thresholds and limiting potential price growth.

The psychological impact on investor sentiment, with a majority facing losses, could foster a bearish outlook, as the concern over further declines overshadows optimism for recovery. This could dissuade new investments and delay any positive price movement. 

YTD Growth Of 21 Coins. Source: Messari.
Comparing the year-to-date (YTD) growth of some of the biggest crypto in the market today – excluding stablecoins and memecoins, MATIC is now at a loss. That status is only followed by the other two coins: ADA and XRP. With the rest of the market booming, investors could start leaving MATIC behind as they seek other investment opportunities with more potential return on their investment. 
MATIC Price Prediction: Is A 10% Drop Imminent?
MATIC’s 4-hour price chart shows that both of its short-term EMA lines recently crossed below long-term EMA lines, triggering a bearish trend. This indicates that recent prices are lower than the historical average, suggesting a period where selling pressure has outweighed buying interest. 
Such a trend implies that the market may continue to see downward pressure on MATIC prices as the bearish sentiment persists over time.

MATIC EMA lines. Source: TradingView. 
Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are a moving average that places a greater emphasis on recent price data, aiming to provide a more accurate reflection of current market trends. They are pivotal in identifying the direction of the price momentum and potential trend reversals.

If the downtrend persists, MATIC’s price could drop until the next support zone at $0.90, an almost 10% price drop. On the other hand, other factors, such as an ETH price surge, could revert this trend and make MATIC’s price start rising again. In that case, it could test resistances at $1.10 and $1.15.

Solana flooded by 20K new tokens daily: Will it make or break SOL? - AMBCrypto



20,000 new tokens are being created on Solana every day.
Sentiment around Solana remained positive despite spike in number of rugpulls.

Solana’s [SOL] network has outperformed most other protocols in terms of activity over the last few months. One of the reasons for this is the accessibility of the network and cheap fees.
Moreover, the recent memecoin frenzy has also contributed to the growth of the network.
Token creation on the rise
As a result of the combination of these two factors, market participants are creating multiple tokens on the Solana network so that they can benefit from user interest.
Based on new data, over 20,000 new tokens are being generated on Solana each day. Even though this is an indicator of a vibrant ecosystem, the creation of these many tokens on the network can have some pitfalls.
One major drawback of the deployment of such a large number of illiquid tokens would be the possibility of rug pulls occurring to addresses holding these tokens.
Even though this behavior is expected from memecoin launches, it could still impact the overall sentiment around the Solana ecosystem.
To combat these problems SolanaFM has introduced blue checkmarks that have been added to the tokens so that they can be verified. The Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Jupiter has also taken actions to help users check for legitimate tokens.
Source: X
Sentiment remains positive
Despite the uptick in the number of rug pulls on the Solana network, the sentiment around the network remained high.
AMBCrytpo’s analysis of Santiment’s data indicated that the weighted sentiment around Solana had grown significantly over the last few weeks. This implied that the number of positive comments around Solana had outnumbered the negative ones at the time of writing.
Coupled with that, the social volume around the Solana network has also grown significantly.
Source: Santiment
However, the positive sentiment around Solana was not reflected in the recent price movement around SOL. In the last 24 hours, the price of SOL had fallen by 6.21% and it was trading at $179.75 at the time of writing.

How much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?

This correction in SOL’s price may be a reaction to SOL crossing past the $200 threshold. If SOL manages to re-test this level it may rally even further.
However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) of SOL decreased during this period. This may indicate a potential decrease in buying pressure for SOL which could impact SOL’s ability to see green going forward.

Shiba Inu has seen a huge amount of action in the past day. A massive two trillion SHIB tokens have been shuffled between numerous entities, including whales, exchange and trading desks. Could it be a signal for SHIB?So, who's moving all this SHIB? Whales and a few crypto exchanges are making the moves. For example, one transaction had a massive 77.453 billion SHIB moving to a Coinbase hot wallet, and another 412.7128 billion SHIB were sent to Coinone's hot wallet.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewBut that's not all – there was a huge transaction of 500 billion SHIB sent to a Crypto.com hot wallet. Another big chunk of 431.1738 billion SHIB landed in yet another anonymous wallet, most likely owned by a whale or a trading desk. These are just a few of the gigantic transactions that occurred.Why all the movement now? It is likely because the whole market is picking up speed, getting back on its feet after a tough time. And it is not just SHIB; other meme coins are bouncing back too.These massive moves might be exchanges shuffling funds around for better security or to manage their wallets more efficiently, in order to stay liquid. Whales might also be ones getting ready for something big or taking advantage of the market's recovery to make some Shiba Inu trades.Whatever the reason, it is clear that activity on the SHIB network is on the rise right now, and these massive transfers are a sign that something is cooking. With the market getting back in shape, it seems like SHIB and other meme coins are coming back.

ENS data from Etherscan now visible in Google search results

Tech giant Google has integrated Ethereum Name Service (ENS) data into its search results through data available from Etherscan.A former ENS core team member, Brantly Millegan, noticed the update and posted the news on X. Cointelegraph confirmed the feature by testing it with several ENS addresses, including Vitalik.eth, an address belonging to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain network.The displayed result showed the address particulars, such as Ether (ETH) balance and the time of the latest transaction. The data is collected from Ethereum block explorer Etherscan.Ethereum Name Service allows the use of complex wallet addresses on the internet in the exact way domains are used. For example, instead of complex numbers, you get an ENS address like yourname.eth, which you can easily share. This is similar to quickly accessing websites directly through domains instead of IP addresses.Source: Google SearchGoogle has become increasingly involved with crypto and blockchain technology. In May 2023, it introduced native support for Ethereum wallet balances. Initially, users could search for a specific public address and view the wallet balance directly in the search results. This functionality has now been expanded to ENS domains.In 2022, Google integrated a crypto feature enabling some Ethereum wallet addresses to have their Ether balances tracked by the Google search engine, saving the need to make the trip to Etherscan. The feature was first made public by a principal at Google Ventures, Han Hua, in an Oct. 11, 2022 post.In addition, the firm also initiated a countdown to the Ethereum Merge event in 2022 by featuring animated pandas moving in sync. In 2023, Google revised its crypto advertising policy to include “Cryptocurrency Coin Trusts.” These products enable investors to trade shares in trusts holding digital assets. Related: Ethereum Name Service founder reveals Vitalik Buterin’s timely grant interventionConsequently, Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) products from notable asset managers like BlackRock now appear in search results for queries like “Bitcoin ETF.”On Feb. 5, ENS announced a partnership with domain registrar GoDaddy, which allows the Web3 community to link their .eth names (domains) to traditional Web2 domains at no extra cost.The GoDaddy-ENS partnership eliminates the barrier of high gas fees that previously dissuaded users from bringing domain names over to ENS. ENS enabled the cost-free transition by deploying new smart contracts for resolution. As a result, DNS domain holders can realize a new form of self-sovereignty by having greater control over their own decentralized identities.Magazine: Doctor Who materializes in Web3 — Tony Pearce’s journey in time and space

Crypto Market Sees Red as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana Dip Ahead of Halving - Decrypt

The cryptocurrency market began Friday covered in red. Several coins, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, fell in morning trading. It could be a sign of volatility ahead of the Bitcoin halving as traders attempt to gauge whether they’ve priced in the event correctly. And as Bitcoin goes, so too typically does the rest of the market.The price of Bitcoin (BTC), the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell over 4% in the last 24 hours to a current price of about $63,400, according to CoinGecko.Cooling off after setting multiple all-time high price milestones in recent weeks, Bitcoin’s fast-approaching halving is adding to volatility, with investors anxiously waiting to see if the price drops after the event—or if it surges to yet another new all-time high.On Thursday, global investment firm AllianceBernstein predicted that Bitcoin will hit $90,000 by the end of 2024. Adding to the bullish market sentiment is surging activity around the Bitcoin ETFs that were approved earlier this year.“ETFs now represent $4 to $5 billion in average daily BTC spot market volume,” Coinbase Asia-Pacific Managing Director John O’Loghlen told Decrypt late Thursday. “So [ETFs] are 15 to 20% of the total across the centralized exchanges globally.”Ethereum, meanwhile, is down almost 6% over the last 24 hours to a current price of about $3,320. While investors wait to see if the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve spot Ethereum ETFs, investment firms—including BlackRock and Grayscale—have filed applications with the regulatory agency.Damping the enthusiasm around an Ethereum ETF is the concern that the SEC may be on the verge of declaring ETH a security, and the Ethereum Foundation recently disclosed that it is being investigated by an unnamed “state authority.” Fortune reports that the SEC is indeed investigating the foundation."On any one of these crypto tokens, it's about the facts and circumstances as to whether the investing public is anticipating a profit based on the efforts of others," SEC chair Gary Gensler told Bloomberg TV earlier this month. "We do have filings in front of us. I'm not going to comment."Solana, recently buzzing due to surging meme coin trading activity, is down even harder today—it has plunged by 8% over the last 24 hours to a current price around $171, just days after tipping over the $200 mark for the first time in more than two years.The network has been struggling with congestion issues in recent weeks due to demand for meme coins, but it could see some relief as the frenzy cools off—at least for now. Notable Solana meme coin prices are down, with BONK falling 9% on the day, Dogwifhat (WIF) dipping by about 6%, and Slerf (SLERF) plunging by nearly 25%.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

New York gives regulatory green light to blockchain-focused asset manager - Blockworks


WisdomTree has gained clearance to offer its “blockchain-enabled” financial app to New York users via a charter expected to also extend its digital assets offerings more broadly.
The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) cleared the fund group — managing $106 billion in assets — to operate as a limited purpose trust company under the state’s banking law, WisdomTree said Friday.
The charter allows the firm to custody digital assets, as well as issue, exchange and manage the reserves of DFS-approved stablecoins. The newly formed WisdomTree Digital Trust Company intends to issue its gold and dollar tokens and maintain reserves for those assets, the company noted.
The company is also set to make its WisdomTree Prime app available to New York customers in the coming weeks, the firm said in a news release. 
The app, which launched in 21 states in July, offers bitcoin and ether, as well as dollar and gold tokens. It also allows users to access digital funds that have share ownership records kept on the Stellar or Ethereum blockchains.

Will Peck, WisdomTree’s head of digital assets, is now also the CEO of WisdomTree Digital Trust Company. 
The charter sets up a roadmap to offer products, such as DFS-approved stablecoins, on public blockchains outside of WisdomTree Prime, Peck told Blockworks.
“We believe long-term legislative and regulatory trends are likely to favor or require the use of highly regulated organizations, like New York limited purpose trust companies, for issuing tokenized products and providing related services,” he added.
The latest regulatory clearance comes after WisdomTree executives have reiterated their vision to bring fixed income, equities and commodities into the digital world via digital funds and tokenized exposures.
Read more: WisdomTree triples down on future blockchain focus
WisdomTree Prime’s tech stack integrates software from DTCC Digital Assets and Fireblocks’ Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet technology for security related to private keys management. 
“Crypto’s interesting, but the real opportunity is blockchain-enabled finance,” Chief Operating Officer Jarrett Lilien said during an October 2022 earnings call. “It’s a mistake to confuse crypto, which is a use case for the blockchain…with the broader opportunity we’re pursuing.”
WisdomTree launched one of the 10 US spot bitcoin ETFs cleared to start trading in January.
“We have no plans to incorporate the trust company into our ETF franchise,” Peck told Blockworks on Friday. “But over time, we plan to use the WisdomTree Digital Trust Company to offer products and services to institutions and business customers.”

Crypto Analyst Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says BTC in ‘Danger Zone’ and Could Fall Further - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is warning that Bitcoin (BTC) could pull back further before next month’s halving event when miners’ rewards are cut in half.
Pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 433,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin has entered a “danger zone” when historically the crypto king has corrected between 20% and 40%.










“It’s been two days since Bitcoin officially entered the ‘danger zone’ (orange) where historical pre-halving retraces have begun. Historically, Bitcoin has performed pre-halving retraces 14-28 days before the halving. Currently, BTC is approximately 26 days away from the halving and has pulled back almost -18% in total since last week. 
Whether the retrace bottom is in already or not is uncertain. But what’s clear is this: Bitcoin has just recently entered its ‘danger zone’ time window. Technically, there’s still time for additional downside.”



Source: Rekt Capital/X



The trader says Bitcoin’s price pattern is showing similarities to the 2016 cycle, which could indicate a deeper dip ahead before the halving event.
“In 2016, Bitcoin performed its pre-halving retrace approximately 28 days before the halving. In 2024, Bitcoin performed its pre-halving retrace approximately 32 days before the halving. Interestingly, when Bitcoin began its 2016 pre-halving retrace, price initially produced a long downside wick before retracing further. 
Recently, Bitcoin has also produced a long downside wick on its pre-halving retrace. Bitcoin will need to continue to maintain these current highs to avoid a 2016-like fate where the initial reaction was strong but short-lived.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
The trader is also predicting when Bitcoin could reach the peak of the current bull market cycle.
“When could Bitcoin peak in this bull market? Bitcoin tends to perform a bull market top 266-315 days after it breaks its old all-time high. Bitcoin broke its old all-time highs last week. The next bull market peak may thus occur in 266-315 days. That’s very late November 2024 or very late January 2025.”
However, the trader says that historically Bitcoin is taking longer to hit peaks each cycle, which could push the peak of the current bull market to December 2024 or mid-February 2025.
“Historically, the amount of days that Bitcoin has spent beyond old all-time highs have increased by approximately 14 days to 35 days… 
If we add 14-35 days to the initial bull market peak range of 266-315 days, that would bring the total to 280-350 days. This in turn could push the Bitcoin bull market peak to mid-December 2024 or mid-February 2025.”

Bitcoin is trading for $65,410 at time of writing, down more than 3% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin traders anticipate volatility as BTC futures open interest tops $36B

Bitcoin (BTC) investors are always waiting for and excited by volatility but seldom enjoy it when a price pump is followed by a sharp correction that triggers forced liquidations in futures contracts and amplifies the downside price movement. Bitcoin futures play an essential role since traders can use leverage; thus, the larger this market becomes, the greater its price impact.Bitcoin futures aggregate open interest, USD. Source: CoinglassThe aggregate Bitcoin futures open interest reached a $36 billion all-time high on March 21, up from $30 billion two weeks prior. Moreover, the market leader, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), achieved an $11.9 billion open interest, surpassing the inflow of U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since their inception.Bitcoin’s volatility increased after the spot ETF launch in the U.S.Despite the successful debut of spot ETFs, some analysts anticipated reduced volatility, given that these instruments trade over $3 billion per day on average. However, recent data indicate the opposite, as Bitcoin's volatility has increased in the last four weeks.Bitcoin/USD 30-day historical volatility. Source: TradingViewBitcoin's 30-day volatility surged above 80%, marking its highest level in over 15 months. For comparison, the S&P 500 index volatility stands at 13%, while WTI oil futures stand at 23%. Even stocks traditionally considered volatile in the traditional market, such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Unity Software (U), currently exhibit a volatility of 72% and 59%, respectively.Volatility examples in Bitcoin include a 10% correction on March 19, reaching a low of $60,795, followed by a 12% gain on March 20. This unforeseen price swing resulted in $375 million of forced liquidations in BTC futures contracts over two days. While this movement may not directly impact holders, it certainly influences the trajectory of the bull run and, more significantly, Bitcoin's risk perception by the broader market.The Bitcoin futures market, like any derivatives instrument, is a double-edged sword: it enables leveraged bullish and bearish bets. While entities aggressively shorting BTC futures may seem detrimental to the spot Bitcoin price, ultimately, the derivatives trade must be settled, either through buying back the contract or forced liquidation.Consequently, if Bitcoin's price was suppressed by investors using leveraged shorts, one should anticipate the movement to eventually reverse, leading to short-term buying pressure. This partly explains why high futures open interest is linked to increased volatility.Are Bitcoin futures behind the apparent BTC price ‘manipulation’?Some analysts attribute the added volatility to excessive leverage, while others simply attribute it to 'manipulation'.Source: amitX user Amit Kukreja, for instance, alleges that market makers have been pursuing leveraged longs and shorts. He claims that stocks directly related to the sector, such as the miner CleanSpark (CLSK), gained 7% on the day Bitcoin's price crashed to $68,000. While suppositions can be made, it is impossible to ascertain the rationale behind each market participant's intentions.To determine whether Bitcoin futures contracts have been used to exert negative pressure on BTC's price, one should analyze the monthly contracts premium. These are the preferred instruments of professional traders due to the absence of a funding rate. To compensate for the extended settlement period, sellers typically demand a 5% to 10% premium relative to spot markets.Related: History of Crypto: Bitcoin — Satoshi Nakamoto’s response to the global financial crisisBitcoin 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: LaevitasThe BTC futures premium has maintained levels above 16% for the past three weeks, which is typical of bullish markets. Furthermore, the indicator has not significantly declined even after Bitcoin's price fell by 17.6% between March 14 and March 20.If anything, the demand for leverage on Bitcoin's futures appears to be more heavily concentrated on the buy side. Conversely, if the Bitcoin price continues to downtrend, those leveraged buyers might face forced liquidation, leading to drastic consequences given the $36 billion open interest.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Why Did LUNA-LUNC-USTC Price Surge? Here are All That is Known - Bitcoin Sistemi


Terra Classic (LUNC), Terra USD (USTC) and Terra (LUNA) prices experienced a slight increase with the recent news.
The rises came after Vijesti, a local newspaper based in Montenegro, claimed that the sentence of Do Kwon, the founder of the altcoins in question, would be commuted to house arrest and Kwon would be released.


The Terra (LUNA) ecosystem experienced a collapse in May 2022 and deleted approximately $40 billion worth of assets from the cryptocurrency market. A significant portion of the cryptocurrency world thinks that Do Kwon is a scammer running a Ponzi scheme. Kwon printed billions of additional LUNA tokens to maintain the stability of his stablecoin called UST at $ 1, causing the value of this altcoin to almost zero.
However, Kwon was caught trying to leave Montenegro with a fake passport. Since then, both the United States and South Korea have requested Kwon's extradition, but Montenegrin officials have not yet made a decision. Kwon's lawyers favor extradition to South Korea, where sentences are lighter.

US DOJ Files Lawsuit Against Apple Over Unfair Rules Targeting Crypto Apps

                        The Department of Justice (DOJ) and 16 state and district attorneys general have filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of monopolizing or attempting to monopolize smartphone markets in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.Apple, a publicly traded company headquartered in California, generated significant revenues in fiscal year 2023, surpassing those of many countries’ gross domestic products.DOJ Files Lawsuit Against Apple, Alleging Illegal Control of Smartphone MarketAccording to the lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, Apple is accused of illegally controlling the smartphone market by imposing restrictive contracts on developers and limiting their access to essential points. This allegedly prevents the development of crypto apps, products, and services that could reduce dependence on iPhones, promote compatibility with other platforms, and lower costs for consumers and developers.The DOJ alleges that Apple uses its dominant position to extract more money from various parties, such as consumers, developers, artists, and small businesses. The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, stated in a press conference on Thursday,“Apple has maintained its power not because of its superiority but because of its unlawful exclusionary behavior. Monopolies like Apple threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based.”According to the DOJ, Apple’s policies have unfairly eliminated alternative payment systems and spotlighted the 30% fee it imposes on apps and in-app purchases despite not being the app developer.This fee, coupled with Apple’s exclusive support for fiat currencies in its payment systems, has posed challenges to integrating cryptocurrencies in apps. As a result, many crypto-based apps have found it economically unfeasible to offer in-app purchases or utilize cryptocurrencies within the Apple ecosystem.Government officials also allege the smartphone company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services, among other tactics, to preserve its dominance over the smartphone market.Apple Faces Legal Challenges from US DOJ and EU Regulators
Apple’s practices also allegedly restrict iPhone users and developers from accessing alternative app stores, which could compete with Apple’s fees. The DOJ claims that Apple arbitrarily enforces its App Store rules and penalizes developers who use technologies that could disrupt its monopoly power.Some examples cited include nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces like OpenSea disabling certain features on their iOS apps due to the 30% fee and a Bitcoin-friendly social app called Damus removing its BTC tipping feature after Apple delisted it for not using its in-app payments system.Additionally, Apple’s control extends to web apps accessed through iOS devices, as the company requires all iOS web browsers to use its WebKit browser engine. The DOJ also accuses Apple of denying access to competing digital wallets and preventing developers from providing customers with payment services.The officials leading the case stress that no company should be above the law, no matter how big they are. They’re determined to enforce antitrust laws to protect consumers and promote fair competition in the market.In response, a spokesperson from Apple stated that the DOJ’s complaint is inaccurate and that they will vigorously defend against it. The company argues that the lawsuit could set a dangerous precedent by giving the government excessive control over technology design.Following the news of the lawsuit, Apple’s shares [NASDAQ: AAPL] fell by 4% to approximately $171, remaining flat in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance.Read more news stories about Apple:

This Trending Meme Coin Explodes 50% Daily: Details


																TL;DR

Meme coins on the Solana blockchain have shown potential for high profits, with instances of substantial investment returns highlighted.
Despite these opportunities, the inherent volatility of meme coins underscores a considerable risk of losses.


Meme coins built on the Solana blockchain have been thriving in the past several months, with the sector spewing new ones quite frequently.
Today’s best performer from that list is Book of Meme (BOME). The asset has experienced a price spike of approximately 50% on a 24-hour scale, while its market capitalization briefly exceeded $900 million. This is a serious achievement for a token that saw the light of day a week ago.

BOME Price, Source: CoinGecko
Currently, BOME is the 126th largest cryptocurrency, and at one point, it entered the top 100 clubs. This happened on March 16 when its market cap neared a whopping $1.5 billion.




The token’s impressive price appreciation has allowed savvy traders to make substantial profits. CryptoPotato reported about the case of one such investor who turned 50 SOL into 767 SOL (equivalent to over $137,000 at current rates).
BOME is not the only meme coin to have exploded by triple digits in a short period of time, thus positioning the investments of some traders well in the green. 
Last year, a mysterious individual purchased over 2.5 million dogwifhat (WIF) tokens, spending just $310. The stash is currently worth almost $6 million.
Despite offering the chance to make life-changing profits, dealing with meme coins can lead to crucial losses due to the infamous volatility of the niche.

Worldcoin (WLD) Slips 3% as It Sunsets Data Storage Amid Regulatory Pressure

Worldcoin has slipped about 3% to $8.07 following the unveiling of its data control known as Personal Custody, a model meant to address regulators’ concerns about data privacy. Market reaction following the announcement has upset Worldcoin's performance with sharp sell-offs.The concept of Personal Custody — a groundbreaking approach recommended by privacy experts — was first unveiled alongside the introduction of World ID 2.0 and intends to reform the way personal data is handled, empowering individuals with unprecedented control over their information.Reforming data handling with Personal CustodyPersonal Custody signifies a shift in the handling of data generated during World ID verification, including images, metadata and derived data, which is securely held on the user's device.This novel approach grants users not only the ability to delete their data but also to control its future use before deletion; it is a level of autonomy that was previously unavailable. The significance of this is that it is a departure from the default practice of data deletion.One of the key advantages of Personal Custody is its ability to unlock new World ID use cases, particularly through Face Authentication for high-security applications. With Face Authentication, users can verify their identity at any time locally on their device, without the need for their data to leave their phone.Additionally, optional Data Custody will no longer be offered during orb visits, ensuring that users have the opportunity to learn about Worldcoin before deciding to share their information. Experts say that with this level of user control, the privacy concerns of the Spanish authorities over its use of eye-scanning technology for data collection should be reconsidered.Personal Custody's impact on Worldcoin's performanceAnalysts say that Personal Custody's regulatory scrutiny will be less on Worldcoin. In late January, the Hong Kong Privacy Commissioner's Office (PCPD) initiated an inquiry into Worldcoin under a court warrant. The authorities concentrated on potential significant privacy risks related to personal data and possible breaches of the Privacy Ordinance.Despite that, the blockchain-based biometrics verification company has soared to new heights to hit a new all-time-high of $11.82 on the back of a sustained bullish rally. However, analysts have predicted that the long-term benefits of this innovative approach, including reduced regulatory scrutiny and enhanced user control, will ultimately contribute to Worldcoin's sustained growth despite initial market sentiment.

Fantom’s FTM Outperforms Ahead of Upgrade

Layer 1 blockchain Fantom’s native token, FTM, has gained over 190% in four weeks, becoming the best-performing non-meme cryptocurrency among the top 100 digital assets by market value. FTM’s price surged to $1.16, the highest since April 2022, according to data tracked by CoinGecko. The token’s market capitalization jumped to $3.29 billion, becoming the 44th largest digital asset in the world. Fantom’s impending Sonic upgrade, expected to boost transaction processing speeds, may have galvanized investor interest in the cryptocurrency. The Sonic mainnet will replace the existing Opera mainnet in the next few months. Sonic’s testnet went live in October. The closed testnet with simulated traffic has demonstrated a maximum theoretical throughput of 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) and a time to finality of 1.1 seconds.

SWIFT proposes a role for itself in a tokenized future on a unified ledger

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) has been watching the development of fintech carefully, with a focus on its own future. After a variety of projects using new technologies, the pillar of the current international payments system has thrown its weight behind a unified ledger payment model.SWIFT looked in particular at tokenization and the shared ledger model, according to a post on its website. Common infrastructure could provide real-time balance to all of the participants in the shared ledger, it said. That’s not to say messaging is unneeded, SWIFT was quick to add:“Shared ledgers are not well suited to carrying and storing high volumes of data due to the way data is synchronised across parties and the computing power required. This is where a messaging layer fits in.”“For transactions to be frictionless, additional types of data also need to be transferred to enable value-added services such as AML, compliance, sanctions screening, trade and accounts receivable reconciliation,” it continued. Related: WEF 2022: SWIFT probably won’t exist in 5 years, says Mastercard CEORather than starting a unified ledger from scratch, SWIFT suggested the creation of a state machine — “a dynamic model that reflects the current state of transactions and balances across institutions” — that could be built on the ISO-20022 messaging technology already in use. It could work on a blockchain or on a centralized platform like SWIFT’s Transaction Manager.Unified ledger technology has been embraced by the International Monetary Fund in its XC platform and by financial institutions participating in the Regulated Liability Network. The Bank for International Settlements has also endorsed the model.Source: Richard TurrinSWIFT, which was founded in 1973, settled on the unified ledger model after considering several other options. In 2022, it teamed up with fintech Symbiont in a pilot project to upgrade its information delivery to corporate clients through Symbiont’s blockchain-driven Assembly platform. SWIFT argued against the use of a unified ledger in a 2023 report in favor of SWIFT as a “single point of access” to different blockchain networks. SWIFT plays a key role in the imposition of economic sanctions worldwide. In February 2022, at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Commission ordered the removal of an unknown number of Russian banks from SWIFT.Magazine: Block by block: Blockchain technology is transforming the real estate market

Google Integrates Ethereum Name Service, Simplifying Crypto Transactions | Cryptopolitan

Google has rolled out an update that integrates Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains into its search results, making it easier for users to view Ethereum wallet balances directly through Google search. The development, first spotted by Brantly Millegan, a former core team member of ENS, marks a pivotal moment in bridging the gap between traditional internet users and the burgeoning world of digital currencies.Simplifying Crypto Transactions with ENS DomainsThe Ethereum Name Service revolutionizes how we interact with Ethereum wallets by replacing complex public addresses with human-readable names, such as “example.eth”. It is not only demystifies the process of sending and receiving cryptocurrencies for the average user but also paves the way for broader acceptance and use of digital assets in everyday transactions. With Google’s latest update, users can now simply enter an ENS domain into the search bar and instantly view the associated Ethereum wallet’s balance, streamlining the user experience significantly.Google’s introduction of native support for Ethereum wallet balances in May 2023 was a landmark moment, signaling the tech giant’s recognition of the growing importance of cryptocurrencies in the digital economy. By allowing users to search for a specific public address and view the wallet balance within the search results, Google had already taken a significant step towards integrating crypto functionalities into its ecosystem. The expansion of the feature to include ENS domains further underscores Google’s commitment to enhancing accessibility and usability for crypto holders and enthusiasts.The Impact of Google’s Integration on the Crypto EcosystemThe integration by Google is more than just a technical update; it represents a significant leap forward in the normalization and adoption of cryptocurrencies. By making crypto transactions more accessible and understandable to the general public, Google is helping to remove some of the barriers to entry that have hindered broader adoption of digital currencies. Furthermore, the move could potentially lead to increased trust and interest in cryptocurrencies, as it aligns with Google’s reputation for providing reliable and user-friendly services.The visibility of Ethereum wallet balances and ENS domains in Google search results is poised to significantly boost interest and participation in the cryptocurrency realm. This development could act as a gateway for more individuals to explore and invest in cryptocurrencies, thereby fueling innovation and growth within the sector. It underscores the growing importance of digital asset management tools and the role they play in simplifying the user experience.Furthermore, the prominence of ENS domains in this context highlights their critical role in the crypto ecosystem. ENS domains provide a user-friendly and efficient way for individuals to manage their digital assets, making the process more accessible and straightforward. This enhancement in visibility and usability is expected to encourage more users to engage with and navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency world, fostering a more inclusive and expansive digital economy.ConclusionGoogle’s integration of Ethereum Name Service domains into its search functionality is a testament to the growing intersection between traditional tech industries and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. The move not only enhances the user experience for existing crypto enthusiasts but also plays a crucial role in demystifying digital currencies for the average internet user. As the lines between the traditional internet and the blockchain continue to blur, initiatives like this are pivotal in paving the way for a more interconnected and accessible digital future.

The Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange platform, through its derivatives department, announced that the platform is preparing to launch new products for its investor pool on April 1st. The recent announcements to introduce cash-settled futures contracts for three major altcoins. Coinbase International took to X (formerly Twitter), to announce the launch. The announcement comes as a huge boost of approval for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. The three Altcoins mentioned have been in the top ten cryptocurrency space for a long time, and this announcement brings hope to long-time investors of the various tokens. The announcement serves as a further endorsement of Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that has often been viewed as the father of meme coins. The coin is clearly transitioning to a more stable cryptocurrency with clear-cut use cases. Considering Dogecoin has often been listed as a legitimate cryptocurrency that can be used to purchase Tesla vehicles, the coin has since recorded significant growth. The crypto exchange platform teased crypto fans, hinting that their first leveraged and CFTC-regulated futures contracts for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Dogecoin could be available to trade on different platforms. Coinbase encouraged cryptocurrency investors to be on the lookout for these leveraged futures as they will be available to trade on partner platforms as well. This is a huge step for crypto enthusiasts and it marks a crucial step towards broader adoption and increased accessibility for digital assets. Behind the Scenes; What steps did Coinbase take?Coinase Derivatives filed a request to list new Futures contracts to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on March 7th. The exchange platform however, expected delays during the regulatory process and therefore planned to launch the products anyway, as they are confident the leveraged contracts adhere to the legal guidelines established by the US Commodity Futures and Trading Commission. In Coinbase’s application to list Dogecoin Futures, it stated that the Doge cryptocurrency has withstood the test of time and undoubtedly grown beyond its reputation as a memecoin. The cryptocurrency’s popularity across the board has soared even more after the announcement, witnessed by the sharp (18%) increase in DOGE price.What Coinbase looks to achieveThe cryptocurrency exchange has played around with the idea of crypto-leveraged derivatives for a long time. Back in 2022. The crypto exchange platform clearly mentioned that it has intentions of making cryptocurrency derivatives contracts reachable to its retail investors. Per its mission, Coinbase reportedly acquired FairX, a derivatives exchange platform regulated by CFTC. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchange platforms in the market is continuing to drive cryptocurrency adoption through different products. These steps are received positively within the Web 3 space, and crypto investors are undoubtedly excited as they wait for this opportunity, come April 1st, to access CTFC-regulated derivatives of well-known cryptocurrencies like BitcoinCash, Litecoin, and Dogecoin.

CryptoPunks record another $16M NFT sale in March

Blue-chip nonfungible token (NFT) collection CryptoPunks saw another record-breaking sale in March, as one more rare alien piece sold for roughly $16 million in Ether (ETH). On March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 was purchased for 4,850 ETH, worth about $16.4 million at the time of the sale. The NFT sale claimed the second-highest selling price ever for a CryptoPunk and followed another high-profile NFT sale earlier in March. On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 ETH, worth around $16 million at the time of sale, making it the third-largest CryptoPunk sale after the recent #7804 punk sale. Top CryptoPunks ranked by sales price. Source: CryptoPunksCryptoPunk #7804 is one of 10,000 NFTs within the collection. However, its value comes from the rarity of its attributes. The character in the NFT has its cap forward, which only 254 CryptoPunks have. It has a pipe, which only 317 of the NFTs have, and small shades shared by only 378 CryptoPunks. However, what truly makes the digital asset rarer is that it’s one out of only nine alien CryptoPunks. Peruggia, the NFT’s seller, posted on X to express thoughts on the sale. The CryptoPunk seller described the sale as the “end of an era” and confessed to feeling like an imposter and holding NFTs back by not elevating the piece to what it deserves. Source: PeruggiaPeruggia bought the CryptoPunk in March 2021 for 4,200 ETH, worth $7.5 million at the sale. The NFT trader held onto the piece for over three years despite being offered around $18 million in 2022. The transaction also held the record for the second-largest CryptoPunk sale before the two $16 million sales this month. Source: FVCKRENDER Community members praised the sale, with many congratulating the seller and giving words of appreciation for holding the NFT asset. Related: BlackRock receives memecoins, NFTs after depositing $100M USDC onchainThe sale of CryptoPunk #7804 catapulted the NFT collection’s sales volume to surpass other popular NFTs like NodeMonkeys and Mad Lads in weekly sales. According to NFT data tracker CryptoSlam, CryptoPunks recorded $21.5 million in sales in the last seven days. With high-profile NFT sales happening in multiple blockchains, transaction volume for NFTs started skyrocketing. In the last 30 days, NFTs recorded $1.5 billion in sales volume across multiple blockchain networks.

Will decentralized protocols become the future infrastructure of machine learning?

Booming interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has led to a shortage of hardware resources and exorbitant cloud service costs, but decentralized infrastructure could challenge the dependence on centralized players.Harry Grieve, co-founder of machine learning compute network Gensyn, spoke exclusively to Cointelegraph during the ETHGlobal event in London about the promise of peer-to-peer computing networks challenging Web2 services like Amazon Web Services. Gensyn is an in-development decentralized network that will enable people to connect to various devices across the internet to train machine learning models. The company is backed by several Web3 venture capital firms and raised $50 million from Andreessen Horowitz in 2023.Grieve says the network holds significant potential as the internet changes to a more dynamic representation of information that will empower “self-sovereignty and computational liberty online.”Grieve chats to Cointelegraph in London during the ETHGlobal hackathon. Source: Gareth JenkinsonGensyn has been in development since 2020, with Grieve and co-founder Ben Fielding researching machine learning computing for training and decentralized verifiable systems. The pair have been looking to solve a threefold problem with blockchain-based technology.“How can you peer with another device and train a machine learning model on that device where A), the device is untrusted? B), your training model can’t fit on that single device. And C, you want the achievable scale of the entire system and unit economic outcomes as good as AWS,” Grieve said.Gensyn’s lite paper describes the protocol as “a layer-1 trustless protocol for deep learning computation.” The network directly and immediately rewards participants for availing computing resources to the network and performing ML tasks. Grieve said the challenge of building the network is verifying completed ML work, which sits at the intersection of complexity theory, game theory, cryptography and optimization:“We realized that if you want to build this in a decentralized way, you need a way to reach a decentralized consensus about who did what. That’s basically all a blockchain is.” Taking a leaf out of Satoshi’s Bitcoin playbookGensyn takes some inspiration from the ideals of the Bitcoin protocol, and Grieve says he’s a big believer in the old Bitcoin laptop mining days, where users could acquire BTC when it was still possible for smaller devices to be used for mining:“Satoshi gave people the right to their money again; they could generate it from a laptop. They could convert electricity into money. They could convert fiat into something harder.”While the long-term plan is to make Gensyn a tool that allows a wide set of users and hardware to provide or access computing resources for ML training, the initial launch will target users with more graphics processing units (GPUs) because they represent the quickest way to get a lot of feedback.“We are thoroughly planning on people building on top of Gensyn to make more user-friendly, supply-side, and contribution applications. Ultimately, an individual with a laptop will be able to download our client and run it in a way that connects you to the network,” Grieve said.Related: io.net adds Apple chip support to its cloud-based GPU-sourcing networkApple’s Silicon chips also promise to unlock massive global computing resources. Grieve says that research into Apple M2 and M3 chips shows that the hardware reaches parity with mid-tier, current-generation consumer Nvidia RTX GPUs. This provides two potential major benefits for protocols like Gensyn, which could tap into a broad set of devices to contribute to its global supercluster. Grieve says:“I think people are more likely to have something that looks like a MacBook than a standalone GPU, so it’s a much more like democratizing force if you can contribute that.”Apple Silicon chips are also highly versatile, acting as a “system on a chip” that could be emulated by other chip manufacturers. Grieve believes the future could have more edge devices that are far more powerful than existing smartphones, adding that decentralizing across lots of devices and verifying device-agnostically is essential.As Cointelegraph previously reported, Solana-based decentralized network io.net will onboard Apple Silicon chip hardware for its artificial intelligence and machine learning services.Magazine: Is measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024?

Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has issued an important warning about ongoing scams aimed at customers of the now-defunct crypto trading platform FTX. As the bankruptcy proceedings of FTX advance and the possibility of repaying some customers emerges, opportunistic scammers are sprouting up, aiming to prey on unsuspecting victims. According to Bloomberg, FTX told a bankruptcy judge in January that creditors of the company who can prove their losses are likely to get all of their money back.In light of this, scammers are reportedly reaching out to FTX customers, offering to expedite the claims process or retrieve assets from the beleaguered exchange. However, these offers are nothing more than a ruse to deceive users and potentially steal (more of) their assets.Ripple CTO issues warningThe collapse of FTX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, dealt a serious blow to the crypto industry, causing widespread uncertainty and a loss of trust among investors. In the aftermath, many users have been left in limbo, hoping to recover their funds. It is within this context that the Ripple CTO alerts of scams that are exploiting the situation.According to Schwartz, scam emails are presently circulating, claiming that customers must take action regarding their FTX claims. These unscrupulous actors generally exploit the fear of customers missing out on their claims, urging them to connect their crypto wallet to verify their eligibility or expedite the claims process.The Ripple CTO warns users not to click on links on scam emails when sharing the link to the official FTX claims page.Users should bear in mind that the deadline for filing a proof of claim on account of a customer claim has passed - Sept. 29, 2023.

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest Reshuffles Portfolio: Trims Coinbase, Buys Reddit - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest recently made two significant transactions involving Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares. The firm, known for its focus on disruptive innovation, sold some of its Coinbase holdings for a profit while simultaneously investing in Reddit’s highly anticipated IPO.



Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest Books Profit on Coinbase, Buys Reddit



ARK Invest, the investment management firm led by Cathie Wood, recently made significant transactions involving Coinbase and Reddit shares. On March 21, ARK sold 199,526 Coinbase shares across three of its ETFs, with the majority (133,533) coming from the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK).



The sale, including shares from the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), amounted to approximately $52.35 million based on Coinbases’ closing price that day. The transaction occurred as Coinbase’s stock price surged above $270, reaching its highest level since December 2021, and is part of a series of significant sales of Coinbase shares by ARK in 2023 and early 2024.



In contrast to the Coinbase sale, ARK Invest acquired nearly 10,000 shares of Reddit on the occasion of the social media platform’s strong market debut.



The firm added 9,982 shares to its ARK Next Generation Internet ETF and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF, with the transaction value amounting to approximately $503,492 based on Reddit’s closing price on the day of the purchase. The acquisition of Reddit shares demonstrates ARK’s interest in the potential growth and innovation of the social media platform as it enters the public market.





Reddit IPO a Success, Closed at $50.44



Reddit’s shares surged 48% on their first day of trading in New York, closing at $50.44 per share after opening at $47. This exceeded the initial pricing of $34 per share set for the IPO.



The company was valued at $6.4 billion post-IPO, raising $748 million through the sale of shares, which decreased from a $10 billion valuation in a private fundraising round in 2021.



Despite not reporting an annual profit since its inception in 2005, Reddit has generated interest by positioning its content as valuable for training artificial intelligence (AI) programs. This includes a reported data licensing deal with Google worth approximately $60 million annually.



The company’s IPO was highly anticipated, having confidentially filed in December 2021, but market conditions delayed the public offering until 2024.



Reddit allocated 8% of its shares to eligible users, moderators, certain board members, and friends and family members of employees and directors. Retail investors were given early access to some shares through various platforms, introducing risks associated with increased price volatility due to the lack of a lock-up period for these investors.



The company’s cultural significance and the “meme-stock” phenomenon of 2021, in which its subreddit “Wallstreetbets” played a key role, contributed to its high profile leading up to the IPO. Its post-IPO performance will be closely monitored to determine its future direction and financial health indicators.







Do you think Reddit has a good long-term potential, or will it be a meme stock? Let us know in the comments below.

Ripple’s chief technology officer and one of the XRP Ledger creators David Schwartz has taken to the X social media network (formerly Twitter) to publish a cryptic tweet. It was a math problem that ultimately equaled 5.Does Ripple CTO's tweet hint at future XRP price?This tweet by Schwartz triggered an enthusiastic response from multiple X/Twitter accounts. The response given to a lot of commentators by the top Ripple executive was “5,” and many XRP enthusiasts preferred to interpret this as Schwartz making a prediction about the XRP price reaching $5 in the future. Perhaps it will once Ripple manages to ultimately win the case against the SEC.When, last year, a major victory in this legal case was obtained and Federal Jjudge Analisa Torres made a ruling that XRP sales on secondary markets do not qualify as sales of securities, XRP soared to the $0.71 level briefly. In the same year, the SEC lost another major case; that one had been initiated by Grayscale to compel the regulator to give serious attention to its filing about converting its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF. This wish was granted on Jan. 11 this year, when Grayscale’s spot ETF was approved along with 10 others, including those issued by BlackRock, Ark Invest and Fidelity.As of this writing, XRP proudly holds the position of the sixth largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization value and is exchanging hands at $0.63214. Over the last 24 hours, the price demonstrated 6.05% growth; however, it was quickly reduced to 4.91% by the decline that followed.David Schwartz develops trading botIn a tweet issued on March 21, the Ripple CTO informed the cryptocurrency community that he had successfully completed the development of a new bot for trading on centralized crypto exchanges.David Schwartz revealed that the bot operates using an algorithm that is similar to the one on which the XRP Ledger's AMM runs.For now, according to Schwartz, the bot is “really rough,” but he is considering adding a GitLab link. The software engineer pointed out that it is too early to tell whether this bot is going to bring high profits. For the time being, he expects he would be able to make approximately 11% per year.

Tether's $5.25 Billion Surge Sparks Speculation, Is This Good for Bitcoin (BTC)?

Tether (USDT), the crypto ecosystem’s dominant stablecoin, has added over $5.25 billion to its market capitalization since the start of March. This boom in stablecoin funding is a good omen for overall market liquidity as it generally provides a baseline that can help meet Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins' demands.For proper reference, the combined spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) market, despite its massive growth thus far this month, has only managed to add less than $4 billion in netflow. That USDT liquidity is higher than the ETF's asset under management (AUM) growth means there is enough stablecoin to fuel both BTC and altcoins' accumulation on exchanges.Based on the current market outlook, data from CoinMarketCap pegs the market capitalization of Tether at $104,056,161,009. This marks a move from around $98.65 billion at the start of the month, with a steady uptrend masked by the short stint consolidation phase recorded through the month.Though this supply figure comes with many speculations of improper reserve backing, Tether has always refuted any related claims, with vocal backing from Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether’s custodian.Tether's relevance on crypto marketSince its creation, Tether has played a key role in bolstering the crypto market’s trading integrity. Many billion dollar trades involving USDT have been recorded lately. Tether’s USDT is hosted on almost every crypto trading platform as it forms a unique pair with the majority of altcoins around.The company behind the stablecoin Tether Holdings is gradually pivoting away from being just a USDT issuer; it is making a push to become a Bitcoin mining entity and developer with extensive investment in the sector. The connection to Bitcoin has sparked conversations around market manipulation, further FUD that the company has tried to vehemently fight off over the past few years.

Worldcoin (WLD) Announces New Step in Response to Criticism - Bitcoin Sistemi


Worldcoin (WLD) announced a new initiative called “Personal Custody” that aims to build additional trust among its users. The initiative will reform how biometric data is handled during the World ID verification process.
Previously, when people signed up for a World ID, they had the option of having their biometric data stored and then encrypted. However, with the Personal Storage application, this option will no longer be available.


Instead, biometric data captured by Orb during World ID verification will be held on users' personal devices, usually a smartphone. Thus, users will have full control over their data, including the option to delete it if they wish.

Tiago Sada, from Tools for Humanity, the altcoin's developer company, said that while Worldcoin has always taken privacy seriously, the private custody initiative is seen as an opportunity to bolster the level of trust felt by potential users who have not yet signed up:






“While previously everything was deleted by default, users now have control over what they do with their data, giving them peace of mind without having to trust absolutely anyone.”

In addition to the private custody move, Worldcoin claims that Orb also aims to promote transparency by making key components of its software publicly available on GitHub.
Worldcoin has been criticized for privacy for scanning people's eye irises and issuing WLD altcoins to users who have not previously registered.

Avalanche continues memecoin push with $1M reward for liquidity providers

The Avalanche Foundation — the organization behind the smart contract blockchain platform Avalanche — is doubling down on memecoins with a liquidity mining incentive program to drive momentum for community-owned coins within its ecosystem. On March 21, the foundation announced “Memecoin Rush,” which provides $1 million in Avalanche (AVAX) tokens as an incentive for traders and liquidity providers of community coins based on Avalanche. The program’s first phase will begin on the decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms SteakHut and Trader Joe. Avalanche said these platforms will “incentivize trading and add liquidity strategies” for community tokens within the network. According to the announcement, rewards will be given to liquidity providers on liquidity pools of memecoins Coq, NoChill, Tech and Kimbo paired with the AVAX token. In addition, Avalanche listed Coq, Kimbo, NoChill, Gec, Tech, Husky, Meow, Kong, Meat and Kingshit as beneficiaries of the incentive program’s vaults. While crypto community figures like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have been critical of memecoin traders, Avalanche seems to have a different perspective. On Dec. 29, it announced that its $100 million culture catalyst fund would be used to purchase memecoin assets based on the network. Source: Vitalik ButerinAvalanche said that memecoins represent the “collective spirit and shared interests of diverse crypto communities” and claimed that they go “beyond mere utility assets.” It also highlighted that the initiative aims to position its blockchain as a network that supports new forms of creativity and culture.Related: Trader fumbles $1M bag after selling a Solana memecoin earlyOn Jan. 24, Avalanche clarified that not all memecoins will get a piece of the $100 million fund. The foundation shared eligibility requirements like having contracts renounced, possessing low ownership concentration among whales and having high levels of liquidity. The Avalanche foundation also said that the project should be a month old at minimum. In March, memecoin on the Solana network hit what a community member described as “peak degeneracy,” with token projects raising over $100 million in just three days. Memecoin founders received millions from March 15 to 18 through a controversial fundraising method called “pre-sales.” With this crowdfunding model, investors send Solana (SOL) tokens to a wallet address, hoping to receive a weighted distribution of tokens once it goes live. However, there is no guarantee that the investors will receive the tokens in exchange for their SOL. Magazine: Real-life Doge at 18: Meme that’s going to the moon

WisdomTree secures NYDFS charter for digital asset custody and stablecoin issuance - Crypto Briefing




Global financial company WisdomTree announced today that it secured the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval to operate as a New York limited-purpose trust company charter. This development allows WisdomTree to engage in digital asset activities, including custody of digital assets and stablecoin issuance.According to a press release published on Friday, this prestigious charter enables WisdomTree to offer fiduciary custody of digital assets, issue DFS-approved stablecoins, and manage stablecoin reserves through its new entity, WisdomTree Digital Trust Company, LLC.WisdomTree Digital Trust Company will initially provide products within the WisdomTree Prime ecosystem, including the WisdomTree Gold Token and the WisdomTree Dollar Token, with reserves maintained under a DFS-approved framework. The charter also grants WisdomTree the ability to serve New York’s retail customers with access to WisdomTree Prime.Jonathan Steinberg, WisdomTree Founder and CEO, is confident in WisdomTree’s ability to regulate the digital asset industry effectively while ensuring the safety of consumers through existing robust regulations.
“The New York State Department of Financial Services is the premier regulator for businesses that engage in digital asset activity. This well-established trust company charter program – which long predates digital assets – is based on bank-grade regulation, allowing us to offer products that capitalize on innovation without sacrificing customer protection,” stated Steinberg.
Will Peck, Head of Digital Assets at WisdomTree and CEO of WisdomTree Digital Trust Company, LLC, emphasized the high compliance standards of a New York limited-purpose trust company, which offers a leading platform for regulated tokenized products and services.
“We have a robust initial product offering and a strong plan to grow in a responsible manner with this charter in New York and through our other licenses across the nation,” stated Peck.
In recent years, some states have created new regulatory frameworks to address the growing popularity of crypto assets. These include limited-purpose charters that allow financial institutions to offer crypto-related services while providing some level of consumer protection through state oversight. An example of a limited-purpose banking charter is the New York Limited Purpose Trust Company Charter. Issued by the state of New York, it allows institutions to act as trustees for digital assets.With the latest regulatory win, WisdomTree joins the ranks of established players like Coinbase, Fidelity, and Gemini. All these companies now hold chartered limited-purpose trust company status, allowing them to act as fiduciaries for digital asset custody under the Banking Law.

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Speaks About Cryptocurrencies: Makes Bizarre "Disinfectant" Comment - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a speech today, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler cited the cryptocurrency industry as a problem area and accused it of avoiding public disclosure by avoiding registration.
Gensler, who has led a legal fight against what he perceives as a largely noncompliant industry during his tenure, has suggested that digital asset businesses are among those seeking to undermine the SEC's disclosure regime. This regime requires companies to register securities and provide investors with information about them.


“There are participants in crypto securities markets who want to avoid these registration requirements,” Gensler said in a speech prepared for an event at Columbia Law School. “No registration means no mandatory disclosure.”

“Many agree that crypto markets could benefit from some disinfectant,” Gensler added. The regulator is currently pursuing various enforcement actions against companies it accuses of failing to register as exchanges and listing unregistered securities, such as Coinbase and Binance. He is also reportedly exploring Ethereum (ETH) and considering classifying the asset as a security, unlike Bitcoin.





Gensler's statement that crypto platforms should be registered may soon be tested. Prometheum, the first firm to launch as an approved, special-purpose crypto brokerage firm, is preparing to open this business to its customers, according to its executives. Coinbase, on the other hand, asked an appeals court to intervene and force the SEC to impose crypto-specific rules.

UN Says North Korea Steals Billions In Crypto To Fund Doomsday Weapons - Benzinga

The United Nations (UN) Security Council has disclosed findings from an investigation into North Korea’s sanction evasion tactics, revealing a significant portion of the country’s foreign currency earnings — approximately 50% — stem from cyberattacks on cryptocurrency-related firms. These cyber operations have inflicted an estimated $3 billion in damages, spotlighting the regime’s reliance on digital theft as a major revenue source.From July 2023 to January 2024, a panel of experts delved into North Korea’s adherence to international sanctions, uncovering sophisticated strategies to bypass these restrictions. While the report carries no legal weight, it paved the way for potential new sanctions by the Security Council and its member states against entities or individuals found in violation.The investigation further highlighted that nearly 40% of North Korea’s expenditures on weapons of mass destruction were financed through revenues from cyberattacks. Defense companies have increasingly become targets, with evidence of hackers linked to the Reconnaissance General Bureau sharing resources and tools more frequently.Additionally, the panel explored allegations of the Islamic organization Hamas utilizing weaponry produced by North Korea. Read Next: Bitcoin, Altcoins Ready For Massive Gains, According To AnalystIsraeli investigations have identified the presence of North Korean missiles and anti-tank arms within Hamas’s arsenal. North Korea has consistently refuted such claims, dismissing them as unfounded.The report also sheds light on North Korea’s continued ballistic missile launches, with at least seven detected in the six months leading up to January 2024. Notably, Japan reported the introduction of a “tactical nuclear attack submarine” capable of underwater assaults.Despite the imposition of economic sanctions aimed at curtailing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions — through fund inflow restrictions and bans on certain imports and exports — the country managed to engage in sanctioned trade activities. These include importing refined petroleum products and exporting luxury goods, leading to a trade volume in 2023 that surpassed figures from the previous year.Read Next: Should You Stay Or Should You Go?

Final Fantasy 15 director says AI, VR, Web3 important for devs ‘whether you like it or not’

Developers should embrace future-facing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and Web3 if they want to stay relevant in the changing gaming industry, says Final Fantasy 15 director Hajime Tabata.Tabata’s comments came during a seminar held by Human Academy featuring former Square Enix president Yoichi Wada and Tabata, who is now the CEO of JP Games. According to a Google translation of a report from Japanese news source 4Gamer, the two gaming industry luminaries discussed the future of gaming with topics ranging from “what is required of creators now" to “these people are not suitable for creators".Creators who haven’t tried generative artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT or dabbled in Web3 and metaverse development won’t be able to keep up with the needs of the industry going forward, according to Wada and Tabata. In reference to these technologies, Tabata said:“It’s important whether you like it or not, but being a game creator is also a service industry, so you can only get paid if you make something that satisfies others and provide it.”The overarching point of the conversation between the two appeared to address the changing landscape and the need for developers to remain both curious and agile as new modalities transform the nature of both game creation and monetization. “To make a game from a management perspective,” said Wada, “you need three things: authorship, craftsmanship, and teamwork.” He added, “If you don’t understand the characteristics of media and the technology related to it, you can’t create proper content.”Under its current president, Yosuke Matsuda, Square Enix has become one of the largest proponents of future-facing technologies among AAA game publishers. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the company pivoted to future tech in 2024 with a promise to modify its organizational structure to support blockchain, Web3, and AI technologies throughout its verticals.

Will Qatar Really Buy Bitcoin (BTC)? Analyst Explained His Opinion - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bitcoin is notable for its volatile price movements and growing acceptance among mainstream investors. But convincing the world's sovereign wealth funds of the advantages of investing in Bitcoin remains a challenge, according to one analyst.
In early March, rumors spread that Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), could potentially invest in the BTC market. This speculation emerged when it was reported that one of the private jets of the Emir of Qatar landed on the island of Madeira for the Bitcoin Atlantis conference.


But Fadi Aboualfa, director of research at Copper, questioned the likelihood of any sovereign wealth fund choosing Bitcoin over fixed income or more traditional assets during its capital allocation. He discussed why sovereign wealth funds would invest in BTC rather than the security of five-year bonds that can offer risk-free returns of 5-6% annually.

When it comes to rumors of QIA's Bitcoin investment, Aboualfa suggested that the country would be better off using its unmined natural gas for Bitcoin mining. “This would be growth in terms of revenue versus the untapped natural resources they already have and the most expensive part of Bitcoin mining,” he added.





However, Aboualfa suggested that BTC could potentially appeal to countries looking to separate themselves from the dollar-dominated global financial system:
“Especially countries that are more dependent on the West for payment networks than they would like may turn to Bitcoin because blockchain and digital assets allow them to reduce geopolitical risks and provide more control. This could eventually lead, in the long run, to a return to monetary sovereignty, which currently only applies to BTC.”

Worldcoin To End Storing Users' Personal Data - Benzinga

Although Worldcoin WLD/USD has always maintained it is highly protective of peoples' biometric data when scanning their eyeballs to prove they are human, the project is now implementing a plan designed to build additional trust. With the implementation of what Worldcoin calls "Personal Custody" when people sign up for a World ID, they will no longer be given the option to have their biometric data stored and encrypted. Now, instead, the biometric data "captured by the orb and used to generate the iris code during World ID verification" will be held on people's own personal devices — in most cases a smartphone — and users then can decide what to do with the data, including deleting it if they choose to. The project's personal custody plan was first teased back in December when Worldcoin announced details for its World ID 2.0, dubbed "a human passport for the internet."Read the full story at The Block.© 2024 Benzinga.com.

JUST IN: Anthropic Makes a Move to Acquire FTX's $1 Billion Stake - Bitcoin Sistemi


Anthropic, a leading artificial intelligence startup, is reportedly currently in the process of raising a new investment round. The company plans to sell the shares of the bankrupt cryptocurrency company FTX for around $1 billion.
However, the company made it clear that it would not accept funds from Saudi Arabia.


The current for-sale stake in Anthropic belongs to FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange that recently declared bankruptcy. FTX bought the shares three years ago for $500 million. Due to recent developments in artificial intelligence, the 8% stake is now worth over $1 billion.
Proceeds from the sale of FTX's shares will be used to refund the cryptocurrency exchange's customers. The transaction is expected to close within the next few weeks.





The shares offered for sale are Class B shares without voting rights. The shares are selling at Anthropic's last valuation of $18.4 billion.
Over the past few years, Anthropic has raised nearly $7 billion from tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, and Salesforce. Anthropic founders Dario and Daniela Amodei reserve the right to object to potential investors.


However, they are not involved in the current fundraising process or discussions with potential investors for FTX's stake.

New EU AML Laws Ban All Anonymous Crypto Payments - DailyCoin


        
The EU has implemented a new law restricting cash transactions to fight money laundering.



The EU has cracked down on money laundering by restricting cash and banning anonymous transactions.



New AML regulations have outlawed unidentified cryptocurrency wallets.
The European Union (EU) has taken a significant step towards curbing money laundering activities by approving anti-money laundering laws (AML). The legislation, which was met with some opposition, aims to restrict both cash and cryptocurrency payments to increase transparency and financial oversight.EU Cracks Down on Cash and Crypto PaymentsThe new regulations, which were greenlit by the majority of the EU Parliament’s lead commission on March 19, establish specific limitations on cash transactions. Notably, any cash payment exceeding €10,000 will be prohibited, while anonymous cash transactions above €3,000 will also be outlawed.Perhaps cryptocurrency payments are the most contentious aspect of the new AML package. Under the new laws, any crypto payments made using unidentified self-custody wallets will become illegal. This applies to any digital wallet, be it mobile, desktop, or browser-based, not operated by a licensed provider.The enforcement of these new AML regulations is slated to begin within three years of their official entry into force. However, Dublin law firm Dillon Eustace anticipates that these laws will be fully operational well before the standard enforcement timeline.One vocal opponent of the new legislation is Patrick Breyer, a member of the European Parliament for the German Pirate Party. Breyer expressed skepticism regarding the effectiveness of these laws in combating crime. MEP Calls Out EU Law’s Impact on Financial FreedomBreyer further emphasized his belief that anonymous transactions are a fundamental human right for achieving individual financial autonomy. Beyond the infringement on privacy rights, Breyer warns of the potential economic and social repercussions of the EU’s war on cash.Public resistance to limitations on cash transactions is not a new phenomenon in Europe. Breyer referenced the “great public outcry” in 2017 when the European Commission previously consulted the public on limiting cash usage.The effectiveness of the new AML legislation in combating money laundering remains to be seen. While some believe it is necessary, others fear it may come at the cost of individual financial privacy and economic freedom.On the Flipside
The legislation might disproportionately affect unbanked individuals who rely on cash for everyday transactions.



The new AML rules may place a significant compliance burden on businesses, especially those dealing with high-value transactions.



The regulations on self-custody wallets could be technologically bypassed by using decentralized exchanges or privacy-focused blockchains.
Why This MattersThe EU’s new AML laws, particularly the restrictions on self-custody crypto wallets, could significantly impact how Europeans interact with cryptocurrency. This crackdown on anonymity raises concerns about user privacy and financial inclusion, potentially stifling innovation and hindering mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies within the EU.Interested in learning more about how the EU’s new stablecoin guidelines work and what they mean for the future of cryptocurrency?

How Solana Stacks Up With Ethereum in One DeFi Key Metric - DailyCoin


        
Solana’s design enables more efficient DeFi applications with less capital locked up.



Solana’s architecture offers faster transactions and parallel processing. 



Network metrics showcase this efficiency.
The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector is at the forefront of blockchain innovation, offering an alternative to traditional financial systems through decentralized applications (dApps). Within this competitive landscape, Solana and Ethereum stand out as leading platforms, each striving to offer the most efficient, secure, and user-friendly environment for DeFi applications.The battle for dominance hinges on several factors, including transaction speed, fees, and scalability. Most recently, a Reflexivity Research report highlighted the importance of capital efficiency in DeFi. Notably, Solana stands out in terms of this key metric, offering better performance for traders than Ethereum. Solana’s Capital Efficiency Outshines EthereumIn March 2024, Reflexivity Research published an analysis highlighting Solana’s significant lead in capital efficiency over Ethereum. This metric is essential in the DeFi space as it indicates how well a blockchain utilizes locked-up value to facilitate economic activity and growth. Capital efficiency, a key metric in TradFi, measures how effectively capital is used to generate revenue and facilitate economic activity. In DeFi, the metric measures the relationship between the total value locked (TVL) and the platform’s economic output, such as trading volume or generated fees.In the first quarter of 2024, Solana was ahead of other chains in terms of the relationship between its DEX volume and TVL. In fact, DEX volume to TVL in that period was at 3.12, compared to Ethereum’s 0.27. This indicates strong capital efficiency. Source: ReflexivityReseachThis metric soared in recent months, thanks to a significant increase in DEX volume, without a comparative increase in TVL. This was in contrast to Ethereum, for which DEX volume to TVL remained largely unchanged. Source: ReflexivityReseachThe report suggests that one of the reasons behind this change is Solana’s architecture. The network supports faster transactions and reduced fees, which means less capital is tied up in transactions waiting for confirmation. Additionally, Solana’s ability to process transactions in parallel significantly boosts its DeFi operations’ efficiency.By requiring less capital to achieve higher levels of economic activity, Solana can potentially attract a wider array of developers and users. In fact, the latest data suggests that Solana is attracting even more activity. Solana’s DeFi Volume Surges in 2024High capital efficiency has already propelled Solana forward, and it has seen a meteoric rise in its ecosystem and trading volume. Solana’s TVL stands at an impressive $3.913 billion, underscoring the substantial amount of assets pouring into its ecosystem.Trading volume has seen a substantial rise, currently standing at $1.792 billion. Moreover, the network collected $4.39 million in fees and generated $2.2 million in revenue over the last 24 hours. Source: DefiLlamaSolana’s impressive metrics in TVL, fees, revenue, and DeFi volume illustrate the platform’s significant competitive edge in the DeFi space. These figures are a testament to Solana’s capital efficiency, where less capital is needed to unlock higher economic activity compared to other platforms. On the Flipside
Low fees on Solana means that many of Solana’s transactions are spam. While this contributes to capital efficiency, it also showcases an issue with the network. 



Reflexivity Research’s report acknowledges that Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem should include the activity on both the mainnet and L2 rollups for a complete picture. 
Why This MattersThe competition between Solana and Ethereum underscores the importance of continuous improvement and innovation within the blockchain space. Read more about Solana’s performance: Solana’s Stellar Rise in 2024: What’s Behind the Success?Read more about Polkadot’s ecosystem: Polkadot (DOT) Embraces Memecoin Mania with $PINK’s Launch

Crypto markets need ‘disinfectant,’ says SEC chair

United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler took aim at crypto industry participants, claiming some avoided registration requirements with the regulator.In a prepared speech released on March 22 for Columbia Law School, Gensler used his closing remarks to criticize crypto firms’ approach to regulatory oversight. The SEC chair spoke in favor of the benefits of mandatory disclosure for market participants, citing Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who said, “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.”“[T]here still are those who would like to whittle away at the SEC’s disclosure regime,” said the SEC chair. “There are participants in crypto securities markets that seek to avoid these registration requirements. No registration means no mandatory disclosure. Many would agree that the crypto markets could use a little disinfectant.”Gensler’s remarks came as the SEC is pursuing several enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including Kraken, Binance, Ripple and Coinbase. Many crypto companies and advocacy groups have called on the SEC to establish clear rules of the road in an effort to keep innovation in the United States.Related: Senators pressure SEC’s Gensler not to approve any more crypto ETFsThe commission has reportedly sent out subpoenas as part of a campaign to eventually classify Ether (ETH) as a security under the SEC’s regulatory purview. In the last two years, the commission has made inroads into approvals of crypto-tied exchange-traded products for U.S. exchanges, including investment vehicles tied to ETH and Bitcoin (BTC) futures and the first spot BTC exchange-traded funds in January.Magazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?

DOGE Landing On X Payments? Twitter Secures 3 More Licenses - DailyCoin


        
X Corp attained three new money transmitter licenses for X Payments.



The peer-to-peer system is expected to include Dogecoin payments.



DOGE slides below $0.15 amid a market-wide drawdown on Friday.
Dogecoin’s future implementation into Elon Musk’s envisioned all-in-one X app comes a step closer to reality, as the social media giant has acquired three new licenses for money transmitter activities in the United States. Preparing the legal groundwork for X’s peer-to-peer (P2P) financial ecosystem, these money transmitter licenses include popular cryptocurrencies.Recently heralded by Musk as “the people’s crypto,” DOGE is a top contender to align with the X’s payment system. Dogecoin’s market value witnessed blitz pumps on several Elon Musk-related endeavors, with DOGE picking up 12% gains on XPayments account inception in January 2024.XPayments P2P: A Game Changer for DOGE?The latest three approved money transmitter licenses allow X Corp to handle cryptocurrency and other digital payments in New Mexico, Oregon, and Illinois on customers’ behalf. Before that, X Corp had successfully secured licenses in 19 other US states, now counting 22 out of 50 states with appropriate regulatory groundwork laid out for the forthcoming product by X.Following the positive news, the top dog coin embarked on a short rally to briefly reclaim $0.16 but slipped below this price range due to an all-around market correction. Losing 6% of the previous gains over the last 24-hour timeframe, DOGE is now exchanging hands at $0.1466, according to CoinGecko. Ultimately, Dogecoin’s inclusion on X could bring tangible utility for a cryptocurrency that started as a joke.On the Flipside
Earlier, X Corp struck a deal with eToro to make cryptocurrency purchases available on X via plugins and widgets provided by eToro’s exchange.



While Dogecoin’s inclusion in the P2P system is plausible due to Elon Musk’s sweet spot for DOGE, Twitter’s staff haven’t confirmed these plans yet.

                        SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor hardware crypto wallets, announced on March 21 that the recent compromise of its X (formerly Twitter) account resulted from a phishing scam and not a SIM-swap attack as earlier suspected.The hardware wallet also shared that only its X social media account was compromised and guaranteed the safety of all wallets for crypto transactions and storage.Trezor Confirms No Trezor Account or Funds Were Compromised
Cryptonews recently reported the breach of Trezor’s X account when popular blockchain and crypto security investigator ZachXBT alerted his 533K followers about the compromise of the hardware wallet page.Soon after, crypto security firm Scam Sniffer detected the suspicious activity and warned crypto traders to steer clear.According to SatoshiLab’s detailed report via Medium, the unauthorized access to their X account was identified at 11:53 PM on March 19, scaling past a series of security protocols, including two-factor authentication (2FA) and a strong password.Nevertheless, the hardware wallet producers stated that all compromises have been resolved, and accounts on its ecosystem were safe.“We want to stress here that the security of all our products remains unaffected,” SatoshiLabs said. “This incident has not impacted or compromised the security of Trezor hardware wallets or our other products. Your Trezor device and Trezor Suite remain safe.”It is worth noting that the hardware wallet’s X account was used to promote a $TRZR presale on the Solana blockchain network during the breach, to deceive traders into sending funds into a Solana wallet.The post also mentioned a new Solana memecoin named Slerf to attract more attention and directed crypto investors to click on a malicious link designed to connect to their wallets and wipe off all assets and funds stored. These posts were deleted shortly after.Popular Web3 security investigator John Holmquist said the hardware wallet breach was due to neglecting to implement two-factor authentication (2FA).This was off the mark, however, as SatoshiLab highlighted that its X account had 2FA and other security measures active. It is still unknown if there will be an impending investigation to identify the perpetrator(s).Trezor Asserts Phishing Attack Was in the Works for Weeks
SatoshiLab further stressed that the official X account breach was a complex and calculated phishing attack that had been in the works for weeks.The company’s investigation revealed that the plan kicked off on February 29, 2024. The bad actors created a faux entity in the crypto sector that convinced members of crypto communities of its high reputation.Although the entity’s name was left out in the report, it was noted that the bad actor participated in genuine crypto conversations to boost its media presence, grew their followership to thousands, and reached out to SatoshiLab’s PR team for an interview with the wallet firm’s CEO.This led to a meeting being set up and a malicious link being shared under the guise of a Calendly invitation. The firm’s PR team member clicked the link and was directed to a page asking for X login details, which raised red flags and halted initial plans for an interview and a suggested reschedule.During the rescheduled meeting, the attacker notified Trezor’s team members of technical issues and urged for a call authorization, which linked the attacker’s Calendly app with SatoshiLab’s X account.The breach then enabled the bad actors to promote fraudulent crypto and malicious links on behalf of the hardware wallet. This was what ZachXBT detected, which made him alert his followers.

LMAX Group CEO Forecasts Bullish Trend: Anticipates Crypto Prices To Surge, Citing Potential $6 Trillion Asset Class - Benzinga

One of the largest ways in which institutions interact with financial markets is through foreign exchange. LMAX Group provides electronic trading opportunities for institutions as well as cryptocurrency trading. CEO David Mercer discussed his views on the future of crypto on CNBC. Mercer said that Bitcoin reaching new highs is "inevitable" because of institutional investment, which outweighs selling pressures. He noted that about 900 Bitcoin are mined per day, which is worth between $60 million and $70 million, as opposed to inflows into the exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which reached nearly $700 million in a single day in early March. According to Mercer, this huge imbalance of supply and demand is driving the price of Bitcoin up.Don't Miss:Additionally, Mercer also discussed the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected in mid-April. This would lower the amount of Bitcoin mined per day by half to around 450, which could further decrease selling pressures and cause Bitcoin to continue going up. However, some, including Mercer, believe that this is already priced into the market. He also made a statement regarding the total size of the crypto market, saying that if "3% of the world's assets go to crypto, that would be a $6 trillion asset class." For reference, the entire crypto market is estimated to be worth around $2.5 trillion. "You should expect most crypto prices to go north from here, and I think that Ethereum and Solana will follow," Mercer said. Looking beyond crypto, Mercer sees tokenization as "the fourth or fifth industrial revolution" and he predicts that "the token economy will be $20 trillion by 2030." He thinks that tokenization is the true underlying benefit of crypto, and he sees Bitcoin as just a "signpost" and a "proof of concept" for tokenization to take off, "which we will be lucky to live through and enjoy." "Based purely on supply and demand … you should see the price of Bitcoin being multiples of what it is today," Mercer said. Though Mercer noted that he is not in the business of predicting, he is basing his idea of Bitcoin going up on the assumption that it will continue to be allocated into standard investment portfolios. This could happen sooner than some expected; the largest pension fund, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), recently submitted a request to explore the viability of incorporating Bitcoin into its investment strategy.  In terms of the potential for spot Ethereum ETFs, Mercer said that "Bitcoin is the store of value … the gold of the crypto market. Ethereum is the utility. The oil of the crypto market." He predicted that the Ethereum ETF would happen and be great for Ethereum and the decentralized economy. Mercer discussed nearly all of the pressing issues relating to crypto, bringing every point back to his bullish stance on the asset class. It will be interesting to see how his predictions play out, particularly his idea that crypto could reach a total market size of $6 trillion. Read Next:

This feature allows users to store their verification data, including images and metadata used for iris code generation, locally on their devices rather than on centralized Worldcoin servers.“Personal data custody, or Personal Custody, means that the information (images, metadata, and derived data) generated at the orb and used to generate the iris code during World ID verification is held on your device,” Worldcoin explained. The shift to personal custody also introduces new use cases. Users can leverage Face Authentication for high-security applications directly on their devices. According to Worldcoin, this approach eliminates data needing to leave the device.Does Worldcoin’s Personal Custody Keep Users Safe?While personal custody is a step in the right direction, there are still avenues through which malicious actors could exploit user data. For instance, If a malicious actor gains physical access to a user’s device, they could bypass security measures (like device encryption) to access the stored biometric data. Moreover, malicious software designed to infiltrate devices could be used to steal the encrypted biometric data. If the malware is sophisticated enough, it could intercept the data during its encryption or decryption process or exploit vulnerabilities in the device’s operating system.The security of personal custody also relies heavily on the encryption of data using public-private key pairs. If a malicious actor obtains the private key, they can decrypt the user’s data. In summary, while personal custody is a step in the right direction, it cannot protect users from all attacks. Data protection still relies both on the network and responsible use by the users. On The Flipside
According to the recent third-party audit commissioned by Worldcoin, the network has fixed its vulnerabilities. The audit came after a significant data breach on the network in April 2023. 



In March 2024, Kenya kept its ban on Worldcoin, despite pressure from the US government. The country cited privacy concerns in its decision. 
Why This MattersWorldcoin’s implementation of personal custody underscores the growing recognition of the importance of user control over personal data in the digital age. However, security challenges remain, even with the new system. Read more about Kenya’s Worldcoin ban: Kenya Reiterates Worldcoin Ban Despite U.S. Govt InterventionRead more about Solana’s major milestone in DeFi: How Solana Stacks Up With Ethereum in One DeFi Key Metric

Buy High, Sell Low: FOMO Made Crypto Trader Lose 6,039 SOL


                            Cryptocurrency traders constantly look for the next big project to yield significant profits. However, not all of their investments result in massive gains.
A recent report by Lookonchain revealed that a trader lost more than $1 million within three days.

When Buying High Doesn’t Result In Selling Higher
According to the blockchain research platform Lookonchain, a crypto trader lost 6,039 SOL over the last three days after FOMO-buying a memecoin. Per the report, the trader bought Slerf (SLERF) for 4,958 SOL, worth around $1 million.
The different transactions occurred when the price hovered between $0.8 and $1.4 on its launch day. A couple of hours later, the trader sold its SLERF tokens, losing 2,793 SOL after the token’s price plunged to the $0.4-$0.6 range, for a loss of $564,000.


Seemingly, the fear of missing out made the trader buy SLERF a second time when the price neared its all-time high (ATH) of $1.30. The address bought 3 million Slerf at $1.17, spending 19,133 SOL, worth around $3.152 million.
At the time, the pending question was whether the trader would profit from this second attempt or lose more money. As Lookonchain reported, the FOMO buyer sold all their SLERF tokens at a loss again, losing 6,039 SOL, worth $1.15 million.
The Slerf token, which has been all over the news for its dramatic launch, saw a significant price decrease of 52.39% from the ATH registered the day after launch. At writing time, SLERF is trading at $0.6351, an 18.4% decrease in the past 24 hours.


A second trader lost 3,731 SOL, worth $775,000, just one hour after buying 790,236 SLERF at its ATH price. The trader then doubled down on its bet and bought another 650,000 SLERF. Unluckily, the token’s price plummeted after both purchases.
Is The Crypto Presale Meta Hand In Hand With FOMO?
To paint an even bigger picture, another crypto trader lost money yesterday after buying a different ‘presale meta’ memecoin. Although the figures are more modest than the other two cases, this trader bought SMOLE and lost 371 SOL. Later, the address spent 2,549 SOL to buy SLERF.


SMOLE, despite only being out for one day, has already seen massive criticism and a 17.1% price drop. At writing time, the memecoin is changing hands at $0.0001499, a 70.39% decrease from its highest price of $0.0005086.
As this might suggest, FOMO seemingly drives memecoin traders’ decisions during this presale meta. The trend has seen hundreds of millions of dollars sent to memecoins, most of which report millions in losses for investors.


Despite experienced traders being able to profit from this trend, the current numbers hint at a considerable amount of traders losing massive figures while trying to catch the next memecoin to go “turbo parabolic,” even if it doesn’t have a long-term roadmap.

Layer-2 Builder Espresso Systems Raises $28,000,000 in Andreessen Horowitz-Led Funding Round - The Daily Hodl


								The blockchain infrastructure project Espresso Systems has raised $28 million in a Series B funding round led by investment giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).
Espresso aims to increase interoperability between Ethereum (ETH) rollups by building a marketplace where rollups can sell the right to build their blocks to bidders.









Rollups are solutions that execute transactions outside of Ethereum’s blockchain but record the transactional data.
Espresso notes that Polygon, Taiko, o1Labs, StarkWare, Offchain Labs and strategic investors from more than 30 ecosystem projects joined their recent Series B round. The project had already raised $32 million between a seed round in 2020 and an Early Stage VC round in 2022.
Says the company,
“This additional funding will help us continue product development, meaningfully invest in the broader rollup ecosystem, and set the stage for the community to ultimately operate and govern Espresso as a fully decentralized, credibly neutral public good for all L2s [layer 2s], from based rollups to validiums. We’ll be hiring aggressively to build out our team and expand our efforts.”
The two primary types of rollups are optimistic and ZK. Optimistic rollups automatically assume transactions are valid, while ZK rollups run computations off the chain and then submit a validity report.
Espresso notes that their marketplace enables proposers to bid on multiple rollup blocks to become shared proposers for multiple chains at the same time, facilitating cross-chain activity.

Will Shiba Inu Outperform Dogecoin In 2024 As The Top Meme Coin? | Bitcoinist.com


								As the crypto bull market rolls around once more, top meme coins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have started vying for the position of best performer once again. The year 2024, despite only being three months in, has already been incredibly interesting in this regard as both meme coins rally to new yearly highs.
Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Price Performance
Taking the year 2024 into account, it seems that Shiba Inu is finally winning the top meme coin battle against Dogecoin. A comparison of prices at the start of the year and now shows that Dogecoin has performed poorly compared to Shiba Inu.

To put this in perspective, the Shiba Inu price started out the year around $0.000009 and then surged more than 400% in March to $0.000044. The price has since retraced since this and returned to the $0.000027 level where it is currently trading now, still a more than 150% increase from where it started the year.
In comparison, the Dogecoin price started 2024 at around $0.08 and then rallied to $0.2 in March. This is less than a 300% increase in the same time period in comparison to SHIB. Then, just like SHIB, the DOGE price has retraced some of its gains and is now trading at $0.15, which is around a 100% increase from where it began the year.
However, when it comes to holding up during a downtrend, DOGE has proven to be the better performer. This is because while Shiba Inu has seen its price fall around 50% from its March highs, the DOGE price has only seen a 25% decline. This suggests that Shiba Inu is the much more volatile option, thus making it more likely to move up faster than Dogecoin. But it also means that the price of SHIB is more likely to crash rapidly compared to the more stable DOGE.
The Rivalry Between SHIB And DOGE
The rivalry between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin goes right back to the launch of SHIB in 2020. SHIB adopted the Shiba Inu dog which is the face of Dogecoin, and after the DOGE price rallied in 2021 due to billionaire Elon Musk’s influencer, SHIB’s position as the “Dogecoin killer” became more prominent.
This piggybacking of the already popular Shiba Inu dog breed made popular by DOGE, as well as a very clever marketing campaign of sending half the total supply to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who proceeded to burn the majority of it, propelled the SHIB price and brought it into the limelight.

Even now, this rivalry continues to wax stronger, with the Shiba Inu team threatening to dethrone Dogecoin as the leading meme coin. In an X post, the Shiba Inu team boasted that the end was close for Dogecoin. The post hinted at major updates coming for the SHIB ecosystem that will help to solidify its position as the leading meme coin.
Nevertheless, Dogecoin remains the leading meme coin for now with a market cap of $22.8 billion. This puts it ahead of Shiba Inu which is the second-largest meme coin with a market cap of $16 billion.

Cryptocurrency Investment Company, Taking Loss for the First Time, Moves All of Its Altcoins to Binance - Bitcoin Sistemi

DWF Labs, a well-known market maker in the cryptocurrency market, has reportedly deposited all BEAM altcoins to Binance.
DWF Labs moved all of its assets worth 130.8 million BEAM ($4.31 million) to the stock market at $0.03296.


Interestingly, just a week ago, on March 15, 2024, DWF Labs had withdrawn these BEAM tokens from Binance at an average price of $0.03631 ($4.75 million). If the firm's transfer transactions were indeed trades, the company would suffer an estimated loss of $439,000, a decline of 9.23%. This marks the first loss for DWF Labs following the market rally in February.

In other news, a supposed investor known as with the short address 0x6c0 continued to deposit MKR tokens to Binance. In the last deposit, 2,000 MKR ($6.52 million) was deposited to Binance at a price of $3,261 per token. Over the last three days, the wallet deposited a total of 5,500 MKR to Binance, for an average of $3,213 ($17.7 million) per token.





Between December 21, 2018 and December 6, 2023, the wallet purchased a total of MKR 7,496 ($9.63 million) from four unidentified wallets at an average price of $1,285. Three of these wallets redeemed their old MKR tokens for new ones through the “MakerDAO: Redeemer” contract, and the old MKR tokens were claimed from MakerDAO in 2016.

Orb Eye-Scanning Code Made Open Source by Worldcoin Foundation - Decrypt

Worldcoin Foundation, the organization behind the digital asset protocol developed by OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman, said on Friday that it is open-sourcing “core components” of its Orb technology. In a move meant to foster trust and collaborative development, Worldcoin says anyone can examine the code for its Orb eye scanners.“Open sourcing typically helps to foster trust, transparency and verifiability while also encouraging developer communities to further advance a technology,” a Worldcoin spokesperson told Decrypt. “This builds on the open sourcing of the iris code last late last year and opening up of the hardware nearly a year ago.”Worldcoin is a crypto project separate from OpenAI, intended to establish a global identification standard that proves "personhood" to combat bots. Altman and Alex Blania launched it in January 2023 as Tools for Humanity. In July, Worldcoin launched its WLD token on the Optimism mainnet.Worldcoin’s Orb scans the irises of users to provide a unique "fingerprint," the IrisCode, which is stored on Worldcoin's blockchain. This scan forms the basis of a WorldID linked to the user.Worldcoin has faced controversy over its eye-scanning technology, offering its WLD token in exchange for users letting the company scan their biometric data with the Orb. Security has been another concern, highlighted by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in a post."If even one Orb manufacturer is malicious or hacked, it can generate an unlimited number of fake iris scan hashes and give them World IDs," Buterin warned.The foundation said user privacy is a top priority.“Privacy and security have always been top priorities when building the Orb,” Worldcoin said in its announcement. “Further audits are underway and, combined with open sourcing, reflect the Foundation’s aim to maintain a continuously high level of transparency around privacy and security.”In February, blockchain-based esports platform Community Gaming said it would use Worldcoin’s WorldID to root out cheaters. Community Gaming clarified that the Worldcoin Orb is unnecessary for the company’s WorldID integration.Following the Orb news, Worldcoin's WLD cryptocurrency rose nearly 4% to $8.40—amid variability as large as 10% within the past 24 hours due to the wave of volatility currently hitting the broader cryptocurrency market.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Shiba Inu To The Moon: Crypto Analyst Predicts 300% Surge For SHIB | Bitcoinist.com


								Pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader Xanrox has predicted a significant price surge that could happen for Shiba Inu (SHIB) this year. The crypto trader also provided an opportunity for investors to profit from this move, as he stated an entry point for those interested in getting on the trade. 
Shiba Inu To See A 300% Gain Before Year-end
In a recent analysis, Xanrox expressed his bullishness on SHIB and stated that the “next profit target is 300% away.” He further asserted that the meme coin would “definitely go higher later this year” and that what was important was to catch the “bounce and ride the next wave to the upside.”

Looking at SHIB’s chart, the crypto analyst noted that the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement at 0.00002249 looks like a great level to invest in the crypto token. He added that an Elliot Wave technical analysis is also important for such big moves to get an idea of the full picture. That way, one can see the “full market structure and map of the uptrend.” 
Therefore, Xanrox suggested that investors wait for a bullish flag or pattern or simply set their limit order to buy SHIB lower. This bullish pattern seemed to form not long after as the crypto trader provided further updates in his analysis, noting that SHIB only had one resistance on the way, and that level was at its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845. 
As part of his update, Xanrox also mentioned an entry point for those looking to benefit from this move to the upside. He directed investors to load up their coins at 0.0000212995, suggesting that the 300% move would start from there.
Shiba Inu Could Hit New ATH By July
From the accompanying chart Xanrox shared, he hinted at SHIB rising to as high as $0.00008854 by July. That would see the meme coin set a new ATH with its current ATH at $0.00008845. SHIB’s rise to that price level might just be the beginning of its run in this market cycle, as other analysts have predicted that the meme coin could delete another zero.

One of these analysts is Javon Marks, who predicts that SHIB hitting the $0.000081 price range could set the stage for a further rise to $0.0001553. In the meantime, SHIB investors will have their eyes on crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s prediction that the meme coin could rise to $0.000052. 
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002794, up over 3% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Are Ethereum Spot ETFs Coming? Grayscale Senior Executive Speaks Out - Bitcoin Sistemi


John Hoffman, Head of Distributor Partnerships at Grayscale Investments, discussed the emergence of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, their performance, and Grayscale's important role in the crypto market at a recent NYSE Floor Talk event with Judy Shaw.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a combination of two groundbreaking financial innovations, Bitcoin and ETFs. Hoffman highlighted how ETFs have revolutionized investing by simplifying and making it more accessible, while Bitcoin is the world's leading digital asset with a market capitalization exceeding one trillion dollars.


When asked about his recent performances, Hoffman described a promising trend. Despite a slight initial sell-off following GBTC's listing, Bitcoin's price rose from around $48,000 to over $70,000.
Discussing the recent Bitcoin rally, Hoffman attributed it to Bitcoin's base rarity of only 21 million in existence. He noted that the interplay of supply and demand dynamics is amplified by the new accessibility of Bitcoin investing to a wider range of investors globally.






Hoffman said that they are working on the ETHE product, which they want to turn into a spot ETF:

“Yes, at Grayscale we run the world's largest Ethereum fund, ticker is ETHE. This is not an ETF. However, we have filed 19 b4 to upgrade this to an ETF, similar to what we did with GBTC. So today we are working with regulators and having active discussions about the product. But it's still the world's largest Ethereum fund, and we've seen GBTC go. “This is definitely something we've been thinking about a lot and talking to our clients about their interest in this fund.”

Bitcoin eyes historic seventh consecutive month rally 1

Bitcoin is on the verge of achieving a significant milestone, potentially closing its seventh consecutive month in the green by the end of March. This would mark a historic achievement in BTC’s price history, requiring the cryptocurrency to maintain a price above February’s close of $61,130, according to data from Tradingview.Bitcoin eyes new record as its price holds steady The last time BTC experienced such a sustained uptrend was from October 2020 to March 2021, during which its price surged by an impressive 445% from $10,781 to $58,783. However, following this remarkable rally, BTC underwent a notable correction, declining by 40% over the subsequent three months, dropping from $58,790 to $35,037.Historically, BTC has often faced corrections in the period leading up to halving events. Nevertheless, the current influx of funds from spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could potentially fuel further price increases in the near future. Matthijs de Vries, the founder of AllianceBlock, expressed optimism about this development, mentioning that the constant inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs could serve as a significant catalyst for price growth in the coming days.Moreover, with the BTC halving cycle approaching, bullish sentiment is expected to strengthen further. De Vries also offered a price projection, envisioning Bitcoin settling at $74,000 by the end of Q1. However, recent market movements have seen Bitcoin’s price dip by 6.1% over the past week, with the cryptocurrency currently trading at $64,177 as of 4:30 pm UTC.Market dynamics and price projectionsDespite this short-term decline, BTC has still recorded an impressive 25% gain on the monthly chart. Analyzing historical chart patterns, crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin remains within the “Danger Zone,” a zone typically associated with pre-halving retracements. This suggests that there is a possibility of downside movement in the coming weeks until the halving event.Despite some larger sell-offs by spot Bitcoin ETFs, there are signs of investors “buying the dip.” Bitcoin analyst and CMCC Crest’s managing partner, Willy Woo, highlighted this trend, noting that while ETFs experienced outflows of $1.6 billion during the first dip, the Bitcoin network received net flows totaling $1.1 billion. This indicates that many investors are opting for self-custody solutions and leveraging price dips to accumulate more BTC.BTC’s current price trajectory and market dynamics present a mix of short-term volatility and long-term optimism. Factors such as ETF inflows, halving cycles, and investor sentiment continue to play crucial roles in shaping BTC’s price movements. The coming weeks leading up to the halving event will likely be closely monitored by market participants for further insights into Bitcoin’s resilience and potential for sustained growth.

$167,911,000,000 Added To US National Debt in 20 Days As Citadel CEO Warns Government Spending at 'Borderline Insanity' - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of a $60 billion hedge fund says Americans should be alarmed about the country’s rapidly expanding debt.
New numbers from the Treasury Department show the national debt climbed from $34.393262 trillion on March 1st to $34.561173 trillion on March 20th, a rise of $167.911 billion in just 20 days.










At this point, the rapid pace of the country’s debt accumulation poses a major risk to America’s fiscal future, according to Citadel CEO Ken Griffin.
In a new CNBC interview at the International Futures Industry conference in Florida, Griffin says the lack of daily dialogue about the growing national debt is allowing the government to borrow at a rate that’s irrational and dangerous.
Griffin says no outside entity can or will save the United States from a debt crisis.
“I think the biggest issue that’s not priced in the markets right now is the sovereign risk of US credit… It’s not AAA anymore, I wish it were AAA.
I think it’s just not part of the day-in and day-out dialogue, and that allows Washington to continue to spend at levels that are borderline insanity at this point in the economic cycle.
We’re talking about a budget next year of $7 trillion. Spending is up about 20% in two years. This is just out of control, and unfortunately when your sovereign markets start to put the hammer down in terms of discipline, that could be pretty brutal. There’s no country that’s going to bail America out. We’re going to right our own ship. There’s no IMF for the United States of America.”

RNDR or TAO: Which AI token should interest you today? - AMBCrypto



Demand for open-source AI grew materially in the last few days.
Render and Bittensor may stand to benefit from the same.

Render [RNDR] and Bittensor [TAO] witnessed a massive surge in interest over the last few months due to the growing popularity of AI. However, recently, the hype around the token has died down.
Even though the momentum around AI tokens isn’t the same as it was a few weeks ago, there are other factors that can contribute to RNDR and TAO’s growth in the long term.
Open source AI is the future?
According to new research data, AI users wanted an open-source approach for the creation of AI-related technology.

Apart from this research, major internet figures have also called for the open-sourcing of AI technology. Recently, Elon Musk announced that Grok, X’s LLM tool, had been open-sourced for the public. These factors have shifted the sentiment positively toward open-source AI technologies.
Both Render and Bittensor are open-source technologies in the AI sector that use the decentralized principles embedded in the crypto ethos. As the demand for open-source AI tools grows, so can the interest in both these technologies and subsequently, the interest in their tokens.
However, investment in AI tokens may be a long-term play, as their current price movement wasn’t showing a positive picture.
High correlation
At press time, RNDR was trading at $11.06 and its price had declined by 0.28% in the last 24 hours. In the last few weeks, the price of RNDR had exhibited multiple lower lows and lower highs indicating a bearish trend.
The CMF had also declined to -0.03. A declining Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) suggests that the buying pressure is weakening relative to selling pressure.
It may take significant bullish momentum to reverse the price movement of RNDR and bring it back to $13 levels.

The price of TAO exhibited similar movements in terms of price and also showcased a bearish trend in the last few weeks. Coupled with that, the RSI of TAO had plummeted indicating that there was no bullish momentum behind this token.
The price movement of both TAO and RNDR showed extreme co-relation which is very common for tokens in the AI sector and they may show similar price movement going forward as well.

Bitcoin traders anticipate price drop below $50,000, options data show - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin traders are preparing for a potential extended decline in the token’s price, with options data suggesting a bearish outlook in the near term, according to crypto options exchange Deribit.The volume of Bitcoin put options expiring on March 29 has exceeded call options in the past 24 hours. This shift in the put-to-call ratio, a key indicator of market sentiment, signals that traders are bracing for a potential drop in Bitcoin’s price. The strike prices of these put options are clustered around $50,000 and $45,000 on the platform, while Bitcoin traded at around $63,500 on Friday.David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX, attributed the market correction to heavy outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).“Spot ETF net inflows data as of yesterday showed the second four-day streak of outflows since these products launched on January 11,” Lawant told Bloomberg.The pullback in Bitcoin’s price contrasts with the recent rally in the stock market, where traders are more optimistic about the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this year. Bitcoin has dropped over 10% from its all-time high, marking one of the largest retreats this year, as the group of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs is on track to post the biggest outflow since their launch. Over $218 million in bullish bets were liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass.Chris Newhouse, a DeFi analyst at Cumberland Labs, told Bloomberg that while digital assets initially reacted positively to macro tailwinds surrounding the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, a weakening correlation to equities, driven by product-specific outflows and liquidations, seems to have driven Bitcoin and Ethereum lower.The funding rates for perpetual futures, which indicate the level of leverage in crypto trading, remain relatively low after recent bouts of liquidations. This suggests that the current drop in Bitcoin’s price may not be as sharp as previous pullbacks. However, the high level of leverage in long positions accelerated the slump in Bitcoin on Monday, with over $582 million in long liquidations and a total liquidation of over $738 million.Despite the current bearish sentiment in the options market and the recent price decline, some analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. According to a recent report by Bernstein, Bitcoin could be poised for significant gains by the end of the year, with a price target of $90,000.The analysts also view Bitcoin miners as attractive investments for equity investors, citing factors such as the new Bitcoin bull cycle and strong exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows.

This Blockchain Game Was Exploited for $4.6 Million Right Before its Launch


																Super Sushi Samurai, a blockchain game native to layer-2 solution Blast, was exploited hours before its much-anticipated gaming product was launched.
The exploit, reportedly orchestrated by a white hat hacker, has resulted in a loss of $4.6 million due to a bug in its smart contract code.
Smart Contract Bug Exploited
According to an announcement from the Super Sushi Samurai team, the exploit was due to a bug in the smart contract code, allowing an unauthorized party to initiate an infinite mint function. This resulted in the creation of an excessive number of tokens that were subsequently sold into the liquidity pool.


CertiK, an on-chain security firm, confirmed the extent of the exploit, stating that $4.6 million worth of tokens were affected. According to CoinGecko data, the exploit led to a 99% token value slippage following an unauthorized token dump. The attacker managed to get 1310 ETH from the token’s main liquidity pool by exploiting the smart contract vulnerability.




Investigations into the incident revealed that an unauthorized party acquired 690 million SSS tokens and initiated a series of transactions through an attack contract designed for this purpose.


Exploiting a vulnerability within the platform’s update function, the attacker duplicated the tokens in their possession 25 times, inflating the quantity to 11.5 trillion, which was then exchanged for approximately 1,310 ETH.
Recovery Efforts
Following the breach, Super Sushi Samurai has actively engaged with its community, providing updates and assurances through its official Telegram channel and other social media platforms.
In an X post, they revealed that the exploit was conducted by a white hat hacker who is currently in communication with their team. The hacker’s message, visible on Blastscan, indicated that it was a rescue mission and plans to reimburse affected users were underway.
They have also disclosed the address containing the compromised funds to facilitate tracking and potential recovery of the lost assets and that they are working with the white hat hacker to ensure the safe return of funds.


Meanwhile, a “post-mortem” update from Super Sushi Samurai outlines the extent of the damage, with negotiations ongoing to reach a resolution that safeguards both users and the white hat hacker involved in the incident.

SUI Surges 28% in 7 Days Despite Slowing TVL Growth - DailyCoin


        
SUI has continued to mount steady gains.



The token’s price performance aligns with the broader market momentum.



Sui has lost its position among the top 10  TVL.
Over the past months, SUI, the native token of the smart contract platform and Layer-1 blockchain solution Sui, has had an impressive run, doubling its year-start trading price and recording new milestones. However, like many, the broader industry volatility has tested the token’s resilience, triggering price fluctuations.   Despite this, SUI has continued to notch gains, experiencing an impressive uptick over the past week.SUI Price Inches Up According to the trading price of SUI on Friday, March 22, the token has shed most of its gains over the past 24 hours. At press time, it was worth $1.79, down approximately 8.9% from its day-high price of $1.902.However, despite its decline, SUI’s current trading price brings its total gains over the past seven days to a healthy 23%, which marks its position as one of the impressive gainers of the week.SUI’s price also marks an approximate 143% increase from its year-start trading range of $0.70 to $0.8, highlighting its bullish momentum and fueling optimism for the token’s potential to regain its all-time trading price of $2.16. The volatility in native token price is not isolated. It coincides with the sluggish trend of the blockchain’s TVL, which experienced an impressive uptick earlier in the year.Sui’s TVL Slows Down, Loses TOP 10 SpotPer the decentralized finance analytics platform DefiLlama today, Sui holds the 12th position among chains by Total Value Locked (TVL).While its present $626 million value represents a 213% increase from its year-start value of $200 million, it underscores a slowing momentum from its previous growth peak, which secured its 9th position on the chart in February 2024.Now surpassing Sui are layer-2 chains Optimism and Base, now holding the 9th and 10th positions with $946 million and $785 million locked, respectively.Find out more about SUI’s performance during the Bitcoin-led rally:SUI Struggles to Reclaim ATH as It Relinquishes Rally GainsTo discover the latest updates in the FTX customers’ claims against Silvergate, read here:What Judge’s Silvergate FTX Fraud Ruling Means in Its Case

Bitcoin Halving to Test Mining Efficiency, Executives Warn

As the Bitcoin halving approaches, industry executives anticipate significant challenges for smaller and less efficient miners, while well-established players are poised to weather the storm with operational efficiency and capital access.Impact on profitability and network feesIn less than a month, Bitcoin miners will experience a reduction in block rewards, expected to substantially dent profitability and income. This looming reality has prompted major mining firms to prepare for the impending halving, which is set to test the resilience of various players in the market.According to Adam Swick, Chief Growth Officer at Marathon Digital, the halving will serve as a litmus test, separating the efficient and well-funded mining entities from the rest. Larger firms with robust operational structures and ample access to capital are expected to navigate the reduced rewards more effectively. However, Swick warns that smaller operations operating on thin profit margins may struggle to survive the halving.Michael Bennet, co-founder of OceanBit, underscores the importance of strategic planning and operational efficiency in the post-halving landscape. Miners burdened with debt and maturing securities are likely to opportunistically sell their holdings to alleviate financial pressure, particularly as competition intensifies and operational efficiency becomes paramount.Historical precedent and adaptationGreg Beard, CEO of Stronghold Digital Mining, points to historical precedent, noting that previous halving events have compelled mining companies to adapt to lower-margin environments. With profitability margins shrinking, miners are expected to adjust their strategies to remain viable in the evolving market.In the face of diminishing rewards, miners must explore avenues to maintain profitability. This may involve strategic selling of Bitcoin holdings or optimizing operational processes to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.Capital structure and debt managementThe significance of sound capital structure and debt management cannot be overstated in the post-halving era. Miners burdened with excessive debt may be disadvantaged, particularly as competition heightens and profit margins shrink.As the Bitcoin halving looms, mining executives emphasize the importance of adaptability and strategic planning. While the event may pose challenges for some miners, it also presents opportunities for those able to innovate and optimize their operations.The Bitcoin halving is poised to test the resilience of miners, with efficiency and access to capital emerging as key determinants of success. As the industry braces for reduced profitability and increased competition, strategic planning, and operational efficiency will be essential for navigating the post-halving landscape. By leveraging historical insights and adapting to changing market conditions, miners can position themselves to thrive in the evolving Bitcoin ecosystem.

New Bitcoin Price Explanations from Billionaire Cathie Wood: "It Could Easily Pass $3.5 Million" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood reiterated her bullish stance on Bitcoin, calling it a “financial superhighway” in her speech at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York today.
Wood, whose company recently became one of the issuers of the spot Bitcoin ETF ARKB, said there are important uses for BTC in emerging markets. He noted that Ark Invest focuses on these markets and the global macro environment, which has been “shocked” by the US Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.


“There are signals that all is not well in the world,” Wood said, referring to countries like Nigeria, which has been one of the biggest adopters of Bitcoin due to the strong depreciation of their currencies. As a result, Wood sees Bitcoin as both a risk-off and risk-prone asset.

Ark's spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB, has become one of the most successful Bitcoin ETFs among the ten funds launched in January. Wood believes Bitcoin's price could easily rise above $3.5 million as more institutions enter the space. However, he refrained from giving a new specific price target.





“Bitcoin has a long way to go,” said Wood, pointing to his previous $1.5 million price target call.

What Judge's Silvergate FTX Fraud Ruling Means in Its Case - DailyCoin


        
The FTX-Silvergate Bank lawsuit will proceed as the court validates investor claims.



A judge has rejected Silvergate Bank’s motion to dismiss.



The sentencing hearing for the convicted FTX founder is fast approaching.
As one of the largest financial fallouts in crypto history, the 2022 FTX collapse resulted in a flurry of legal actions, roping in major institutions and venture firms. In February 2023, a group of FTX investors filed a class action lawsuit against Silvergate, alleging the bank’s involvement in the multi-billion dollar fraud scheme orchestrated by Sam Bankman-Fried.Over a year later, the legal tussle has recently gained momentum as a federal court in San Diego has validated the investors’ claims.FTX-Silvergate Ties Lawsuit ProgressesAccording to a Tuesday filing, US Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro has ordered the advancement of the class-action lawsuit against Silvergate Bank, its parent company Silvergate Capital Corporation, and CEO Alan Lane, which alleged that the defendants hid “the true nature of FTX” from its customers.“This follows the rejection of the bank’s motion to dismiss, filed on June 19, 2023. While Silvergate argued that the bank “conducted significant due diligence on FTX and its related entities, including Alameda,” the court asserted otherwise, emphasizing that Silvergate neglected its “duty of care” to customers.“It was foreseeable that allowing FTX customer funds to be deposited into non-FTX accounts would lead to fraud and harm the owners of those funds,” the filing stated.Judge Bermudez Montenegro endorsed the plaintiff’s claim that Silvergate benefited from the FTX and Alameda’s fraudulent operations, evidenced by the staggering 889% increase in its annual net income.“Before Silvergate went public on November 7, 2019, and before Silvergate attracted FTX as a client, Silvergate had an annual net income of only $7.6 million. By 2021, Silvergate’s annual net income had increased to $75.5 million,” it stated, asserting that  the bank had a strong incentive to conceal the fraud.The judge emphasized that the plaintiffs adequately alleged that the defendants aided and abetted the FTX and Alameda fraud, advancing the case to further scrutinize Silvergate’s involvement in the activities. This coincides with the looming sentencing of FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was also convicted of fraud.SBF on His Way to JailThe upcoming sentencing of SBF has thrust the disgraced crypto mogul under renewed spotlight as questions of his fate linger amid an escalating legal tussle between his lawyers and United States prosecutors.In a sentencing memorandum filed on March 13, prosecutors stated that SBF deserves no less than 40 to 50 hears bend bars. They highlighted his lengthy list of offenses, including wire and securities fraud, money laundering conspiracy, and illegal campaign contributions.Bankman Fried’s legal team however opposed, criticizing the 50 years sentencing proposal as exceeding the judgment necessary to satisfy the goals of his punishment. The legal team emphasized the recommendation does not align with the principles of justice, and is equivalent to “a death-in-prison” sentencing recommendation.SBF is incarcerated in the New York Metropolitan Detention Center, awaiting a sentencing hearing scheduled for March 28, 2024.On the Flipside
While Silvergate announced plans to wind down its operations and liquidate following the FTX collapse, the bank remains liable for its actions and ensuing legal consequences.



Other firms, including  Sequoia Capital, Thoma Bravo, and Paradigm, were also targets of lawsuits following the FTX fallout.



FTX remains indebted to an extensive list of creditors, with over $8 billion in liabilities.
Why This MattersThe ongoing tussle between FTX’s customers and Silvergate highlights the enduring aftermath of the exchange’s implosion, even years later. Additionally, the judge’s validation of the investors’ claims confirms the questionable relationship between Silvergate and FTX, which has significant implications for the bank’s reputation.Read more on the efforts to bag SBF little to no time behind bars:“SBF Is Selfless”: Lawyers Seek Shorter Term with Image Shift Here’s how Bitget is championing advocacy for gender balance in the industry:Bitget’s Gracy Chen Joins UN to Promote Gender Equality

FTX to offload $1B Anthropic stake to pay off bankruptcy debts within weeks - report

Defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX will soon offload its stake in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic worth around $1 billion as part of a deal to pay off its bankruptcy debts, according to a report from CNBC on March 22. Anthropic is currently considering a slate of investors to purchase the stake, per the article, with a deal expected to occur in a time period of “within a couple of weeks.” The report cites sources familiar with the matter who’ve asked to remain anonymous due to the ongoing nature of the financial negotiations. The shares are being shopped through a special purpose vehicle (SPV), according to CNBC’s sources. This is likely due to the fact that FTX is bankrupt, as SPVs are essentially separate corporate legal entities that exist to ensure a parent company can meet its legal obligations in the event of insolvency. Related: US government asks for court approval to sell private jets tied to Sam Bankman-FriedCNBC’s sources also claim that Saudi Arabia has been locked out of contention over alleged national security concerns, however the article doesn’t specify whether this refers only to state investors or if individual or corporate investors from Saudi Arabia or citizens operating companies in foreign territories will be similarly barred. This, despite the fact that the shares are considered “Class B” non-voting shares. As Cointelegraph reported back in February, Delaware Bankruptcy Court Judge John Dorsey ruled in a Feb. 22 hearing that FTX could sell its shares in Anthropic. At the time of the stock purchase, in April of 2022, FTX bought about $530 million in Anthropic shares. But those shares have since nearly doubled in value amid the generative AI boom and are currently estimated to be worth around $1 billion. This news comes just under a week before FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearing is scheduled on March 28. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven fraud counts in November 2023. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams described Bankman-Fried’s crimes as among the biggest financial frauds in U.S. history and “a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the king of crypto.”

Apple Macs Have a Fatal Flaw That Lets Hackers Steal Your Crypto-And There's No Fix - Decrypt

Hackers have a new way to try and steal your crypto—and if you're using an Apple device made in the last half decade, there's not much you can do to mitigate the attack.Security researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Apple's latest computer chips—its M1, M2, and M3 series, which powers all of its latest devices—that could let hackers steal cryptographic keys designed to protect data from disclosure. That includes the keys to software crypto wallets installed on vulnerable Apple devices.The likely target for a malicious exploit would be “high-end users, like someone who has a cryptocurrency wallet with a lot of money,” Matthew Green, a cryptographer and computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University, told author and journalist Kim Zetter. While not a “practical” attack, it could be aimed at web browser encryption—which would affect browser-based applications like MetaMask, iCloud backups, or email accounts.The potential hack has been dubbed the “GoFetch exploit” in an eponymous report released by a team of scientists from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), University of Texas, Austin, Georgia Tech, UC Berkeley, University of Washington, and Carnegie Mellon University. It works by gaining access to the computer's CPU cache through Data Memory-Dependent Prefetchers (DMPs) built into the chips.“In a cache side-channel attack, an attacker infers a victim program’s secret by observing the side effects of the victim program’s secret-dependent accesses to the processor cache,” the researchers said, adding that the experiment was validated using the Apple M1’s 4 Firestorm (performance) cores. “We assume that the attacker and the victim do not share memory, but that the attacker can monitor any microarchitectural side channels available to it, e.g., cache latency.”Today's disclosure is different from the so-called “Augury” pre-fetchers exploit announced in 2022, although it involves a similar mechanism.The researchers said they notified Apple of their findings on December 5, 2023, and that more than 100 days had elapsed prior to the public release of the research paper and accompanying website.In an email, an Apple spokesperson told Decrypt that the company is grateful for the collaborative efforts of researchers and highlighted the significant impact of their work in advancing understanding of specific security threats.While they did not comment further, the Apple spokesperson pointed Decrypt to a developer post by Apple that shows how to mitigate the attack. The recommended workaround could slow down application performance, because it would mean assuming “worst-case” processing speeds to avoid invoking the cache. Further, changes would need to be made by creators of MacOS software, not users.Despite its published post, Apple's response fell short, Zetter says.“Apple added a fix for this in its M3 chips released in [October],” Zetter tweeted, "but developers were not told about the fix in [October] so they could enable it. Apple added an instruction to its developer site on how to enable the fix only yesterday.”For crypto users, that means it's up to wallet makers like MetaMask and Phantom to implement a patch to protect against the exploit. It's unclear if either company has yet made those efforts and representatives for MetaMask and Phantom did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.For now, if you have a crypto wallet installed on a vulnerable Apple device, all you can do is remove the wallet from the device to play it safe. (If you're on an older Apple device with, say, an Intel chip, you're in the clear.)Apple users have long considered themselves safe from malware attacks because of the way MacOS and iOS devices are designed. Nonetheless, a separate report in January, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky sounded the alarm on “unusual creativity” in building malware targeting both Intel and Apple Silicon devices.Kaspersky said the Apple malware targeted Exodus wallet users, attempting to get them to download a fake, malicious version of the software.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

'Real-World' Crypto Asset Project Surges 69% in One Week Amid Rollout of New Blockchain - The Daily Hodl


								The native token of a crypto project focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has surged 69% in the past week amid the rollout of a new private blockchain.
Polymesh (POLYX) is a public blockchain purpose-built for RWA tokenization. The project’s native token, POLYX, is trading at $0.415 at time of writing, up from $0.245 one week ago.










The 192nd-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up 7% in the past 24 hours.
On Monday, the project announced the launch of Polymesh Private, a confidential version of the network’s public permissioned blockchain. Polymesh notes that companies can use the new private permissioned network and then migrate to the public network when ready.
Graeme Moore, head of tokenization at the Polymesh Association, says the new private blockchain will offer “seamless public migration.”
“The vast majority of RWA tokenization by banks and large financial institutions is still taking place on private blockchains. Polymesh Private will meet these players where they are while providing a future-proof tech stack.”
After its gains this week, POLYX is only 16% down from its all-time high of $0.494, which it set back in October 2022.
The token is used for staking, governance and transaction payments on the network.

DEX Screener To Review Moderation Policy Amid Flurry of Racist Memecoins - The Defiant

The platform ensured it won’t be a gatekeeper, but that it’s also not here to spread hate.A proliferation of racist tokens has pushed DEX Screener, a real-time DeFi token analytics platform, to review its token profile moderation policy.“We'll be reviewing our token profile moderation policy in the coming days,” said the platform’s X account, adding that it, “won't be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we're definitely not here to spread hate.”The announcement, made late Friday, March 22, came as a number of unsavory token profiles began popping up on the platform–most of which are surfacing on Solana.Some of these include derogatory terms and symbols based on race and religion, as well as other hateful language.Permissionless for Good or Bad Racist memecoins highlight an odd situation in the cryptocurrency space. For one, it shows an ugly underbelly in the ecosystem, with people interested in creating and purchasing these types of tokens.Meanwhile it also shows the permissionless nature of open blockchains, and the fact the technology enables the freedom to create anything a developer or user wants–for good or bad.Memecoins have taken the cryptocurrency ecosystem by storm in recent months. Some, like DogWifHat and Book of Meme, have climbed the market cap ladder extremely quickly. The former trades for $2.21 with a $2.2 billion market cap, whereas BOME–which reached a $600 million market day in less than two days–now sits at $800 million, trading for $0.01.

Racist Solana Memecoins: Freedom Isn't a Free-for-All - DailyCoin


        
The Solana blockchain is booming with activity.



Some users are launching racist memecoins.



Rumors of psyop and sabotage swirl.
Solana’s network growth has exploded since the market flipped bullish in Q4 2023, culminating in more than 20,000 new coins being created daily. This frenetic pace of innovation has democratized access to blockchain assets like never before. While this effect has birthed smash hit projects like Dogwifhat and BOME, it has also taken a darker twist with the proliferation of bigoted memecoins recently.Bigoted memecoins, such as slur-laden coin tickers and stereotyped imagery, are flooding Solana DEXs, highlighting the double-edged sword of decentralization principles like censorship resistance and permissionlessness. Yet, at the same time, racist memecoins should not be tolerated. Is Solana Racist Now?Trying to understand the rise of racist Solana memecoins, X user @trading_axe wondered whether these tokens align with Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of total freedom prescribed under a truly decentralized system. He argued that the internet has become overly “serious” and lacking “flavor” compared to the early internet, an issue compounded by the “woke agenda.” In @trading_axe’s view, the trend represents a backlash against the absurdity of wokeism and a cry for the return to pre-Google days. While doubting the likelihood of a bigoted token gaining serious traction, @trading_axe contended that their existence demonstrated a willingness to “burn money” to make a provocative point. However, regardless of how racist memecoins are rationalized, there is no getting away from the bad optics foisted on Solana as a result. Recognizing this, “Ethereum Damien” considered whether this trend was a deliberate ploy by Base supporters to damage Solana’s reputation through offensive content. As far-fetched as that seems, this sentiment was echoed by NameGames, who warned concerned Solana holders not to get taken in by the deception. “941” argued that while presenting a poor look, racist tokens emerged on Ethereum in 2017 before its massive rally, stating, “Let nothing shake uw out” from Solana.Although it’s too early to determine where the Solana community goes from here, as demonstrated by the Pepe backlash in 2023, cryptocurrency communities wield the power to shape narratives around ethical transgressions.Freedom of ExpressionThe 2023 Pepe incident, in which Coinbase was forced to retract and apologize for associating the meme with far-right groups, showcased cryptocurrency communities’ power. Despite its creator’s intentions, Pepe was increasingly co-opted by racist online subcultures. However, Coinbase’s attempt to document this faced fierce backlash, with #deletecoinbase trending as users defended Pepe’s broader harmless usage.While Pepe’s creator could not stop fringe groups from adopting the imagery to spread hate, Solana’s racist memecoins represent a deliberate attempt to shock and stir bigotry from inception. This disturbing development was perhaps inevitable after anonymous individuals launched provocative memecoins overtly mocking reviled industry figures like Gary Gensler and Elizabeth Warren.Whether regarded as an offensive social statement or pure profit-seeking, the proliferation of bigoted tokens undermines blockchain’s credibility. It gives no-coiners yet another excuse not to get on board.On the Flipside
Memecoins generally lack fundamentals, making them a high-risk trade.



This dynamic is magnified by racist memecoins, which are highly likely to be pump-and-dumps or rug pulls in the making.



Some racist memecoins have exploded in price.
Why This MattersRacist Solana memecoins lay bare the paradoxical relationship between decentralized technologies and societal norms. Blockchain offers a neutral base pliable to anyone who chooses to build on the tech, whether to solve real-world financial problems or express bigoted ideologies. This underscores that true decentralization comes at a price.Find out more on Solana memecoins post significant losses amid the wider market downturn:Solana Memecoins Drop Across the Board: Is the Party Over?Kyle Davis holds firm in refusing to apologize despite media backlash.

As Bitcoin’s Consolidation Continues, Crypto Analyst Compares BTC’s Movements to Previous Cycles - The Daily Hodl


								With Bitcoin (BTC) falling nearly 7% in the last week, one widely followed crypto analyst believes the correction is all part of the process.
Digital assets trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 705,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC’s downward trend may be a result of a pre-halving peak.










“The consolidation on Bitcoin continues. 
I don’t think we’ll see much spectacle coming from Bitcoin; if we do, it will need to break $70,300.
Above, there is time for new all-time highs, but I suspect we’re still seeing the case of peaking pre-halving. 
Just like any other cycle.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
The BTC halving refers to the quadrennial event when Bitcoin’s mining rewards are cut in half. The next halving is expected next month.
According to the analyst, BTC’s current price chart is similar to the 2016-2017 cycle chart.
“In some way, the price action of Bitcoin is comparable to the 2016-2017 cycle.
Peak four weeks before the halving takes place.
Consolidation and another correction, after which a slow upward grind happens until acceleration 6 months later.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Van de Poppe also claims that BTC’s correction only strengthens his bullish thesis.
“Bitcoin still correcting down. 
My main thesis is that we’ve seen the pre-halving hype and that we’re going to have a long, massive bull market.
Anything in the lower boundaries -> buy opportunity.
Interested in buying dips on altcoins too.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is worth $63,873 at time of writing, down 4% in the last 24 hours.

Montenegrin authorities to release Do Kwon as he awaits extradition: Report

Authorities in Montenegro will reportedly release Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon as local courts decide on his fate over extradition to the United States or South Korea.According to a March 22 report from Montenegrin news outlet Vijesti, Kwon will be allowed to leave prison on March 23 after being held in custody for roughly a year but forced to surrender his travel documents to prevent him from leaving the country. The decision to release Kwon reportedly came from the Council of the Supreme Court, which is set to review a decision that could grant or deny extradition to his native South Korea.Source: VijestiKwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 for using falsified travel documents with his colleague, Terraform Labs’ former chief financial officer Han Chang-joon. Authorities from the U.S. and South Korea filed competing extradition requests to have Kwon face fraud charges in their respective countries, but no final decision has been made.If extradited to the United States, the Terraform Labs co-founder would likely face eight felony charges filed by prosecutors in March 2023. In South Korea, Kwon could face an indictment for fraud and violations of capital markets law. It’s unclear where he will ultimately be extradited, if at all, at the time of publication.Related: Prosecutors request Changpeng Zhao surrender all passports ahead of sentencingProsecutors purportedly plan to confiscate Kwon’s South Korean passport, which authorities applied to revoke in 2022 after the collapse of Terra. He reportedly used a forged Costa Rican passport in Montenegro — which Kwon claimed was authentic — leading to his 2023 arrest. Terraform Labs co-founder Shin Hyun-Seong, also known as Daniel Shin, and others associated with the platform face criminal charges for defrauding investors at trial. Shin stayed in South Korea after the collapse of Terra in May 2022, an event for which the platform faced regulatory scrutiny and contributed to a significant crypto market downturn.Magazine: Decentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century

Crypto market experiences general crash ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin halving 1

The crypto market witnessed a significant downturn on Friday, with major coins like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) experiencing notable price declines. Bitcoin, the leading digital asset by crypto market capitalization, dropped over 4% in the last 24 hours, reaching around $63,400, as reported by CoinGecko.The crypto market sees red ahead of BTC’s halvingThis decline comes after a series of all-time high price milestones, signaling potential volatility ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Investors are closely monitoring the Bitcoin halving event, speculating on whether the current prices adequately reflect its impact. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been associated with increased market volatility, prompting traders to adjust their positions accordingly.Global investment firm AllianceBernstein has expressed a bullish outlook on Bitcoin, predicting a price target of $90,000 by the end of 2024. This optimism is further fueled by the growing activity surrounding Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have contributed significantly to the daily spot market volume, according to Coinbase Asia-Pacific Managing Director John O’Loghlen.On the other hand, another crypto market favorite Ethereum experienced a nearly 6% decline, settling around $3,320. Investors are awaiting a decision from the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding spot Ethereum ETFs. While investment firms like BlackRock and Grayscale have submitted applications for Ethereum ETFs, concerns linger about a potential SEC classification of ETH as security.Digital assets decline amid regulatory concernsThe Ethereum Foundation’s disclosure of an investigation by an undisclosed “state authority” has added to regulatory uncertainties surrounding the cryptocurrency. Solana, amidst its recent surge in meme coin trading activity, faced a sharp 8% decline, dropping to approximately $171. The network has been grappling with congestion issues due to the demand for meme coins, leading to operational challenges.Notable Solana meme coins such as BONK, Dogwifhat (WIF), and Slerf (SLERF) also saw significant price drops in the crypto market. Despite the current crypto market fluctuations, investors remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, driven by factors such as institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and technological advancements.However, ongoing regulatory scrutiny and market dynamics continue to influence price movements and investor sentiment in the crypto space. The performance of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in the cryptocurrency market reflects the complex interplay of various factors. Market participants are closely watching key events such as the Bitcoin halving, regulatory decisions on ETFs, and investigations by regulatory agencies.These developments contribute to market volatility and shape investor confidence in the evolving landscape of digital assets. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, investors and stakeholders navigate through a dynamic environment, balancing opportunities with risks and regulatory compliance. The resilience and adaptability of cryptocurrencies to external factors will continue to shape their trajectory and influence investment strategies in the years to come.

BlackRock Customers Show No Interest in Ethereum ETF


Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, indicated a tepid interest from the firm’s client base in an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), starkly contrasting the growing demand for Bitcoin.
This revelation came during the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York, where Mitchnick shared insights into the company’s digital asset strategy and its reception among investors.
No Interest in Ethereum ETF
Despite the growing interest in various cryptocurrencies, BlackRock’s clientele exhibits a pronounced preference for Bitcoin, relegating Ethereum to the sidelines. Mitchnick’s comments reflect a critical assessment of the demand within the crypto market, suggesting that, aside from Bitcoin, the appetite for other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, remains tepid at best.

“I can say that for our client base, Bitcoin is overwhelmingly the number one focus and a little bit Ethereum,” Mitchnick said. 

BlackRock’s strategic moves in the cryptocurrency market have been closely watched. Especially, following the successful launch of its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) earlier this year. The fund’s rapid ascent to becoming one of the top five ETFs in the market, with an impressive $15 billion in assets, reflects a keen investor interest in Bitcoin. 

This contrasts sharply with the “very, very little” interest in the possibility of an Ethereum ETF.

Still, BlackRock’s journey into crypto has been fraught with enthusiasm and caution. For example, launching a $100-million money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain brought to light the unforeseen challenges of operating within the cryptocurrency market. BlackRock’s Ethereum wallet, intended for legitimate transactions, quickly became a magnet for an array of low-quality meme coins and NFTs.

This incident highlighted the legal and operational challenges that come with embracing blockchain technology, prompting a reevaluation of strategies for managing and securing digital assets.

Floki Inu Roadmap Reveals Plans For Regulated Bank Accounts, FLOKI Faces 17% Downtrend


                            The development team behind the dog-themed meme coin Floki Inu has unveiled its highly anticipated roadmap for 2024, revealing several upcoming features and utility-focused initiatives. 
Notable highlights include the launch of regulated digital banking accounts, integration with the Venus decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, the Floki debit card’s introduction, and the Valhalla mainnet’s upcoming release.
Floki Inu Aims To ‘Bank The Unbanked’
Floki Inu plans to introduce regulated digital banking accounts, enabling users to create and fund bank accounts using FLOKI tokens. 

In partnership with an unnamed licensed fintech company operating in key jurisdictions such as Canada, Spain, Dominica, Australia, and the UAE, these accounts will support SWIFT payments and SEPA IBANs. 
In addition, the upcoming launch of Floki Debit Cards will allow users to link their digital bank accounts to debit cards, providing a convenient and secure way to spend their FLOKI tokens in traditional currencies such as Euro (EUR) and US dollars (USD). 
According to the proposal, the initiative aims to “bank the unbanked” by enabling a broader user base to access traditional banking services using their FLOKI tokens while increasing the utility and adoption of cryptocurrency.
Pending governance approval, Floki Inu also seeks to list its native token, FLOKI, on the Venus Core Pool. This integration aims to unlock deeper liquidity, comparable to established blue-chip cryptocurrencies and allow FLOKI holders to use their tokens as collateral to borrow various assets such as Maker (DAI), Circle’s USDC stablecoin, Binance Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH). 
By integrating Venus Markets directly into Floki’s user interface (UI), the protocol states that users will have frictionless access to the liquidity provided by the platform, further integrating Floki into the decentralized finance ecosystem.
FLOKI-Powered Trading Bot And Valhalla Mainnet Launch
Floki Inu plans to introduce a cross-chain Telegram and Discord trading bot powered by the FLOKI token. This bot will allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on leading blockchain networks. Specifically, 50% of the fees generated will be used to buy and burn FLOKI tokens, increasing their utility and contributing to a deflationary mechanism. 
Finally, the highly anticipated mainnet release of Valhalla, Floki Inu’s flagship utility and metaverse game, will occur. Valhalla on the Mainnet will feature on-chain game mechanics, a PlayToEarn economy, upgradeable NFTs, and an open-world experience.

As of this writing, the FLOKI token has experienced a correction of over 17% in the past seven days, aligning with the overall market trend. This correction has resulted in the current trading price of $0.0002295 for the FLOKI token.
Despite the recent downtrend, it is worth noting that FLOKI has still achieved a remarkable year-to-date gain of 440%. This substantial increase in value has propelled the token’s market capitalization to $2 billion, solidifying its position at the 59th spot among the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the market.

Axie Infinity's Biggest Guild Is Transforming Into a Protocol for ‘Pixels’ and Beyond - Decrypt

As co-founder Gabby Dizon tells it, Yield Guild Games always aimed to be much more than a guild. The vision was to help other groups of crypto gamers unite, collaborate, and thrive together. It just had to start somewhere.“The biggest problem of any platform starting out is that no one really cares about you, right?” he told Decrypt’s GG. “And for us, the way to reach that goal long-term was to be the biggest guild ourselves. And we were able to achieve that with Axie Infinity.”When Axie Infinity’s monster-battling, token-earning model became lucrative amid the crypto and NFT bull run of 2021, play-to-earn gaming suddenly looked like the future. Yield Guild Games was already proving an adjacent business model as the biggest operator of “scholarships,” or lending gaming NFTs to players and taking a cut of their in-game winnings.Investment from Andreessen Horowitz and other VC heavyweights followed, while infamous crypto exchange FTX even “sponsored” Axie players in the Philippines and elsewhere via Yield Guild. But that particular economic model didn’t stay viable for long, and no other crypto game approached Axie’s raging, albeit short-lived momentum.Yield Guild kept building during the brutal bear market, investing in assets for various games, developing infrastructure to support regional sub-DAO organizations, and making plans for a hopeful wave of high-quality crypto games to come.Now those games are arriving, in the form of Pixels and Parallel and others, and Yield Guild Games is starting to showcase its next big evolution: from a guild into a guild protocol.What does that mean? Effectively, Yield Guild wants to be the infrastructure layer to enable all guilds to exist and thrive—both on-chain and in games. Think tokenized credentials and tooling to manage assets and roles, and deep integrations into blockchain games so that players can not only carry those structures into game worlds, but also quest and be rewarded together.“Think about it as the guild system of World of Warcraft pulled out and put on chain,” Dizon said.We’re just now seeing the first real example of that concept in Pixels. It’s the biggest crypto game of the moment, and Yield Guild is once again in a key position to not only benefit from that position but to help others benefit as well.And Gabby Dizon himself is right there to help you out in Pixels. Yield Guild is the official guild partner of Pixels, the blazing-hot social farming game on Ethereum scaling network Ronin—the very same network that powers Axie Infinity. And indeed, Dizon’s smiling, 16-bit visage is there to help you learn about the game’s guild system, which went live this week.Pixels’ guilds are designed to be a literal game-changer, with founder Luke Barwikowski recently telling Decrypt’s GG that he envisions such squads of on-chain gamers giving the game a more competitive edge and helping to disperse resources in the game world. Dizon also said that there will be large-scale quests that only guilds will be equipped to tackle.Every gaming guild today invariably has a Discord server, and some may have a main wallet for holding shared assets. But there’s no common tech stack for managing such groups, and while numerous blockchain games have guild integrations to some level, they can vary widely. Pixels' integration is substantial, and could be a sign of things to come in the industry.Dizon sees gaming guilds as the “small-to-medium enterprises of Web3”—and in his view, they desperately need proper infrastructure to scale.Yield Guild itself endured the Axie boom days of ad hoc guild and scholarship integrations and lived through the hype and crash of the early play-to-earn premise. With that experience under its belt, the firm now is building to help other guilds thrive via transparent, composable, and interoperable on-chain assets and tooling.Yield Guild Games has also amassed a trove of in-game NFT assets across various titles over the years, and Dizon thinks that can complement the protocol.Imagine staking varying amounts of YGG tokens to borrow NFTs, with the more valuable assets requiring a larger stake, thus representing both an investment in and commitment to the protocol. Dizon said that the protocol can also develop something of a “credit rating” for guilds over time, based on their likelihood to honor their revenue share and not bolt with the assets.Yield Guild already has features like quests and achievements launched for various games, but otherwise is currently in the process of building out its on-chain infrastructure. The on-chain guild format will include a multisig wallet for each guild, along with NFT badges and an allowlist that defines roles within the gaming organization. That should launch in Q2 2024.Alongside the integration in Pixels, Yield Guild has had a number of other recent moves, including strategic investment from LongHash Ventures. On Thursday, Yield Guild brought its YGG token to Ronin and held an airdrop to reward Ronin (RON) stakers using its network validator.As Yield Guild aims to develop the infrastructure to power the next generation of crypto gaming guilds, it’s also working closely with game studios to advise them and develop content to help new players learn and thrive. They’re demonstrating how guilds can support games—and fighting the idea that such organizations are purely there to earn and extract.“The narrative of scholarship in Axie Infinity was so strong that people would think, ‘Oh, these guys are just extracting value from the ecosystem,’” said Dizon. “But that often was not true from what I've seen with the guilds that we operate with, actually.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Can Aptos (APT) Price Rally 20% to All-time High Next?


Aptos (APT) price is treading against the broader market cues to consistently post gains on the daily chart.
The altcoin now stands less than 20% away from charting fresh all-time highs, provided APT does not lose this crucial support level.
Aptos Price Finds Support From the Market
Aptos price, trading at $16 at the time of writing, is continuing the bullish trend that began towards the end of February. Despite the prolonged rise in APT by over 80%, the growth remains unstopped and could stay this way.
The first sign of this potential comes from the Average Directional Index (ADX). This indicator measures the strength of a trend to provide a sense of the price’s direction. Values above the 25.0 threshold suggest the active trend is strong and could extend going forward.

This is the case of Aptos price as well, which, in addition to being in an uptrend, is noting strength to its uptrend. Furthermore, investors are likely going to go back to being bullish again as long-term liquidations are now declining.
Read More: An Ultimate Guide to Aptos Cryptocurrency (APT) and Its Network
Long contracts tend to liquidate when the price falls sharply and suddenly, inducing pessimism among investors. This prevents the altcoin from finding support for being bullish again. However, low volumes hint at the bearishness waning, leaving the altcoin open for bullish bets.

Aptos price could benefit from these bullish bets as they would drive the price higher.
APT Price Prediction: Next Stop – All-Time High?
Aptos price is less than 20% away from the all-time high of $19.92. This is the present ceiling reached by APT back in January 2023. Breaching through this barrier would mean that not only has the cryptocurrency formed a new all-time high, but it is also closer to hitting $20.

However, if Aptos price fails to substantially test the $15.68 line as support it could fall through towards $13.61. Losing this level would invalidate the bullish thesis, pushing APT to $12.16

                        Unabomber prosecutor Robert J. Cleary has been given the green light by a U.S. bankruptcy judge to probe law firm Sullivan and Cromwell’s potential conflicts of interests in relation to FTX, according to a Wednesday court filing.What Will Cleary Find in FTX Probe?
Cleary’s appointment by Judge John Dorsey marks a key shift in the examination of the FTX’s collapse, formally reversing his rejection of an independent examiner in February 2023. Sullivan and Cromwell spearheaded the doomed crypto exchange through its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and has since charged over $170 million for its services.Last month, a number of FTX investors filed a class action lawsuit against the law firm, noting Sullivan and Cromwell’s “conduct and participation” in “racketeering activity” with Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchange. Investors claimed that through the firm’s advisement to FTX through 2021 and 2022, Sullivan and Cromwell “placed itself in a unique position to gain deep insight into the FTX entities’ convoluted organizational structure, abject lack of internal controls, and dubious business practice.”Additionally, they alleged that the law firm “vouched for the solvency, safety, and security of the FTX Group up until its very collapse,” misleading customers and investors regarding the exchange.“Despite this knowledge, S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and so agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain,” the filing continued.FTX’s Collapse Prompts Conflict of Interest Concerns
News of Cleary’s approval comes just two months after a federal appeals court mandated the reversal of Dorsey’s February 2023 decision, citing added security to the crypto sector as a whole.“The collapse of FTX caused catastrophic losses for its worldwide investors but also raised implications for the evolving and volatile cryptocurrency industry,” said Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo. “For example, an investigation into FTX Group’s use of its own cryptocurrency tokens, FTTs, to inflate the value of FTX and Alameda Research could bring this practice under further scrutiny, thereby alerting potential investors to undisclosed credit risks in other cryptocurrency companies.”Critics of FTX’s collapse have long called for such an examination, with Senators John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) penning a letter to Dorsey in January 2023 for an “objective investigation.”“As legal counsel is often central to major financial scandals, given their role in drafting financial agreements, risk management compliance practices, and corporate controls, it is perfectly reasonable to have concerns about the impartiality and manner that Sullivan & Cromwell will approach any investigation of FTX with,” the senators wrote.Going Forward with FTX Probe

Big Money Eyes Dogecoin: Whale Activity Explodes 600%


								On-chain data shows whale-related activity on the Dogecoin blockchain has registered a sharp 600% increase over the past month.
Dogecoin Whale Transactions Have Exploded In The Last Month
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, DOGE whales have become quite active recently. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the Transaction Count of transfers on the Dogecoin blockchain with a value of at least $1 million.
Generally, only the whale entities are capable of moving such large amounts with single transactions, so these transactions are attributed to involving these humongous investors.

As such, the total number of transactions taking place on the network every day that are of a size falling in this range can provide us with hints about the behavior of the whales.
When the value of the Transaction Count of moves of this size is high, the whales actively participate in the network. Such a trend implies that interest around the memecoin may be high among these large traders.
On the other hand, low values of the indicator suggest not many large transactions are happening on the blockchain, a potential indication that the whales aren’t paying attention to the cryptocurrency.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Transaction Count for the whales over the past month:

The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
As the above graph shows, this Dogecoin indicator has recently registered a sharp uptrend. “The number of DOGE transactions larger than $1 million increased by more than 600% in the last 30 days!” notes IntoTheBlock.
The analytics firm has also shared a zoomed-out view of the chart for the same metric, which puts into perspective the scale of the recent DOGE whale activity.

The trend in the whale Transaction Count over the past few years | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
It would appear that the recent levels of the Transaction Count of the Dogecoin whales have been the highest that the network has witnessed since May 2021, when DOGE hit its top.
What does the high whale activity mean for the memecoin’s price? Generally, it’s hard to say anything about a price outcome based on the Transaction Count of these humongous entities alone, given that both selling and buying transfers count equally in the metric.
What the indicator’s trend can say, though, is whether the asset is likely to see more volatility in the near future. A large number of whale transactions means a significant shift of volume in the market, which can naturally produce some noticeable fluctuations in the price.

As Dogecoin has been going through high whale activity recently, it may see more volatile price action soon, should whales continue to remain active. However, the direction of this volatility can theoretically take the memecoin in either direction.
DOGE Price
When writing, Dogecoin is floating around the $0.15 mark, down more than 6% over the past week.

Cardano Defies Crypto Downturn: Smart Contract Development Up 170% Year-to-Date | Cryptoglobe


                                
Amid a wider cryptocurrency market downturn that has seen cryptocurrency prices plunge after Bitcoin ($BTC) hit a new all-time high, the smart contract platform Cardano ($ADA) has been seeing its smart contract development skyrocket.



Data from Cardano Blockchain Insights shows a remarkable increase of over 170% in Plutus scripts, the network’s language for building smart contracts, since the beginning of the year.



 This translates to nearly 500 new smart contracts being added to the Cardano network per day, as CryptoPotato first reported. The total number now sits at an impressive 39,000, with a particular emphasis on the newer Plutus V2 iteration.



Plutus is designed with a focus on security and reliability, drawing on principles from functional programming. Plutus V2, however, offers additional features and benefits for developers that include reduced transaction sizes and costs, along with a more flexible and scalable framework for building applications.

A closer look at the figures reveals 6,447 Plutus V1 scripts, representing a modest 2.2% increase since January 1. However, Plutus V2 scripts have skyrocketed by over 300% over the same period, now totalling 32,897. This translates to an average daily addition of 495 new smart contracts, with roughly 82 being Plutus V1 and 413 being Plutus V2.



Cardano’s growth extends beyond smart contracts, as the network has seen a significant rise in user activity over the last 30 days, with the number of active wallet addresses reaching a one-year peak of over 600,000 after surging nearly 40% over that same period.



According to data from Cardano-based decentralized exchange Danogo, the number of active wallet addresses on the network hit a lot of 297,000 back in September 2023, when the price of ADA was trading at $0.24 before a wider cryptocurrency market rally kicked off earlier this year with the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETFs) in the United States.

Ethereum Long-Term Holders Unfazed by SEC Probe, Data Shows - DailyCoin


        
Ethereum long-term holders appear undeterred by the SEC’s probe.



The data suggests that these investors believe ETH’s price will continue to appreciate.



Besides the resilience of long-term holders, key Ethereum on-chain metrics also remain strong.
Following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, speculators immediately turned their attention to Ethereum (ETH), anticipating that the SEC was set to approve ETFs backed by the asset next. Recent reports suggesting that the SEC seeks to label the asset a security, however, have sent hopes of an Ethereum ETF approval diving. Despite the recent uncertainty and market jitters, data suggests that long-term ETH holders are undeterred and even adding to their holdings.More Upside in the Card for Ethereum?On Friday, March 22, IntoTheBlock data shared by the firm’s Head of Research, Lucas Outumoro, suggested that long-term holders who have held ETH for over one year have been unfazed by the SEC’s recent probe of the Ethereum Foundation. On the contrary, the amount of ETH held by this class of investors continues to reach new highs at over 98 million ETH.Chart of ETH Balances by time heldSource: XExplaining the behavior of these long-term ETH holders, Outumoro suggested that they likely believed that the asset’s bull rally had yet to be exhausted."Based on previous market cycles, it appears that hodlers still believe ETH has room to continue appreciating. As we've covered before, Hodlers tend to sell into the later stages of a bull market and begin re-accumulating after 50% drops."Meanwhile, the lack of selling from long-term holders is not the only key metric unfazed by the SEC’s recent probe, as on-chain volumes are also rising.ETH Volumes Tap Highest Level in Over 2 YearsAccording to IntoTheBlock data, ETH on-chain volumes reached their highest level since May 2022 this week at about $12.27 billion. As highlighted by Outumoro, Layer 2 chains dominate with combined transaction numbers on Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, more than double that of the Ethereum mainnet.Chart of ETH transaction volumeSource: XOutumoro suggested that the recent Layer 2 dominance was only likely to continue following the recent Dencun upgrade, which has led to a dramatic decrease in gas fees on these chains.Citing the lack of long-term holders selling and rising volumes, the analyst suggested that the Ethereum ecosystem would likely continue to grow despite recent concerns."Overall, after undergoing a major upgrade, ETH hodlers continue to be bullish. Despite recent headwinds, the data supports continued growth for Ethereum both on layer 1 and layer 2s," he wrote.On the Flipside
Details of the SEC’s probe against the Ethereum Foundation remain unclear.



Some analysts have disputed the growing narrative that the recent SEC probe would automatically lead to a denial of Ethereum ETF applications.



BlackRock recently launched a tokenized fund on Ethereum.
Why This Matters The recent Ethereum data suggests that the crypto market is growing tough skin in response to the SEC’s crypto regulatory efforts. At the same time, the data also supports continued Ethereum growth.Read this for more on the SEC probe:SEC Reignites Ethereum Debate Yet Again: Security or Not?See how Polygon is attempting to simplify EVM DApp development:Polygon (MATIC) Labs To Scale DApp Development With New Tool

Key Technical Indicator Suggests Ethereum ($ETH) Price Could Top $5,400 This Year | Cryptoglobe


                                
Technical indicators suggest Ethereum ($ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could see its price climb above $5,400 this year, according to data shared by a cryptocurrency analyst.



The analysis, based on the Mayer Multiple oscillator, which is calculated “as the ratio between price, and the 200-day moving average” points to the possibility of Ether reaching the upper band of the indicator, as reported.



Ethereum is at the time of writing trading at $3,300 after losing over 10% of its value over the past week amid a wider cryptocurrency market downturn that has seen Bitcoin plunge from a new all-time high above $73,400 to around $62,800 at the time of writing.







Ethereum’s value has recently plunged partly as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly started investigating whether to classify it as a security, with multiple companies having received subpoenas related to the probe.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The SEC’s move casts doubt on the potential approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds this year, which would come after the regulator greenlit the trading of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds that helped the cryptocurrency market rally materialize.



The SEC’s investigation involves demanding documents and financial records from firms regarding their dealings with the Switzerland-based Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit overseeing the blockchain’s governance and development. Sources familiar with the subpoenas said the investigation began after Ethereum’s shift to a Proof-of-Stake network in September 2022.



Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, as reported, has bashed the SEC’s investigation in a strongly-worded response, where he refused the implication that Ethereum’s status is in question. He stressed that millions of Americans hold ETH, underscoring its significance within the crypto space since 2015.



Per Grewal, the SEC is contradicting itself, as senior SEC officials like Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman have previously acknowledged that ETH is not a security. Grewal went further, referencing SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s own Congressional testimony (in July 2018, which was before he became the SEC Chair) classifying ETH as a commodity rather than a security.

Ethereum price clings to key support amid SEC probe and traders’ shifting sentiment

Ether (ETH) price faced a significant setback after encountering robust resistance at the $4,100 mark on March 12. Ether has seen a 9% decline over the past week, underperforming when compared to the broader cryptocurrency market, leading traders to speculate whether the current support level of $3,200 will hold. For context, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell by 2.5% during the same timeframe.Ether/USD, 12-hour price index. Source: TradingViewEther’s bullish prospects hinge on spot Ether ETF approvalFrom a bullish viewpoint, the potential approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) remains a key catalyst. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing the matter, with a final decision anticipated by May 23. However, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart does not consider approval as his base scenario.The recent upgrades to the Ethereum protocol should not be overlooked. The Dencun hard fork, which took place on March 13, aimed at enhancing the network's scalability and improving layer-2 data processing capabilities, is highly sought after by rollup solutions. As a result, transaction fees for most applications on Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base have significantly decreased.Cointelegraph notes that, in theory, Dencun’s enhancements are expected to encourage Ethereum users to embrace layer-2 solutions. Data indicates a surge in 7-day volumes for Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base by 145%, 144%, and 203%, respectively, thereby alleviating some of the downward pressure on Ether’s price that was attributed to high gas fees.It's worth noting that competitors like BNB Chain (BNB) and Solana (SOL) provide significantly lower transaction fees at the base layer, which often appears more accessible to newcomers. Despite the positive impact on Ethereum’s ecosystem, Solana’s decentralized application (DApps) volumes have increased by 57% over the last week, according to DappRadar.Regulatory challenges could adversely affect Ether’s priceThe bearish outlook for Ether’s mid-term price is bolstered by the increasingly complex regulatory environment in the United States. Cointelegraph reported on March 20 that the SEC is scrutinizing companies for possible connections with the Ethereum Foundation, aiming to classify Ether as a security.This move by the SEC was reportedly sparked by Ethereum’s transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake network, with several U.S.-based companies being asked to submit financial records and documents related to their interactions with the Ethereum Foundation.Market experts, including Van Buren Capital and lawyer Scott Johnsson, suggest that the SEC's probe into Ether's status as a security serves as "an additional pretext to deny" the spot Ether ETF applications. However, this perspective is not universally shared, with Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, arguing, "The SEC has no valid reason to reject the Ether ETP applications."To understand if professional traders flipped bearish after Ether’s price decline, one should use the ETH options 25% delta skew as a proxy. A skew metric rising above 7% indicates anticipations of a price drop, whereas a negative 7% skew typically reflects bullish sentiment.Ether 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: LaevitasFrom March 21 to the present, the ETH options 25% skew has increased from 0% to 5%, suggesting a cautious skepticism toward the $3,200 support level. However, one might argue that despite an 11% correction in Ether's price over a week, the skew metric has stayed in neutral territory, showing little sign that bearish sentiment has intensified.Looking at the bigger picture, the Ethereum network maintains its leading position in terms of deposits, with a total value locked (TVL) of $94 billion. The initiative by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, to launch a tokenized asset fund on Ethereum solidifies the network's prominence. Consequently, there seems to be no compelling reason to doubt that Ether's support at $3,200 will break in the near term.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Dogecoin to the Moon? Analyst Predicts Potential 550% Increase for $DOGE Price | Cryptoglobe


                                
A prominent cryptocurrency analyst has recently revealed he is bullish on the price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin ($DOGE), predicting it could surge over 550% from its current levels to reach the coveted $1 mark.



In a recently published video on the Google-owned platform YouTube, pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst DonAlt revealed that he believes DOGE reaching $1 “isn’t too unlikely,” suggesting the cryptocurrency could move up over 550% from its current $0.15 level.




VIDEO




His bullish outlook on Dogecoin, as Daily Hodl first reported, stems from the coin’s recent price action relative to Bitcoin, which he interprets as a sign of strong support as DOGE “kind of dipped back into support on the BTC chart,” he explained.



DonAlt acknowledged potential drawbacks to his bullish thesis, setting a price point of around $0.05 as a level that would negate his optimism. However, he emphasized that the potential reward outweighed the risk, particularly considering that Dogecoin recently traded at a low price of $0.12, which is 20% away from the $0.1 mark that he considered an “optimal” entry point.



As CryptoGlobe reported, another popular pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst, Altcoin Sherpa, noted in a post on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to their over 200,000 followers, that DOGE’s price surge could be partly supported by its “firepower” attributed to it being “king meme” and being supported by Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk to surge over 550%.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Musk has previously expressed his interest in the token and has hinted at its possible integration into his ventures, such as X, which have historically led to DOGE price rises.



The price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency surged in November 2022, for example, when Musk noted that the platform would be supporting payments, fueled by speculation the cryptocurrency – which Musk has said “might be my fav cryptocurrency” – could be a part of the payments system integrated into the platform.



DOGE has historically seen significant rallies over short periods of time. Back in 2021,  search interest for Dogecoin exploded during the cryptocurrency’s massive 10,000% price rally, going from an average of 135,000 monthly searches in April 2020 to 16.5 million in April 2021.



Dogecoin was created back in 2013 as a joke. The cryptocurrency’s community is well-known for taking on philanthropic projects, which included helping charitable organizations. It made headlines in 2014 after raising more than $25,000 worth of DOGE to let the Jamaican bobsleigh team attend the Winter Olympics in Sochi.

SEC Again Delays Decision on Grayscale Ethereum ETF - Decrypt

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission postponed a decision on whether to approve Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust's Ethereum ETF application, the agency said in a document filed on Friday. Its new deadline is May 30.The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 gives the agency has 180 days or six months from when notice of the proposed rule change is published. The Grayscale application was first filed in September, and the agency deferred making a decision in November.“The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,” the SEC said, echoing previous announcements.Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are a type of investment fund that tracks the price of digital assets and is traded on traditional stock exchanges, providing investors a taste of crypto without requiring them to hold tokens directly. A futures EFT focuses on the future price of the asset, versus a spot ETF that tracks the current price in real time.In January after approving 11 Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC delayed its decisionmaking on spot Ethereum ETF application from Grayscale and BlackRock. The next month, the SEC delayed its decision on a joint spot Ethereum ETF application from investing firms Invesco and Galaxy Digital.While the SEC’s decision on Grayscale's Ethereum futures ETF may disappoint cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts, some say the agency's delay is a good thing, allowing for greater adoption of Bitcoin ETFs.“Spot Ethereum ETFs will gather more assets if they launch in December versus if they launch in May,” Bitwise Chief Information Officer Matt Hougan said on Twitter. on Tuesday “TradFi needs more time to digest the Bitcoin ETFs.”The SEC's postponing its Ethereum ETF decision adds to negative pressure pushing the price of Ethereum down. On Friday, Ethereum was down 10.4% for the week and is currently trading at $3,289, according to Coingecko.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

SEC pushes back decision on Grayscale Ether futures ETF

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended the deadline yet again to decide on the approval of digital asset management firm Grayscale’s Ethereum (ETH) Future Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF).In a filing published on March 22, the SEC stated that it will postpone the March 31 deadline to May 30 to decide on whether or not to approve Grayscale's Ethereum Futures Trust ETF, which would focus on investing in Ethereum futures contracts.“The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.”In December 2023, the SEC postponed the approval date for Grayscale's future ETF product, stating that it would seek additional public input regarding whether the ETF should be listed.Related: SEC is attempting to classify Ether as a security: ReportThis came only three months after Grayscale proposed listing and trading shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E in September 2023.Following the listing, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart claimed that Grayscale was using its futures ETF application as a “trojan horse” to influence the SEC's decision into approving its spot Ether ETF.He explained that if the SEC approved Grayscale’s application, it would allow Grayscale to argue for the approval of its spot Ether ETF application.Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart Marchpost on X.Meanwhile, on Jan. 25, the SEC delayed its decision on whether to approve a spot Ether ETF from Grayscale, also opening the application to public comments.Following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, there has been increased skepticism among crypto industry commentators regarding whether the SEC will take a tougher stance on crypto-based ETFs.Cointelegraph recently reported that Capital founder John Lo expects the SEC to put increased scrutiny on all upcoming crypto-based ETFs, especially Ether ETFs:“Scrutiny towards cryptocurrency ETFs has only grown, as you could argue to a certain degree that the SEC was forced to approve the Bitcoin ETFs because of its case with Grayscale. No doubt, the SEC internally views that as a huge loss for themselves.”Other asset management firms are also facing obstacles with their Ethereum ETFs. In separate March 4 filings, the SEC announced that its decision on applications from BlackRock for its iShares Ethereum Trust and Fidelity for its Ethereum Fund would be delayed.Magazine: SEC radio silence on Ethereum ETF ‘not a good sign’ — Bloomberg analyst

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders & Price Top: Glassnode Reveals Pattern


                            The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has explained that Bitcoin tends to reach a potential top when the long-term holders show this pattern.
Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Ramping Up Distribution
In a new report, Glassnode discussed the influence that the BTC long-term holders have on the cryptocurrency’s supply dynamics. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days.
The LTHs comprise one of the two main divisions of the BTC user base based on holding time, with the other cohort known as the “short-term holders” (STHs).

Historically, the LTHs have proven themselves to be the persistent hands of the market. They don’t quickly sell their coins regardless of what is happening in the broader sector. The STHs, on the other hand, often react to FUD and FOMO events.
As such, it’s not unusual to see the STHs participating in selling. However, the LTHs showing sustained distribution can be something to note, as selling from these HODLers, who usually sit tight, may have implications for the market.
There are many different ways of tracking the behavior of the LTHs, but in the context of the current discussion, Glassnode has used the “LTH Market Inflation Rate” metric.
As the report explains:
It shows the annualized rate of Bitcoin accumulation or distribution by LTHs relative to daily miner issuance. This rate helps identify periods of net accumulation, where LTHs are effectively removing Bitcoin from the market, and periods of net distribution, where LTHs add to the market’s sell-side pressure.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC LTH Market Inflation Rate over the past several years:

The value of the metric seems to have been on the rise in recent days | Source: Glassnode
In the chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data for the asset’s Inflation Rate, which is basically the amount that the miners are introducing into the circulating supply by solving blocks and receiving rewards for them.
When the LTH Market Inflation Rate equals 0%, these HODLers are accumulating amounts exactly equal to what the miners are issuing.
This implies that the indicator below the 0% mark suggests the LTHs are pulling coins out of the supply, while it being above is a sign that they are either distributing or just not buying enough to absorb what the miners are producing.
The graph shows that historically, the cryptocurrency’s price has tended to reach a state of equilibrium and potentially even a top when the LTH distribution has peaked.

The LTH Market Inflation Rate has been increasing recently, but it’s yet to reach any significant levels. As for what this could mean for the market, Glassnode says:
Currently, the trend in the LTH market inflation rate indicates we are in an early phase of a distribution cycle, with about 30% completed. This suggests significant activity ahead within the current cycle until we achieve a market equilibrium point from the supply and demand perspective and potential price tops.

Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Could Skyrocket To $3.8M By 2030 Thanks To 'Institutional Green Light' - Benzinga

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has projected a staggering price target for Bitcoin BTC/USD. According to Wood, the cryptocurrency’s price could soar to $3.8 million. What Happened: Wood made this prediction at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on Friday. She attributed this potential surge to the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the introduction of new ETF products, reported Business Insider.Wood’s previous prediction in January suggested that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030. She now believes that if institutional investors allocate just over 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, her projection would surge to $3.8 million in the same time period.See Also: Shiba Inu Blockchain Shibarium’s Meme Coin DAMN Leads Board With 22% Single Day Gains"With this institutional green light that the SEC has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we’ve done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you." Wood’s firm, Ark Invest, was among the 11 companies, including BlackRock and Fidelity, that received approval from the SEC for spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.The introduction of these products has led to a surge in demand, setting new records for inflows into US ETFs and driving up demand for Bitcoin itself. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, anticipated in April, is also expected to create a supply shock, further fueling the current demand-driven rally.Why It Matters: Wood’s recent prediction aligns with her revised expectations for Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. Wood’s forecast also resonates with other experts’ bullish outlook on Bitcoin. An analyst recently predicted significant growth for Bitcoin and altcoins, with Bitcoin potentially reaching close to $100,000 by the end of 2025.Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin has shown resilience. The cryptocurrency, along with other major cryptos, experienced a surge following the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady, indicating a strong market sentiment.Wood’s projection also underscores the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. This trend is in line with the broader shift towards digital assets and blockchain technology, which ARK Invest predicts could reach a total market value of $220 trillion by 2030.Price Action: Bitcoin was trading at $63,990, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin Dip ‘100% Predictable,’ Could Trade Below $60K Before ‘Meaningful Rally Attempt'Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image made via photos on Flickr by WEF and Shutterstock

Solana Meme Coin Mania Breaks Records: DEX Volume Surges, Yet Failed Transactions Hit 72% | Bitcoinist.com


								Solana (SOL) has experienced an exceptional uptrend, with a staggering year-to-date (YTD) surge of 652%. However, the recent surge in meme coins has further amplified the blockchain’s growth narrative. 
Solana-based tokens such as dogfight (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), and Boof of Meme (BOME) have witnessed remarkable growth rates of 574%, 3200%, and 49%, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. 
Nevertheless, this unprecedented meme coin mania has its fair share of ramifications, including increased transaction failures, rising transaction fees, and the dominance of bot-driven activities.
Meme Coin Ecosystem Faces Challenges
The surge in meme coin popularity is evident through the rise in decentralized exchange (DEX) and meme coin volume on Solana. On March 16th, major meme coins like BONK, WIF, TREMP, BODEN, and BOME recorded a cumulative volume of $1.33 billion. 
This surge in trading activity highlights investors’ significant interest and participation in the Solana meme coin ecosystem.
However, the influx of bots seeking to exploit potential opportunities has resulted in a notable increase in failed transactions within the Solana network. 

On-chain researcher and analyst Tom Wan reveals that 72% of the failed transactions can be attributed to bot activities. Although this high failure rate has impacted the network’s efficiency, the effect on organic users has been relatively less severe than bots.

However, as the meme coin frenzy continues to grip Solana, the network has witnessed a substantial increase in average transaction fees. 
While average users can still execute transactions without paying priority fees, Tom Wan highlights that the median transaction fee has tripled from 0.000005 SOL to 0.000016 SOL. As a result, the average transaction fee has risen to $0.065, reflecting increased demand and congestion on the network.
Ultimately, the surge in meme coin trading activity on Solana has brought benefits and challenges. While the DEX and meme coin volume growth signifies the increasing adoption and interest in these tokens, it has also exposed vulnerabilities within the network. 
Solana Surpasses All Other Blockchain Ecosystems
The competition between Ethereum (ETH) and Solana continues to intensify, as the so-called “Ethereum Killer” appears to be the latest to dominate global investor interest, outpacing other blockchain ecosystems. 
According to recent research by CoinGecko, Solana’s growing popularity can be attributed to its recent rally, which has propelled it to reclaim its 2021 highs. 
This resurgence has captured the attention of investors worldwide, who are drawn to blockchain’s potential for innovation and growth. In addition, the success of notable projects within the Solana ecosystem, such as Pyth, has further boosted investor confidence and interest in the platform.

While Solana has emerged as the most popular blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum holds a significant position in the industry. CoinGecko’s data reveals that Ethereum captures 12.7% of investor interest, ranking it as the second most popular ecosystem 2024. 
According to the research, Ethereum’s continued relevance can be attributed to its well-established presence and familiarity among investors. However, attention within the Ethereum ecosystem is increasingly dispersed to layer 2 solutions built on top of the Ethereum network.

With a 5.4% share of investor interest year-to-date (YTD), the third most popular blockchain ecosystem is crypto exchange Binance’s BNB Smart Chain ecosystem.

Currently, the price of SOL stands at $171.80, reflecting a continuation of its price correction over the past seven days, which amounts to a 5% decline. This correction has also persisted over the past 24 hours, with a further decrease of 6.6% in price.

Billion-Dollar Bank Abruptly Freezes Woman’s Account and Refuses To Return Funds, Forcing Her To Rely on Family and Friends for Survival: Report - The Daily Hodl


								An Atlanta woman says a popular US bank abruptly froze her account and refused to let her cash out, leaving her to fend for herself.
Shelley Camp says Green Dot locked her out of her bank account out of nowhere for “unusual activity,” reports the ABC-affiliated news station WSB-TV.










Camp says she was out of town when the bank, which has $4.817 billion in assets and 33 million customers, decided to lock her account.
The move forced her to borrow money from friends and family for basic necessities like food, gas and transportation.
“It’s $640. And it might not seem like a lot. But when it’s the money you got, it’s a lot, you know?” 
Camp says the $640, which was her IRS refund, was in deep freeze with no further explanation until WSB-TV began investigating.
After the news team reached out, Green Dot unlocked the account, stating that it’s deployed “extra fraud protections” for some IRS refunds.
 “The majority of those accounts that required additional verification have now been fully processed, and funds have been received by those customers.”
Similar reports of Green Dot freezing accounts in relation to IRS refunds circulated late last year in Tennessee.
Green Dot Bank is partnered with Walmart and TurboTax and specializes in processing tax refunds for its 33 million customers.
In the first six months of 2023, the bank processed about 13.78 million in tax refunds, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) filing.

Is Your Crypto Safe? Trezor Addresses Concerns Over X Hack


								On March 19, Trezor’s X suffered a security breach that exposed the account’s 200,000 followers to a fake crypto presale. After the alarms were raised, most crypto users stayed vigilant while the hardware wallet company regained control.
Trezor’s team recently published a preliminary report addressing the concerns. The post also explained the elaborate phishing scam that bypassed the company’s security measures.

Is Trezor’s “Unwavering Security” Still Protecting Your Crypto?
After gaining control of the account, the hacker posted a fake presale address for a $TRZR token. Disguised as an “initiative” to help the Slerf community, the post offered a “separate bonus airdrop” from a website linked in the post that redirected to a wallet drainer.
After Trezor regained control of the account, X users expressed their worries about the incident and suggested that the hack was a “bad look” on the security-focused company. However, the company guaranteed that they had “robust security measures.”
We want to clarify that we do not make use of SMS for 2FA, and instead employ more secure methods of authentication.
The company finally addressed users’ concerns in a preliminary report. The hack is possible due to a “sophisticated phishing scam” instead of a lack of basic security measures.
The company is based on “unwavering security,” the post states; as such, all products and internal systems remain unaffected despite the breach.

Statement from Trezor's preliminary report. Source: Medium.com
Sophisticated Phishing Scam Steals Pocket Change
According to Trezor, the ongoing investigation has revealed that “the breach appears to have arisen from a sophisticated and calculated phishing attack that was in the works for weeks.”
The calculated scheme began on February 29 after the attacker posed for a “credible entity” from the crypto industry. At the time of writing, the identity of the impersonated figure was not revealed.
The attacker contacted Trezor’s PR team through X using a “well-crafted social media presence.” The seemingly genuine contact aimed to schedule an interview with the company’s CEO.
According to the report, the attacker and the team had a back-and-forth conversation over several days, which made the efforts to stage a call seem more credible. However, the call agreement led to the click of the link that granted access to Trezor’s X account.
The malicious link was disguised as a Calendly invite that, upon clicking, redirected a Trezor’s team member to a page requesting the X login credentials. The team rescheduled the call as the incident raised red flags.
During the rescheduled call, the attacker pretended to have technical issues and urged Trezor’s team member “to ‘authorize’ joining the call.” This authorization connected the hacker’s Calendly app with the company’s X account. As a result, the attacker gained access to the account and published the now-deleted posts.


The hacker only stole $8,100 from the malicious link redirecting to the wallet drainer.  Impressively, just 0.96 SOL (around $162,4 at writing time’s pricing) were sent to the fake presale address.
Undoubtedly, the attack was a calculated and elaborate scheme that aimed to become a big heist. However, the hacker’s attempt was halted by the crypto community surveillance and the suspicious nature of the unauthorized posts.

Bankers go bonkers as FTX dangles 8% stake in hot AI startup Anthropic

Bankers are actively seeking buyers for FTX’s 8% stake in Anthropic, an AI startup, as reported recently. FTX acquired the 8% stake in Anthropic three years ago for $500 million. However, due to the recent surge in the AI sector, the stake’s value has more than doubled to over $1 billion.FTX’s Anthropic stake – Who wants the share?The FTX estate received approval from a New York bankruptcy court to proceed with the sale of the shares in February. A previous attempt to sell the shares in June 2023 ended up falling through after months of due diligence came to a halt.This artificial intelligence company competes with OpenAI and other similar companies. Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried made a substantial $500 million investment in the company through Alameda and FTX, which resulted in the estate’s stake reaching approximately 8%.Last December, Anthropic aimed to raise $750 million, which would have valued the company at approximately $18 billion. Based on those figures, the investment would have a value of approximately $1.4 billion.According to a court document from Feb, the Debtors have highlighted the importance of having the flexibility to sell their Anthropic Shares at different times and through various means in order to monetize their interest.As per a report from CNBC, which relied on undisclosed sources, Anthropic is actively seeking a buyer to acquire a portion of the company’s ownership. However, they have made it clear that they are not considering investors from Saudi Arabia as potential buyers.As stated in the report, the sale is anticipated to conclude within the coming weeks, with the proceeds being utilized to reimburse FTX investors.In January, lawyers representing FTX stated that the bankrupt exchange plans to fully reimburse customers for their holdings’ value. Disgraced founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been leveraging this fact to argue for a much shorter sentence than the 40-50 years proposed by federal prosecutors.National security concernsDespite Saudi Arabia’s ambitious efforts to diversify its investments through Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030 Initiative,” the country has been prohibited from investing in Anthropic.As per the report, Anthropic founders Dario and Daniela Amodei, who have connections to FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried through the effective altruism community, advised bankers against selling the stake to Saudi Arabia. Both parties have limited involvement in the discussions, but they still have the authority to evaluate potential investors.Anthropic’s decision is said to be influenced by factors related to national security and geopolitical complexities. These factors include Saudi Arabia’s relations with China and its controversial human rights record, which has been brought to attention through incidents like the alleged assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.The AI firm may have concerns about selling the shares to Saudi Arabia due to the fact that AI is seen as a technology with potential risks in both civilian and military applications.Nevertheless, the company has made no effort to prevent other countries from joining the sale, as the UAE’s Mubadala remains a contender. In recent weeks, the US government has expressed concerns regarding the sensitive nature of AI and its potential impact on national security.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has the authority to block foreign investments that are considered a potential risk to national security. They may also choose to intervene in the sale process due to the increased interest from foreign state-backed entities.

Chainlink Clinches #1 TitleOn Friday, March 22, crypto intelligence tracker Santiment crowned Chainlink as the number one blockchain by developer activity, a title Cardano has held for months due to its active developer community. This is the first time Chainlink has ever broken into the top three platforms by developer activity. Chainlink, renowned for its decentralized oracle network, secured the top spot by a narrow margin, registering over 451 daily developer submissions on GitHub in the past 30 days. Meanwhile, Cardano closely trailed behind with 445 daily submissions, showcasing its consistent performance in this metric.Although Cardano has been displaced from its coveted top spot, it remains strong in developer engagement, consistently ranging between 400 and 500 submissions every month.Interestingly, the former leaders of the developer activity leaderboard, Polkadot and Kusama, received quite a dent in their positions, dropping to 6th and 7th place, respectively. The shift opened the door for newcomers like  Status and Optimism, which recorded 434 and 411 daily submissions in the past 30 days, respectively, to claim their spots.On the FlipsideWhy This MattersDevelopers are the backbone of every blockchain protocol and represent activity and innovation on the network.

With a gain of $204 million, the UAE has been placed 38th among the top 50 nations.



Bitcoin is considered the most popular cryptocurrency among investors in the nation.




A recent report unveiled the significant gains in the crypto sector in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the last year. According to a Chainalysis report, the UAE has marked a substantial capital gain of $204 million in crypto investment in 2023.



Though the UAE was only 38th in the top 50 countries with remarkable crypto investment gains, it secured the second rank among the GCC countries. Saudi Arabia, with a gain of $351 million, achieved the first position in the list of GCC countries and the 26th position in the top 50 countries. No other GCC countries were included in the list.









Notably, the United States led the rally with a total gain of $9.36 billion. The United Kingdom secured the second position, marking a gain of $1.39 billion.

The report further highlighted that Bitcoin is the most preferred cryptocurrency by UAE investors. Chainalysis stated, “This asset class delivered strong results for UAE investors, accounting for 70 percent of the total gains they made last year.” Ethereum and Ripple’s XRP secured the second and third positions for the most preferred cryptocurrencies in the UAE. Chainalysis’ Director of Research, Kim Grauer, stated,




The outsized popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum indicates a level of maturity among UAE investors. The community is backing well-established digital assets with steady and proven performance, rather than more speculative cryptocurrencies.




Moreover, the report unearthed the global crypto investors’ gains that totaled  $37.6 billion in 2023. Chainalysis cited, “2023 proved to be a year of strong recovery for global crypto markets, with asset prices and market sentiment rebounding positively after the turmoil of the previous year.”

Will Bitcoin (BTC) Break its $73.8K ATH Before the Halving Next Month?


																Bitcoin’s price has already gone through a massive rally in the past six months or so, perhaps fueled first by the hype of the spot ETFs in the US and then the actual demand for those products once they went live.
As such, the asset broke its 2021 all-time high but faced a massive correction after that. With less than a month until the next halving, an event that typically serves as a catalyst for future price movements, we decided to ask Perplexity – a popular AI chatbot that has access to the Internet in real-time, unlike ChatGPT – whether BTC will tap another ATH in the following weeks.
New ATH Before the Halving?
Ever since BlackRock filed to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US last June, the sentiment in the community changed, and the market experienced a long-overdue resurgence. Bitcoin struggled at well below $30,000 but gained more than 50% in the next months and doubled its price when the actual ETFs were approved in mid-January this year.
The bull run continued after a brief hiatus, and the primary cryptocurrency broke its 2021 all-time high of $69,050 in early March. The rally culminated on March 14, when the asset tapped $73,800 to register its current ATH. Since then, though, the bears have been predominantly in control and have pushed BTC south by about ten grand.
The halving is an event that slashes the BTC rewards in half, thus making Bitcoin more scarce. In theory, this should be a highly bullish development for the cryptocurrency, especially if the demand remains the same or increases. History shows that BTC has gone on a tear in the first 6-12 months after each of the previous three halvings.




Consequently, the community expects another rally after the fourth halving, which should take place in 29 days, according to current estimations. But will BTC break its current peak? Perplexity seems to think so.
“Based on the information from the search results, it is highly likely that Bitcoin will break its all-time high price again before the 2024 halving. Several factors contribute to this likelihood, including the positive momentum in the market, the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the anticipation surrounding the upcoming halving event in April.”
How High Can Bitcoin Go?
Despite the recent turnaround in terms of ETF inflows and outflows, these financial assets became a hit among traditional investors and broke numerous records in the first two months after their launch. The demand for BTC led to an impressive bull run for the asset and the entire market, and Perplexity believes there are more gains to be charted in 2024 and 2025.
The AI chatbot said Bitcoin could go to $90,000 this year, based on research from analysts like Bernstein. It could peak within a six-digit price territory of over $122,000, Perplexity concluded.

‘You’re Not Ready for What’s Coming Next’ After Bitcoin Hits $90,000, Says Kevin Svenson - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Cryptocurrency analyst Kevin Svenson is forecasting the path forward for Bitcoin (BTC) over the coming weeks and months.
In a new video, Svenson tells his 73,700 YouTube subscribers that higher levels of volatility will ensue if and when Bitcoin surges by nearly 40% from the current level.










According to Svenson, once Bitcoin confirms the fourth stage of the parabolic curve pattern on the weekly chart, the levels of volatility will rise.
In technical analysis, a parabolic curve pattern has four stages with the fourth phase becoming the launching pad for a breakout towards a higher level that is typically known as the “sell point” or an area where a major correction begins.
Says Svenson,
“What we just saw here was the touch for base four. If we do in fact hit another high, that would be confirmed as base four. We can’t confirm base four until we break out again for the next leg up…
This means that Bitcoin is now looking for that final extension up to the sell point where the chart basically goes fully vertical. Fully vertical up to base four, which according to the textbook is $90,000…
I went into very deep detail about what I think is going to happen after we hit $90,000. If this dip for Bitcoin [from the all-time high of over $73,000 to under $63,000 earlier this month] scared you, you’re not ready for what’s coming next because you’re going to see much, much bigger swings.”
Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube
On what to expect if the volatility levels reach the magnitude experienced in 2017, Svenson says,
“And so if we go to $90,000 and we get a classic 2017 40% dip from $90,000, a punch up to $90,000, a pullback to maybe into the $50,000s, consolidate, run up again into the six figures, a classic 2017 break down of the parabolic trend that then becomes a larger trend, well during that moment your portfolio would drop in half.”
Bitcoin is trading at $63,987 at time of writing.

Is Ether a security? What happens if the SEC says it is?

Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market cap, has been under scrutiny regarding its classification as a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Recent reports indicate that the SEC is considering whether to classify ETH as a security, which has significant implications for the cryptocurrency market and ETH’s ecosystem. This classification debate has sparked discussions within the crypto community and among regulators. If the SEC determines that Ether is indeed a security, it could lead to various outcomes, impacting both the crypto market and ETH’s operations. The consequences may include regulatory compliance requirements, potential legal actions, market volatility, and changes in ETH’s development and usage.Ether’s road ahead is not pleasantThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is debating whether to categorize ETH, the second-largest crypto by market cap, as a security. According to reports, the financial watchdog has issued subpoenas to three organizations as part of a probe into the ETH Foundation, the ecosystem that powers the ETH blockchain network.The announcement follows the SEC’s reluctance to approve spot ETH ETFs, leaving applicants such as Hashdex and ARK 21Shares (pdf) awaiting final rulings in May. While the agency approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, it appears that ETH ETFs will meet regulatory challenges.On February 26, the Ethereum Foundation’s GitHub page stated that the group had “received a voluntary inquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality.”Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, there has been much debate about whether cryptocurrencies such as Ether are a sort of currency, security, or commodity. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who taught a blockchain and crypto course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is well-known for his tough stance on crypto regulation.He has referred to the bitcoin industry as the Wild West, highlighting the necessity for regulation. The SEC’s recent action has jolted the possibility of spot Ethereum ETFs. The ETH blockchain network, which underwent a big upgrade earlier this month, is home to thousands of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and the move is likely to have an impact on the crypto market.SEC decision about ETH could create another XRP situationA number of digital assets lawyers have stated that the Ethereum Foundation’s “voluntary inquiry” disclosed in its GitHub repository is not cause for concern. Subpoenaing cryto companies is a common practice in this market. The Ethereum Foundation’s canary — a reference to “canaries in coal mines,” which signifies whether a government has probed a website — had to be removed ultimately.Shortly after ETH’s proof-of-stake update, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that proof-of-stake chains, which pay users token rewards for locking up their money as a security mechanism, are similar to investment contracts and might be categorized as securities — though he did not mention ETH by name.He has, however, filed lawsuits against a number of US-based and foreign crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, alleging that they were selling securities to US customers without the necessary registrations. These include assets like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL).ETH has never been explicitly identified as a security in an SEC enforcement case, which crypto attorney Ignacio Ferrer-Bonsoms finds incongruous. In a recent blog post, Ferrer-Bonsoms compared ETH to Cardano, arguing that if the SEC believes one to be in violation of securities rules, it must also scrutinize the other.Both the ETH Foundation and the Cardano Foundation raised millions of dollars through token sales to fund network development ($18.3 million in bitcoin and $62 million, respectively); both govern their respective networks through foundations based in Zug, Switzerland; and both distribute tokens to their founders and foundations.A US federal judge recently criticized the SEC’s “gross abuse of power” for “deliberately perpetuating falsehoods” in its dispute with crypto startup DEBT Box. This comes on top of an extraordinary closure by a three-judge appeals panel, which criticized the agency’s yearslong prohibition of spot bitcoin ETFs as “arbitrary and capricious.”In short, if the SEC is attempting to make a case for rejecting spot ETH ETFs by targeting the underlying asset, it must have a strong justification.

ChatGPT Analyzes Which Solana Meme Coins Can Outperform Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 2024


																TL;DR

Solana-based meme coins could potentially outperform Shiba Inu, depending on market support and influential endorsements.
Dogwifhat and Bonk Inu stand out for their recent gains and exchange listings, though overtaking Shiba Inu’s market dominance seems like a tough mission.


What Needs to Happen?
The meme coin sector has recently made serious waves, with its market capitalization briefly surging above $60 billion. Some of the assets of that type generating the most interest due to their impressive price spikes are built on the Solana blockchain. As such, we decided to ask ChatGPT whether one of those can outperform Shiba Inu (SHIB).
The AI-powered chatbot estimated that a flippening is highly “unpredictable and speculative” but still possible, assuming several factors are in place. Bonk Inu (BONK), dogwifhat (WIF), Myro (MYRO), Slerf (SLERF), Book of Meme (BOME), or any other Solana-based meme coins need to generate a solid support from investors and developers and ink vital deals to have any chances.
Recall that Shiba Inu (SHIB) is the meme coin with the strongest community, while Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe Coin (PEPE), and Floki Inu (FLOKI) follow next. 
Technological advancements, favorable market sentiment, and a positive regulatory environment were also mentioned as vital elements. 




Last but not least, ChatGPT reminded that the valuation of a certain meme coin can exponentially head north following endorsement from prominent people, giving Elon Musk’s support toward Dogecoin as example. 
“A new meme coin would need to foster a similarly robust community or receive endorsements from influential figures to challenge Shiba Inu’s position,” the chatbot stated.
WIF and BONK Seem to Have the Best Chance
The Solana-based meme coin with the largest market cap (as of the moment of writing these lines) is dogwifhat (WIF). The asset, whose logo represents a dog wearing a beanie, experienced a 520% price increase on a monthly scale.
It also secured listings on leading cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Kucoin, Bybit, and more. WIF also caught the eye of well-known industry participants, including BitMEX’s co-founder Arthur Hayes, who posted a photo of himself wearing a hat (remarking with the token’s symbol). He later highlighted WIF’s spike above the $2 mark, forecasting that the next target could be $10.
Bonk Inu (BONK), which was particularly trending in December last year, is the second-biggest Solana meme coin. Binance, Coinbase, and many other exchanges allowed trading services with the asset, and at one point, its market capitalization neared the $2.5 billion level. 
Still, Shiba Inu has a market cap of over $15 billion, making an eventual flippening quite challenging (to say the least).

Amid a market where meme coins are underperforming today, Book Of Meme BOME/USD stands out as one of the few tokens trading in the green over the past 24 hours.What Happened: In the past 24 hours, Book Of Meme reported a 6.4% surge in its price with a 13.4% rise in the past 24 hours trading volume to $1.5 billion. This is significantly ahead of ‘Dogecoin Killer' Shiba Inu's SHIB/USD trading volume of $1.2 billion. BOME currently stands at the second-highest trading volume position on the meme coin board.Last week, Binance announced that it will list BOME for users on its spot market and futures platform from March 23. It will be applying a seed tag to its BOME spot listing as the asset might be prone to higher volatility. The largest exchange by volume will be introducing a USDT-margined BOME Perpetual Contract, offering leverage of up to 50x.The BOMEUSDT Contract will have an interesting feature, the Multi-Assets Mode which will enable users to trade across various margin assets, including Bitcoin.Also Read: Biden-Inspired ‘Jeo Boden’ Meme Coin Leaves Behind Dogecoin, Shiba Inu In Monthly Gains, ‘Relevancy Increases’ On Election Narratives Says TraderWhy It Matters: Based on CoinGlass data, BOME's derivatives data analysis highlighted a 30% surge in volume, while open interest is currently standing at $143.4 million, the highest level in quite some time. Meanwhile, liquidations in the past 24 hours stand at $4.16 million, with $2.12 million accounting for long liquidations. These two metrics indicate high interest from traders and an expectation of bullish momentum on the token's price.In his recent post on X, Kyledoops, the host of the technical analysis show on Crypto Banter, commented, With BOME breaking through resistance, it has now established solid support. The price testing at this level suggests a new launching pad for potential gains. Maintaining strength here could indicate a bullish trend ahead.With high trading volumes and a price rally, the newly launched BOME token is quickly catching up to other trending and leading meme coins on the board. Will this be a strong and stable token, or yet another highly volatile token with sudden drops and increases?Read Next: How ‘Meme Coin Sausage Is Made,’ According To Crypto VC: ‘I May Be Everyone’s Exit Liquidity’Bitcoin and altcoins via Shutterstock

From Riches to Rags: Crypto Trader Burns $46,000 on Solana-based Memecoin | Cryptoglobe


                                
A cryptocurrency trader has, while looking to trade lesser-known digital assets on the Solana ($SOL) network, managed a loss of $46,000 in just three minutes after the price of the token, Milady Wif Hat ($LADYF) plunged.



According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the trader invested 300 Solana ($SOL) to buy the cryptocurrency in a trade that went awry, as the token’s price quickly started dropping to the point the trader managed to, in the span of three minutes, sell back their stake for 36.49 SOL.



As Lookonchain points out, this means that the trader lost 263.5 SOL tokens, worth around $46,000, in just three minutes trading the meme-inspired cryptocurrency.







The incident highlights several key factors native to the cryptocurrency space, which include the volatility inherent to it that’s especially present in lesser-known and meme-inspired cryptocurrencies, and the liquidity issues that these newly launched tokens can have, forcing traders to suffer significant losses to slippage.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The trade comes at a time in which the memecoin scene on the Solana network has been surging, with several traders making extreme returns off of newly launched digital assets. In one case, a memecoin saw a dramatic price rise of over 3000% over a 24-hour period, and a cryptocurrency trader managed to take advantage by betting 50 $SOL, worth around $9,000, in the cryptocurrency. Its rise has seen them make a profit of over $123,000.



In another case, a cryptocurrency trader managed to make a profit of over $3 million trading a newly launched Solana-based memecoin within just 12 minutes after betting nearly $2 million on it right after it started trading.



In yet another incident, a trader, identified on-chain by the alias “sundayfunday.sol,”turn a $72,000 investment into a staggering $30 million within just three days trading a little-known cryptocurrency.



Various users on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), have suggested that the traders making such high-risk investments in these newly launched cryptocurrencies are the developers behind them or marketers helping pump the cryptocurrency’s price up so they could later sell the tokens at a higher value.

Bitcoin demand in Argentina reaches highest point in nearly two years

Argentines' efforts to preserve their savings amid the ongoing decline of their national currency, the Argentine peso (ARS), has resulted in the nation recently hitting its highest demand for Bitcoin (BTC) in 20 months, according to a recent report.On March 20, Bloomberg reported data sourced from cryptocurrency exchange Lemon Cash revealing nearly 35,000 customers in Argentina purchased Bitcoin in the week ending March 10, which is double the weekly average compared to 2023.Bitcoin purchases in Argentina Jan 2023 - March 2024. Source: BloombergA major factor for the increase in demand is the ongoing decline of the nation’s currency. Over the past twelve months, the ARS value against the US dollar has plummeted fourfold, dropping from 0.0049 USD per ARS in March 2023 to 0.0012 USD at the time of publication.However, it was noted that Lemon wasn't the only platform seeing a surge in demand. Other major exchanges in Argentina, such as Ripio and Belo, reported similar trends.According to the CEO of the digital wallet Belo, Manuel Beaudroi, stablecoin purchases in Argentina declined from 70% to 60% as Bitcoin's recent price surge attracted more interest.“The user decides to buy Bitcoin when they see the news that the currency is going up, while stablecoin is more pragmatic and many times used for transactional purposes, as a vehicle to make payments abroad.”He also claimed that Belo has seen volume in Bitcoin and Ether increase “tenfold so far in 2024 compared to the same period last year.” However, a recent report suggests that interest in stablecoins might still exist, as Argentines are possibly choosing not to use the well-known exchanges within the country for purchasing them.On Feb. 12 Cointelegraph reported that Argentines are using black market exchanges, known locally as “crypto caves,” to buy USD stablecoins in an effort to escape strict currency controls and the rising inflation of the ARS.Related: Bitcoin eyes 7-month win streak for the first timeMeanwhile, the use of digital currency for specific transactions is slowly gaining traction within the country.In December 2023, Diana Mondino, the minister of foreign affairs, international trade and worship, claimed that a decree aimed at economic reform and deregulation would allow the use of Bitcoin and other cryptos in the country under certain conditions.Following the ruling, a local landlord and a tenant in Rosario, the third most populated city in Argentina,  sealed a rental agreement where the latter would pay monthly rent in Bitcoin.Magazine: Bitcoin ETFs make Coinbase a ‘honeypot’ for hackers and governments: Trezor CEO

Why Bitcoin’s Limited Supply Is Foundational to the Current Surge - The Daily Hodl


								
 
Of the many breakthroughs that Satoshi gave us with Bitcoin, its hard-capped supply and programmatic issuance have always been most captivating to me.
Unlike any other money the world has ever seen, it is impossible to create more of it than the supply schedule dictates.
New Bitcoins are issued every 10 minutes as ‘block rewards’ given to miners as payment for securing the network.
Roughly every four years (210,000 blocks), Bitcoin’s supply issuance is reduced by 50% in an event known as the ‘halving,’ which is set to occur this year around April 20.
The brilliance of this programmed scarcity can be explained with basic supply and demand economics.
Like any new technology, Bitcoin adoption increases with network effects.
As people around the world learn about Bitcoin and want to use it to store and send value to each other, demand for the asset increases exponentially as more people come to the network.
Meanwhile, on the supply side, the amount of Bitcoin being issued every four years is decreasing due to the halving event.
Miners are paid fewer Bitcoin per block and therefore have less to sell to offset their infrastructure costs of securing the network.
The current block reward is 6.25 Bitcoin (900 per day), which will reduce to 3.125 Bitcoin (450 per day) at the halving.
More demand seeking out decreasing supply brings price appreciation, as the only way to acquire Bitcoin is to increase the notional price and incentive for existing holders to part with their Bitcoin.
The SEC approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF and the ease for new capital to access the Bitcoin market has shown these supply and demand mechanics at work.
In less than two months, the Bitcoin ETF launch has shattered all historical precedence for the debut of an ETF product with the cumulative trading volume across all issuers surpassing $141.7 billion.
For perspective, Bitcoin ETF inflows over the past two months have exceeded inflows into all gold ETFs in the past five years.
Even more remarkable, the volume of Bitcoin acquired daily through the ETF is accelerating with net inflows for the week ending March 15, reaching a record $2.57 billion.
Since launch, the ETF has seen average inflows nearly three-and-a-half times larger than the cumulative daily block reward – and ETF demand recently surged to seven-and-a-half times the cumulative daily block reward.
Extrapolating those numbers out post-halving, even with no further acceleration, and we’ll see ETF demand for Bitcoin 15 times larger than the new coins being provided by the network by the block subsidy.
As a result of basic economics, the increase of demand to the market with fixed supply issuance has dramatically impacted the price of Bitcoin, which has increased approximately 61% since ETF approval, at the time of writing, bringing the asset to new all-time highs in US dollar terms.
Appreciation of Bitcoin’s price works as its best marketing tool, as price increases bring more media coverage and more people talking, ultimately drawing more eyes and interest to Bitcoin.
The flywheel of adoption turns faster, resulting in even more price appreciation and the beginning of a new Bitcoin bull market.
While it drives headlines to make price predictions for Bitcoin based on the performance of other Bitcoin bull cycles, I believe such forecasts are misguided.
Never in Bitcoin’s history have we had buying behavior, demand and incentives that can be compared to what we’ve seen with these new ETF products.
Firms like Fidelity and BlackRock are not just using their massive marketing machines to bring their ETFs to customers – they’ve placed them as baskets in their ‘all-in-one funds’ to boost returns.
These funds are automatically contributed to in vehicles like 401ks, IRAs and pensions, bringing a consistent buyer of scale to Bitcoin of the likes that we’ve never seen.
As these funds perform better as a result of Bitcoin’s inclusion, competing funds will have to follow suit to ensure they don’t lose their customer base and increase allocation percentages to bring greater returns.
Expecting Bitcoin price performance to act the same way it has in prior cycles with different participants is likely a mistake.
We have buyers who behave differently, and we won’t truly understand their impact until they’ve weathered another cycle or two.
While there will of course be leverage and speculation with any market cycle, I believe this time it is different.
We’ll see a cascade of corporates, institutions, governments and sovereign wealth funds enter the space as the ETF has brought the asset class both legitimacy and accessibility.
Firms like Microstrategy are showing the game theory Satoshi designed at work, as their first mover advantage to using Bitcoin as their treasury asset has brought a 333% return to the stock in the last six months.
Other CEOs and board members are taking note, with their compensation packages tied to stock performance, and there will be other dominos to fall as a result.
As Satoshi designed, this is basic supply and demand principles at work at a grand scale, and we’re watching the repricing of Bitcoin in real time.
The largest capital allocators in the world are now pawns in Satoshi’s game theory, not wanting to miss out on the first mover advantage to their peers that they’re measured against.
It’s a privilege to be a spectator in such fascinating times as the world wakes up to the significance of scarcity.

European Union Strikes Down Anonymous Crypto Payments


                                EU’s AML Bans Anonymous Crypto Payments to Address Criminal Activity                                In a recent regulatory change in the European Union, The EU’s AML has made the use of unidentified and anonymous self-custody crypto wallets for cryptocurrency payments of any amount illegal and Banned it in Europeon Union. This decision is part of new anti-money laundering laws in the EU.The majority of the EU Parliament's lead commission approved this prohibition as stated in a post by Patrick Breyer. Breyer, a member of the European Parliament for the Deutsch Piraten Partei, was one of the two leaders who opposed the approval. Gunnar Beck, representing the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, was the other Parliament member who voted against it.Why EU Banned Anonymous Crypto Payments?The European Union's recent ban on unidentified cryptocurrency wallets aims to bolster transparency and oversight in financial transactions, making it harder for illicit activities like money laundering and terrorism financing to occur unnoticed. By mandating identifiable crypto payments, authorities can better monitor and track transactions, reducing the risk of criminal exploitation within the crypto space. These regulations align with existing anti-money laundering frameworks, providing a cohesive approach to addressing emerging challenges.While critics raise concerns about individual financial autonomy, proponents argue that the benefits of enhanced security outweigh the right to anonymous transactions. The EU seeks to strike a balance between privacy rights and the imperative of combating financial crime. Enforcement of these regulations is slated to begin within three years, although experts anticipate expedited compliance due to the urgency of improving financial oversight and security.Implications of Banning Anon Crypto PaymentsThe new anti-money laundering (AML) laws in the EU pose several challenges for the crypto ecosystem. Firstly, banning anonymous transactions threatens to diminish privacy and anonymity, key features that attracted users to cryptocurrencies. Secondly, restrictions may hinder financial inclusion by excluding certain groups, impacting both users and developers who rely on privacy features. Additionally, stifling innovation could limit the growth and potential of the crypto space. Finally, the loss of anonymity might deter widespread adoption, affecting trust and investment. Overall, these regulations could lead to economic repercussions, discouraging investment and innovation in the crypto industry.In conclusion, the implementation of the new anti-money laundering law will effectively ban cryptocurrency payments made through self-custody wallets. Most cryptocurrency networks function on permissionless systems, allowing anyone to generate a cryptographic private key for unrestricted access. This characteristic is fundamental to cryptocurrencies' core value proposition, offering a more inclusive, equitable, and accessible approach to finances without discriminating against users.

Solana’s [SOL] decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) has reached its highest level since May 2022, according to DefiLlama’s data.
Source: DefiLlama
At press time, the Layer 1 (L1) network’s TVL was $4.03 billion, having risen by 97% in 30 days. According to DefiLlama’s ranking, Solana is the only blockchain amongst the top 10 DeFi networks that its TVL has risen by this much in the last 30 days. 
Rise in user demand for Solana
The surge in Solana’s TVL is attributed to a recent uptick in user activity on the network. 
According to The Block’s data dashboard, the monthly count of new addresses on Solana has risen to an all-time high. In the past 21 days, the number of unique first signers to transact in the Solana Network has totaled 16.32 million.
Source: The Block
Further, the month so far has been marked by a significant uptick in active address count. AMBCrypto found that this has amounted to 22.19 million, representing Solana’s highest since July 2022.
Due to the rise in user activity on the chain, the total amount of transaction fees paid on Solana climbed to a multi-month high of $5.08 million on 18th March. 
DefiLlama’s data showed that on that day, protocol revenue derived from transaction fees rose to an all-time high of $2.5 million. 
SOL demand trickles in but bearish sentiments rise
SOL exchanged hands at $179 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap’s data. Although impacted by the general market decline in the past week, the demand for SOL continues to outpace coin sell-offs among spot market participants.
AMBCrypto’s readings of the coin’s key momentum indicators showed that they were positioned above their neutral lines at press time. 
For example, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were 61.19 and 80.74, respectively. These values showed that daily traders favored SOL accumulation over distribution.
Further, the coin’s positive Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) value indicated an inflow of liquidity into the SOL market. As of this writing, SOL’s CMF was 0.16.

How much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?

However, despite this, SOL’s Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) indicator hinted at the steady rise in bearish activity, mirroring the decline in bullish sentiment in the general market. 
This indicator identifies potential trend direction and reversals. When its dotted lines rest above an asset’s price, traders take it as a signal to exit long positions or initiate short positions.

Apple Users Beware: Reported Flaw Exposes Mac Users Crypto Private Keys


																A recent study has raised alarms after identifying a vulnerability in Apple’s M-series chips that has the potential to enable hackers to retrieve the cryptographic private keys of Mac users.
In the absence of a direct resolution, the other method suggested by researchers may drastically hamper performance.
Apple M-Series Chips Susceptible to Key Extraction
The vulnerability in question functions as a side channel, thereby permitting the extraction of end-to-end keys when Apple chips execute implementations of commonly employed cryptographic protocols. Due to its origin in the microarchitectural structure of the silicon, direct patching is not feasible, unlike traditional vulnerabilities.
Instead, the report highlighted a fix that relies on integrating defenses into third-party cryptographic software. However, this approach may significantly, “degrade” the performance of M-series chips during cryptographic tasks, especially evident in earlier generations like M1 and M2.
The researchers also added that the exploitation of the vulnerability occurs when both the targeted cryptographic operation and a malicious application, operating with standard user system privileges, are processed on the same CPU cluster.




“Our key insight is that while the DMP only dereferences pointers, an attacker can craft program inputs so that when those inputs mix with cryptographic secrets, the resulting intermediate state can be engineered to look like a pointer if and only if the secret satisfies an attacker-chosen predicate.”
The latest research sheds light on, what is being toouted as, an overlooked phenomenon regarding DMPs within Apple silicon. In certain cases, these DMPs misinterpret memory content, including critical key material, as the pointer value utilized for loading other data. As a result, the DMP frequently accesses and interprets this data as an address, leading to memory access attempts, the team of researchers explained.
This process, known as “dereferencing” of “pointers,” entails reading data and inadvertently leaking it through a side channel, representing a clear breach of the constant-time paradigm.
GoFetch
The researchers identified this hack as a “GoFetch” exploit while explaining that it operates on the same user privileges as most third-party applications, exploiting vulnerabilities in clusters of M-series chips. It affects classical and quantum-resistant encryption algorithms alike, with extraction times varying from minutes to hours depending on the key size.
Despite previous knowledge of similar threats, the researchers said that GoFetch demonstrates a more aggressive behavior in Apple’s chips, posing a significant security risk.

Galaxy Digital Analyst Evaluates the Chance of Ethereum Spot ETFs Approval in May - Bitcoin Sistemi

Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, recently expressed skepticism about the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in May.
The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) failure to actively engage with ETF applicants and recent subpoenas issued to cryptocurrency firms regarding their dealings with the Ethereum Foundation have cast a shadow of doubt over the approval, according to the analyst.


Fortune reported this week that the SEC was “waging an energetic legal campaign” to classify ETH as a security, citing U.S. companies that have received subpoenas related to an investigation.
Thorn, a former Fidelity Investments employee, said that if the SEC sought information about crypto firms' interactions with the Ethereum Foundation, it would consider the original Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014 to be an unregistered security, rather than classifying current secondary trading of ETH as securities trading. He suggested that he might be considering whether he had an offer.






The analyst suggested that the SEC could distinguish between the ICO and existing secondary trading of ETH, but that any enforcement action against the Ethereum Foundation after almost a decade would be “highly unregulated.”
SEC Chairman Gary Gensler declined to comment on whether the agency considers ETH a security. The SEC is reportedly considering Ethereum's 2022 “Merge” upgrade as increasing the likelihood of ETH becoming a security due to the network's transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.


However, the SEC has allowed the launch of several futures-based Ethereum ETFs in 2023, a year after Ethereum's transition to PoS. Therefore, Thorn argued that if the SEC were to pursue securities violations allegations against ETH or the Ethereum Foundation, it would be “treading on difficult terrain in terms of law, regulatory precedent, and impact on an industry that is more than a decade old.”

SEC lacks grounds against ETH: Coinbase CLO - Crypto Briefing




The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is under fire for its perceived lack of clarity regarding Ethereum (ETH). In a recent post on X, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, challenged the SEC’s position, arguing that the SEC doesn’t have sufficient reasons to classify ETH as a security nor justifiable reasons to reject a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).Grewal pointed to several key points about Ethereum, including the widespread adoption of ETH. According to him, classifying ETH as a security potentially impacts several US citizens.The core argument is that “ETH is a commodity, not a security.” Grewal believes Ethereum should not be classified as a security, which would put it under stricter SEC regulations.In support of his argument, Grewal referenced statements from former SEC officials. He highlighted comments by William Hinman, the SEC’s former Director of Corporation Finance, who previously declared, “ETH is not a security.” Grewal also mentioned that SEC Chair Gary Gensler himself, before his appointment, had publicly stated that “ETH is not a security.”Grewal added that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal courts have consistently classified ETH as a commodity. According to him, ETH futures contracts traded on CFTC-regulated exchanges demonstrate established regulatory acceptance of ETH as a commodity.This raises concerns about a potential clash between the SEC and the CFTC. Some analysts have previously warned that if the SEC classifies ETH as a security, it could directly contradict the CFTC’s view.Grewal further argued that the Howey Test, a legal framework used to identify investment contracts, doesn’t apply to determining ETH’s status as a commodity. He believes that even with the merge, Ethereum’s major update that transitioned the network to proof-of-stake, ETH wouldn’t meet the criteria of an investment contract under the Howey Test.Despite the SEC’s uncertain stance on ETH, Grewal believes the SEC has no valid reason to reject applications for spot Ethereum ETFs.News of a probe into the Ethereum Foundation by an undisclosed “state authority” has cast a shadow over the already uncertain fate of spot Ethereum ETFs. The legal status of ETH has been a point of contention, and this investigation could further complicate the SEC’s decision on several pending ETF applications.Details regarding the SEC’s investigation into the Ethereum Foundation remain unclear. It’s unknown whether the SEC is the unnamed agency involved, and even if it is, the purpose of the investigation remains unconfirmed.Coinbase’s Paul Grewal isn’t alone in advocating Ethereum’s classification as a commodity. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently argued in a post that the SEC is “losing badly” in court battles regarding Ethereum and falling behind international regulatory standards.Spot Ethereum ETFs face continued delaysThe SEC has delayed its decision on several spot Ethereum ETFs, including Grayscale’s Ethereum Futures Trust ETF, which was pushed back again on Friday. Other major issuers, such as ARK Invest, VanEck, BlackRock, and Fidelity, are also waiting for the SEC’s green light on their proposed Ethereum ETFs.Bloomberg ETF analysts’ latest update paints a grim picture for hopeful investors awaiting approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. Their revised estimates peg the chance of a May approval at a meager 35%, significantly lower than their predictions for spot Bitcoin ETF approval.Adding to the uncertainty, two US senators sent a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler earlier this month urging him to deny new crypto ETFs. Meanwhile, Gensler remains tight-lipped on the topic.

Why does the world still believe the US is the leading economy when half of its states are in recession?

Amidst economic challenges, recent reports indicate a concerning trend for the United States, with implications both domestically and globally. Recent data suggests that half of the Americanstates are currently experiencing a recession. This sustained period of economic downturn can lead to decreased consumer spending, increased unemployment rates, and overall economic instability.Concurrently, the erosion of the US dollar (USD) persists. Despite its historical dominance, the American Dollar is facing challenges due to various economic and political factors, contributing to a gradual decline in its global hegemony.US dollar collapse is imminentThe United States is currently facing a wave of economic and financial downturns. A recent analysis published by a well-known financial expert, Game of Trades on X, has outlined a new statistical insight into the state of the American recession and currency degradation.The analysis provided by the analyst emphasized the considerable downturn that half of the American states are currently suffering. According to the pooled analysis, 22 American states had an economic collapse in the fourth quarter of 2023.These American states, known as an economic recession, are experiencing repressed economic growth, with measures such as state unemployment rates, average manufacturing hours worked, real wages, and nonfarm payroll employment hitting rock bottom.The analyst later analyzed the present US recession. The handle rapidly highlights the causes, highlighting how “vulnerable” states are prone to severe economic crises and meltdowns.“Recessions don’t occur overnight, with all states simultaneously entering one. Weaker and more vulnerable states tend to be the first to experience a recession. Once a certain threshold is reached, it becomes inevitable that other states will follow suit.”The expert went on to describe a serious detail in the combination. Game of Trades emphasized that the nation may soon enter its formal recession phase, considering that 22 of its states are already experiencing economic difficulties and unexpected swings. American dollar weekend forecastThe American Dollar reclaimed greater stability over the course of an additional notably fruitful week, concluding its second consecutive week of gains and reclaiming the region in which the Dollar Index (DXY) was monitoring its decline to 104.00.Concurrently, the index increased its distance from the recent breach of the pivotal 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 103.70, thereby creating an opportunity for the bullish posture to persist for the time being.Interestingly, the weekly gain in the American dollar was accompanied by a decline in momentum during the recent rally in American yields across multiple time frames, which appears to have accelerated since the FOMC meeting. On the other hand, this ascent seems to have been propelled predominantly by the substantial depreciation in the Japanese Yen. This effect was exacerbated by the BoJ’s dovish rate rise earlier this week. The Greenback’s weekly price movement was primarily influenced by the FOMC report released on March 20.The Federal Reserve (Fed) maintained its anticipated fed funds target range (FFTR) of 5.00% to 5.25% with regard to the latter. Moreover, the Committee raised its interest rate projections for 2025 and subsequent years, as well as its core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) estimates for 2024, which had been established in December at a range of 2.4-2.5%, to a range of 2.5-2.6%.Investors’ focus has shifted to the release of another inflation data, this time from Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), at the end of next week. These numbers will be released alongside other crucial indicators, such as another revision to the Q4 GDP Growth Rate, Durable Goods Orders, the typical weekly Initial Jobless Claims, and the final Michigan Consumer Sentiment gauge.

Ethereum FUD vs. On-Chain Growth - IntoTheBlock Analysis | Cryptoglobe


                                
In the March 22nd issue of his firm’s “On-Chain Insights” newsletter, Lucas Outumuro, Head of Research at crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock (ITB), dives into the recent criticism and scepticism surrounding Ethereum (ETH). He addresses concerns about ETH’s price performance and perceived regulatory threats, counterbalancing them with on-chain metrics that point to continued growth and bullish investor sentiment.



ITB observes that network fees across both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains experienced declines. Bitcoin fees decreased by 15%, aligning with reduced network activity as the speculative interest around ordinals fades. Ethereum fees dropped notably by 41%, suggesting a slowdown in meme-coin activity.



Examining exchange net flows, ITB highlights a contrasting movement. Bitcoin saw substantial net outflows of $380 million, a decrease from the prior week. In sharp contrast, Ethereum recorded its largest weekly net inflows into centralized exchanges (CEXs) since late 2022, amounting to a staggering $720 million. ITB notes this sizable inflow corresponds with a period of growing regulatory scrutiny towards Ethereum.



ITB acknowledges that Ethereum’s price action has sparked concerns. Relative underperformance against Bitcoin and even traditional markets like the S&P 500 is evident. However, ITB stresses that Ethereum’s trajectory appears promising from an on-chain data standpoint.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The amount of ETH transferred on the Mainnet reached its highest levels since mid-2022, ITB highlights. It goes on to say that the daily average volume trend mirrors the early 2020/2021 bull market. Crucially, this time, layer 2 (L2) solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum appear to be playing a dominant role, facilitating greater activity while helping to lower Mainnet fees. Aggregate transaction numbers on these L2s currently surpass Mainnet volume by over two times. ITB also notes that the amount of ETH held on L2s has recently topped 10 million ETH, a doubling since last year.



ITB’s analysis paints a picture of unwavering conviction among long-term ETH holders. Despite negative headlines and regulatory uncertainty, the volume of ETH held for over a year continues reaching new highs. This lack of selling, ITB notes, aligns with patterns seen in previous market cycles, where holders accumulate after significant dips and unload later in bull markets.

Decoding the Meme Coin Craze: SLERF, Shiba Inu, and BEFE Coin Compared | Cryptopolitan

The crypto market is in an uptrend since the Bitcoin halving is approaching. MEME coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, BFEF, and SLERF are making trends. Let’s see which meme coin can ride this craze and has potential.SLERF: The Faltering Former KingSLERF is the Solana-based-meme coin. This Solona canine-themed token rode a speculative wave to a $296 million market cap and social following. But like all good things in crypto, SLERF’s dominance has not shown its potential now.Over the days, the SLERF  coin has unceremoniously surrendered over -9% as it fell out of favor amidst stiff new competition. With a $0.5931 SLERF price and a dwindling 24-hour trading volume, there are rumors that SLERFs may be the top Solona meme coin.Shiba Inu: The People’s ChampAs SLERF’s thrown lost its shine, the “Dogecoin Killer” Shiba Inu rushed in to claim the meme coin throne. Propelled by a crazy community of diehard supporters, this upstart Shiba Inu token exploded into the charts, gaining over 137% in the last 12 months.At a $15.65 billion market cap, Shiba Inu is a true crypto heavyweight now. And Shiba Inu’s $0.00002658 price point still grants investors plenty of bang for their buck. The Shiba Inu coin seems primed to keep leading the meme coin. Shiba Inu has some potential in the future.BEFE: The Disruptor Gunning for GlorySpeaking of underdogs making waves, it would be a mistake to overlook the rapidly growing BEFE coin. As compared to Shiba Inu and SLERF, BEFE is looking more promising. This coin emerged out of nowhere in the past year, rocketing over 458% higher in the crypto market.Despite a $40.37 million market cap, BEFE has more than a few meme coins like SLERF, Shiba Inu, and Pepe in anticipation of what could come next. Think about what might transpire if this hyper-volatile token manages to siphon even a modest amount of SLERF and Shiba Inu’s craze.With a $0.0004034 price tag and robust 24-hour trading activity, BEFE is showcasing the potential to go higher. And history has shown that with meme tokens, it’s disrupting other coins like SLERF and Shiba Inu tends to happen swiftly and violently.For the traders, and whales stalking the crypto market for the next generational score, BEFE’s opening act heroics may just mark the dawn of a new meme coin era. It’s a shift where the emerging coins surpass other meme tokens like dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and SLERF. Of course, in the game of meme coin investment, there are no guarantees. So, choose the right coin and hold it tight.

Shiba Inu, PEPE Coin, or Bitgert Coin: Making the Right Choice | Cryptopolitan

The crypto market has been undergoing correction ever since Bitcoin lost track of its rising trajectory. After touching a formidable target of $73K, Bitcoin has been unable to look up and is trading between $66k and $68k. The most tantalizing gains have come from memecoins and mid-cap tokens like Bitgert. Solana is the new hub for launching memecoins this bull season. While altcoins have taken to following Bitcoin’s footsteps and retraced, a few coins need investors’ attention. Let’s dig deeper into what makes Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin, and Bitgert great contenders for investments with good returns in 2024. Is Bitgert bullish while the market undergoes correction? Let’s find out. BitgertBitgert is a layer-1 blockchain similar to Solana and Cardano. It uses a Proof of Authority mechanism to cross-check transactions and execute them at super-fast speed. Cardano and Solana have been in the Layer-1 blockchain space for quite a long time now. However, both have been unable to provide a TPS that can catalyze mass adoption. But Bitgert offers a transaction throughput of 100K TPS, which is far better than Solana and Cardano can afford. Solana’s jump this season has been mainly because of the memecoin frenzy. Solana and Cardano have low gas fee requirements, between $0.003 and $0.005. But what do you say to a $0.0000000000001 gas fee?That’s Bitgert for you. Bitgert’s token BRISE has a deflationary mechanism and limited supply, which grants it a superior edge over Solana and Cardano. Bitgert blockchain has a full-fledged economy with multiple projects running, a dedicated community, and the potential of 20.000% returns in the coming months. Solana and Cardano have already soaked in their gains, and most factors look priced in. Pepe Coin Pepe Coin was launched in August 2023 to celebrate the spirit of the popular meme Pepe The Frog. Pepe Coin jumped by 651% in the last 30 days. Those are some formidable returns for growing your portfolio from 1x to 600x in a matter of a few weeks, Pepe Coin is still going strong and has earned good repute among the memecoins that come, create controversy or hype, and disappear. Pepe Coin has a no-tax policy, a price-burning mechanism to make the token deflationary, and a redistributive system to reward long-term stakers. Shiba InuShiba Inu is among the most popular dog meme-themed coins besides Doge. Sihna Inu is also one of the oldest and most resilient memecoin ecosystems in the cryptocurrency space. Shiba Inu was launched in 2020 and has gained value ever since. The token jumped by 155% in the past 30 days alone and looks nowhere stopping.Shiba Inu has a full-fledged ecosystem of native projects like an NFT marketplace, games, and a DEX. Its dedicated community is one of its biggest strengths and the strongest reason for its great performance this bull season.

Do the Rumors About OKX Founder’s Arrest Target OKB’s Fall?


							

Rumors regarding the increasing scrutiny over OKX Founder Star Xu have gained attention over the last few days.



Star Xu refuted the claims via recent X posts with an angry face emoji.



Alvin claims that the rumors might be targeting the fall of OKX’s OKB token.




In a recent turn of events, rumors have circulated regarding OKX Founder Star Xu’s arrest by American authorities. However, Xu has refuted the claims by posting messages on his official X account.









Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu recently shared an X post, providing updates on the rumors surrounding the United States’ scrutiny over OKX Founder. According to Wu’s X post, Xu has shared three X posts in an attempt to dismiss the rumors. The reporter also shared insights on similar rumors that were frequent after Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s prosecution in the US.







Alvin, a prominent voice in the crypto sphere, took to X to comment on the prevailing rumors about Xu and his detention. He wrote that the community is bothered by the news spreading about the increasing scrutiny and Xu’s arrest. However, he asserted that the news is likely a rumor, stating,




I think it is most likely a rumor. They want to force OKB to be raped.




Subsequently, Xu posted an angry face emoji in response to Alvin’s message, expressing his outrage at the rumors.







The rumors came following OKX’s crucial decision to shut down in India amidst increasing regulatory challenges. In December 2023, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of India warned 9 foreign crypto exchanges, including OKX, against their non-compliance with the country’s registration laws.



On March 21, OKX requested its Indian customers to close their accounts and withdraw their funds by April 30. The platform noted, “We regret to inform you that OKX is no longer providing services to users in India.”

Bitcoin price crash alert: Analyst predicts ETF-driven plunge, time to sell? - AMBCrypto



The forecast was linked to the sharp drop in inflows to Blackrock’s IBIT spot ETF.
Long-term holders would book profits on average if they decide to sell their coins.

Bitcoin [BTC] long-term holders (LTH), understood to be the cohort holding the asset for at least six months, become a widely-discussed topic during a bull market. This is because they target this phase for profit-taking after quietly accumulating during the bear market.
LTH selling to increase in the days to come?
An on-chain analyst and verified author at CryptoQuant drew market’s attention towards a likelihood of LTH increasing their deposits to exchanges in the days ahead, fueling speculation and anxiety.
The forecast was linked to the sharp drop in inflows to Blackrock’s IBIT spot ETF, the second-largest in terms of overall holdings, and the one which led the wave of inflows over the past two months.
Indeed, daily inflows into the $15 billion-strong Bitcoin investment fund have been on a downhill after peaking earlier in the month, according to AMBCrypto’s analysis of SoSo Value data.
On the 22nd of March, just about $18.89 million in Bitcoins was purchased, compared to nearly $45 million on the 12th of March.
Source: SoSo Value
Explaining the scenario, the researcher stated that most of the transactions between the LTH and BlackRock have happened over-the-counter (OTC) in the last two months.
This meant that despite a sharp drop in their holdings, LTH didn’t have to deposit their coins to exchanges, unlike the previous bull cycles.
Source: Glassnode
However, decreasing inflows to BlackRock suggested that demand was weakening. The researcher noted,
“If this is just temporary, then there may not be any issues. However, if it persists, there is a possibility that long-term holders may start depositing Bitcoin into exchanges in the same way as before. If that happens, the likelihood of price dumping increases.”

LTH cohort in profit
Bitcoin’s sharp descent from the $73k peak clocked earlier in the month impacted the network’s overall profitability. In fact, at press time, Bitcoin investors realized losses on average, according to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data.
Having said that, LTH investors would still book profits if they decide to sell their coins at current price, as evidenced by the MVRV Long/Short Difference indicator.

🚀 Altcoin Surge Alert: The Next Big Winners in the Crypto Space | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin’s price could rise by 200% after halving according to some analysts. This happens every four years and cuts Bitcoin rewards in half for miners. The halving could make Bitcoin scarce, pushing prices up. As Bitcoin grows, other digital coins, called altcoins, often follow. This article explores which altcoins might rise next, showing why the cryptocurrency world is buzzing about these potential big winners.BlastUP Presale Hits $2.5 Million: Anticipating the Next Big Thing in CryptoBlastUP, the premier launchpad on Blast, has recently made a splash in the crypto world with its head-spinning debut, raising  $2.5 million in a few weeks.

Similarly, the six months’ impressive rally of 489.86% reflects a bullish momentum that could persist. AVAX’s current price at $52.47, just above the nearest support level at $33.98, might attract buyers aiming for the next resistance at $61.66. Considering the historical peak at $151.22, there’s potential for growth if the market maintains its confidence and demand for Avalanche continues to rise. However, market fluctuations are natural, and investors should monitor the support levels closely.Over a longer term, looking at the 100-day simple moving average of $40.43 signifies solidity in Avalanche’s current market trend. The price standing well above this average could be a sign of durability and possibly further gains. However, markets are unpredictable, and while past performance points towards a positive trend, future events could introduce volatility. Factors like technology upgrades, market sentiment, or competing blockchains could influence prices. Watching the 10-day moving average at $55.68 could offer insights into emerging trends, providing investors with hints on whether the current bullish stance will hold or if caution is warranted.Polygon’s Price Dynamics: Dip or Surge Ahead?Polygon’s current price of $0.959, sitting below the 10-day average of $1.07, suggests a dip in the short-term trend. Yet, recent months have seen a remarkable 84.07% increase, showing strong upward momentum. If the price can break past the near resistance of $1.13, we could see a climb towards the $1.27 level. However, if it fails to maintain support at $0.81, the next safety net is at $0.63, which could indicate a steeper decline. This price action underlines the volatile nature of the market, with potential for both advances and retracements.Long-term observers will note that despite the one-month drop of 6.26%, Polygon’s historical 84.07% six-month surge reveals an overarching positive trajectory. The current price is above the 100-day average of $0.923, which could show enduring confidence among investors. The all-time high of $3 isn’t in immediate reach, but these numbers hint at Polygon’s capacity to regain and even exceed past performance. Still, considering the dynamic market conditions, sustained growth is far from guaranteed, and investors might have to brace for fluctuations that could challenge the upward trend.ConclusionIn conclusion, while other altcoins such as Avalanche and Polygon have shown significant market strength and potential for growth, BlastUP notably remains at the forefront in the race of high-potential crypto assets. Gaining traction within the robust Blast ecosystem, BlastUP distinguishes itself not just through impressive presale achievements but also via its innovative combination of Web3 tools and AI to support burgeoning blockchain startups. The fervent support and unique benefits available to early adopters underscore the widespread belief in BlastUP’s trajectory to transform into a leading launchpad in the dynamic crypto landscape.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Bitcoin Rallies Amid Fed's Interest Rate Decision, Showcasing Resilience Against ETF Outflows



                    
On March 21, Bitcoin maintained its upward trajectory, buoyed by a quick recovery that delivered a 12% increase in its price. 



This uptick followed a period of consolidation within a tight range, sparked by a favorable response to comments made by the United States Federal Reserve, which opted to keep interest rates steady.




The Federal Reserve’s decision came after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with Chair Jerome Powell indicating potential rate cuts later in the year. 



He stated it would be “appropriate” to initiate such cuts once there was greater confidence in inflation moving sustainably towards the 2% target. 



A press release underscored this stance, emphasizing patience until there’s more certainty about the inflation trajectory.




This development helped Bitcoin avoid a drop below the $60,000 support level, propelling it to $68,000 and negating its recent losses. 



The sentiment was encapsulated by a popular trader, Jelle, on X (formerly Twitter), who highlighted the importance of staying above $65,300 for Bitcoin to potentially revisit its 2021 cycle highs.

This surge inflicted significant losses on short sellers, with CoinGlass reporting $70 million in short BTC liquidations on March 20.



Despite new withdrawals from U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), market morale remained strong. 



Farside, a UK investment firm, noted that $261 million exited new ETF products on March 20, largely due to $386 million in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), even as other ETFs experienced inflows.



Market commentators expressed optimism amidst these developments. Dyme, a well-regarded voice, observed Bitcoin’s resilience against the backdrop of ETF outflows, suggesting the market’s independence from ETF movements. 



Similarly, Samson Mow, CEO of crypto adoption firm Jan3, opined that ETF outflows would inevitably reverse, encouraging investors to plan with this future shift in mind. 



These perspectives underscore a growing belief in Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its capacity to withstand market fluctuations.

Tax Expert Claudemir Ramos Explains How Expats Can Avoid IRS Penalties



                    


Living abroad doesn’t exempt US citizens and permanent residents from their tax obligations to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However, many expatriates are unaware of these requirements, inadvertently becoming non-compliant with the IRS and subject to penalties, including criminal charges. To delve deeper into this issue, we’ve invited an expert in the field to shed light on potential solutions.



Claudemir Ramos, an expert with over a decade of experience in Brazilian law, brings his expertise to the American market through his company, CR Accounting & Consulting LLC. Renowned in the Brazilian accounting field, he extends his influence by providing valuable insights through influential articles on tax regulations in both countries, helping to disseminate knowledge about tax rules to a wider audience.




Our specialist notes that US-born individuals or green card holders living abroad may qualify for the IRS Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedure. This program enables them to fulfill tax obligations without penalties for late filing, provided the lack of compliance was due to unawareness.



Tax obligations include filing annual income tax returns for global income, submitting FATCA Form 8938 for foreign financial accounts meeting specific thresholds, disclosing ownership in foreign corporations exceeding 10% via Form 5471, reporting investments in foreign funds with Form 8621, declaring third-party gifts over $100,000 with Form 3520, and disclosing foreign bank accounts or assets over $10,000 with Form 114 – FBAR.



Qualification for the Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedure includes living outside the US for at least 330 days in one of the last three years and certifying that failure to file taxes and FBAR was due to an honest lack of awareness of US tax laws.




If you qualify for the program, you will need to submit the last three years of overdue tax returns, the last six years of FBAR, a comprehensive statement explaining asset acquisition, and payment of calculated income tax due with applicable interest.



Seeking personalized assistance tailored to individual tax situations and professional guidance from experts like Claudemir Ramos is vital to understanding the complexities of tax filing statuses.

Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF Faces Record Outflows Amid Crypto Market Turmoil, But Analysts Predict a Turnaround



                    
Grayscale, a leading crypto asset manager, is experiencing a notable decline in investments in its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with recent data showing significant outflows. 



On March 21, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) reported outflows of $358.8 million. 




This event comes on the heels of a record-breaking $642 million outflow on March 18, according to Farside Investors. 



Over the past week, GBTC has seen a total of $1.8 billion in withdrawals, marking a trend of persistent outflows across the cryptocurrency ETF sector for four consecutive days.



Despite these significant outflows, experts believe this trend could be nearing its end. 



Eric Balchunas, a Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, suggested on March 21 that the majority of the outflows, particularly from the recent bankruptcies within the crypto industry, might be concluding due to their “size and consistency.” H



e further speculated that the outflows could be linked to bankrupt firms purchasing Bitcoin with cash, which could be stabilizing the market. 



Balchunas optimistically noted that once this period is over, the market might only see retail-driven flows, similar to those observed in February.

Adding to the discussion, an independent researcher known as ErgoBTC pointed out that around $1.1 billion of the recent GBTC outflows likely originated from Genesis, a bankrupt crypto lender. 



The researcher highlighted the timing and volume of transactions between GBTC and Genesis as evidence of their correlation. 




WhalePanda, a pseudonymous crypto market commentator, echoed this sentiment, referring to a statement from Genesis about returning assets to creditors by converting GBTC shares into Bitcoin.



The selling pressure on GBTC has been further amplified by major liquidations in the crypto industry. 



On February 14, Genesis received court approval to liquidate its $1.3 billion in GBTC shares to repay creditors. 



Additionally, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX liquidated all of its 22 million GBTC shares, valued at nearly $1 billion, just a month earlier.



As of March 21, Grayscale reported its Bitcoin Trust holds assets under management worth $23.2 billion, despite a $13.6 billion reduction since its conversion to an ETF on January 11. 



These developments reflect the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and the interconnectedness of its participants.

Launchpad Token's Historic 67000% Gain: A Sign for This Bull Run's Future? | Cryptopolitan

A key challenge for crypto investors is to identify tokens with great potential, underpinned by tangible utility within the project rather than mere speculative buzz. Wider adoption and recognition of a project typically leads to an increase in the value of its native token. Launchpad platforms are a good example of such projects. These are specialized platforms that assist blockchain startups in garnering attention, raising funds, and establishing a strong footing in the market. These platforms act as gateways for novel projects to connect with potential investors in a structured and efficient manner. The success of projects launched within an ecosystem has a ripple effect, helping the entire community to grow and prosper.Given the high utility of launchpads, they appear quite appealing to savvy investors who are eager to spot the projects with the highest potential for success. This article is a breakdown of the launchpad platforms that are most worthy of investment.Seedify: Skyrocketing Over 1500% in Just Five MonthsLaunched in June 2021, Seedify’s native token (SFUND) initially traded at $0.28, but it has managed to skyrocket to $16.77 by November of the same year, making it a whopping +1566% increase in just five months.  Seedify is a Web3 projects incubator and launchpad built on the Binance Smart Chain protocol. From its outset, Seedify has been primarily focusing on innovative technologies, including Web3 Gaming, NFTs, and metaverse. What sets Seedify apart is its inclusive approach to project selection. Unlike traditional models where decisions rest with a select board or individual, Seedify democratizes the process by allowing anyone to submit their idea or innovation to the platform. Through a community-driven voting mechanism, projects vie for initial funding rounds via an IDO, ensuring a fair and transparent selection process.Early investors who recognized Seedify’s high potential were able to secure enormous returns by investing mere cents. Currently, the price of SFUND has stabilized at approximately $5, which is notably lower than its all-time high. Despite this, the token has demonstrated a positive performance, registering a 31% increase over the past three months. So, while the potential for profit remains, investing now may generate much lower gains.Polkastarter: Surging 67000% In Less Than A YearThe native token of Polkastarter POLS was trading at just $0.0014 in September 2020 and hit an all-time high of $7.51 in February 2021, a staggering 67000% gain in less than a year. Polkastarter is an open-source launchpad platform leveraging the robust infrastructure of the Polkadot network. The platform’s architecture enables the creation of swap pools with predefined token purchase rates, facilitating seamless fundraising for initial coin offering (ICO) projects. Notably, these swap pools ensure price stability throughout the sale process, safeguarding against sudden fluctuations until the initial token supply is exhausted.POLS, the native token of Polkastarter, grants users access to pools and offers priority access to holders. Additionally, staking POLS rewards users, promoting loyalty within the platform.The recent performance of POLS is spectacular with an almost 300% increase in the past six months. However, this is nothing compared to an astonishing 67000% surge experienced during its first year. While investing in POLS now could still yield some gains, the returns are unlikely to match the phenomenal success seen in 2021.What is the Next Stellar Performer?The success of launchpad platforms hinges not only on the team’s efforts but also on the popularity of the underlying blockchain. Platforms built on established blockchains like BNB Chain or Polkadot hold promise due to their solid foundations.However, the cryptocurrency landscape is ever-evolving, with new ambitious projects often gaining an edge over older competitors by introducing innovative ideas. The emergence of Blast, a new Layer 2 blockchain, is a testament to this dynamism. Within just one month of its launch, Blast has garnered significant attention, boasting over $30 billion in total locked volume (TLV) and securing a spot among the top 10 projects by TLV. BlastUP, the first launchpad on Blast, is poised for similar success.BlastUP: The Next Launchpad to Generate Triple-Digit Profits From The StartBlastUP is the first launchpad platform on Blast, a popular Layer 2 solution. BlastUP embodies its motto, “grow faster and earn more,” delivering simplicity and transparency to blockchain startups seeking a seamless market entry.In just a month of its presale, BlastUP has swiftly raised over $2.5 million. With a surge in investor interest, BlastUP is on track to become a magnet for millions of users, driven by its commitment to ensuring the success of blockchain ventures. At its core lies the Launchpad Accelerator, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at empowering projects with documentation and optimized tokenomics, streamlining the capital-raising process. Security is paramount at BlastUP, exemplified by its rigorous Project Screening process, which ensures that only the most reliable projects gain entry. This dedication to security positions BlastUP as the premier choice for reliability and sustainable growth in the crypto launchpad landscape. BlastUP is running a presale of BLP, its native token, currently priced at $0.055. As the flagship launchpad within the Blast ecosystem, BlastUP indicates a compelling trust from investors, setting a high bar against competitors. Once the BLP tokens are listed, they are anticipated to experience a stellar rise similar to Seedify and Polkastarter. Site, Whitepaper, Telegram

Shiba Inu vs. Pepe Coin vs. Bitgert Coin: Decoding the Cryptocurrency Trifecta | Cryptopolitan

The crypto market’s fortunes started turning in December 2023. The ETF approval added fuel to the fire, and the prices of most cryptocurrencies skyrocketed. The market cap touched $2.77 trillion in a matter of months before the correction. The market correction saw Bitcoin prices slashed by 10% in a few days. The rest of the altcoin pack followed suit, except Bitgert. Bitgert continued to rise up the charts as it had done during the last bear market. Bitgert prices jumped by 67% in the last 30 days, outperforming the larger market and other layer-1 blockchains like Solana and Cardano. Traders on the lookout for good returns in this bull market have also found memecoins like Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin a good bet. However, Pepe Coin has outperformed most of the memecoins and has proved resilient. Let’s take a look at three of the many sparkling bets that are gaining momentum better and independent of the larger market scenario. Bitgert Bitgert isn’t your regular layer-1 blockchain like Solana, Cardano, Ethereum, etc. The blockchain uses highly sophisticated proof of Authority consensus to execute transactions at lightning-fast speed and negligible costs. Bitgert offers a transaction speed of up to 100K TPS, whereas Solana still struggles to touch even 3K. Investors, traders, developers, and meme-coiners are rushing toward Solana and Cardano, which offer low gas fees between $0.003 and $0.005. However, Bitgert is killing the gas-fees game, leaving behind Solana and Cardano at a $0.0000000000001 gas fee. Bitgert’s token, BRISE, has strong fundamentals like limited supply and deflationary economics, making it a better choice over big-cap tokens like Solana and Cardano with sustained price rises. Pepe Coin Pepe Coin was launched in April 2023 as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, the popular internet meme. Pepe capitalizes on the meme frenzy and gives tough competition to the likes of older memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Why does Pepe Coin appeal to the larger investor base despite being a memecoin? Unlike many memecoins, Pepe Coin institutes a no-tax policy and has a redistributive reward system that rewards long-term stakers. Pepe Coin also has a burning mechanism that helps maintain its scarcity. Pepe Coin has reached a market capitalization of over $1.5 billion and has risen by 654% in the past 30 days! Shiba InuShiba Inu is a rip-off of the first-ever successful memecoin, Doge. Shiba Inu was created in August 2020 as an Ethereum-based alternative. Shiba Inu has a dedicated community and several projects under its banner, including an NFT art incubator and a DEX. Shiba Inu has a full-fledged roadmap and charity initiatives for Dogs. Shiba Inu community dedicated funds to the India Covid-19 relief fund.  Shiba Inu’s market cap is $16 billion, and its price has jumped by 155% in the last 30 days. Every bull market pumps billions into memecoins, but what if we tell you Bitgert could guarantee returns of 20,000% if it meets its price target of $0.001 in the coming months?

This Week in Coins: After Setting a New All-Time High, Bitcoin Struggles to Retake $69K - Decrypt

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.Bitcoin seemed to be on a roll earlier this month, reaching a new all-time high ten days ago. Now it's struggling to break above its longstanding top of $69,000 set in November 2021. What's going on?For a start, Grayscale selling coins isn't helping. The massive fund manager was again shifting crypto to its custodian as investors redeemed their shares.Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities, told Decrypt that it was likely due to "leftover holders desiring to leave this vehicle for a cheaper ETF."The redemptions—alongside uncertainty about the impact of the upcoming halving—have pushed the price of Bitcoin down: The biggest digital coin's price now stands at $64,415, a weekly drop of nearly 7%, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin was recently closing in on $74,000.Ethereum isn't faring much better, either. The second-biggest coin has dropped 10% over the week and is now worth $3,342.The news of a "voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality" didn't do the asset any favors.Elsewhere, popular meme coins—which earlier this month piqued investor interest again—took a battering. The biggest ones experienced the biggest dips: Pepe, Dogwifhat, and Bonk are the week's biggest losers. The assets are down 16%, 21%, and 28%, respectively.Despite the current market pessimism, some reputable analysts are still confident over the long-term: global investment firm AllianceBernstein this week forecasted that Bitcoin would hit $90,000 by the end of the year.A Monday report from Standard Chartered, meanwhile, claimed that Ethereum could hit $8,000 by the end of this year, and $14,000 is possible by the end of 2025.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

TON Defies Market Sentiment With 11% Surge, BTC Falls to $64.5K (Weekend Watch)


																BTC’s price troubles are not over yet as the asset tumbled to $62,500 yesterday before managing to recover around two grand.
The altcoins have also bled out on a daily scale, and the total crypto market cap has remained well below $2.6 trillion.
Bitcoin’s Latest Issues
The start of the current business week and how it went were in total contrast to the previous one when BTC skyrocketed above $73,000 to chart its latest ATH. However, the bears have taken control of the market in the past seven days or so, which is evident from Bitcoin’s performance.
The cryptocurrency slumped hard on Monday and Tuesday, ahead of the second FOMC meeting for the year. In fact, it slumped to a 15-day low of under $61,000 amid fears of a potential change in the Fed’s monetary policy.
Since there was no such alternation from the US central bank, BTC quickly rebounded and soared past $68,000 on Wednesday. That was short-lived, though, as the asset tumbled almost immediately and dropped all the way down to $62,500 yesterday evening.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Nevertheless, Bitcoin managed to react well to the recent declines, which were perhaps fueled by the continuous ETF outflows and has recovered more than two grand as of now. Still, BTC is down by more than 2% on a daily scale, and its market cap is well below $1.3 trillion.

TON Defies Market Sentiment
Most altcoins are also well in the red on a daily scale. Ethereum has shed 4% of its value and now struggles below $3,400. BNB is down by 4.5% and sits beneath $560. Ripple, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, Polkadot, and Tron have also declined in the past 24 hours, albeit in a more modest fashion.
Toncoin has emerged as the top performer from the larger-cap alts. In contrast to most other assets, TON has soared by more than 11% daily and sits close to $5. As such, the asset is just 5-6% away from its 2021 all-time high of $5.25, according to CoinGecko.
Bitcoin Cash is the other notable gainer from the top 36 alts, having jumped by over 4% daily to $435.
Nevertheless, the cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has declined by about $50 billion overnight and is below $2.6 trillion now.

Doxxed: You Won't Believe Who Bitcoin Whale “Mr. 100” Is


The emergence of a colossal Bitcoin whale named “Mr. 100,” has stirred waves of intrigue. This entity’s wallet, swelling with over 52,996 Bitcoin valued north of $3.5 billion, has become a focal point for analysts. 
Notably, on March 15, this whale outdid itself by acquiring at least 1,000 BTC. It seized a staggering 52% of the total buys by the top 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Bitcoin Whale Doxxed
Since the downfall of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, Mr. 100 has been on an aggressive accumulation path. It enhanced its holdings by at least 100 BTC daily since mid-February 2023. 
Intriguingly, the wallet’s behavior indicates a broader strategy, with significant transfers from a secondary wallet that has followed a similar pattern since 2019. This revelation positions Mr. 100 as a seasoned player, engaged in the crypto market well before the current bull run.

Speculations abound regarding the true nature of Mr. 100. They range from a Hong Kong financial institution laying the groundwork for Bitcoin ETFs to sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East or even a tech titan’s covert cryptocurrency venture. Despite the flurry of guesses, Arkham Intelligence’s investigation offers a compelling theory.

The blockchain forensics platform identified Mr. 100’s wallet as an Upbit cold wallet. This classification stems from the wallet’s transactions and its association with other Upbit addresses, which is a typical exchange cold wallet’s operational pattern.

“Mr. 100 is in fact an Upbit Cold Wallet. This is because of its strong and consistent associations to other Upbit Wallets, which match the pattern of a typical exchange cold wallet. The ‘Mr. 100’ address receives the 100 BTC inflows primarily from sweeping Upbit deposit wallets. Some of its outflows also fund Upbit Hot Wallets used for customer withdrawals,” analysts at Arkham Intelligence said.

Arkham Intelligence’s commentary demystifies the enigma surrounding Mr. 100, proposing that rather than embodying a single entity’s strategic market play, it represents the machinations of an established cryptocurrency exchange. This sheds light on the critical role of cold wallets in the secure management of digital assets.

Bitcoin Consolidation A Case Of 'Peaking Pre-Halving:' Analyst Says King Crypto Has A 'Long, Massive Bull Market Ahead' - Benzinga

King Crypto Bitcoin BTC/USD has experienced a nearly 7% drop over the past week. However, a prominent crypto analyst suggests that this correction is part of a larger cycle.What Happened: Michaël van de Poppe, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, has shared his insights on Bitcoin’s recent price movements.Van de Poppe believes that the recent downward trend in BTC may be linked to the upcoming halving event.“The consolidation on Bitcoin continues. I don't think we'll see much spectacle coming from Bitcoin; if we do, it will need to break $70,300."See Also: Shiba Inu Blockchain Shibarium's Meme Coin DAMN Leads Board With 22% Single Day GainsHe added that the current consolidation is a case of "peaking pre-halving. Just like any other cycle," even though there is potential for Bitcoin to chart new all-time highs in the near future.The halving event, which occurs every four years, involves a reduction in Bitcoin’s mining rewards. The next halving is expected to take place next month.Van de Poppe compared BTC’s current price chart to that of the 2016-2017 cycle, suggesting that the current correction could be a prelude to a significant upward trend.Despite the recent correction, Van de Poppe remains bullish on Bitcoin, stating,"My main thesis is that we've seen the pre-halving hype and that we're going to have a long, massive bull market."Why It Matters: The recent correction in Bitcoin’s price comes amid significant developments in the cryptocurrency market.Earlier this week, major cryptocurrencies experienced a mixed trading session, following a drop in weekly jobless claims.Renowned investor Cathie Wood projected a staggering price target for Bitcoin, suggesting the cryptocurrency could reach $3.8 million by 2030.Despite the recent correction, analysts remain optimistic about the future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.A bullish forecast released by a popular analyst predicts significant growth for Bitcoin and altcoins by the end of 2025.Price Action: Bitcoin was trading at $64,718, down 2.36% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro.Read Next: ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ Author Says Foolish And Desperate China Is In TroubleDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo courtesy: Shutterstock

                        AI startup Anthropic will not accept investments from Saudi Arabia in the sale process of 8% of its shares as part of FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings.Executives at Anthropic have cited these concerns as the reason for ruling out Saudi Arabian involvement, as reported by CNBC.Bankman-Fried, acquired the stake three years ago for $500 million. Thanks to the recent surge of interest in AI technologies, the value of the 8% stake has now exceeded $1 billion.The proceeds from the stake sale will be used to repay FTX customers, and the transaction is expected to conclude within the next few weeks, according to insiders who have requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the negotiations.Sources reveal that the class B shares, which do not grant voting rights, are being sold based on Anthropic’s most recent valuation of $18.4 billion.In recent years, Anthropic has raised approximately $7 billion from tech giants such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Salesforce. The company’s advanced language model directly competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.While founders Dario and Daniela Amodei retain the right to challenge potential investors, they are currently not involved in the fundraising process or discussions regarding FTX’s stake. The Amodei siblings were introduced to Bankman-Fried through the concept of “effective altruism,” which involves maximizing wealth for charitable causes.UAE Considering Investing in Anthropic
Although Anthropic has explicitly stated its refusal to accept Saudi Arabian investments, it does not plan to challenge funding from other sovereign wealth funds, including the United Arab Emirates’ Mubadala. According to one source, Mubadala, based in the UAE, is actively considering an investment in Anthropic.The potential buyers for FTX’s shares consist of a syndicate of new investors for Anthropic, excluding Amazon and Alphabet. FTX’s stake is being marketed through special purpose vehicles (SPVs), which allow multiple investors to pool their capital. Venture firms have received emails from SPVs soliciting participation in the sale, according to three sources. Perella Weinberg, an investment bank, is managing the sale on behalf of FTX.Saudi Arabia’s Sovereign Wealth Fund Invests in Tech
PIF, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund with assets exceeding $900 billion, has been heavily investing in technology to diversify the nation’s revenue sources away from oil. The fund is reportedly in discussions with venture firm Andreessen Horowitz to create a $40 billion fund dedicated to AI investments, as reported by CNBC based on sources familiar with the matter.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious “Vision 2030 Initiative” aims to modernize the economy and strengthen global financial ties. PIF has made investments in companies such as Uber and has also funded the LIV golf league while making significant commitments to professional soccer and tennis.Anthropic’s national security concerns regarding Saudi Arabia may be related to dual-use technology, which refers to software or tech that can have both civilian and military applications. This area of concern aligns with the focus of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which has the authority to block foreign investments from specific sources in certain sectors. It is worth noting that Saudi Arabia has also been cultivating closer ties with China.In November, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, was convicted on seven criminal counts related to the collapse of the exchange. His sentencing is scheduled for next week, and prosecutors are recommending a sentence of 40 to 50 years.

BlastUP is about to shake up the crypto scene, so get on board before this rocket ship takes off without you!>> Act Fast! Supply of BlastUP Tokens is Limited – Secure Your Spot in the BlastUP Launch! <<Solana’s Noteworthy Surge Amid Potential VolatilityThe recent price uptick in Solana is a head-turner with a monthly surge of 56.09% and a striking six-month spike of 767.86%. If the momentum continues, we could see further gains, possibly pushing prices towards previous highs or beyond. However, such rapid increases can also attract profit-taking, which might cause corrective dips or increased volatility in the short term. Investors should be ready for fluctuations but optimistic about the growth potential.Over the long haul, if Solana keeps building on its strong foundation and network developments, there’s a chance for sustained growth. With a keen eye on the impressive six-month growth, long-term investors might view any short-term price drops as opportunities to buy. However, the crypto market is known for its twists and turns, and past performance isn’t always a reliable roadmap for future prices. Caution is warranted, as new highs could be met with significant pullbacks.Polygon’s 84% Growth vs. Recent 6.16% DropThe recent drop of 6.16% this month suggests some short-term caution is warranted for Polygon. However, the impressive 84.26% growth over the last six months cannot be ignored, signaling strong mid-term potential. With the current price at $0.96, just below the 10-days Simple Moving Average of $1.07, and a bit higher than the 100-days average at $0.92, it’s plausible to expect some stability or a minor uptick in the near future. The nearest support level at $0.82 could be a key juncture to watch, as falling below may lead to a test of the second support at $0.63, while breaking past the resistance at $1.13 could pave the way for further gains.Considering the all-time high of $3.003 and the recent historical performance, Polygon shows the capacity for substantial recovery and positive momentum over the long term. The existence of multiple resistance levels at $1.13 and $1.27 might cap short-term growth, but overcoming these could boost investor confidence and push prices upward. While the drop in the past month introduces some risk, the rapid growth over six months suggests resilience and underlying strength. If the market sentiment remains in favor, the path to growth may continue, keeping the all-time high as a possible target again in the future.Avalanche Sees 491.44% Six-Month SurgeAvalanche has seen a significant jump over the last six months, with a dramatic 491.44% increase, and a notable 36.82% rise in the past month. Although the current price of $52.80 sits above recent support levels, approaching the second resistance level at $61.66 signals potential room for growth. Long-term opportunities could see Avalanche pursuing its all-time high of $151.223 again, supported by the optimism surrounding its historical performance. However, its current price surpassing the nearest resistance of $46.32 requires careful monitoring for sustainability over time.Short-term, the market’s signals are mixed, with a sell suggestion from the MACD and a neutral stance from the RSI and Stochastic RSI Fast. At $52.80, Avalanche is trading higher than the 10-day simple moving average of $55.69, which might indicate a potential pullback. Conversely, the 100-day SMA at $40.43 presents a buy signal, suggesting stability and possibility for gradual gains. Investors must weigh immediate pressures against the fundamentally strong six-month trend, staying alert for fluctuations that could test the support levels at $33.98 and $26.97.ConclusionIn conclusion, while the cryptocurrencies we’ve discussed show promise, BlastUP stands at the pinnacle of potential. Part of the alluring Blast ecosystem, its concept hinges on fostering growth within a dynamic community — a move that resonates with the commitment to sustainable advancement. Building on solid presale success, BlastUP’s utility, particularly through AI and Web3 integrations, positions it as an asset brimming with opportunity. Investors keen on forward-looking projects with a robust structural backbone may find BlastUP’s position within the Blast ecosystem an attractive prospect signifying longevity and innovation.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Ripple CEO Predicts SEC Clash Over Ethereum's Status


                                Ripple CEO Predicts SEC's Struggle with Ethereum's Regulatory Status                                Ripple's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has offered a bold prediction regarding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its potential clash with Ethereum (ETH). Making connections to the legal battle that Ripple faced over XRP, Garlinghouse expects a similar outcome for Ethereum, indicating that the SEC may struggle in its efforts to classify ETH as a security.Garlinghouse's comments align with reports suggesting that the SEC is looking closely at whether Ethereum should be considered an unregistered security. This development has sparked conversations and raised worries among the cryptocurrency community. Although the SEC has not directly classified ETH as either a security or a commodity, its chairman, Gary Gensler, has consistently indicated a broader view that most crypto tokens could be seen as securities, except Bitcoin.The Ripple CEO's perspective reflects a growing feeling within the industry, where regulatory clarity and consistency have become important. With the SEC facing challenges and setbacks in its legal battles against crypto firms, including Ripple, Garlinghouse's doubt regarding the SEC's potential actions against Ethereum carries significant weight.Garlinghouse highlighted the SEC's recent legal struggles, stating that the agency has faced defeats in court and encountered friction with other regulators like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This friction, along with international regulatory dynamics, creates a complex view of the evolving landscape for cryptocurrencies and their regulatory status.The Ethereum Foundation got a "voluntary inquiry from a state authority," showing how closely Ethereum is being watched by regulators. This, along with what Garlinghouse said, adds to talks about how the SEC deals with cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, not just Bitcoin, and what it means for the whole market.SEC Decision Awaited on Ethereum ETPsCoinbase's Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, highlighted the importance of waiting for the SEC's decision on spot Ethereum exchange-traded products (ETPs) sold on the spot market. He warned against spreading false information about Ethereum's regulatory status. Grewal confirmed that Ethereum is considered a commodity, a view supported by the CFTC and federal courts over the years.The debate over Ethereum's classification highlights the complexities and details of regulatory frameworks in the crypto space. While Bitcoin enjoys a clearer status as a commodity, other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum navigate a more uncertain regulatory landscape, subject to interpretations and legal scrutiny.Crypto Community's Focus – SEC and EthereumGarlinghouse's perspective on the SEC's potential challenges with Ethereum reflects broader discussions within the crypto community regarding regulatory clarity, investor protection, and market stability. As regulatory agencies deal with defining and regulating cryptocurrencies, stakeholders closely monitor developments that could impact the industry's future path.The evolving regulatory environment underscores the need for clear guidelines, transparent communication, and collaborative efforts between industry participants and regulators. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance and adoption, regulatory frameworks play a very important role in shaping their legitimacy, functionality, and market dynamics.ConclusionGarlinghouse's thoughts on the SEC's possible issues with Ethereum show how tricky it is for regulators to handle cryptocurrencies. With rules still unclear, people in the industry want clear, fair discussions to encourage new ideas and deal with regulatory worries.Also read - EU's AML Turns Down Anonymous Crypto Wallets and Payments

Crypto Markets Require “Sunlight and Disinfectant” for Integrity: Gary Gensler - Coin Edition


							

SEC Chair Gary Gensler underscores the necessity of transparency in crypto markets.



Gensler suggests the market requires “disinfectant” to address potential shortcomings.



He warns against repeating historical market collapses due to a lack of transparency.




In a recent address at the Columbia Law School conference, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler reiterated his stance on the necessity of transparency in the crypto markets. Specifically, Gensler suggested the crypto markets could benefit from a “sunlight and disinfectant.”



Gensler expressed this view while emphasizing the significance of appropriate disclosures by crypto projects. He highlighted the manifold benefits of investors having access to disclosure mandated by laws and regulations. 



Firstly, Gensler emphasized that disclosure fosters more efficient markets by facilitating better price discovery. According to him, more information enables prices to reflect a company’s prospects more accurately.









Furthermore, the SEC chair noted that disclosure cultivates trust in markets. He pointed out that investors are more inclined to invest their capital when they receive consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosure. 



Meanwhile, Gensler highlighted the concerning trend of some crypto projects attempting to limit the information available to investors. He drew parallels to the 1920s when federal disclosure requirements were absent. 



Gensler pointed out that the absence of disclosure led to rampant fraud, manipulation, and market abuse. Consequently, investors suffered losses and lost faith in the integrity of the capital markets, ultimately leading to a market collapse.



In parallel, he emphasized that some contemporary voices are advocating for further exemptions to the rules mandating the registration of public offerings. According to Gensler, the absence of registration equates to a lack of mandatory disclosure, which raises concerns about transparency and investor protection within the crypto markets. 



Echoing U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis’ sentiment from 1913, Gensler cited,  “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.” On this premise, the SEC chairman concluded that many would agree that the crypto markets could benefit from a dose of “disinfectant” to ensure integrity and mitigate risks for investors.

The first of these was a whale known as the iExec RLC altcoin team multisig 0x213 wallet, which deposited 12,500 ETH, worth approximately $41.7 million, to Kraken 8 hours ago. At the time of the transfer, the price of Ethereum was around $3,339.

The current asset of the wallet in question is 12.2 thousand ETH and its value is 40.9 million dollars.

The second whale, known by the short address 0x50b, transferred the last 11,600 ETH worth $39.1 million to Binance in the last 22 hours. At the time of the transfer, the price of Ethereum was approximately $3,374. This wallet first received Ethereum in December 2017. In a significant move, the wallet deposited all 32.6 thousand ETH into Binance at a price of approximately $3,312, making a total of $108 million. He withdrew 80 million USDT to his external wallet in the last three days.





The third Wallet, Metalpha multisig 0x435, transferred 8,427 ETH worth $28.2 million to Binance just an hour ago. At the time of the transfer, the price of Ethereum was $3,347. This wallet first received Ethereum in July 2021. The wallet's current assets are recorded at 62.3 thousand WSTETH worth $242 million.

Do Kwon To Be Released From Prison But Remanded To Montenegro - Details


								Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon is now set to be released from prison in Montenegro; however, the South Korean will remain restricted to the borders of the European nation pending a fixed date for his extradition to his home country. 

Do Kwon Serves Time In Montenegro, Awaits Extradition Decision
In March 2023, Do Kwon, alongside former Terraform CFO Han Chang-joon, was apprehended by local authorities in Montenegro for traveling with falsified documents. This development came as the crypto mogul was wanted by legal authorities in the US and South Korea for crimes of fraud following the crash of the prominent Terra ecosystem in 2022, which wiped out over $50 billion of users’ funds. 
Do Kwon was given a four-month sentence in Montenegro for using a fake passport which eventually commenced in November 2023. According to local media Vijesti, this prison time has been served with the South Korean citizen set to be released on March 23, 2024. 
However, an order from the High Court of Podgorica directing the seizure of Do Kwon’s valid travel documents will prevent the wanted crypto figure from leaving Montenegrin borders for the time being. This is quite unsurprising as Do Kwon is expected to be extradited to South Korea to face fraud allegations for his involvement in the Terra blockchain project.
The Asian nation had initially contested with the US for the custody of the former Terraform boss, with both parties filing extradition requests following Do Kwon’s arrest in Montenegro. After a series of court proceedings over the last few months, South Korea finally secured the custody of the Terra Luna founder on the basis of filing an extradition request earlier than the US. However, recent developments reveal the extradition process may be stalled for the time being.

Montenegro’s Apex Court Postpones Do Kwon’s Extradition Indefinitely 
In an unexpected turnout, the Supreme Court of Montenegro has ordered a halt to the extradition of Do Kwon to South Korea pending its decision on a petition from the national prosecutors’ office. 
On March 20, the Supreme State Prosecutor’s Office of Montenegro filed a request for protection of legality regarding the decision on the extradition request process by a lower court. The prosecutors argued there were procedural errors in the handling of the case by the appellate court. 
Specifically, the prosecutors believe that the appellate court acted beyond its authority by rejecting an appeal from Kwon’s legal team, asserting that only Montenegro’s Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to make such legal decisions. Therefore, the Council of the Supreme Court will evaluate whether there were indeed procedural violations and whether the lower court’s decision regarding Kwon’s extradition was legally sound, which will determine if the approved transfer will follow through.

Crypto mogul Star Xu squashes arrest speculations in bold response

In response to circulating rumors regarding the arrest of Star Xu, the founder of OKX, by American authorities, Xu has vehemently refuted these claims. Speculations emerged across various platforms alleging Xu’s detention in the United States, prompting swift action from the cryptocurrency mogul. Xu’s direct response dispelling arrest rumorsThrough his official X account, he addressed the rumors directly, posting messages to dispel any notions of his arrest. Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu played a pivotal role in disseminating the response, sharing updates on the situation through an X post. Wu highlighted that he utilized three separate X posts to counter the rumors effectively. Drawing parallels to previous incidents involving cryptocurrency figures, Wu referenced similar rumors that surfaced following the prosecution of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao in the US.Skepticism and support amidst Xu arrest rumorsThe cryptocurrency community, stirred by the news of the alleged arrest, expressed concern over the escalating scrutiny faced by OKX and its founder. However, prominent voices within the sphere, including Alvin, weighed in on the matter. Alvin took to X to voice skepticism regarding the rumors, dismissing them as likely unfounded. In a statement, Alvin asserted, “I think it is most likely a rumor. They want to force OKB to be raped.” Xu responded to Alvin’s comment with an angry face emoji, showcasing his frustration with the spread of baseless information.OKX responds to regulatory pressureThe emergence of these rumors follows OKX’s recent decision to cease operations in India amidst mounting regulatory pressures. In December 2023, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of India issued warnings to nine foreign cryptocurrency exchanges, including OKX, citing non-compliance with the country’s registration laws. OKX subsequently announced the closure of its services in India, urging customers to withdraw their funds by April 30.Star Xu’s swift dismissal of rumors regarding his arrest by US authorities underscores the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. As regulatory pressures continue to mount globally, industry figures like Xu face increased scrutiny and speculation. The response from Xu and the broader cryptocurrency community highlights the importance of transparency and clarity amidst such rumors. Moving forward, OKX and its founder remain focused on navigating regulatory challenges while maintaining trust and confidence within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The crazy Google Trends data on cryptocurrencies

From Google Trends, examining some crypto searches, you discover some anomalous data, almost certainly wrong. 
The problem lies specifically in the geolocation of searches. 

Google Trends and crypto searches: The anomalous data on Bitcoin
In the crypto field, the most searched research on Google is related to Bitcoin. 
Regarding Google searches for the word Bitcoin worldwide, in the last 12 months the country leading in search volume is El Salvador, according to Google Trends.
Although this already seems like a very anomalous fact, given that El Salvador has only 6 million inhabitants (50 times less than the USA), in second place there is Nigeria and in third place Switzerland.
The USA wouldn’t even be among the top five countries in the world for searching the word Bitcoin in the last 12 months worldwide. 
However, at least as far as El Salvador is concerned, there would be a reason: there Bitcoin is legal tender, along with the US dollar.
The data from Nigeria could also make sense, considering that the country has over 200 million inhabitants. 
Switzerland in third place instead appears more than anomalous. It is a country with 8 million inhabitants, and in which only in some specific areas (Lugano and Zug) there is some form of support for Bitcoin from the authorities. 
Switzerland has six cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, and in none of these it appears that the authorities explicitly support the use of Bitcoin. Lugano has just under 100,000 inhabitants, while Zug has only 30,000.
As if that were not enough, if Brazil is in fourth place in that ranking, which has more or less the same number of inhabitants as Nigeria, in fifth place there are the Netherlands which do not reach 18 million inhabitants. 
The fact that Slovenia is in sixth place, with only 2 million inhabitants, makes it clear that those data are incorrect. The United States of America would be in 28th place. 
By focusing the research only on the last 30 days, Slovenia even rises to third place, with Nigeria and Brazil dropping out of the top 5. 
The absurd data on cryptocurrencies on Google Trends
But there is worse. 
Examining global searches for the word crypto reveals completely nonsensical data. 
It should be noted, however, that crypto does not only mean cryptocurrencies, but nevertheless those data remain meaningless. 
In fact, the “nation” with the most Google searches in the last 12 months for the word crypto would be Saint Helena.
Saint Helena is not even a State, because it is a British overseas territory belonging to the United Kingdom of Great Britain. The island has less than 5,000 inhabitants, so it is absolutely impossible that such a small number of people have conducted all those researches. 
However, this could be explained by the research conducted through VPN. 
Crypto is a term that obviously also has to do with cryptography, and it is possible that those who deal with cryptography prefer to browse the web anonymously, or at least not tracked.
So it’s plausible that they use VPNs, and one of the things VPNs do is hide users’ real IP address by replacing it with a fake one.
For example, if many VPNs used fake IP addresses that Google Trends interprets as addresses of machines located in Saint Helena, these absurd data would be explained.
Indeed, in second place there is the usual Nigeria, but in fourth place there is the tiny Singapore, which however has 5 million inhabitants. 
In the last thirty days, Nigeria rises to first place, but Slovenia rises to third place, just like Bitcoin. 
Other absurd data
However, there are also other absurd data that make these data seemingly meaningless. 
For example, by choosing “cryptocurrencies” as the research topic instead of a specific keyword, Saint Helena has always been in the first place in the last 12 months. 
This seems to suggest that it is not so much cryptography enthusiasts who use VPNs, but rather users interested in cryptocurrencies. 
But the other positions appear totally inexplicable. 
Indeed, in second place there is Laos, and in third place Iran. 
As for Iran, which has almost 90 million inhabitants, there could also be some explanation, since Iranians may want to understand how to circumvent international sanctions, but as for the small Laos, which has only 7 million inhabitants, there seems to be no explanation at all. 
Restricting the search to the last 30 months, Iran takes the lead ahead of Nigeria, with Slovenia in third place. 
The role of memecoins
By examining Google Trends’ so-called “related queries,” it becomes clear that most of the attention actually concerns meme coins.
There are two meme coins in particular that absolutely dominate the ranking of associated queries: PEPE and BOME.
Pepe has been around for just under a year, so it is still a relatively new meme coin and maybe not very well known. 
Book of Meme ($BOME) was launched just a few days ago, so many are now looking for what it is.
Even regarding Bitcoin searches, the second associated query in the last 12 months turns out to be Pepe. 
So it is possible to imagine that those who still do this type of research on Google are not those who follow Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, but total beginners who approach this world maybe for the first time in the dream of earning a lot of money in a short time by betting on a meme coin. 
And it is also likely that this happens especially in less developed countries, so much so that these are the ones that dominate the rankings of crypto and cryptocurrencies research.

Big News for XRP Ledger: is an XRP Bull Run Coming?


																The decentralized finance ecosystem in XRP, managed by its decentralized network XRP Ledger (XRPL), has progressed after adopting the automated market maker(AMM) functionality.
Per a post on X (formerly Twitter) by XRPScan, the first AMM liquidity pools were created just a few minutes after the AMM features went live. Some pools now hold hundreds of millions of tokens, supporting pairs such as XRP/USD and XRP/BTC.


Automated Market Makers (AMMs) rely on mathematical algorithms to quote cryptocurrency prices and facilitate trades for users through liquidity pols. This approach enables anyone to participate as a liquidity provider to receive trading rewards, and users get instant liquidity through the pools above.
Bringing DeFi Enhancements to XRPL
Ripple Labs announced that the XRP Ledger intended to add an AMM engine into its network. After a year of extensive research and development, the feature is finally live.




Adding the AMM engine to XRPL facilitates token swapping and liquidity sourcing, making it more accessible to users and benefiting decentralized applications (dApps), especially decentralized exchanges (DEX).
Moreover, the feature is poised to facilitate the creation of bridges, fostering innovation within the XRP ecosystem and enabling seamless interaction with other blockchain networks.
This means that as more decentralized applications come to XRPL, XRP could see a boost in price as more users trade the token or pay transaction fees. Moreover, more protocols would begin using the token to reward network validators for their tasks.
Meanwhile, XRP’s price has decreased by 3% on the weekly scale, settling at $0.61, as per data from CoinMarketCap. It could be said that this is a result of the overall market downturn, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) falling off to $64K and $3.3K, a weekly decrease of 7% and 10% drop, respectively.However, analysts foresee a new bull run for XRP in the near future, with XRP hitting multi-year highs.

Linea Park airdrop: last week to participate

Linea, a well-known layer-2 solution for Ethereum, plans to launch its own native crypto in 2024 through an airdrop distribution that would reward all active users of its ecosystem.
One of the latest initiatives sponsored by the project is “Linea Park”: it is a GameFi incentive campaign where participants can solve tasks and challenges in exchange for LXP points that will then be converted into airdrops in the future.
What are you waiting for? There is only one week left until the end of Linea Park.
Get your share of free cryptocurrencies.

Line: everything you need to know about this layer-2
Linea is a zk-rollup layer-2 dedicated to solving scalability issues of the Ethereum blockchain, which is among the most popular in the cryptographic sector.
Launched on mainnet in July of last year, Linea has already created a very flourishing ecosystem of applications and could soon also include a native token that will likely be distributed through an airdrop program.
Similar to what happened with Starknet, the launch of the new crypto will reward all those slices of the community that have shown activity in supporting the chain in the initial development phase.
In particular, it is expected that all those who have used Linea consistently will be rewarded, bridging assets from the main Ethereum network to L2 and interacting with various smart contracts.
Roughly we can predict that the users who meet these criteria will receive the airdrop:
bridge at least once
at least 5 transactions in 3 or more months
at least 100 dollars in volumes
balance in the wallet of at least 0.05 ETH.
Furthermore, it is possible that a portion of the airdrop will be allocated to those who participated in the various incentive campaigns on Galxe and Layer3. Of these, the most important of all is “Linea Park“.
The distribution of tokens could have a strong economic impact on the community, especially considering that Linea is a product developed by the famous software development company Consensys, and that several million dollars have been raised from VC investors for the project, including Animoca Brands and Coinbase Ventures.
With a TVL doubled since the beginning of the year, amounting to 400 million dollars, Linea’s airdrop is shaping up to be one of the richest of 2024.
We still do not know the timelines of the token generation event (TGE) and distribution to the community but it is likely that these will be revealed in the second half of the current year.
Don’t get caught unprepared and interact as much as possible with the Linea blockchain. To check your progress on-chain, use a wallet checker like this.

Linea Park: last week to participate in the airdrop campaign
As excitement grows for the Linea airdrop, the “Linea Park” campaign is about to come to an end with the final date to try the experience set for April 2nd.
Linea Park represents a cornerstone event in the world of web3, which started on February 20, bringing together a wide range of dapps and emerging projects to offer the end user an unprecedented adventure where they can earn XLP points simply by solving quests.
The official partner of Linea Park is the provider layer3, who has lent their platform GameFi for the entire duration of the campaign.
These points will then be transformed into the Linea token which will be airdropped to the Ethereum zk-rollup community during the token generation event (TGE).
There is only one week left to interact with this incentive program conducted by Linea itself, so it’s better to hurry to maximize your rewards.

Altogether Linea Park includes 10 thematic areas, where each one contains overwhelming missions and XLP points up for grabs.
Joining the initiative we find a wide range of role-playing games and MMOs, action and strategy, social, minigames, NFT and much more.
All these projects are obviously set within the Linea blockchain and constitute part of the lifeblood of the cryptographic ecosystem.
Completing quests involves participating in each of these games, resolving strategic objectives, completing quizzes, performing social tasks, and sometimes even minting commemorative NFTs.
Furthermore, the program is affiliated with the ” Proof of Humanity ” section of Linea where users can verify their original identity in the web3 world, through a check with independent providers such as Gitcoin, Trusta, Nomix, 0xScore, Openid3, Pado and many others.
Completing missions on Linea Park and verifying decentralized identity POH involve commission costs that range around 100 dollars.
However, it is estimated that the XLP points obtained from these activities will be worth much more when converted into LINE tokens during the airdrop phase.
Pay attention not to miss this opportunity: to participate in Linea Park you can click here.

The $1 trillion question: Is Bitcoin crashing into 'uncharted territory'? - AMBCrypto



Despite recent dips, investors remain bullish on Bitcoin.
Exec believes supply shock can lead to price appreciation.

The crypto market appears to be in a whirlwind as Bitcoin [BTC] continues to decline despite having tested $68,000 on 21st March. The king coin dropped by almost 7% last week, bringing it to trade at $63,974 at press time.
However, investors remain ever so optimistic about the asset’s future. On 22nd March, Anthony Pompliano, founder of Pomp Investments, spoke to Yahoo Finance during the inaugural Bitcoin Investor Day in NYC. The exec shared his insights on BTC’s resilience, remarking,
“Bitcoin obviously is one of the best-performing assets. It’s a trillion-dollar asset now, and it’s infiltrated now into the traditional financial world.”
Will Bitcoin go up?
Pompliano highlighted that Bitcoin’s simple nature has contributed significantly to its value. He explained that BTC allows investors to invest in an asset that isn’t devalued while simultaneously increasing their purchasing power. 
This simplicity has made its way into Wall Street, where individuals and institutions see BTC as a viable investment option. But how does that reflect on the price front? The exec commented:
“Now, is it going to go up in the short term, medium term, long term? How much? When? All these different things come into how much do you want to allocate. How do you put it into a portfolio? Are you trading, or are you just buying and holding? But really, at the end of the day, it’s just, ok, if demand outstrips supply, the price is going to go up.”
He believes this economic principle supports the increasing interest in Bitcoin. This, in turn, leads to a bullish future that is against the backdrop of limited supply.
2024 Bitcoin halving is different 
Bitcoin’s recent behavior has been nothing short of surprising. Ergo, the question: What is different about this halving? Pompliano explained,
“We violated a lot of the rules that people previously relied on in Bitcoin….we also had never hit an all-time high before the Bitcoin halving. So I think what it just means is like we’re in uncharted territory.”
The exec pointed out that HODLers will likely view this cycle optimistically, expecting further price surges. Yet, there’s also a degree of unpredictability that can lead to widely different outcomes.

Top Analyst Who Accurately Nailed 2018 Bitcoin Bottom Says Dogecoin Ready To Rip Higher - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto trader who called Bitcoin’s (BTC) 2018 price floor thinks that top memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) is gearing up to witness a big upside move.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 250,400 followers on the social media platform X that DOGE is in a solid position to print gains against both the US dollar and Bitcoin.










According to the top trader, DOGE is primed to start another leg up in both the USD and BTC pairs after completing a three-wave correction that started in the first week of March.
“DOGE finally looks ready to rip higher again, nice big f**k off long drawn-out ABC down on the USD and BTC pairs after that initial February impulse.”
Source: Bluntz/X
The trader relies on the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rally after a three-wave ABC correction. Based on his chart, it appears that he is suggesting that Dogecoin could surge by over 50% from the current level and rise above $0.24.
DOGE is trading at $0.163 at time of writing.
Next up is fellow memecoin Pepe (PEPE). According to Bluntz, the DOGE rival looks ready to ignite a surge to a fresh all-time high.
“Pepe finally looking good for the next leg up, solid bounce from major support and still yet to put in a macro wave five higher from the lows.”
Source: Bluntz/X
From Bluntz’s chart, it appears that the pseudonymous analyst sees Pepe rising close to the $0.000014 level after completing a wave four correction at around $0.000006.
PEPE is trading at $0.000008 at time of writing.

Do Kwon Is Set To Leave Prison, Remain Under House Arrest


							

According to Montenegrin authorities, Do Kwon would leave the prison but remain under house arrest.



As a security measure, the Supreme Court in Podgorica ordered the confiscation of Kwon’s travel documents.



Kwon’s planned release links to a case of forgery that led to a four-month prison sentence ending soon.




Authorities in Montenegro have announced plans to release Terra (LUNA) founder Do Kwon from prison soon. According to the announcement, Kwon would leave the prison but remain under house arrest. As a security measure, the Supreme Court in Podgorica ordered the confiscation of Kwon’s travel documents.







It is essential to note that Kwon’s planned release links to a case of forgery that led to a four-month prison sentence ending soon. The court in Podgorica convicted the Terra (LUNA) founder for forgery after the authorities arrested him with a fake passport at the airport.









Meanwhile, the Supreme Court Council has postponed Kwon’s extradition to South Korea. The postponement is pending a decision on the request submitted by the Supreme State Prosecutor’s Office to preserve legality. 



According to reports, an aspirant legality claimed the decision to extradite Kwon falls outside the remits of the lower courts. Hence, the Montenegrin Supreme Court plans to review a request contesting the decision.



For the review, the Supreme Court would consider ‌procedure infringement, with Kwon’s legal team claiming the appellate court’s decision to override their appeal was inappropriate. They claim that only the Supreme Court reserves such powers to make such an order.



The Montenegrin authorities arrested Do Kwon in March 2023, and the embattled crypto Terra (LUNA) founder has since remained in their custody. There are two conflicting extradition requests for Kwon, one from the United States and the other from South Korea. 



Each of the extradition requests cites various charges against the crypto personality from the respective countries. Reportedly, Kwon prefers to be transferred to South Korea instead of the United States.

Ether's Price Projected to Surpass $5,400 in 2024 Amidst High Market Optimism and Potential ETF Approval



                    
Ether‘s price is on track for a significant increase, potentially hitting the $5,400 mark in 2024, according to a well-regarded technical indicator. 



This prediction comes from an analysis using the Mayer multiple oscillator, which compares Ether’s current price to its 200-day moving average. 




This insight, provided by CryptoQuant-verified author Binhdangg, was shared in a post on March 21.



The Mayer multiple oscillator indicates that Ether might not only reach but possibly exceed $5,400 in a high-risk scenario. 



Bitfinex analysts have elaborated on this projection, stating, “We expect it to reach oversold condition this year based on the fact that there is a cyclical behavior of the asset to oscillate between the overbought and oversold bands of the indicator. 




However, this is a dynamic moving average-based deviation, and the upper band may be far above the $5,400 level by the time the price reaches those levels.”



Presently, Ether is trading above $3,500, marking a 27% gap from its all-time high of $4,891 recorded on November 16, 2021, as per CoinMarketCap data.

Market sentiment is increasingly optimistic, with over 62% of participants now expecting Ether to revisit its all-time high within 2024, a significant jump from 45% just a month prior, based on Polymarket odds.



The anticipation surrounding Ether’s value is also buoyed by the potential impacts of the Dencun upgrade on the ETH/BTC ratio, hinting at a possible climb to $5,900 for Ether, considering the current BTC market price. Bitfinex analysts suggest that the BTC price could rise by the time Ether reaches this significant level.



A crucial factor that might influence Ether’s price trajectory in the short to medium term is the potential approval of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). 



This event is highly anticipated but comes with uncertainties regarding regulatory scrutiny, especially from the SEC. John Lo, founder of Recharge Capital, noted that the approval process for an Ether ETF might face more challenges compared to previous Bitcoin ETF approvals. 



The SEC has delayed its decisions on ETF applications from VanEck, Hashdex, and ARK 21Shares, with final decisions expected by late May.

In an exciting development, the second most popular meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu has staged substantial growth in the amount of SHIB that have been locked in unspendable wallets since last morning.In the meantime, the SHIB price has attempted to recover after the recent decline.SHIB burns jump by 103.45%Shibburn meme crypto tracking platform has revealed data about the Shiba Inu burns that have taken place within the period of the last 24 hours. These figures have revealed that the SHIB community has succeeded in burning a total of 34,681,610 SHIB, increasing the burn rate by 103.45%.Image via ShibburnBurning this SHIB lump has been achieved by four transfers to dead-end wallets, the largest one carried 33,673,855 SHIB meme coins, which equals 97.08% of the total burned amount of crypto.The SHIB community conducts regular meme coin burns in an attempt to reduce SHIB's supply and make the meme cryptocurrency more scarce.

Vitalik Buterin Doubles Grant for ENS, Fueling Growth and Innovation in Web3 Addresses



                    
Nick Johnson, the brain behind Ethereum Name Service (ENS), embarked on this project with uncertain financial requirements. 



To his surprise, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, granted him twice the amount he requested from the Ethereum Foundation. 




This pivotal moment was discussed by Johnson during an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph at ETHGlobal in London. 



He delved into the inception and evolution of ENS, a service enabling the creation of human-readable Web3 addresses. 



These addresses serve multiple purposes: as a Web3 wallet for cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and as a domain for decentralized websites.




Before his venture into the blockchain world, Johnson, originally from New Zealand, contributed his expertise to Google. 



His journey into cryptocurrency began with Bitcoin, but he quickly gravitated towards Ethereum, attracted by its programmability. 



He noted, “I learned about Bitcoin not long after it came out. I initially thought this was really cool, but then I realized it is just money. 



“There’s no programmability here.” With a robust background in infrastructure, tooling, and libraries, Johnson leveraged his skills to develop his own Ethereum strings library, essential for string manipulation in coding.



Johnson’s talent caught the attention of the Ethereum Foundation, which brought him onboard to tackle an existing gap in their infrastructure through the development of the name service. 



This project initially commenced within the EthSwarm team but continued to flourish as Johnson transitioned to the Go Ethereum team, eventually becoming his primary focus.

The establishment of ENS as a separate organization was propelled by a significant grant from the Ethereum Foundation, aimed at supporting a two-year roadmap. 



Buterin’s intervention to double the initial grant ensured the project’s sustainability and growth. 



Johnson reminisced, “They took it to Vitalik, and he said, ‘No, that’s not nearly enough, take twice as much.’ That’s how it started. If he hadn’t got involved, ENS would have sputtered and failed.”



Since its launch, ENS has seen over two million addresses registered. 



However, Johnson values the quality of user engagement over mere numbers, wishing to measure the utility of ENS addresses in crypto transactions more accurately. 



Despite the challenges in gauging direct metrics, Johnson is optimistic about ENS’s expansion and its adoption on various networks to enhance Web3 utility.



Looking forward, ENS plans to integrate with Ethereum layer-2 solutions, aiming to become more user-friendly and accessible. 



This strategic direction underscores Johnson’s commitment to bringing ENS closer to users and improving overall usability within the Web3 space.

Current Bitcoin Spot ETF Fund Data Announced: Negative Outlook Continues - Bitcoin Sistemi

On March 22, US Bitcoin ETFs experienced a mixed flow of fund inflows and outflows. Last Day's transaction volumes were as follows: IBIT with 1.44 billion dollars, GBTC with 660 million dollars, FBTC with 515 million dollars, ARKB with 187 million dollars and BITB with 97 million dollars.
ARKB saw an inflow of $5.4 million, equivalent to 85 Bitcoins. There was a positive inflow of $30 million into EZBC. However, GBTC experienced an outflow of $170 million. BITB and FBTC witnessed inflows of $16.3 million and $18 million, respectively. BTCO and IBIT also saw positive inflows of $4.5 million and $19 million. There was a significant inflow of $25.5 million into BRRR.


Despite these inflows, the day's total was a net negative $51 million, marking the fifth consecutive negative day.
Since their launch in January, 10 US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen total inflows of $11 billion, according to BitMEX Research. Historically, financial advisors, sophisticated family offices, hedge funds, venture capital funds, and banks have been hesitant to enter the world of digital assets other than occasionally launching internal blockchain projects to improve efficiency.






But this trend seems to be changing. Bank of America's Merrill Lynch and multinational financial services giant Wells Fargo have already begun offering access to spot Bitcoin ETFs to select asset management clients, according to media reports in February.
Analysts expect these outflows from ETFs to subside soon. “The outlook for spot BTC ETF inflows remains buoyant as most major platforms are still in the early stages of opening up access to their customers,” said David Lawant, director of research at cryptocurrency brokerage FalconX.

Why This Token Is Poised to Outperform AEVO in the Upcoming Bull Run | Cryptopolitan

The cryptocurrency market is gearing up for a potential bull run, with renewed investor confidence driving prices upwards. Within this exciting space, two projects, NFTFN and AEVO, are attracting significant attention. Both offer innovative solutions, but cater to distinct market segments. Here’s an analysis of why NFTFN might outperform AEVO in the coming months:While both projects operate within the broader blockchain ecosystem, their target audiences differ significantly. NFTFN focuses on bridging the gap between Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Their flagship product, SuperNova (SNV), tackles a major hurdle for new NFT investors: the high entry cost associated with premium “blue-chip” NFT collections.  SNV offers NFT Floor-Price Perpetuals, allowing users to gain exposure to these collections without purchasing the entire NFT itself. This opens the door for a broader range of investors to participate in the booming NFT market, fostering greater inclusivity and potentially driving wider adoption.AEVO, on the other hand, caters to a more experienced user base. It’s a decentralized derivatives exchange platform specializing in options and perpetual futures trading on a custom EVM roll-up built on Ethereum. This complex financial suite requires a deeper understanding of derivatives and risk management strategies.Market Dynamics and Growth PotentialThe NFT market witnessed explosive growth in 2021 and continues to gain momentum. Reports estimate the global NFT market to reach a staggering $230 billion by 2030. This projected growth suggests significant potential for NFTFN, which positions itself as a gateway for new investors entering the NFT space. By simplifying NFT investment and offering innovative risk management tools like hedging on blue-chip collections, NFTFN could experience significant user growth alongside the overall NFT market expansion.AEVO operates in a niche market – derivatives trading. While it caters to experienced users seeking advanced financial instruments, the overall user base is likely smaller compared to the rapidly expanding NFT market. Therefore, AEVO’s growth might be more closely tied to the broader cryptocurrency market’s performance rather than experiencing the same level of independent growth potential as NFTFN in the NFT space.Additionally, NFTFN has secured partnerships with key industry players like Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (Blockchain Partners), Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Partner), OpenSea and BitsCrunch (Pricing Partner). These collaborations bolster its credibility and pave the way for potential integrations and future collaborations.NFTFN’s vision extends to creating a vibrant NFT ecosystem. Their roadmap outlines features like cross-market capabilities for enhanced portfolio management within the platform and decentralized order matching for increased security and efficiency. Additionally, plans to develop risk-tailored indexes catering to diverse user preferences suggest a commitment to user experience and inclusivity. >> Be Among the FIRST! Get the Exclusive Perks From NFTFN Presale <<Community Building and Long-Term VisionBuilding a strong and engaged community is crucial for any successful project. While both projects are relatively new, NFTFN appears to have a more defined strategy for community engagement. Their roadmap highlights the importance of fostering a thriving NFT ecosystem, suggesting a long-term vision beyond simply facilitating transactions. This focus on community building fosters a sense of loyalty and shared purpose, which could contribute to long-term user retention and project growth.For investors seeking exposure to the burgeoning NFT market and its potential for broader adoption, NFTFN offers a compelling opportunity. Its focus on democratizing access, fostering a vibrant community, and exploring innovative solutions like NFT Floor-Price Perpetuals positions it well to capitalize on the projected growth of the NFT space.For more visit:Website: nftfn.xyzTelegram: t.me/nftfnofficialTwitter: twitter.com/nftfnofficial

The much anticipated automated market maker (AMM) feature is live on XRP Ledger (XRPL), and accompanying it are liquidity pools that show fast-growing embrace of the new feature. According to an update from XRPScan, these liquidity pools have surpassed the 1,000 milestone with a wide-ranging list of assets hosted in private pools.Per the data, one of the biggest liquidity pools features the XRP/XCASH pair with the AMM account identified as "rUCLr….ABx6D" and a balance of 273,184,692.307334 LPToken. The innovations ongoing in XRP Ledger with the launch of the AMM feature underscores the long-term yearning for this product. The AMM now positions XRP Ledger as a positive destination for decentralized exchanges (DEX) and other decentralized finance (DeFi) related innovations. Despite being ranked one of the most versatile Layer-1 blockchain networks, the lack of key features like the AMM has kept it behind its key peers.Ripple CTO David Schwartz also acknowledged the AMM feature rollout, an innovation developed for approximately two years. While he looks forward to the impact on traders and innovators, the veteran warned users to be careful when trading using the AMM.Start of many milestones to comeThe ultimate ambition of XRP Ledger is not to launch just this AMM but to evolve into a vibrant ecosystem to compete with other major chains like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and BNB Chain (BNB), respectively.Before the launch of the AMM on the mainnet, some key solutions like the Clawback amendment had also been launched. This feature enables fund recovery in cases where fraud or other events necessitate the recovery of funds from wallets.This feature serves as an insurance card for innovators, especially those who may now be making use of the new AMM update to create trading engines.

AI Challenges Will ‘Escalate Dramatically’ This Year, Says Crypto Gaming Exec - Decrypt

Artificial intelligence and its convergence with blockchain technology were hot topics at the annual VanEck Blockchain Conference in Los Angeles. For Tom Bilyeu—creator of the Project Kyzen 3D avatar and game platform—proof of authenticity is the perfect first use case, particularly in the face of AI-generated deepfakes.“I think [AI deepfakes] are going to escalate so dramatically in 2024 as we march towards the election—I don't think people understand how serious it's going to get,” Bilyeu told Decrypt, pointing to a recent AI-generated deepfake scam that impersonated MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. "Getting some sort of AI-based watermarking or putting these things on the blockchain so you can have proof of authenticity is going to be absolutely critical.”The threat of AI-generated deepfakes has grown to the point that the Biden Administration said in February that it plans to tag authentic content with digital watermarks and cryptography to fight disinformation.A web3 game developer and wellness entrepreneur, Bilyeu also co-founded Impact Theory with his wife Lisa in 2016 after selling Quest Nutrition for a reported $1 billion. The Impact Theory YouTube channel boasts over 4 million subscribers.Impact Theory sold “Founders Keys” NFT in December 2021 as a way to raise funds in exchange for a stake in the company. The firm was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last August, settling with the regulatory agency by paying a $6 million fine and burn the keys.In the mean time, Bileu introduced Project Kyzen, a digital platform with evolving game features and digital avatars in a 3D world. The project team includes ex-executives from Riot Games, Disney, and Bank of America.Since the launch of OpenAI’s GPT-4 last year, generative AI model developers have been dogged by plagiarism and copyright infringement accusations.The New York Times sued OpenAI in December over copyright infringement, claiming that millions of the outlet's articles were used to train AI models without permission. In January, OpenAI pushed back on the Times’ claims saying that the news outlet crafted its AI prompts to generate the most damning evidence possible.Proving who created a piece of information and tracking where it's been would be helpful in such a dispute, Bilyeu said.“I thought there would be a more rapid adoption of the blockchain for that purpose,” he said. “But I think people are getting caught off guard by just how fast AI is moving.”He said proving ownership is where enlisting blockchain technology as a digital ledger can be of great use.“It will certainly help in the virtual world in that you can take an item—in the same way that you could take something as proof of humanity—you could do proof of copyright ownership if you have a rights management system that plugs into the blockchain,” he said. “On a longer timeline, I think that will be incredibly useful.”Bilyeu also proposed using blockchain to create scarecity, to ensure digital assets retain value and bridge the gap between physical and virtual realms.“You actually know how many of something there are, you know where they are, and who owns them,” he said.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin price clear for new record high as GBTC outflows drop to $170M

Bitcoin (BTC) could already be seeing “momentum turning” as institutional BTC outflows recede.The latest data from sources, including United Kingdom-based investment firm Farside shows the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) losing just $170 million on March 22.BTC price consolidating before all-time high retest?The United States Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been at the center of attention for arguably the wrong reasons this week.Inflows have declined significantly versus the start of March, while GBTC outflows hit record highs, producing five consecutive days of net reductions in assets under management (GBTC).The timing appears not to be random — as Cointelegraph reported, bankrupt crypto lender Genesis is rumored to have been selling its GBTC position throughout the week.Should this now have concluded, downward pressure on ETF trends could ease.“Net flows out of the Bitcoin ETFs dropped to -$51.6mil yesterday, helped by a big slowdown in GBTC selling,” investor and entrepreneur Alistair Milne noted on X (formerly Twitter) about the flows data.“Momentum turning?”Bitcoin ETF flows (screenshot). Source: FarsideThe pivot point theory is also shared by statistician Willy Woo, creator of on-chain data resource Woobull.In a recent X post, Woo revealed a new model comparing ETF inflows with BTC price action. While he did not give specific information on which data is used for the metric, he suggested that the most intense phase of offloading might be over.“According to this new model I've been playing with, the worse of the sell down in this first phase of the consolidation may be over,” he commented. “I'm kinda expecting consolidation to run right into the halvening, thus more choppiness through April.”Bitcoin Inflow Model. Source: Willy Woo/XPseudonymous commentator WhalePanda agreed on the outlook.In his own assessment of the week’s flows, he remained optimistic on near-term BTC price action, suggesting that tailwinds for a return to price discovery could be in place by next week.“Now we'll most likely have a sideways weekend and potentially consolidate a bit more next week before the path up to new ATH,” he wrote. “Lots of people shaken out, lots of people waiting for lower. With current emission schedule at $64k we need $57.6 million of inflows per day to scoop up the daily mined coins. In less than a month with halving that total is $28.8 million.”GBTC is Bitcoin's "biggest headwind"Others were more critical of GBTC, which now retains barely half of the AUM it had when it converted to an ETF in January.Related: Bitcoin price retests $63K despite GBTC outflows dropping below $100M“The whole ecosystem is going to be much healthier when GBTC has zero AUM,” crypto author and educator Vijay Boyapati argued on March 23. “It was the product at the center of the 2022 market collapse and it's the product whose net outflows are the biggest headwind to Bitcoin now.”As a whole, the spot Bitcoin products represent the most successful ETF launch in history. Since they began trading, cumulative flows have reached $12.15 billion. Earlier, Cathie Wood, CEO of one of the ETF providers, ARK Invest, said that the bulk of institutional exposure is still to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Shiba Inu prices soared about 300% at the start of March, reaching a peak of $0.000045 on March 5. SHIB's price plummeted afterward as a result of profit-taking. After reaching a low of $0.0000235 on March 16, SHIB entered range trading, oscillating between $0.000023 and $0.000030.On-chain data lends credence to this technical narrative. Where SHIB presently trades, 100.93 trillion SHIB were bought by 140,030 addresses in the range between $0.000023 and $0.000030 at an average price of $0.000026.Global In/Out of the Money, Courtesy: IntoTheBlockThe large size of the cluster indicates that this is a key price range on-chain where a large number of addresses (or volumes of tokens) were previously purchased and would now profit if sold today because the price is higher than their acquisition cost.That said, bulls are currently focusing on this key level, which could act as a springboard for SHIB price recovery.Looking ahead, Shiba Inu will face its next big resistance in the range of $0.00003 to $0.000037, where 29.13 trillion SHIB were purchased by 143,770 addresses for an average price of $0.000033.Sustaining key range might forestall 30% declinesMeanwhile, SHIB's next support level is between $0.000019 and $0.000023, where 35.55 trillion SHIB was purchased by 47,640 addresses for an average price of $0.000021.Thus, Shiba Inu sustaining the aforementioned 100 trillion SHIB range might be key to forestalling declines to $0.000019, which represents a nearly 30% decrease from current levels.At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00002787, up 3.87% in the last 24 hours.Shiba Inu continues to garner attention. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Bitcoin and fiat, along with meme coins, are the primary focus of traders as the weekend begins.Aside from Bitcoin, meme coins are seeing an increasing amount of narratives heading into the weekend. According to Santiment, meme coin market cap drops are showing polarized views.

Argentinians Turn to Bitcoin Amid Increasing Inflation Rates: Report


																In the face of relentless inflation and economic instability, Argentinians are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a refuge, with recent data indicating a surge in purchases of the cryptocurrency.
This trend comes as Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable rally in recent months, hitting record highs and outpacing traditional hedges against inflation, such as the U.S. dollar.
Bitcoin Purchases Soar in Argentina
According to a Bloomberg report, in the first week of March alone, the number of weekly Bitcoin purchases in Argentina soared to 34,700, marking the highest volume seen in the country in 20 months. This surge represents more than double the levels observed in early February, showing Argentinians’ growing interest and adoption of Bitcoin.
The appeal of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation has intensified as the cryptocurrency has witnessed substantial gains, rising as much as 73% year-to-date and reaching an all-time high of over $73,000. This surge has been attributed to various factors, including the introduction of the U.S.’ first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipation surrounding the upcoming halving event scheduled for April.
Argentina’s inflation rate, currently at 276%, has eroded the value of the national currency, the peso, prompting citizens to seek alternative stores of value. Traditionally, the U.S. dollar has been the preferred choice for Argentinians seeking stability amidst economic turmoil. However, the recent strengthening of the peso, coupled with government efforts to stabilize the currency, has diminished the appeal of the greenback.




Dollarization Remains a Distant Prospect
President Javier Milei’s administration has taken steps to address economic challenges, including efforts to clean up the central bank’s balance sheet. While Milei had campaigned on a promise to dollarize Argentina’s economy, his approach since taking office has focused on managing the peso’s valuation rather than immediate dollarization. He has also suggested that full dollarization remains a distant prospect.
The shift towards Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty has also led to a decline in demand for traditional assets, including digital tokens tied to real-world currencies such as USDT and USDC.
Argentina has a history of economic instability, marked by frequent devaluation of its currency, which poses challenges for its residents in saving and managing finances. This has increased interest in cryptocurrency in the country, driven by the desire to avoid the effects of peso devaluation, high inflation, and limitations on accessing foreign currencies.

Bitcoin set for the worst weekend since August 2023

Bitcoin is currently facing its worst week since August as demand for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to the cryptocurrency has faltered. The price of Bitcoin has declined by more than 10% from its recent all-time high amid moderating appetite for spot Bitcoin ETFs. This downturn comes as dedicated US ETF demand dries up, prompting concerns among investors. Despite the setback, industry experts like Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood continue to highlight Bitcoin’s significance, referring to it as a “financial super highway” with important use cases.Bitcoin’s negative weekend sentiment kicks inCurrently, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) stands at $64,338.62, showing a slight decrease of 0.4% in the past hour and 0.5% since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 5.9% lower than its value 7 days ago.Currently, the global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $2.58 Trillion, with a slight decrease of -1.51% in the past 24 hours and a significant increase of 109.63% compared to one year ago.Currently, the market capitalization of BTC stands at $1.27 Trillion, indicating a Bitcoin dominance of 49.18%. Meanwhile, Stablecoins’ market cap stands at $150 billion, representing a 5.82% share of the overall cryptocurrency market cap.BTC has experienced a decline of over 10% from its all-time high, as the demand for new spot BTC exchange-traded funds decreases. This has resulted in the cryptocurrency having its worst week since August.The group of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs is set to experience its largest weekly outflow since the products were introduced on Jan. 11. Meanwhile, the largest crypto is experiencing one of its most challenging weeks of the year with a decline of approximately 6.5%. The token experienced a 2.5% decrease, reaching $63,820 on Friday.One crypto market analyst asserts that BTC is nearing the 60K mark due to decreasing ETF flows, liquidations, and rumors of delays in an Ether ETF. The markets are eagerly looking for a positive catalyst to bolster any upward movements.According to JPMorgan Chase and Co. strategists, BTC is showing signs of being overbought. They are cautioning against further declines leading up to April’s highly-anticipated halving event, which will reduce the supply of newly minted BTC from miners.According to another market analyst, the sustained open interest in CME Bitcoin futures and the declining ETF flows are indicating bearish signals for the price of BTC.BTC ETF inflow in the marketThe rate at which net inflows are entering spot BTC ETFs has significantly decreased, as there has been a notable outflow in the past week,” the strategists noted. This questions the idea that one-way net inflows will consistently characterize the flow picture of spot Bitcoin ETF. Given the upcoming halving event, it is probable that profit-taking will persist, especially considering the current overbought positioning despite the recent correction.Last month, the bank made a prediction that the price of Bitcoin would decrease to around $42,000 after April as the excitement caused by the BTC halving event fades away.Investors withdrew a significant $836 million from ETFs between Monday and Thursday, as outflows were observed from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and a decrease in subscriptions for similar offerings from companies such as BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments.According to data compiled by Bloomberg, the funds have attracted net inflows of $11.3 billion so far. This makes it one of the most successful debuts for an ETF category. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has been converted into an ETF, has experienced outflows totaling $13.6 billion.This past week, there has been a slowdown in those inflows, suggesting that interest in BTC ETFs may be leveling off, at least for now. Although Bitcoin reached a new high of nearly $73,798 on March 14, there are signs that retail traders may be losing some of their excitement, The rally’s failure to gain momentum from the all-time high raised concerns about its strength. If this event fails to maintain momentum, there is a possibility of a significant retracement, potentially causing the price to drop below $50,000.

Cryptocurrency Exchange Manager Speaks on the Possibility of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the UK - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bivu Das, Managing Director of Kraken UK, expressed strong support for the use of Bitcoin ETFs in the UK. Bitcoin ETFs should “absolutely” be available in the UK, Das said during an interview at the Digital Asset Summit in London.
Das said the global environment has improved significantly since the UK restricted such products in 2021. The manager believes that regulators' concerns about protecting retail investors are somewhat alleviated if investors do not own the underlying asset, which in this case is Bitcoin.



According to Das, Bitcoin ETFs are an interesting product with significant return potential. However, Das notes that investors in the UK are currently unable to access these products. This lack of access potentially drives investors to unregulated venues for exposure to these products, which Das describes as not an ideal situation for the UK:

“The UK has always said it wants to be a crypto hub. And ETFs are one of the key bases to potentially meet that definition.”

While the UK has recently approved the launch of cryptocurrency ETNs, these are only available to institutional investors, unlike Bitcoin ETFs, which are available to all investors in the US.

Sell-off alert: Bitcoin bearish bias remains strong


Bitcoin’s (BTC) attempt to recover and reclaim its all-time high above $73,000 is facing hurdles, with the asset currently trading below the $70,000 mark amid anticipation ahead of the halving event. Recent price movements have led to Bitcoin’s bearish price predictions, with a section of the market suggesting the outlook is part of the pre-halving retrace.
For instance, cryptocurrency trading expert Alan Santana, in a TradingView post on March 23, warned investors to brace for a sell-off, noting that Bitcoin’s bearish bias remains strong.
With Bitcoin struggling to breach the $65,000 resistance, Santana forecasted a continued downward trajectory for Bitcoin over the coming days or even weeks. The analysts anticipate that this downward movement will follow a pattern of bottom formation, accumulation, and reversal signals before any potential recovery.


As per the analyst, Bitcoin has consistently traded above the exponential moving average 21 (EMA21) daily, confirming a bearish sentiment in the market. Santana projected that the next target for Bitcoin would be around $59,000 in the short term, with a swift breach of this level expected. The subsequent levels to watch out for are $55,000, with a possible floor as low as $51,000-$53,000.

“Just keep in mind that the first crash will be fast and some 20-30% will disappear to not comeback for 6-8 months,” he said. 

Bitcoin’s levels to watch 
Examining Bitcoin’s short-term trendlines, the trading expert observes that the cryptocurrency is currently confined within a bearish territory. This indicates a prevailing negative sentiment among traders. 
Notably, for a shift towards bullish momentum, Bitcoin would need to surpass and close above $68,500, with a preliminary positive indication being a move above $66,666.

“For bullish potential to be considered or go back into play in this chart setup, Bitcoin needs to move and close above $68,500. Moving and closing above $66,666 is a good start. Any trading below $65,000 and the bearish bias remains strong while we wait for lower prices,” he added. 

In recent days, Bitcoin has experienced heightened volatility, briefly reaching close to $60,000. Analysts attribute this correction in part to overheated market conditions, labeling it a “pre-halving retrace”.
Market observers suggest that the volatility is also due to outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Notably, ETFs have seen consecutive days of money flowing out.
Bitcoin price analysis 
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $64,5700 with losses of almost 5% in the last seven days. It is worth noting that earlier in the week, Bitcoin briefly touched the $68,000 mark before correcting.

Why DeCC Is the Future of Crypto - Decrypt

About the AuthorAlexander Zaidelson is the CEO of Secret Labs, or SCRT, which specializes in scaling technologies to ensure privacy across Web3. He previously served as Chief Business and Data Officer of Israel-based decentralized exchange (DEX) VirtuSwap, where he remains a strategic advisor.
The views expressed here are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Decrypt.We often talk about the value of “decentralization” delivered by blockchain technology. This term often represents robustness, censorship resistance, and a “bottom-up” system of support that could help secure and democratize world-changing applications.The benefits of decentralization are already being realized across a number of major fields, including finance (DeFi), physical infrastructure (DePIN), social networks (DeSo), scientific research (DeSci), artificial intelligence, and more. Realistically though, these applications are heavily restricted by a critical issue: data confidentiality.Since most traditional blockchains are fully transparent, user data is instantly public and can be used for analysis and research. This makes Web3 much less suitable for institutional players and, in some cases, makes its use truly impossible. How can we protect the sensitive raw data demanded by each of these and hundreds of other applications while still reaping the benefits of decentralization?The answer is decentralized confidential computing, otherwise known as DeCC.Confidential computing has existed for years but has often been lumped together with privacy chains, a misunderstanding that hides the true power of this technology. DeCC is a distinct category that can secure compliance and corporate use cases.DeCC meets the blockchainConfidential computing is the ability to protect data during processing and it has been a critical offering in the Web2 world. Companies like Microsoft, Google, IBM, NVIDIA, and others already offer powerful confidential computing solutions. However, this industry mega-trend is only now becoming understood in the Web3 world. Buzzword-heavy initiatives like “decentralized AI” and DePIN have exposed the limitations of completely transparent blockchains, and builders are turning to decentralized confidential computing as the solution.DeCC provides protected computing, making it possible to perform arbitrary computations on data without revealing that data to the world. It is important, however, to distinguish confidential computing blockchains from projects focusing solely on transactional privacy, such as Monero or ZCash.We are seeing this technology enable hundreds of new use cases across Web3 infrastructure. To name a few:
Confidential trading strategies for DeFi 
AI model training on confidential data
AI models with confidential parameters
Sealed-bid auctions for DeFi, DeSci, and NFT worlds
NFTs with protected data, enabling true ownership of content on Web3
Confidential on-chain voting (e.g. for DAOs)
A decentralized on-chain identity that doesn’t reveal data to everyone
Multiple gaming use cases
Confidential computing also enables opt-in compliance. With fine-grained access control, users can choose who can have access to their data and when they can have it.The tech behind DeCCDeCC can be implemented using several leading technologies that enable it on blockchains. These include Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP),  Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Fully-Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). With variations in security, speed, and flexibility, these all empower smart contracts that perform decentralized confidential computations and protect user data. As a starting point, here is an incomplete list of projects using these technologies:
TEEs are used by Oasis, Phala, and Marlin to empower fast, secure, hardware-dependent computations,
MPC is used by Fairblock and Partisia to ensure no single party has full access to confidential information,
ZKPs are used by Aztek, Aleo, Penumbra, and Manta Network to enable questions to be answered without any data being revealed, and
FHE is used by Fhenix and Inco to provide fully secure computation on encrypted data
Each technology has unique benefits and advantages, and all of them will play an important role in the future of DeCC. We will see more projects combining several different DeCC technologies for the best results.The future of DeCCDeCC is the missing piece of the Web3 stack that will enable new types of powerful decentralized applications—ones that empower innovation and pave the way for broader adoption. It’s surprising to find out how many blockchain use cases benefit substantially when you can control access to data, verify integrity, and encrypt sensitive information in a decentralized manner.DeCC is a key building block of the decentralized web, taking its place alongside DeFi, DePin, DeSo, DeSci, and Gamefi. It enriches existing use cases, enables a slew of new ones, and serves as a key driver for wider adoption.Considering the industry’s focus on modularity in blockchains, DeCC fits perfectly. It provides a Confidential Execution Layer as a fifth layer, while Execution, Consensus, Data Availability, and Settlement are the other four.There will be a day in Web3 when it is standard practice to perform confidential computations and protect data stored on chain, instead of being a novel idea. Only then will we have achieved the full promise of decentralized networks - and only then will we have unlocked blockchains for individuals and institutions everywhere.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Federal Judge Blasts U.S. SEC's Misconduct in Crypto Case | Cryptoglobe


                                
As Bloomberg News recently reported earlier this week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was criticized by a federal judge in Utah for what was described as an egregious misuse of its authority in its case against Digital Licensing Inc., which operates as DEBT Box. This decision, delineated in an 80-page legal document, marks a rare judicial rebuke of the regulatory body by Judge Robert Shelby of the Salt Lake City federal district court.



According to Bloomberg, the judge’s condemnation centered on the SEC’s actions during its legal proceedings against the cryptocurrency platform. The SEC had accused DEBT Box of defrauding investors out of at least $49 million in July 2023, leading to an asset freeze and the company being placed into receivership at the SEC’s behest. However, the integrity of the SEC’s claims came under scrutiny, culminating in the reversal of the asset freeze upon the revelation that the SEC may have presented “materially false and misleading representations” to secure it.



Bloomberg highlighted a specific instance where the SEC’s assertions about DEBT Box’s activities were questioned. The SEC had claimed that DEBT Box was transferring investor funds abroad, a claim that, upon dispute, was revealed to be based on inference rather than direct evidence, drawing partly from a DEBT Box official’s YouTube video.



Bloomberg’s report went on to say that Judge Shelby’s findings were damning, noting that the SEC’s conduct involved a series of misrepresentations and misleading statements, undermining not only the proceedings against DEBT Box but also the judicial process at large. As a result, Judge Shelby mandated that the SEC cover DEBT Box’s attorney’s fees and other related costs, marking a significant admonishment of the regulator’s practices.



In response to these developments, Bloomberg reports that Gurbir Grewal, the SEC’s enforcement chief, extended apologies to the court for the oversights in the DEBT Box case, acknowledging the need for additional training for SEC enforcement staff on the standards required when seeking emergency relief.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The case has sparked a broader conversation about the SEC’s enforcement actions, particularly in the crypto industry, which has often found itself at odds with the regulator. The incident has not only garnered attention on social media but also prompted concerns from several Republican senators regarding the potential erosion of public trust in the SEC’s enforcement capabilities.











On 8 February 2024, Senator JD Vance (R-OH), along with Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Katie Britt (R-AL), sent a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler to raise concerns over the enforcement of this case.



In this letter, the senators stated:



“We write to express our concerns regarding developments in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“the Commission”) enforcement proceedings against Digital Licensing Inc., also known as “DEBT Box,” the company’s principals, and 13 other defendants.“As part of these proceedings, the Commission sought a temporary asset freeze, restraining order, and other emergency relief against DEBT Box, all of which were granted by the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah. However, the Court became aware that “the Commission made materially false and misleading representations…and undermined the integrity of the proceedings.” In the meantime, the restraining order froze the defendants’ personal and business assets, shut down DEBT Box, and caused its native token to crash by more than 56 percent. The Commission’s Enforcement Division Director, Grubir Grewal, admitted to these misrepresentations in its request that the court refrain from levying sanctions. We are greatly concerned by the Commission’s conduct in this case. It is unconscionable that any federal agency—especially one regularly involved in highly consequential legal procedures and one that, under your leadership, has often pursued its regulatory mission through enforcement actions rather than rulemakings—could operate in such an unethical and unprofessional manner…“As you know, the Commission’s mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation is of the utmost importance. The public must have wellplaced confidence in the Commission’s enforcement actions, its motives for undertaking them, and its professionalism when carrying them out. This trust is undermined, and your mission compromised, by episodes like the DEBT Box case.”

Ethereum Drops Below The 100-Day Moving Average - What's Next?


                            The crypto market is experiencing a pullback after Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, reached a new all-time high. However, Ethereum (ETH) is not left out in this downward move.
After setting a new yearly high of $4,094, the price of Ethereum has been moving downward and this has led to the price trading below the 100-day Moving Average (MA) both in the 1-hour and 4-hour timeframes, but this is not so in the daily timeframe. 
Will the price continue downward or will it change direction and start moving upward? At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price was trading around $3,360 and was up by 0.64% in the last 24 hours.
Ethereum Indicators And What They Suggest
Looking at the chart, technically we can see that a support level of $3,067 and a resistance level of $3,681 and $3,591 have been formed respectively. Nonetheless, there could be more support and resistance created if the price continues to move downward.
4-Hour Moving Average: A technical observation of the chart from the 4-hour timeframe as seen in the image below reveals that the price is trending below the 100-day moving average. This suggests that the price is on a downtrend and could potentially move further downward.

 4-Hour RSI indicator: With the help of the Relative Strength Index indicator (RSI) we can see the RSI signal line is trending below the 50 line. This is a strong indication that the price of Ethereum is in a downward trend as observed in the image above.
MACD Indicator: Taking a close look at the MACD indicator in the 4-hour timeframe, it appears that the MACD histogram has dropped below the zero line. In addition, both the MACD line and the signal line have crossed below the zero line. 
This setup indicates that the price is still bearish and there are possibilities that it could still move downward. The image below provides more details:

Possible Outcome
If the price of Ethereum continues downward and breaks below the support level of $3,067, it could move further downward to create a new support level. However, if the price fails to break below this support level, we could see a price reversal and may start a fresh trend upward. Thus there could be a possibility that the price could break above the resistance levels of $3,681 and $3,591 respectively, and continue its bullish run.

Parts can be digitally tagged using unique identifiers on the blockchain to trace their entire lifecycle across suppliers and manufacturers. Tamper-proof ledgers also bring greater transparency and audibility to automotive supply chains.
Improved Supply Chain Management 
Automakers rely on just-in-time manufacturing with large supplier networks spread globally. Complex supply chains make identifying bottlenecks, quality issues, and part provenance difficult. Blockchain enables real-time tracking of parts as they move through multiple tiers of suppliers. It also brings transparency, financing arrangements, and inventory levels. Automakers can use blockchain to identify counterfeit parts, improve recall management, and verify sources. Smart contracts can be used for order fulfillment, invoice generation, and payments to streamline supply chain administration.
Automotive Maintenance and Recall Handling
Blockchain can transform maintenance logs and vehicle service histories into tamper-proof digital records. This provides transparency during sales of used vehicles and aids recall handling. When maintenance records are linked to the digital identities of vehicles, nearby service centers can have real-time access to maintenance requirements. Smart contracts can enable automated payment processing when contract conditions are met. Ride-sharing fleet operators and rental car companies can benefit from comprehensive maintenance insights through blockchain.
Demonstration of automotive industry growth
Usage-Based Insurance
Insurers are exploring blockchain to price policies based on real vehicle usage accurately. Metrics like mileage, driving behavior, and vehicle health can be reliably tracked on a tamper-proof ledger. This enables flexible, customized insurance plans as opposed to fixed annual premiums. Autonomous payments can be automatically triggered based on insurance terms coded into smart contracts. Accident liability can also leverage usage data for fairer judgment. Blockchain standardization offers interoperability between insurers, their partners, and customers.

Explore the dynamic landscape of venture capital funding in the crypto industry and gain valuable insights into emerging trends with this comprehensive article.

Autonomous Payments and Smart Contracts
Blockchain enables automated payments triggered when contract conditions are fulfilled. Smart contracts are self-executing based on if-then scenarios. For example, ride-sharing drivers may receive payments once their ride is complete. Electric vehicles can autonomously pay for charging stations. Tolls, parking fees, and related transactions can also leverage smart contracts for seamless automation. This also lowers infrastructural needs. Related areas like enabling access rights, vehicle feature unlocks, and loyalty rewards can also benefit.
Vehicle Identity and Ownership
Vehicle identity and ownership management are crucial but fragmented in the automotive industry. Blockchain can create unique digital IDs for vehicle ownership histories securely tracked on distributed ledgers. This provides transparency during sales of new and used vehicles. Multiple parties like insurers and lenders can gain trusted insights into asset ownership. It also assists law enforcement and regulators in combating theft. Overall, blockchain strengthens integrity across vehicle identity and ownership processes.

Blockchain Use Cases and Examples
Supply Chain Tracking
Automakers like BMW and Ford are actively exploring blockchain for supply chain transparency. BMW has piloted blockchain to track auto parts across international suppliers starting from their origin. It provides an immutable audit trail across tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 suppliers. Ford similarly tracks vehicle components from supply to assembly lines to build trust. Recalls can also be efficiently traced back to faulty batches and root causes.
Usage-based Insurance 
Insurers like Progressive and Allstate now offer usage-based insurance for driving behavior metrics. Customers can voluntarily install telematics devices or utilize mobile apps to share odometer readings, accident history, and even driving style factors. This enables highly personalized, flexible insurance offerings. Blockchain strengthens integrity and auditability in usage metrics. Decentralized oracles can securely feed external data like weather or traffic conditions into smart contracts.
Autonomous Payments
Daimler already enables automated payments at electric charging stations using blockchain. Payment actions are triggered by smart contracts once charging is complete. This improves efficiency for drivers and infrastructure providers. Volkswagen, too, is exploring blockchain payments that deduct tokens as cars drive through toll booths or parking lots. Token balances can be topped up in advance, creating seamless transaction experiences.

Explore the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in revolutionizing the Crypto Industry and its transformative impacts, uncovered with this comprehensive article.

Vehicle Identity and History
Blockchain is envisioned to underpin comprehensive digital IDs for vehicles. This encompasses identifying attributes like VINs but extends into ownership changes, insurance claims, accident reports, etc. Toyota and Ford are among the companies developing blockchain platforms for vehicle identity and history transparency. This benefits dealerships, repair shops, and even law enforcement. Comprehensive insights can also help augment reliability and safety.
Ride-hailing and Car Rentals
Ride-hailing fleets and rental cars see high utilization and movement between users. Blockchain can optimize utilization and asset tracking. It can enable dynamic risk assessment and pricing when integrated with usage-based insurance. Health metrics like mileage and maintenance needs can be centrally tracked even as vehicles switch between riders or renters. Payments also become frictionless with blockchain-based smart contracts.
Challenges and Limitations for Blockchain in Automotive
Scalability Limitations
Public blockchains used for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are limited in scalability at present. Ethereum processes 15 transactions per second, which lags far behind Visa’s 24,000. Automotive use cases must leverage private, permissioned blockchains with higher transaction throughput. Consortium models can also help coordinate blockchain adoption across industry stakeholders.
Integration with Legacy Systems
Integrating with legacy IT systems is essential for blockchain to impact existing automotive processes. Inventory management, billing, customer relationship management, and other back-end systems need appropriate interfaces. A phased approach can allow automakers and suppliers to gain experience before expanding blockchain across processes. APIs and middleware layers may be needed for interoperability.
Regulatory Uncertainty 
Smart contracts and blockchain-based records establish a new paradigm for automotive processes. However, legislation around data privacy, financial transactions, liability assignment, and more must be clarified. Governments also need to define compliance requirements for blockchain-based systems. Close collaboration between technology and regulatory stakeholders is crucial.
Lack of Standards
While some blockchain protocols like Ethereum are gaining adoption, there are yet to be definitive standards, especially for the automotive context. Interoperability between blockchain platforms, apps, and data schemas will require strong industry standards. Common standards are also essential for ensuring distributed ledgers remain synchronized correctly. Developing standards will facilitate integration with legacy IT as well.
Future Outlook for Blockchain in Automotive
Scalability and Adoption Growth 

Adopting can gain momentum as blockchain platforms scale through second-generation evolutions and optimized consensus protocols. Automakers seem particularly bullish on permissioned consortium blockchains for supply chain transparency. Such private networks avoid public blockchains’ latency and cost issues by limiting participation. Automobile blockchain use cases will progress from proof of concepts to production with faster transactions.
Business Opportunities
Blockchain creates new value propositions and business models. Automakers can monetize usage data through smart contracts. Auto insurance can evolve into highly personalized offerings. Blockchain also enables new peer-to-peer services for ride-sharing, car rentals, and vehicle charging. New ecosystems can be built on open blockchain platforms where traditional sector boundaries dissolve.
Platformization Potential 
Widely adopted open blockchain protocols can enable new ecosystems like Android on mobile or the Internet. This creates opportunities for innovation and collaboration. Network effects due to standardization provide benefits across interconnected members. Emerging developments like decentralized finance and NFTs indicate rapid platform-based business growth is possible with blockchain.
Integration with IoT, Big Data, and AI
Blockchain will interface heavily with IoT ecosystems as vehicles become rich data devices through telematics and in-car sensors. Big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning can provide actionable insights atop the auditable data foundation established by blockchain. This can hugely expand the possibilities for usage-based services and personalized customer experiences.

European Union (EU) Adopts Bans and Regulations Regarging Some Areas About Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a major regulatory move, the European Union (EU) has made it illegal to make cryptocurrency payments of any size using anonymous self-storage cryptocurrency wallets.
The move is part of wider new anti-money laundering laws (AML) being introduced across the continent.


The ban was approved by the majority of the leading committee of the EU Parliament on March 19, as Patrick Breyer explained in an article. Dr. is a member of the European Parliament of Deutsch Piraten Partei. Breyer was one of two leaders who opposed this ratification. The other dissenting vote came from Gunnar Beck, a member of Parliament representing the Alternative Für Deutschland (AfD) party.

The new AML law specifically targets certain thresholds for cash payments and any anonymous crypto payments. Notably, any cash payments over €10,000 and anonymous cash payments over €3,000 will be considered illegal.





The ban on payments with cryptocurrencies will specifically apply to unidentified wallets, also known as wallets operated and hosted by service providers. This includes any self-custody wallets provided by mobile, desktop or browser applications.
According to Dillon Eustace, an Ireland-based law firm, the newly approved AML package will be implemented three years after it comes into force. However, the firm expects these laws to be fully functional before the standard implementation timeline.

Trade finance might not be sexy, but it’s blockchain’s key to success - Blockworks


In the sands of Arrakis and the bustling markets of feudal Japan, trade is the lifeblood of society. 
Just as the characters in Dune and Shogun navigated intricate webs of alliances and commerce, businesses face similar challenges in today’s complicated global trade landscape. 
Yet, as supply chains become increasingly complex, it’s blockchain technology that is up to the task of revolutionizing and modernizing trade finance, offering a transformative solution to the persistent trade finance gap.
While trade may sound like a complex conversation, two recent releases covering the subject have drawn massive audiences. Dune: Part Two has generated over $490 million at the box office, and Shogun garnered 9 million streaming views globally to become the best worldwide debut to date for a Disney General Entertainment scripted series.
Today in the real world, trade also stretches across the globe, creating challenges for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) who need funding to support their operations. 
The recent rise in interest rates and the tightening of credit has led to more difficulty in managing capital demands — squeezing businesses on both sides of their ledger with higher costs to produce and higher costs to borrow. 
Current financial institutions are unable to adequately respond to these demands on their own, especially in regions that lack adequate banking. Clearly, the traditional banking system has not caught up with the needs of the global supply chain.
Enter blockchain.
Blockchain offers financial institutions the ability to leverage distributed ledger technology and digital asset solutions to meet the excessive demand for capital with sufficient supply. For that reason, the most prevalent and impactful use case for blockchain will be in the trade finance industry.
The $5 trillion trade finance gap represents the collective difference in the demand for capital and the supply of capital for global shipments, obstructing the flow of funds to where it’s needed most — MSMEs. 
Mirroring the struggles of those small traders in Shogun’s ancient markets, MSMEs find themselves at a disadvantage due to inefficiencies, lack of visibility and centralized systems that hinder their access to funding.
Blockchain, as a decentralized and transparent ledger, emerges as a powerful tool to address the shortcomings of traditional trade finance. It’s clear that the most prevalent and impactful use case for the technology will be in the trade finance industry.
Blockchain creates new opportunities — for suppliers, buyers, banks and non-bank originators — and new rails to conduct commerce in real time, all the while carrying immutable data, records, capital and digital representations of real world assets.
As governments around the world recognize this potential, blockchain’s role in global trade will become increasingly indispensable. We are seeing this already with the United Nations’ Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR), which allows for transferable documents and instruments in electronic form, and other regulatory advancements in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America. 
Unlike in Dune’s Arrakis and Shogun’s shores of feudal Japan, our modern trade networks can flourish and help solve suppliers’ growing demands, even easing pandemic-era disruptions. 
Blockchain also offers the greatest opportunity for MSMEs, originators and investors — who have been in the global supply chain trenches — to rise above outdated models and create a new vibrant ecosystem for businesses. And when user-friendly interfaces are more widespread, blockchain’s momentum will really be unstoppable.
Read more from our opinion section: Blockchain really is better than middlemen
With these opportunities, one would think people across the blockchain and crypto spaces would embrace its power to create new rails for businesses to build on and economies to scale. But there seems to be a real misunderstanding of what blockchain’s opportunity holds. Or perhaps there is a lack of understanding of trade finance and its value proposition. 
By contrast, investing in the hottest dog memecoin is an easy proposition to understand. This is the conundrum of blockchain. Users want the excitement of a fervent market over the slower path toward trade finance adoption.
The route is more challenging for protocols to gain traction with those in the space who don’t understand blockchain’s trade finance value proposition. This limiting spirit won’t solve the problem of how to fund MSMEs across the globe and, in turn, feed value back to blockchain networks. 
In the end, our ethos should be rooted in this question: How do we create a more egalitarian way to help all boats rise, to ensure everyone succeeds? 
We do it by making blockchain more accessible to more people. Everyone will win — those who want to own a memecoin and those who want to create a better way for businesses across the globe to grow and prosper. Or even those who want both.

EU enacts ban on anonymous crypto transactions via self-custody wallets

In a recent regulatory change, the European Union (EU) has prohibited cryptocurrency transactions of any value made through unidentified self-custody crypto wallets. This update is a component of the region's newly implemented Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.According to a post by Patrick Breyer, a member of the European Parliament for the Deutsch Piraten Partei, the majority of the EU Parliament’s lead commission endorsed the prohibition on March 19.Notably, Dr. Breyer is one of the two leaders who opposed this approval. Gunnar Beck was the other Parliament member who voted against it, representing the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The ban on cryptocurrency payments applies specifically to unregistered wallets offered by service providers (hosted wallets), covering self-custody wallets provided via mobile, desktop, or browser applications.Source: Patrick BreyerThe recent Anti-Money Laundering legislation specifically outlaws certain limits for cash transactions and anonymous cryptocurrency payments. Under these regulations, cash transactions exceeding €10,000 and anonymous cash payments over €3,000 will be deemed illegal.The approved laws are expected to be fully operational within three years from their entry into force. However, Dillon Eustace, an Ireland law firm expects these laws to become fully operational before the usual enforcement timeline.Fundamentally, many cryptocurrency networks function within permissionless environments, allowing anyone to create a cryptographic private key and granting unrestricted entry into the system. Related: UK treasury seeks to improve AML through crypto supervision changesThis characteristic lies at the heart of cryptocurrencies’ fundamental principles, offering a more inclusive, liberated, and equitable financial system that does not discriminate against its users in any form.Experts and freedom advocates consider this recent approval a hit against financial freedom and fundamental human rights. German MEP Patrick Breyer opposes the bill, claiming it compromises economic independence and financial privacy. He considers the ability to transact anonymously to be a fundamental right.The crypto sector, known for its emphasis on privacy and decentralization, has responded critically to the EU’s regulatory measures. These new regulations have created mixed reactions, whereby some believe the new AML laws are necessary, while others fear they may infringe on privacy and hinder economic activity. Daniel “Loddi” Tröster, the Sound Money Bitcoin Podcast host, underscored the practical hurdles and consequences of the recent legislation, elaborating on the impact on donations and the broader implications for cryptocurrency use within the EU. He articulated concerns over the stifling effect these rules might have. Notably, self-custody to self-custody transactions are not affected by the new law.Magazine: Hodler’s Digest, Jan. 7–13: Venezuela shuts down Petro, SEC’s X account hacked, Bitcoin ETFs go live

Ripple vs. SEC: Sealed documents set for public viewing

In the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, significant developments have occurred. The SEC has filed its opening remedies brief along with supporting documents, albeit under seal. These developments come as the latest in a series of legal moves that have captivated the attention of the cryptocurrency industry. The sealed documents, once redacted, will become available to the public, shedding light on the SEC’s stance and proposed remedies against Ripple Labs.James K. Filan, a prominent lawyer in the XRP community, announced the update via a post on X. According to Filan, the parties involved, SEC and Ripple Labs, have agreed to a timeline for making these documents public.They plan to meet on March 25 to discuss the necessary redactions before filing a redacted version in the public docket by March 26. This step aligns with previous sealing requests made earlier in the week, aiming to protect sensitive information while keeping the public informed.Ripple to file sealed opposition in AprilBoth parties have clearly outlined the process for redacting and filing these documents. After the SEC’s initial filing, Ripple Labs will follow with its opposition next month. Specifically, XRP will file its opposition under seal on April 22.Following a similar procedure, the parties will meet the next day to identify necessary redactions, with a public version of the opposition to be filed by April 24. This systematic approach ensures that while sensitive information remains protected, the public and interested stakeholders have access to the proceedings and arguments within this landmark case.Furthermore, the SEC plans to file its reply to Ripple’s opposition in the same manner. After filing under seal on May 6, redactions will be made by May 7, with the edited version submitted by May 8. These steps underscore the importance of confidentiality for certain details within the lawsuit, particularly concerning financial records and contracts related to Ripple’s institutional XRP sales post-December 2020 complaint.Experts debate Ripple’s potential SEC penaltiesThe legal confrontation began when Ripple was accused of selling $770 million worth of XRP to institutional clients without proper registration, a move considered by the SEC as a violation of securities law. The ongoing remedies phase could significantly impact Ripple, with speculations about the possible imposition of hefty penalties.Some experts suggest penalties could reach up to $3 billion if Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) sales are deemed securities. However, predictions about the size of potential fines vary, with some believing that penalties might not exceed Ripple’s legal expenses, estimated at around $200 million.This lawsuit has financial implications not only for Ripple but also for the cryptocurrency market. The outcomes could set precedents for how digital assets are regulated and defined under U.S. securities law. As the parties prepare their redacted filings, stakeholders within and beyond the cryptocurrency community await further revelations. The meticulous process of redaction and public disclosure reflects the delicate balance between transparency and the protection of sensitive information in high-stakes legal battles.

Ether ETFs coming in Q2 2024? Probably not

With anticipation surrounding the potential approval of Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in May, sentiments vary among analysts and investors. Bloomberg analysts suggest the likelihood of spot Ether ETF approval in May has diminished, citing regulatory concerns.Anticipation is high as the SEC prepares to decide, yet uncertainty lingers regarding regulatory clarity and market reactions.Ether ETFs stand to miss the predicted timelineAccording to a Bloomberg ETF analyst, the likelihood that spot ether ETFs will be approved in May has decreased. The analyst cites the apparent absence of involvement of U.S. regulators with potential issuers regarding these products.James Seyffart, an analyst for the Bloomberg Intelligence ETF funds, wrote on X on Tuesday, “We now believe these will ultimately be denied on May 23 for this round.” In May, Seyffart and his colleague Eric Balchunas had previously estimated the likelihood of approval at 35%.Having previously delayed a decision regarding an exchange-traded fund that trades spot ether, the Securities and Exchange Commission will now be obligated to render a decision by May 23, as that date represents the ultimate straw for one of the applicants.Seven issuers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco with Galaxy, Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares with Ark, and Hashdex, are presently expressing interest in launching an ether fund.Seyffart observed that the SEC and issuers regarding the spot ether ETF have not engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth, in contrast to the exhaustive deliberations that occurred prior to the January approval of spot bitcoin ETFs.Crypto ETFs struggle for recognition and survivalChairman Gary Gensler stated in a January statement that the SEC’s approval of spot bitcoin ETF products was “congruent with ETPs holding a single non-security commodity, bitcoin.”Gensler further stated that the approval represented “the most sustainable course of action” due, in part, to the SEC’s August court loss to Grayscale Investments.During a panel discussion on Tuesday in London, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein stated that the litigation hinged on the “inextricable tie” between the spot market and the regulated bitcoin futures market.The argument was that since the SEC had approved bitcoin futures ETFs, it was unjust to deny spot BTC products. In the past ten weeks, ten spot bitcoin ETFs have been traded on US markets following Grayscale’s legal victory.In October, the US securities regulator authorized trading in ether futures ETFs; this is a fact cited by a number of industry observers who contend spot ether ETFs are inevitable.Similar to the bitcoin futures ETFs, these funds contain futures contracts that are traded on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).A number of industry executives expressed their views prior to a crypto report that disclosed the SEC had issued subpoenas to multiple US companies in connection with their transactions with the Ethereum Foundation, an organization responsible for supervising the Ethereum blockchain.However, the potential investigation has reignited a longstanding inquiry: Is it a commodity or a security? Segment observers have noted that this inquiry would influence the SEC’s approach to its regulation of ether ETFs.Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, stated in a series of X posts that the SEC “has no good reason” to deny the spot ether ETF applications.“And we hope they won’t try to invent one by questioning the long established regulatory status of ETH, which the SEC has repeatedly endorsed. That’s not how the law works. And Americans deserve better.”

Crypto analysts can't seem to narrow down the exact Bitcoin halving date - Here’s why

Bitcoin halving events occur approximately every four years, but the exact timing of each halving is uncertain due to the nature of the Bitcoin network.  Bitcoin’s protocol adjusts the difficulty of mining every 2016 blocks, aiming to maintain an average block time of 10 minutes. However, network activity variations can cause block time fluctuations, affecting the exact timing of halving events.Bitcoin halving dates – What we knowBTC halving, a significant event in the cryptocurrency world, occurs approximately every four years, reducing the reward for miners by half. While the concept of halving is well understood, predicting its exact timing remains elusive. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network with no central authority governing its protocol. Unlike traditional financial systems, where centralized entities control monetary policies, Bitcoin relies on a distributed network of miners and nodes. This decentralized structure makes it challenging to predict precisely when the next halving will occur.Bitcoin’s protocol adjusts mining difficulty approximately every two weeks to maintain a consistent block production rate of around one block every ten minutes. The time between blocks can vary due to network hash rate fluctuations. As a result, the exact timing of each halving event depends on the rate at which new blocks are added to the blockchain, which is unpredictable.While Bitcoin’s protocol aims for a block time of ten minutes, actual block times can vary. Factors such as changes in mining hardware efficiency, fluctuations in network participation, and external events impacting miners’ behavior can influence block creation times. These variations make it challenging to pinpoint the precise moment when the predetermined block height for halving will be reached.Bitcoin network volatility natureVarious factors influence Bitcoin’s network growth and adoption rates, including regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market dynamics. The rate at which new users join the network and invest in mining infrastructure impacts the hash rate and, consequently, the timing of halving events. Since these factors are subject to change and difficult to predict accurately, forecasting the exact timing of halving events becomes even more challenging.Bitcoin’s price and market sentiment can affect miners’ behavior and, consequently, the network’s hash rate. If miners anticipate a significant price increase following a halving event, they may ramp up their mining activities to capitalize on potential profits before and after the halving. Conversely, if market conditions are uncertain or bearish, miners may adjust their operations, impacting the network’s hash rate and, consequently, the timing of halving events.Do not forgot this!!Each block contains a distinct hash, represented by a 64-digit hexadecimal string. Miners must successfully discover this hash in order to earn the privilege of adding the block to the chain and receiving the associated reward. The current reward of 6.25 BTC will soon be reduced to 3.125 BTC.Miners operate advanced machines called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that can generate trillions of hashes every second. With an increase in machines, there is a corresponding increase in the number of trillions of hashes being generated. Over time, this should result in a higher amount of Bitcoin being mined despite the inherent randomness involved. This is how the industrialized bitcoin mining industry we are familiar with operates.Discovering blocks involves a random process. At times, they can be found in a matter of seconds, while on other occasions, it may take hours. The uncertainty surrounding the timing of the next block and the next halving makes it difficult to predict accurately.While Bitcoin halving events occur approximately every four years, pinpointing the exact timing of each event is inherently challenging due to the decentralized nature of the network, variable block creation times, and unpredictable market dynamics. While analysts can make educated guesses based on historical data and network trends, the precise timing of halving events remains uncertain until they occur.

Hedera Joins Ripple, Coinbase at UK Crypto Business Council


							

Hedera has secured a pivotal alliance with the UK Cryptoasset Business Council (UKCBC).



Other crypto firms that have joined UKCBC include Ripple and Coinbase



Crypto market participants anticipate a potential positive impact on the HBAR token.




Hedera, the team behind the HBAR token, has secured a pivotal alliance that could positively impact its native asset. In a recent post on X, the Hedera team announced joining the UK Cryptoasset Business Council (UKCBC).







Hedera expressed excitement about officially joining UKCBC, considering the roster of prominent crypto-based tech firms that have previously joined the council. This includes crypto payment firm Ripple, U.S.-based exchange Coinbase, DEX platform Uniswap (UNI), and institutional crypto platform Archax.









Notably, the UK Cryptoasset Business Council is dedicated to advancing the UK’s crypto ecosystem, focusing on supporting users, investors, and businesses. Its mission includes encouraging innovation, ensuring consumer protection, and promoting growth through well-crafted policies. 



The announcement of Hedera entering UKCBC has attracted significant attention in the crypto community. Crypto market participants congratulate Hedera on the feat and anticipate the potential impact on the HBAR token.



Meanwhile, HBAR is yet to record positive gains following this announcement. In the last 24 hours, HBAR is down 4.15%, mirroring the broader market downturn influenced by Bitcoin. The asset has also crashed by over 6.4% since last, putting its price at $0.1079.



While it currently battles bearish forces, the asset has been a notable performer in this emerging bull market. As of last November, it traded as low as $0.06. It has since grown by 123% to reach a yearly peak price of $0.1339. At $0.1079, the asset remains 80% below its 2021 all-time high of $0.5701.

Shiba Inu Rival That’s Soared Over 500% in a Month Primed To Be This Bull Run’s Main Memecoin: Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist believes one red-hot Shiba Inu (SHIB) rival will be a top performer in the ongoing bull market.
Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 211,200 followers on the social media platform X that he is bullish on the dog-themed crypto asset Floki (FLOKI) due to significant project announcements.










“Important announcement on Thursday. Roadmap release on Friday. Nothing stops this train. This is what is positioning FLOKI to be the main memecoin in this bullrun.” 
Floki and its sister project TokenFi, a crypto and asset tokenization platform, are reportedly set to serve as official partners of the World Table Tennis Championship hosted by South Korea this month, which is expected to draw 450 million viewers.
Floki developers have also announced a project roadmap that includes the launch of a financial product that will offer customers regulated digital banking accounts funded with FLOKI tokens.
The accounts would come with debit cards and may be denominated in USD, EUR and GBP.
Says Floki,
“These accounts will be facilitated through a key partner licensed in four key jurisdictions: Canada, Spain, Dominica, Australia, and the UAE.” 
Floki also intends to offer staking services.
“We will be introducing a Floki Staking-as-a-Service program that allows other token projects to create their token staking programs directly through our platform.”
At time of writing, FLOKI is trading for $0.000236, up over 12% in the last 24 hours.

Crypto Pundit Predicts Massive Price Surge For Dogecoin - Here’s The Target


								Crypto analyst DonAlt has provided a bullish narrative for the foremost meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE). This follows his recent statement suggesting that DOGE could still move over 500% from its current price levels. 
Dogecoin Could Rise To $1
DonAlt mentioned in a video on his YouTube channel that DOGE “it isn’t too unlikely for Dogecoin to go to $1.” This raises the possibility of the meme coin breaking its all-time high (ATH) of $0.7376 on its road to $1, which no doubt presents mouth-watering gains for investors. 

The crypto analyst made this statement while revealing that Dogecoin was one of the altcoins he had his eyes on. He added that he found the meme coin “interesting” because it dipped back into support on the PTC chart. Meanwhile, DonAlt suggested that $0.1 is a good entry point for those looking to invest in DOGE and stated that he will probably buy if it drops to that level. 
The crypto analyst remarked that he would also look to Bitcoin’s price movement to determine whether or not to buy Dogecoin now. If Bitcoin confirms a bullish sentiment, he will buy the meme coin at whatever price level he finds it at since it is still a long way from hitting $1. 
Interestingly, the crypto analyst suggested that DOGE was a better investment than Bitcoin. He stated that DOGE could trade as high as $2 if Bitcoin never drops back to the $60,000 range. That is why he finds investing in the meme coin more attractive than buying the flagship crypto at $60,000 and seeing it rise to $90,000.

Shiba Inu Could Also See Significant Gains
Crypto analyst and trader Xanrox also recently predicted that DOGE’s top contender, Shiba Inu (SHIB), could witness a price surge of over 300%. This also means that SHIB, like DOGE, could hit a new ATH in this market cycle. Meanwhile, analysts like Javon Marks have also raised the possibility of SHIB deleting another zero and rising to as high as $0.0001553. 
These massive price predictions for DOGE and SHIB again underscore the battle between these crypto tokens to assert themselves as the most valuable meme coin. So far, they have made significant moves in the market since the beginning of the year. However, there is a growing feeling that SHIB could overtake DOGE at some point. 

SHIB has already seen more gains since the beginning of the year, boasting a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 160% compared to DOGE’s 80%.

Ethereum Panic? CEX Inflows Hit Multi-Month Highs


Another wave of FUD around the possible security status of Ethereum (ETH) is the key reason behind its "underperformance," data says. However, passionate holders do not seem to be ready for selling en masse.Ethereum FUD causes record-breaking ETH inflow to CEXesIn the past week, the Ethereum (ETH) supply has experienced mixed trends. As the meme coin mania loses steam, the aggregated Ethereum (ETH) fees dropped by 41%, says leading blockchain data tracker IntoTheBlock. Such calculations were revealed by IntoTheBlock in its latest On-Chain Insights newsletter.Also, Ether recorded its largest weekly net inflows into centralized exchanges since September 2022: Scared holders brought $720 million to CEXes.This week, besides the "regular" rumors about Ether's security status, some media outlets reported that Ethereum Foundation was being investigated by law enforcers.Should Ethereum (ETH) be deemed security in the U.S., the prospects of Ethereum ETF approval might be questioned.As covered by U.Today, U.S. congresspersons and Coinbase CLO slammed the SEC and its leadership for its failure to protect Ethereum (ETH) from a regulatory crackdown."ETH underperformance is real," IntoTheBlock saysIt is the FUD to blame for Ethereum's (ETH) underperformance, IntoTheBlock data says. In the shadow of the marvelous BTC rally, ETH has lagged behind Bitcoin and on a risk-adjusted basis, even behind the S&P 500.Also, the ratio of ETH/BTC is holding just above 0.05, inching closer to its lowest point since June 2022. It should be noted that BTC has already managed to exceed its 2021 high, while the Ethereum (ETH) upsurge stopped 32% short of the ATH.At the same time, long-term ETH holders are not ready to sell their coins. The amount of Ethers in wallets that have been holding for over one year continues hitting new highs despite the negative news.

What is the genesis block, explained

                            Understanding genesis block and its significance                                        The genesis block kickstarts a blockchain by establishing the network, adhering to consensus rules and linking all future blocks back to the origination point.In proof-of-work (PoW) chains, the genesis block is the first block ever mined on a blockchain network and serves as the foundation for all blocks that follow. It is typically hard-coded into the protocol and created by the creator of the blockchain. Since there are no previous blocks to reference or mine against, it doesn’t involve the traditional mining process.  In contrast, the genesis block is usually created by the network’s developers and/or validators who initiate the PoS chain. Validators might be selected based on specific criteria outlined in the protocol rather than through the staking process since there are no previous transactions or stakes to reference.The origin of the genesis block dates back to the launch of the Bitcoin network in 2009. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, generated the first block on the chain that became the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency with the highest market capitalization, even briefly surpassing the market cap of silver. This established the genesis block as an integral part of launching a functional, decentralized blockchain ledger.The core purpose of the genesis block is to initialize the blockchain by cryptographically linking to the blocks that follow it. It is the starting point that anchors the blockchain and enables trust in the immutable ledger. The genesis block sets initial parameters, such as mining difficulty and block rewards, that govern the network’s operation and incentive structure. Without the genesis block providing this foundation, the blockchain would not have a secure and reliable beginning to build upon. All cryptocurrency networks require a genesis block to start their ledger. For example, Ethereum’s genesis block contains instructions for initial Ether (ETH) allocation and core network parameters.The genesis block provides a starting point upon which the rest of the ever-growing blockchain can build. Without the genesis block, a blockchain would have no foundation to permanently record transactions through cryptographic hashes.                                                                    The genesis block in Bitcoin                                        Satoshi Nakamoto pioneered the genesis block to launch Bitcoin’s blockchain, establishing technical attributes and an issuance model still followed by cryptocurrencies today.The Bitcoin genesis block was mined on Jan. 3, 2009, and is famously known as block 0. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto as a way to launch the network and initiate the first cryptocurrency.Nakamoto designed the Bitcoin genesis block to establish the core technical elements of the protocol and set certain launch parameters. The block contains a reference to the headline “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” which was published in the London-based newspaper The Times on Jan. 3, 2009. By including this headline, Nakamoto timestamped the block and provided poetic context for Bitcoin’s mission as a decentralized alternative to the traditional financial system.The genesis block’s nonce field has a specific value of 2083236893, which was found by Satoshi Nakamoto through a mining process to satisfy the difficulty target at the time of the Bitcoin network’s launch. Although the difficulty was much lower compared to today’s standards, creating the genesis block still involved varying the nonce value until a valid block hash meeting the target was discovered. All subsequent blocks build on the hash of the genesis block, creating a chain linking each block to the originating one.One of Nakamoto’s most pivotal decisions was setting the mining reward for adding new blocks to the blockchain. The genesis block includes a coinbase transaction that grants a 50-Bitcoin (BTC) reward, establishing the Bitcoin issuance model. However, this particular reward is a special case and cannot actually be spent due to the unique way the genesis block is hardcoded into the Bitcoin software. The 50-BTC reward sets a precedent for block rewards, which halve approximately every four years until the total 21 million supply cap is reached.The hardcoded design of the Bitcoin genesis block established the core technical and monetary attributes of Bitcoin. As the first-ever block on the Bitcoin blockchain, it enabled the launch of the network’s distributed ledger, setting the stage for innovation across blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and finance.                                                                    The genesis block in other cryptocurrencies                                        While Bitcoin pioneered the genesis block, other cryptocurrencies have adapted this mechanism to launch their own blockchain networks.The Ethereum genesis block was mined in 2015 as the foundation for the Ethereum blockchain. It established the initial supply and distribution of the ETH token by allocating Ether purchased by early adopters during a pre-sale. However, the genesis block itself did not implement the network’s PoW consensus model, which was a separate part of Ethereum’s protocol design (before the Merge). Ethereum’s approach differed from Bitcoin’s in several ways, most notably in the initial token distribution method, which allowed early adopters to purchase ETH, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, before the network went live.Many cryptocurrencies closely copy Bitcoin’s genesis block format when launching. Litecoin’s 2011 genesis block mirrored Bitcoin’s, with small changes to technical parameters like the mining algorithm. Dogecoin’s genesis block in 2013 paid homage to Bitcoin’s genesis block with encoded text referencing a newspaper headline about Bitcoin’s rising value.Several differences can be seen when comparing cryptocurrency genesis blocks. Some feature timestamps in the distant past as a proof-of-work timestamp, while others timestamp the genesis block more recently. The initial mining difficulty and block reward amounts also vary across cryptocurrency genesis blocks.While the structures are similar, each genesis block is distinctive in initializing the blockchain’s distributed ledger. The blockchain industry continues to innovate on the genesis block structure with alternatives like proof-of-stake consensus models. However, the genesis block retains an important symbolic role, representing the beginnings of a transparent, decentralized financial system.                                                                    Components and structure of the genesis block                                        The genesis block sets the foundation for the blockchain by establishing the format for data and structure that all future blocks will follow.The genesis block contains foundational data that sets the stage for the remainder of the blockchain. This inaugural block is hardcoded with an index of 0 and establishes the structure that subsequent blocks will follow.The data embedded in the genesis block includes the timestamp, block hash, previous block hash, nonce and block reward address. The timestamp represents when the block was created, while the previous block hash is a series of zeros since no prior block exists. In PoW blockchains like Bitcoin, the nonce is a value that is varied to find a valid block hash meeting the network’s difficulty target. However, the significance and use of the nonce can vary across different blockchain implementations, especially those that do not use PoW consensus. The block reward address indicates where to send the block reward, although this functions differently in the genesis block compared to subsequent blocks.Notably, the concept of a block reward address is more nuanced in the genesis block, as it doesn’t function in the traditional sense seen in subsequent blocks, especially in networks like Bitcoin, where the genesis block’s reward is not spendable.Additional genesis block events may designate initial conditions or distribute tokens. For example, the Ethereum genesis block executed smart contracts that assigned the starting supply of ETH. It’s also not uncommon for genesis blocks to carry encrypted messages or references, adding a symbolic or commemorative layer to the block.The genesis block’s structure contains a block header and body. The header includes metadata like the version, timestamp, target difficulty, Merkle root hash (summarizing transactions) and nonce. The body contains all transactions in that block, which is only the reward transaction for the genesis block creator in newly launched networks.This standard structure forms the template for the chronological sequence of blocks that follow. The fixed composition of the genesis block establishes the blueprint for validating transactions, adding new blocks, achieving consensus and growing the chain. This pioneering first block boots up the blockchain’s functionality.                                                                    Events after the genesis block                                        The genesis block launches the network. Then confirmation, incentives and difficulty adjustments enable decentralized propagation, consensus and mining to grow the blockchain.Once the genesis block is established, the blockchain network can be formally launched. This milestone opens participation to the public and kickstarts the process of consensus and decentralization.After launch, the blockchain begins building on top of the genesis block. As the inaugural block, the genesis block is automatically accepted as valid by the network nodes, but it does not require confirmations in the traditional sense that transactions or later blocks do. Subsequent blocks reference the genesis block’s hash, establishing an unbroken chain linking back to the network’s origin point. With the genesis block confirmed, miners compete to add new blocks. As blocks get appended, more confirmations accumulate for preceding blocks, hardening the permanence of the blockchain. New coins are issued through block rewards, and transactions are validated.The network difficulty adjusts dynamically based on activity to maintain the cadence of block creation. More miners and higher participation increase competition and difficulty, while lower activity decreases the difficulty target. This fluctuation ensures the blockchain’s self-regulation.After the genesis block, the blockchain grows organically through decentralized propagation, consensus mechanisms and incentivized mining. The activity solidifies the genesis block as the immovable anchor point. Transactions multiply rapidly as adoption spreads.In the case of cryptocurrency blockchains, value accrues as trust in the network takes hold. Coins gain monetary value according to the market dynamics of supply and demand. Speculation, trading and real-world utility drive investment and participation.The genesis block thus graduates from its honorary position as the network activates. The launch it facilitated gives rise to a bustling ecosystem governed by participants aligned in economic interest by the blockchain’s incentive structures.

El Salvador sets the pace on what Bitcoin adoption is really like

In recent times, El Salvador has made significant headlines by doubling down on its commitment to Bitcoin. Despite market fluctuations and potential profit opportunities, the Central American nation, under the leadership of President Nayib Bukele, has shown unwavering support for the cryptocurrency. This strategic move includes not only retaining but actively increasing the country’s Bitcoin holdings. As a result, El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserves now stand at a substantial total of 5,690 BTC, valued at approximately $400 million. This bold decision reflects El Salvador’s pioneering stance in embracing cryptocurrencies and signals its long-term vision for economic development and financial independence.El Salvador turns into a BTC homeEl Salvador, through a series of calculated maneuvers that emphasize its dedication to cryptocurrencies, further solidifies its involvement in the digital currency sector, with a specific focus on bitcoin (BTC). Recently, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador declared the nation’s intention to purchase one bitcoin daily, with the goal of doing so until the price of bitcoins becomes prohibitive in fiat currencies. The results of this endeavor have increased the country’s bitcoin reserves to an impressive 5,690 BTC, which are currently valued at around $400 million.In conjunction with its cryptocurrency initiatives, El Salvador has unveiled a significant development in the international investment sphere through the abolition of income tax on money transfers and international investments. This reduction in the tax rate from 30% to 0% is intended to stimulate economic growth and attract foreign investors.The nation’s dedication to Bitcoin was further underscored this week with the transfer of over 5,000 BTC to a cold wallet. President Bukele revealed that a substantial proportion of these assets, comprising bitcoin valued at $400 million, has been transferred to an inactive device housed in a physical vault located on the territory of the nation. By implementing a “Bitcoin piggy bank” to safeguard digital assets, El Salvador has taken a substantial stride in its financial strategy, thereby enhancing security measures and demonstrating a robust belief in the long-term viability of the cryptocurrency.The choice to proceed with the transfer to a cold wallet was prompted by an unforeseen surge in El Salvador’s bitcoin reserves, which nearly doubled their previous recorded amount. El Salvador’s BTC purchasesThe nation obtained Bitcoin through a variety of channels, including daily purchases, passport sales, business currency conversions, mining, and government services. Prior to this disclosure, El Salvador’s bitcoin holdings were estimated to be less than 3,000 BTC. However, this strategy has significantly increased those amounts.El Salvador established a precedent-setting position regarding Bitcoin in September 2021, when it became the initial nation to recognize the digital currency as lawful tender. Following that, the value of Bitcoin has experienced substantial volatility, most recently attaining an all-time high of $73,800. The nation’s persistent daily bitcoin transactions and the establishment of a tax-exempt cryptocurrency sanctuary fueled by geothermal energy derived from a volcano exemplify its forward-thinking strategy in using cryptocurrencies to foster economic growth.President Bukele harbors aspirations that surpass the mere accumulation of bitcoin. Instead, he foresees El Salvador becoming a prosperous nation by means of strategic investments and initiatives pertaining to the digital currency. In spite of admonitions and disapproval from global institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), El Salvador maintains a resolute stance towards its bitcoin strategy, exhibiting no indications of discontinuing its involvement in the digital currency.El Salvador’s audacious exploration of Bitcoin and its endeavors to establish an environment favorable to cryptocurrency investments exemplify a substantial paradigm shift in how countries perceive and interact with digital currencies. With the ongoing progress of its bitcoin procurement program and the improvement of its cryptocurrency infrastructure, the nation has established a model that may influence the trajectory of international finance.

Analyst Says Ethereum in a ‘Complicated Spot,’ Names Support Level ETH Must Hold To Avoid Triggering a Breakdown - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is warning that Ethereum (ETH) could collapse in value after failing to hold a key level.
In the latest edition of the trader’s altcoin newsletter, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital warns that Ethereum could dip below $3,000 based on historical precedence.










“Ethereum is in a complicated spot. Because it has rejected from the green $3,956 resistance, similarly as in the past (red circles).”
Source: Rekt Capital/Altcoin Newsletter
The trader believes that Ethereum needs to hold the level around $3,342 or it could move down much further to the $2,700 level.
“A weekly close below the orange box [around $3,342] would likely trigger a breakdown whereas consistent holding of the orange box as support should be enough in building momentum for the next leg up.”
If ETH does dip into the $2,000s, the trader says he will still remain long-term bullish on Ethereum.
“Whatever the scenario, ETH needs to reclaim this orange boxed area as support (blue circle) to enable uptrend continuation. 
So whether ETH does that now to precede a rally to ~$4,000 or whether it needs to first drop into the ~$2,700s before doing so doesn’t make much of a difference in the long-term because macro uptrend is bullish, but offers dollar-cost-averaging opportunities in the short-term.” 
Ethereum is trading for $3,340 at time of writing, down more than 4% in the last 24 hours.

According to on-chain data analytics Spot On Chain, a group of Ethereum whales has collectively transferred a staggering 32,527 ETH to various exchanges.Three long-term ETH traders (or maybe funds) have deposited 32,527 ETH worth $109 million to CEXes in the last 24 hours. A trader named "0x213" deposited 12,500 ETH worth $41.7 million to Kraken at $3,339. The whale first received 120,900 ETH from white-hat hacker Baylina.eth in July 2017 and currently holds 12,200 ETH valued at nearly $40.9 million.Another whale, "0x50b," deposited their last 11,600 ETH worth $39.1 million to Binance at nearly $3,374. The said whale first received ETH in December 2017 and deposited all 32,600 ETH to Binance at nearly $3,312 worth $108 million. So far, they have withdrawn 80 million USDT in the past three days.The third whale, "Metalpha," deposited 8,427 ETH worth $28.2 million to Binance at $3,347. The whale first received ETH in Jul 2021 and currently holds 62,300 WSTETH worth $242 million.The timing of this transfer is particularly intriguing, as it comes after Ethereum's price topped the $4,000 mark and then dipped remarkably. The recent action of the whales has spurred speculation: "Did the whales think that the recent correction was still not enough?"Ethereum whale activity hits 2024 highsThe price of ETH has retraced about 18% since hitting highs of $4,093 on March 12.According to Santiment, Ethereum whale activity has hit its highest level in 2024 as the $3,300 price levels dip into the midterm buy zone. A combined 59,137 separate ETH whale transactions exceeding $100,000 in value were recorded between March 19 and 21.Santiment urges traders to keep an eye on the 30-day average returns of ETH wallets, which might indicate if a buy is justified. Average 30-day ETH traders are now down 7%, increasing the likelihood of a rebound. Also, its RSI has dropped to 28.5, the lowest seen for ETH since the price bottomed in late January.According to IntoTheBlock, fees on Ethereum declined by 41% this week, with meme coin speculation slowing down significantly. The amount of ETH transferred on the mainnet has also reached its highest since May 2022 this week.ETH also recorded its largest weekly net inflows into exchanges — $720 million since September 2022 — as regulatory FUD spread.

Super Sushi Samurai exploited for $4.6M right before its launch

Super Sushi Samurai, a blockchain game developed on the Blast layer-2 solution, was poised for its much-anticipated launch when it fell victim to a devastating exploit, resulting in the loss of $4.6 million. This incident occurred mere hours before the scheduled release of its gaming product, casting a shadow over the project’s debut and raising concerns about the security of decentralized applications (DApps).Super Sushi Samurai’ token tanks amid $4.6M exploitThe GameFi project Super Sushi Samurai (SSS), which is built on Coinbase’s Base layer-2 blockchain and the Telegram messaging app, experienced a $4.8 million withdrawal on March 21. This withdrawal was made by an individual who identified themselves as a white hat hacker after discovering a double-spending glitch in the system. Following an unauthorized token dump, the value of the token experienced a significant 99% slippage. The perpetrator managed to siphon off 1310 ETH from the token’s primary liquidity pool by repeatedly doubling their balance and subsequently liquidating all of it, as per the information disclosed by Certik to the cryptocurrency community.Super Sushi Samurai had planned to release its web3 game on the same day. It is possible that the incident was carried out by a hacker with good intentions who is currently in contact with the Super Sushi Samurai team. Unfortunately, the details remain unclear at this time.According to CertiK, there was an incident where a user made a series of transactions involving a large number of SSS tokens. The user initially purchased 690 million SSS tokens and then transferred the entire balance to themselves. They proceeded to double the balance 25 times, resulting in a final total of 11.5 trillion SSS tokens. These tokens were eventually sold for 1,310 ETH, which is equivalent to approximately $4,590,827.Following the incident, the individual responsible for double-spending the tokens sent a message on the blockchain, stating: “Hi team, this is a whitehat rescue hack. Let’s work on reimbursing the users. Please reach out via Blockscan chat from the SSS deployer 0x555b28f3b8b3b8ebd1b06997c2078fd94529f555 on Ethereum mainnet.”Despite their apparent good intentions, it is important to highlight that the individual in question caused the SSS token to collapse by withdrawing $4.8 million in funds. Before the crash, SSS had a market capitalization of $27.75 million. The tokens have experienced a significant decrease in value, losing over 99% of their initial worth. Shortly after, SSS developers replied: “Hello, white hat; we have reached out to you on Blockscan. Thank you for cooperating with us. SSS Team.”A disturbing trendAfter the breach, Super Sushi Samurai has been actively communicating with its community, sharing updates and providing reassurances through its official Telegram channel and other social media platforms.The Super Sushi Samurai exploit is not an isolated incident within the Blast ecosystem. Last month, the Blast-based gambling project RiskOnBlast gained attention for reportedly deceiving investors.The project mysteriously vanished after allegedly losing 420 ether, which is equivalent to $1.29 million, that was raised during a token presale. Over 750 victims experienced significant financial losses as the website and social media accounts vanished.Despite the impressive $2.3 billion in deposits generated by Blast’s mainnet launch, its journey to success has been marred by security vulnerabilities and instances of exploitation. Blast currently holds a staggering $980 million in total value locked (TVL) at the moment.Merely a month earlier, the ERC-X token Miner experienced a devastating crash of 99% due to the unearthing of a double-spending glitch, resulting in the endless creation of tokens. It’s unfortunate that the contract contains loopholes at a lower level. Transferring money to yourself can actually double your balance. The glitch resulted in significant user losses, totaling more than $10 million.

What does Worldcoin plan to achieve by making Orb software open-source?

Worldcoin has taken a significant step forward by making its Orb software open-source. This move aligns with Worldcoin’s broader mission to democratize access to the global economy. By releasing the core components of Orb software as open-source, Worldcoin aims to enhance transparency and verifiability. This initiative not only fosters community collaboration but also facilitates innovation and adoption of the Worldcoin protocol.Worldcoin takes an unexpected turnSupported by Sam Altman Worldcoin’s eye-scanning Orb has faced skepticism due to its use in creating biometrically unique accounts for over four million users. However, Worldcoin has demonstrated transparency by announcing in a blog post on Friday morning that they will be making the core software supporting the Orb open source to the public.The Orb’s shift towards open source has been a gradual process. Worldcoin had previously shared information about the device’s hardware and made its iris recognition component open source. However, they had not yet disclosed specific details about its main software to the public.This recent release of the Orb’s core functionality provides insight into the process of converting iris scans into unique verifications within the World App, developed by Tools For Humanity. Nevertheless, the main application of the Orb does have certain code omitted from the internal version. The code that was removed pertains to fraud checks, as mentioned in the blog post.The announcement states that the core components of the Orb software are available on GitHub under a dual license of MIT/Apache 2.0. The new open-source components enhance the hardware it previously released.The release contains code related to the Orb, which plays a vital role in capturing images and securely transferring them to the product’s app.Worldcoin stated that its software and iris recognition repositories represent a notable advancement in establishing transparency for Orb’s image processing, as well as providing verifiable privacy assurances.Alongside making more of the software behind the well-known metallic, eye-scanning Orb available to the public, Worldcoin also introduced a new privacy feature called “Personal Custody.”This new feature enables users to take control of their data by using a data package that is signed with a private key and encrypted with a user-provided public key before being transferred to their mobile phone.What else is accessible?The do_signup function within the orb-core repository, a crucial component of the Orb’s software, is now accessible for examination. This function explains the technical processes involved in each World ID verification method, such as image capture, biometric processing, and secure data submission.While the software is capable of producing excellent eye and face images, the company acknowledges that they have faced difficulties in integrating the autofocus system. Their software uses a feedback controller incorporating a neural network to provide accurate real-time sharpness estimates.Throughout the following biometric stage of image processing, Python interfaces are utilized to access custom neural networks and implement Gabor filters. The software first checks if the images have been altered or artificially created.Then, the Iris Recognition System (IRIS), a software developed by Tools for Humanity and later made available as open source by Worldcoin, is used to analyze the eye images.
The Rust programming language has been fine-tuned to minimize the adverse effects of frequent reloading of components like IRIS and other models. This is accomplished through a design that draws inspiration from the Android Zygote process.Worldcoin claims that the software’s implementation on the Orb ensures users’ control over their data with robust security measures. These mechanisms involve using Orb’s private key for signing and the user’s public key for encryption.The signing process is performed by a dedicated secure element within the Orb, which is cryptographically paired with the Nvidia Jetson platform during manufacturing for enhanced security. In a blog post, the company explains that the encryption process ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt the transmitted biometric data by using a sealed box.The privacy claims of the Orb’s architecture underwent an audit conducted by Trail of Bits, a reputable security research firm.Worldcoin has stated that specific parts of the orb-core and orb-secure-element include sensitive code that has been forked for public use. Their approach to minimizing the need for these forks involves a gradual transition towards open-sourcing the software components. This will allow them to develop the non-sensitive parts of the software in a transparent manner.The company emphasizes that these efforts align with their commitment to user privacy, data security, and transparent governance.

Bitcoin ETF demand could rise as prices drop, crypto analyst suggests

Amid Bitcoin’s price decline, the spot Bitcoin ETF market has been gloomy recently. Despite these persistent declining net flows, Ki Young Ju, a prominent analyst and CEO at CryptoQuant, has predicted a possible resurgence in the spot Bitcoin ETF market. In a post on X on March 22, Ki Young Ju shared that spot Bitcoin ETF netflows could rise even as the BTC price decline continues. Using data from the historical netflow trends, the analyst noted that demand for Bitcoin ETFs usually kicks in when the cryptocurrency traces to certain support levels. According to data from analytics firm BitMEX Research, these BTC ETFs have recorded a negative flow for the last four trading sessions. This situation has been marked by significant levels of Grayscale’s GBTC outflows and the record low inflows for the other ETFs, mainly the market leaders BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. Source: Ki Young JuYoung Ju noted that new BTC whales, especially ETF buyers, have an on-chain cost basis of around $56,000. This indicates that significant Bitcoin holders, particularly ETF investors, typically acquired Bitcoin at an average price of $56,000. In line with this pattern, the cryptocurrency quantitative expert anticipates significant inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETF market should BTC attain the mentioned price threshold.According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fluctuated between $62,000 to $68,000 over the past week. However, Young Ju suggests that such a decline is plausible, given that corrections typically see a maximum drop of 30%. With BTC’s recent peak at $73,750, the analyst forecasts that the asset’s price could drop as low as $51,000.Related: Bitcoin demand in Argentina reaches highest point in nearly two yearsHowever, over the past 48 hours, BTC’s price dropped 13% from its new all-time high of $73,835 to briefly trade near $60,000. The correction was caused by overheated market conditions in what analysts have christened a “pre-halving retrace” ahead of the Bitcoin halving event that is roughly 30 days away. A report by CryptoQuant shows that the Bitcoin bull cycle is not over, given the relatively low level of investment flows from new investors and price valuation metrics still below levels seen in past market tops.Meanwhile, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event is a significant driver expected to bolster BTC price, ushering in a parabolic uptrend. According to CoinMarketCap’s halving countdown, Bitcoin’s next halving event is less than 31 days away.Magazine: Bitcoin ETFs make Coinbase a ‘honeypot’ for hackers and governments: Trezor CEO

$720 Million in Ethereum (ETF) Flood Exchanges: Price Impact


On-chain activity indicates a notable reaction to regulatory uncertainties surrounding the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, Ethereum.
A significant spike was registered in the number of tokens sent to centralized crypto exchanges. This is the biggest ever recorded since September 2022, profoundly influencing the price of Ethereum.
Ethereum Sees Largest Exchange Inflow in 2 Years
Ethereum has faced considerable scrutiny recently. Critics within the cryptocurrency community cite its lackluster price performance and the rise of Solana as evidence of Ethereum’s declining influence. Furthermore, regulatory bodies are purportedly targeting the Ethereum Foundation, questioning ETH’s classification as a security.
Indeed, concerns escalated as reports emerged about the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations into entities associated with Ethereum. The resulting negative sentiment led to the transfer of over $720 million in ETH into centralized exchanges during the past week, according to IntoTheBlock. 

Notably, SpotOnchain identified three notable long-term ETH traders who deposited 32,527 ETH valued at approximately $109 million onto centralized platforms in the last 24 hours. Specifically, these traders shifted 12,500, 11,600, and 8,427 ETH to Kraken and Binance.

“Three long-term ETH traders/funds deposited 32,527 ETH ($109 million) to CEX in the past 24 hours. Did the whales think that the recent correction was still not enough?,” SpotOnChain wondered.

When funds move to exchanges, it is typically viewed as a bearish signal for the market. This indicates that a holder is prepared to sell their assets. As a result, Ethereum has witnessed a noteworthy dip in its price. 

According to BeInCrypto’s data, ETH price dropped by 10% over the past week, settling at $3,371 at the time of reporting.
Lucas Outumouro, Head of Research at IntoTheBlock, highlighted ETH’s underperformance compared to Bitcoin and even the S&P 500. However, he emphasized the enduring strength of Ethereum’s fundamentals, which continue to reassure long-term holders.

“Overall, after undergoing a major upgrade, ETH hodlers continue to be bullish. Despite recent headwinds, the data supports continued growth for Ethereum both on layer 1 and layer 2s,” Outumouro stated.

Supporting this stance, analysts at Santiment observed a transaction surge among Ethereum whales. Between March 19 and March 21, this group executed 59,137 transactions exceeding $100,000. The firm also noted a significant 7% reduction in the average 30-day ETH traders, signaling the potential for a market rebound.

The "accidental" error of the founder of the memecoin Slerf

In this article we tell the crazy story of Slerf, a sloth-themed memecoin on the Solana blockchain, and the “accidental” mistake of its founder who, right after raising funds from a pre-sale token sale of 10 million dollars, burned all the resources intended for investors.
Despite this setback, Slerf has received an extraordinary media attention managing to reach a trading volume of 2.7 billion dollars in the first days of trading of the cryptocurrency, more than what was recorded by all decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain.
Thanks to the mistake (or clever move) of its main developer, the memecoin went from an initial price of 0.02 dollars to 0.76 dollars in just one day, for an increase of 38X.
All the details below.

The incredible story of the memecoin Slerf: founder accidentally burns 10.8 million dollars of pre-sale investors
Slerf, a new memecoin based on Solana that features the image of a sloth, has caught the attention of the entire crypto world after its founder (aka developer) managed to make a multi-million dollar mistake.
It all started when, on March 18, immediately after concluding a public pre-sale of 10.8 million dollars with the new SLERF tokens that would be used as a reward for investors, the project founder announced that he had “accidentally” burned the LP tokens representing the on-chain liquidity provided and the tokens intended for pre-sale buyers.
These resources are considered lost forever because they were sent by mistake, in an attempt to clean up their wallet from all the scam tokens sent by external users, to a wallet whose developer does not know the private keys.
By doing so, in addition to sending all the investors’ money into nothingness, Slerf automatically lost 50% of its maximum supply.

A similar event in the memecoin sector occurred at the dawn of the success of Shiba Inu, when its lead developer Ryoshi sent 50% of the supply to Vitalik Buterin, with the intention of pushing up the price of the cryptocurrency (as actually happened).
Even in this case, we can imagine that the alleged “error” was previously orchestrated only to benefit from greater attention in a market frenzy fueled by enthusiasm, especially in the context of Solana, and attract potential buyers.
Success is huge right from the start: in just 24 hours of trading SLERF recorded an increase in its value of about 38X the listing price and an incredible trading volume of 2.7 billion dollars, even higher than the entire volume traded in the decentralized markets of Ethereum.
In the first 2 and a half hours of listing, buyers pushed the price of SLERF up by 6500%, going from around 0.02 dollars to almost 1.4 dollars.

The founder of the project appeared visibly upset about the mistake, and was willing to organize a space X to discuss possible resolutions to repay the investors who were left holding the bag.
His own investment in the token was lost forever, fueling the (not very credible) narrative that the incident happened in good faith.
What is actually more likely, even if not empirically confirmable, is that it is a mere marketing strategy, created specifically to push the price of the token and reevaluate another purchase outside the pre-sale, whose value would have increased by several multipliers.
In this way, on one hand the developer has lost a significant amount of money (most of which did not belong to him) but on the other hand he has made a stellar profit.
A brilliant move of insider trading.
Solana community support for the Slerf incident
The only ones who have been burned by the Slerf incident are the pre-sale buyers who, despite having spent their SOL, did not receive any amount in the aforementioned memecoin.
To remedy the disaster, the Solana community has considered several possible compensation solutions, such as the creation of a new token, but all ideas have been rejected by the founder of the cryptographic project.
Instead, it was decided to create a dedicated wallet for donations to users who were burned by the pre-sale, from which the Slerf team does not have access as it is managed by a third-party independent.

However, the real support came from the Solana ecosystem, and more generally from the entire crypto world, in the days following the listing of the memecoin when several exchanges that had listed the token on their markets decided to donate the proceeds from the fees to the defrauded users.
Among these, the exchanges HTX (formerly Huobi Global), Bitget, and BingX stand out: it is still not clear how refunds will be made, but the CEOs of the platforms have revealed that new guidelines will be disclosed in the coming weeks.
Even Justin Sun, the famous billionaire owner of HTX and Tron, participated in the charity event to help cover the losses of investors.

Finally, another form of contribution has arrived in the same way in which the same cryptocurrency was conceived, namely in the form of memes!
Several users on X have shown their support to the users who were scammed, tweeting messages of support and attaching funny memes.
Even Leonidas, a prominent figure in the Ordinals field, joked about the incident by echoing the words of the Slerf developer (quote: Guys, i fucked up) immediately after sending an NFT “Runestone” to Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet, commemorating the launch of the digital asset.
This market never ceases to amaze us.

Floki Inu unveils 2024 roadmap with digital banking focus

The Floki Inu development team has recently announced its strategic roadmap for 2024. The roadmap outlines a series of ambitious initiatives aimed at increasing the utility and adoption of the FLOKI token. Among the key highlights is the introduction of regulated digital banking accounts. These accounts will allow users to establish and fund bank accounts directly with FLOKI tokens. This move represents a significant step towards bridging the gap between cryptocurrency and traditional banking services.Collaborating with an undisclosed licensed fintech company, Floki Inu aims to offer banking services across several strategic locations. These include Canada, Spain, Dominica, Australia, and the UAE. The digital banking accounts will support SWIFT payments and SEPA IBANs. This initiative is poised to enhance the usability of the FLOKI tokens. It will provide users with a seamless method to engage with traditional financial systems.FLOKI token enhances utility with debit cardIn addition to the digital banking solution, the roadmap also details plans for integration with the Venus decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. The inclusion of FLOKI in the Venus Core Pool aims to improve liquidity. It also intends to enable token holders to use FLOKI as collateral for borrowing assets such as DAI, USDC, BNB, and ETH. This integration facilitates access to DeFi services. It underscores Floki Inu’s commitment to enriching its ecosystem within the decentralized finance space.The roadmap further introduces the upcoming launch of the Floki debit card. This card will link users’ digital banking accounts to a physical payment method. It is designed to allow transactions in conventional currencies such as the euro and the U.S. dollar. By leveraging the FLOKI tokens for everyday transactions, the development team aims to extend the practicality of cryptocurrency. They also seek to promote its wider acceptance in the mainstream economy.Floki Inu to launch cross-chain trading botAs part of its comprehensive strategy, Floki Inu is set to embark on several other notable projects. These projects aim to reinforce the token’s market position and utility. The launch of a cross-chain trading bot on platforms like Telegram and Discord is among these initiatives. This bot, powered by FLOKI tokens, will enable users to trade cryptocurrencies across major blockchain networks. Importantly, it adopts a deflationary approach by utilizing half of the generated fees to purchase and burn FLOKI tokens.The much-anticipated Valhalla mainnet launch is also featured in the roadmap. Valhalla, Floki Inu’s flagship metaverse game, promises an immersive on-chain gaming experience. It will include PlayToEarn systems, customizable NFTs, and an extensive open-world environment. This venture is expected to cement further Floki Inu’s standing within the blockchain gaming and NFT sectors.The roadmap’s unveiling comes amid increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies. The Hong Kong, Securities and Futures Commission, has issued warnings regarding unauthorized staking programs associated with the Floki Inu ecosystem. Despite these challenges, Floki Inu’s development team remains focused on advancing their roadmap objectives. They are dedicated to enhancing the token’s utility and fostering broader adoption within and beyond the crypto community.

Buy signal for 2 strong cryptocurrencies in April


The overall mid-term sentiment remains bullish for the cryptocurrency market, despite the short-term bearish pivot, following a market retracement. In this context, a buy signal might surge for cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and technical indicators.
A massive liquidation event wiped over $230 million of crypto’s total market cap in one day this week. Thus, short-term cryptocurrency trading suddenly saw a dominating fear taking over while cryptocurrencies tested support levels.
In the meantime, some projects accumulated smaller losses than others, maintaining a strong position and holding their previous gains.


Particularly, Finbold recurred to CoinGlass’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) weekly heatmap and CoinMarketCap’s ranking for potential buy signals to April.
Strong buy signal for Uniswap (UNI)
First, Uniswap (UNI) holds a strong weekly RSI of 67.35, significantly above the market’s average of 59.05. UNI lost 4.79% of its exchange rate in the past seven days, now trading at $11.84. This drove its daily RSI to neutral, registering 49.22 points in this time frame, which could act as support.
Crypto market weekly RSI heatmap: UNI. Source: CoinGlass
Uniswap is the leading decentralized exchange natively built on Ethereum (ETH) but supports multiple EVM chains. An increased demand for its ecosystem could potentially fuel the token’s performance. For example, BlackRock’s recently announced endeavor to create a tokenization fund with a seed investment of $100 million.
Interestingly, UNI jumped in its market cap ranking with over $7 billion, joining the top 20 most valuable cryptocurrencies.
UNI and NEAR are the top 18 and top 19 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap
Near Protocol (NEAR) shows strength 
Meanwhile, Near Protocol (NEAR) also climbed CoinMarketCap’s ranks, currently at the 19th position with a $7 billion capitalization.
NEAR is one of the strongest cryptocurrencies in the weekly RSI, with 68.91 index points. Remarkably, this strong position was kept even with 19% losses in the week, trading at $6.67 by press time.

The Near Protocol is a competing layer-1 blockchain for Web3 and DeFi, focused on scalability and a friendly development environment.
However, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets and buy signals could find invalidation if circumstances change, despite the strong indicators. Investors must remain cautious and understand the underlying fundamentals of the projects they are investing in.

SEC Extends Decision Deadline for Grayscale Ether Futures ETF by 60 Days - Coin Edition


							

The SEC has delayed its decision regarding Grayscale’s ETH Futures ETF.



Initially set for March, the decision deadline has been pushed back to May 30.



The SEC’s decision comes as no surprise to prominent market watchers.




In a recent filing, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced yet another delay in its decision regarding Grayscale’s Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) application. Initially filed on September 19, 2023, the proposed rule change sought to list and trade the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust ETF shares.



Despite previous extensions and proceedings initiated by the commission, the SEC has extended the review period by 60 days. Initially set for March 31, 2024, the decision deadline has been pushed back to May 30, 2024.









The SEC cited the need for ample time to carefully consider the proposed rule changes and their various issues before reaching a final verdict. The statement read:




The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.




Meanwhile, the SEC’s decision comes as no surprise to prominent market watchers, such as James Seyffart, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst.







Ultimately, the move from the SEC underscores the regulatory body’s cautious approach towards cryptocurrency-related financial products. This cautious approach echoes the SEC’s actions last year when it deferred its decision on Bitcoin spot ETFs until finally granting approval earlier this year.



Following the approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs in January, the SEC delayed its decision on the spot Ethereum ETF applications from Grayscale and BlackRock. Subsequently, in February, the SEC postponed its decision on a joint spot Ethereum ETF application from investment firms Invesco and Galaxy Digital. 



While the SEC’s decision to delay its ruling on Grayscale’s Ethereum futures ETF might disappoint some crypto enthusiasts, others view the delay as a positive development. They argue that this extension could pave the way for greater adoption of Bitcoin ETFs.

JPMorgan debunks notion of Bitcoin ETFs impacting gold ETFs | Cryptopolitan

Rumors have been swirling, guys. They say Bitcoin, the so-called “digital gold,” is elbowing its way into the gold ETFs’ lunch, gobbling up investments as it grows. But hold your horses! Recent digs by JPMorgan have thrown cold water on this fiery claim, suggesting that the rise of Bitcoin ETFs isn’t really causing investors to ditch gold ETFs in droves. The Great Investment Shift: Myth or Reality?Here’s the scoop. As the world first dipped its toes into Bitcoin ETFs in the US, these digital darlings raked in a hefty $10.6 billion globally up to March 14, even with some investors pulling out their stakes from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the big kahuna of Bitcoin funds. Meanwhile, gold ETFs saw a drain of $7.7 billion, despite the shiny metal hitting a record price of $2,200 per ounce. This set tongues wagging, with speculation that investors were swapping their gold bars for digital bytes in their portfolio mix.However, this is where JPMorgan steps in with a “Not so fast, cowboy!” Their analysis tells a different tale. It turns out the gold ETF bleed started way back in April 2022, well before Bitcoin ETFs became the new kids on the block, and this trend hasn’t picked up speed with the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs.Diving deeper, it’s clear the story isn’t just about ETF flows. The World Gold Council’s data reveals a whopping $229 billion poured into gold bars and coins by private investors from September 2020 to December 2023. Plus, central banks have been on a gold buying spree, adding $155 billion to their reserves, pointing to a strong appetite for gold outside of ETFs.Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a JPMorgan strategist, sheds light on this. He argues that the move away from gold ETFs towards bars and coins doesn’t signify a loss of interest in gold but rather a shift in how people prefer to hold their assets. Since the pandemic hit, folks have been valuing privacy and tangibility more, making the traceable and registered nature of ETFs less appealing compared to the good old hold-in-your-hand gold bars and coins.But what about central banks, you ask? Their gold craze isn’t about joining the Bitcoin bandwagon. It’s more about diversifying reserves with assets that are less likely to be affected by Western sanctions or dependent on Western custody arrangements.Bitcoin’s Place in the Investment WorldNow, let’s not get it twisted. Bitcoin ETFs have indeed seen a solid inflow of cash, but this doesn’t mean there’s a mass exodus from gold to Bitcoin. Direct sales of Bitcoin on exchanges have seen a $6 billion drop, indicating that the buzz around Bitcoin ETFs might be more about investors shifting their existing crypto holdings for a taste of that regulatory protection and convenience ETFs offer, rather than a flood of new money into the crypto space.The whole gold versus Bitcoin ETF saga also overlooks another player in the game – the momentum traders. These folks have been snapping up futures contracts linked to both gold and Bitcoin, adding another layer of complexity to the investment flows and market dynamics.Experts from the World Gold Council, Morningstar, and various investment management firms chime in with a collective nod. They acknowledge that while there might be a sprinkle of investors hopping from gold to Bitcoin, the broader investment landscape shows gold is far from losing its shine. Central banks and traditional gold buyers in emerging markets are sticking to their guns, and the narrative that Bitcoin ETFs are draining life out of gold investments doesn’t quite hold up.To cap it off, the future remains a big question mark. Yes, Bitcoin, with its digital allure, might continue to draw in the young and tech-savvy investors, potentially nudging some away from gold ETFs. But as things stand, the gold market is vast and varied, and ETFs are just one piece of the puzzle. The love for gold is alive and kicking, just taking on different forms beyond the ETF sphere.So, there you have it.

BlackRock Reconsiders Ether ETFs Amid Client Preference for BTC - DailyCoin


        BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is reevaluating its application for a spot Ethereum ETF, according to comments made by Robert Mitchnick, the firm’s head of digital assets, at the recent Bitcoin Investor Day conference. This shift comes despite the successful launch of their Bitcoin ETF in January 2024.BlackRock Prioritizes BitcoinMitchnick highlighted a significant client preference for Bitcoin compared to Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. This focus on Bitcoin could lead BlackRock to prioritize Bitcoin offerings within their digital asset strategy. The firm has yet to make a final decision on the Ethereum ETF, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponing their review until May 2024.BlackRock’s commitment to the digital asset space remains strong, however. This is evidenced by the recent appointment of Matt Kunk as their Digital Assets Product Strategist. Kunk will lead the company’s efforts on iShares digital assets ETFs, showcasing their continued interest in the sector.Regulatory concerns surrounding Ethereum are also a factor in BlackRock’s hesitation. Discussions are ongoing regarding Ethereum’s classification by the SEC. If categorized as a security, similar to XRP, the approval process for an Ethereum ETF would become significantly more complex.Industry Stands Behind EthereumDespite these challenges, the industry remains largely supportive of Ethereum. Leading players like Coinbase advocate against differing classifications between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This unified stance underscores the industry’s belief in Ethereum’s value irrespective of regulatory hurdles.BlackRock potentially shifting from an Ethereum ETF wouldn’t lessen the asset’s significance in the digital ecosystem. Their exploration extends beyond the ETF, evidenced by the recent launch of the BUIDL stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain, showcasing their broader commitment to digital asset innovation.These initiatives demonstrate their ongoing interest in understanding and leveraging blockchain technology, independent of individual ETF applications.BlackRock’s cautious approach to the Ethereum ETF reflects the complex landscape of digital assets, influenced by both regulations and client demand.On the Flipside
While BlackRock prioritizes Bitcoin due to client preference, there could be a silent demand for Ethereum ETFs that isn’t reflected in their current client base.



BlackRock’s focus on Bitcoin ETFs could cause them to miss out on the potential growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.



Despite BlackRock’s hesitation, the industry’s unified support for Ethereum suggests its long-term potential, regardless of BlackRock’s ETF decision.
Why This MattersAs the market matures, BlackRock and other institutions will likely adapt their strategies to align with evolving regulations and client preferences. However, their continued exploration of blockchain technology and digital assets beyond Ethereum indicates a long-term commitment to the sector, promising ongoing innovation and investment.While the SEC investigates Ethereum, on-chain data suggests long-term holders remain confident. Learn more about the data here:Ethereum Long-Term Holders Unfazed by SEC Probe, Data ShowsThe SEC is considering classifying Ethereum as a security. This reignites the debate on Ethereum’s status and its potential impact on the crypto market.

Claude Opus AI predicts SHIB price for the end of 2024


While the broader cryptocurrency market has witnessed short-term volatility, meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) has notably stood out by mainly trading in the green zone for the short term.
Particularly, the meme coin has largely mirrored the performance of the overall crypto market. Investors are keenly observing how far SHIB will rally, especially considering the community’s efforts to enhance its utility. 
Indeed, the Shiba Inu community has increasingly emphasized initiatives such as token burning to bolster its competitiveness against other established cryptocurrencies.


To gather insights into how SHIB will likely perform in the coming months, Finbold consulted  Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus AI platform, a notable competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
SHIB price predictions 
In this case, the tool offered three possible scenarios for SHIB by the end of 2024. 
In the most plausible scenario, SHIB could maintain its current momentum, potentially trading within the range of $0.000050 to $0.000080.
However, this projection cautiously incorporates the possibility of market corrections and stabilization, which are commonplace in the volatile cryptocurrency domain.
In an optimistic scenario fueled by bullish market sentiment, heightened adoption, or significant news catalysts, the AI platform noted that SHIB could surge to a maximum potential of $0.000120. Achieving this pinnacle would necessitate sustained growth and influential factors instilling investor confidence.

“Shiba Inu has demonstrated strong growth potential, as evident from its recent 200% increase in the last 30 days. This suggests that there is significant investor interest and market momentum behind the cryptocurrency,” the tool said. 

Additionally, Claude AI also factored in a bearish outlook for SHIB noting that the token could be impacted by market downturns, intensified competition, or adverse regulatory developments. In such a scenario, SHIB’s price might retreat to a minimum of $0.000020.
SHIB network activity 
In the meantime, SHIB continues to record increased network activity, especially around the burning rate for excess tokens. Notably, data retrieved from Shibburn on March 23, over the last 24 hours the burn rate has surged over 300%.

Additionally, Lucie, the marketing lead of SHIB, remarked that while Bitcoin (BTC) and the entire cryptocurrency market are currently undergoing a phase of price reversal, she holds the belief that SHIB stands out as the sole coin capable of surprising the market.
Lucie anticipates the meme coin to surge to a new all-time high either preceding the upcoming Bitcoin halving event or shortly thereafter.
At the same time, Lucie highlighted that the market should anticipate something intriguing concerning the layer 2 scaling solution Shinarium, as well as the meme coins Bone (BONE) and Damn (DAMN).
Damn, a recently launched crypto by the Woofswap DEX, operates atop the layer-2 solution Shibarium. It incorporates an inherent system for burning Bone, the gas token of Shibarium. This burning mechanism is poised to significantly diminish Bone’s supply over time, rendering it a deflationary token.
Shiba Inu price analysis
In the short term, SHIB has gained almost 1.5% to trade at  $0.0000277 by press time. Over the past seven days, the coin has also been on a positive trajectory with an almost 2% surge in its value. 
SHIB seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold
In summary, given that SHIB is still striving to solidify its market utility, the meme coin remains heavily susceptible to the fluctuations of the general market.

BakerySwap Finalizes Refunds for PUMP Presale: A Comprehensive Update | Cryptopolitan

In a recent development that has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community, BakerySwap, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX), has completed the process of issuing refunds to participants of the PUMP presale. This move relieves holders of BNB, BAKE, and CAKE tokens who had previously engaged in the presale, ensuring that their investments are returned in full. The announcement also highlighted an important note regarding BNB refunds, which have been processed in the form of wBNB, albeit with a straightforward option for conversion back to BNB at a one-to-one ratio. Furthermore, IQ50, another entity involved in the presale, is set to begin its refund process within the next 48 hours, marking the next step in resolving the presale’s aftermath.BakerySwap ensuring a smooth refund processBakerySwap’s decision to refund presale participants underscores the platform’s commitment to maintaining trust and transparency within its user base. By ensuring that all valid BNB, BAKE, and CAKE holders receive their refunds promptly, BakerySwap has taken a significant step towards reinforcing its reputation as a reliable and user-centric DEX. The conversion of BNB to wBNB (wrapped BNB) is a technical necessity, given the operational mechanics of the blockchain and smart contracts. However, the platform has assured users that converting wBNB back to BNB is a straightforward process, maintaining a 1:1 conversion ratio to ensure no value is lost during the refund process.The announcement also sheds light on the role of IQ50 in the presale and its subsequent responsibility in the refund process. IQ50’s commitment to initiating refunds within the next 48 hours is a crucial part of the broader effort to ensure that all participants are made whole following the presale’s resolution. This coordinated approach between BakerySwap and IQ50 demonstrates a collaborative effort within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to address and rectify issues swiftly, maintaining the integrity of the investment process for all parties involved.The successful completion of refunds for the PUMP presale by BakerySwap, followed by IQ50’s impending refund process, serves as a significant event within the cryptocurrency community. It highlights the importance of accountability and responsiveness by platforms and entities involved in the dynamic and often unpredictable crypto market. For investors and participants, this development reinforces the need for diligence and the importance of engaging with platforms that prioritize user security and trust.Moreover, the event underscores the evolving nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where mechanisms such as presales and token distributions are continually being refined to enhance fairness, transparency, and security for investors. As the market matures, the expectation for swift and equitable resolutions to issues, such as those demonstrated by BakerySwap and IQ50, will likely become the standard, shaping the future conduct of platforms and projects within the space.As BakerySwap and IQ50 move forward from the PUMP presale refunds, the cryptocurrency community will be watching closely to see how these platforms and others learn from this experience. The ability to effectively manage and resolve such challenges is crucial for the long-term sustainability and growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. For participants, the incident serves as a reminder of the inherent risks and the importance of engaging with reputable and responsive platforms.ConclusionBakerySwap’s completion of the PUMP presale refunds marks a positive outcome for all parties involved, demonstrating the platform’s dedication to its users’ interests. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, such instances of accountability and transparency will play a pivotal role in shaping the trust and reliability of DeFi platforms and the broader crypto ecosystem.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler Says Crypto Industry Needs ‘Disinfectant’ - Here's Why


								In a passionate address to Columbia Law School, Gary Gensler, the Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), delivered a scathing critique of crypto industry participants who evade registration requirements.
Promoting Transparency in Cryptocurrency
Gensler’s speech focused on the need for transparency and mandatory disclosure in the cryptocurrency markets, drawing on the famous quote by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis that “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.”

Gensler expressed his concern about certain participants in the crypto securities markets who seek to avoid registration requirements, thereby evading mandatory disclosure. He stressed the importance of transparency in the industry and highlighted the potential benefits of applying stricter regulatory oversight.
By shining a light on the practices and operations of market participants, Gensler aimed to promote a more accountable and trustworthy crypto ecosystem.

“There are participants in crypto securities markets that seek to avoid these registration requirements. No registration means no mandatory disclosure. Many would agree that the crypto markets could use a little disinfectant,” he said.

The SEC Chair’s remarks come at a time when the commission is actively pursuing enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including Kraken, Binance, Ripple, and Coinbase. These actions underscore the SEC’s commitment to ensuring compliance within the industry.
However, Gensler’s focus on transparency goes beyond enforcement, as he believes that the entire crypto market can benefit from increased disclosure and regulatory compliance.

Gensler’s Regulatory Vision
Advocacy groups and crypto companies have long called for clear regulatory guidelines to foster innovation within the United States. While Gensler acknowledged the importance of innovation, he emphasized that it should not come at the expense of transparency and investor protection.
By advocating for mandatory disclosure and registration requirements, Gensler seeks to strike a balance between fostering innovation and maintaining market integrity.
Gensler’s call for transparency aligns with his previous warnings that cryptocurrency exchanges must register with the SEC and adhere to the same rules as traditional financial companies. He has consistently emphasized the need for accountability and regulation in the crypto space, aiming to ensure that investors are adequately informed and protected.

In addition to his focus on transparency, Gensler also addressed the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. He likened Bitcoin to a roller coaster ride, cautioning investors about the volatility of the asset. While acknowledging the market’s enthusiasm, he stressed the importance of evaluating the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies to make informed investment decisions.
As Gensler’s “disinfectant” tirade reverberates throughout the cryptocurrency industry, stakeholders are left contemplating the future of regulation and transparency.
The SEC’s ongoing enforcement actions and his steadfast commitment to mandatory disclosure signal a shift toward greater scrutiny and accountability in the market.
The impact of Gensler’s speech and the SEC’s actions will likely be felt across the industry. Market participants may face increased pressure to comply with registration requirements and provide transparent disclosures. This could potentially lead to a more robust and trustworthy crypto ecosystem, attracting both institutional and retail investors.

Cryptocurrency Analysis Company Founder Reveals the Cost Level of New Whales in Bitcoin and the Most Probable Maximum Price to Drop - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptoquant founder and analyst Ki Young Ju suggested that demand for Bitcoin ETFs may increase even as the Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to fall. In a post, Ju used historical net flow trends to support his prediction.
According to Ju, demand for Bitcoin ETFs generally increases when the BTC price reaches certain support levels. However, the analyst noted that net flows of Bitcoin spot ETFs are currently slowing.


“Demand may recover if BTC price approaches critical support levels,” Ju said. He also announced that the on-chain cost basis for new whales, primarily ETF buyers, is $56,000.

In bull markets, corrections usually involve a maximum drawdown of around 30%, and in this case the maximum loss point is at $51,000. Ju noted that new whales purchased Bitcoin mostly through spot ETFs at an average price of $56,400. In comparison, the average purchase price of ancient whales is $21,300 thousand.





At the time of writing, BTC price is trading at $65.0300 and has gained 2.37% in the last 24 hours.

Analyst warns of bearish bias as Bitcoin faces hurdles

In the realm of cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin‘s journey to reclaim its all-time high above $73,000 has encountered significant hurdles, with the asset currently trading below the $70,000 mark. The anticipation surrounding the upcoming halving event has added to the uncertainty, prompting some market analysts to issue bearish price predictions. Notably, cryptocurrency trading expert Alan Santana has cautioned investors to brace themselves for a potential sell-off, citing Bitcoin’s persistent bearish bias.Bitcoin’s bearish forecast insights from trading expert Alan SantanaAlan Santana, in a recent TradingView post, highlighted Bitcoin’s struggle to breach the $65,000 resistance level, indicating a continuation of its downward trajectory. Santana emphasized the importance of monitoring Bitcoin’s movements vis-à-vis the exponential moving average 21 (EMA21) daily, which has consistently signaled a bearish sentiment in the market. He projected a short-term target of around $59,000, with further potential downside to levels between $51,000 and $53,000.Examining Bitcoin’s short-term trendlines, Santana observed a prevailing negative sentiment among traders, with the cryptocurrency confined within a bearish territory. He outlined key levels to watch for potential shifts in momentum, noting that Bitcoin would need to surpass and close above $68,500 to signal bullish potential. A preliminary indication of positive momentum would be a move above $66,666. However, any trading below $65,000 would likely reinforce the bearish bias in the market.Volatility and market influencesRecent days have seen heightened volatility in Bitcoin’s price, with the cryptocurrency briefly dipping close to $60,000. Analysts attribute this correction to various factors, including overheated market conditions and the approaching Bitcoin halving event, scheduled in approximately 30 days. Additionally, outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have contributed to the volatility, with consecutive days of withdrawals indicating investor caution. Analysts point to several key factors contributing to Bitcoin’s recent price correction. One significant factor is the overheated nature of the cryptocurrency market, where rapid price increases have led to concerns about a potential bubble. As investors grow increasingly cautious, selling pressure has intensified, leading to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.Bitcoin’s price currently stands at a crucial juncture as it grapples with the challenge of reclaiming the $65,000 mark. The market remains on edge as investors await signals of a potential reversal or further downtrend in the coming days or weeks. Bitcoin’s volatility and market influences are key factors shaping its price fluctuations in the current environment. As the cryptocurrency market navigates through these uncertainties, investors are advised to exercise caution and remain vigilant in response to evolving market dynamics.Bitcoin’s uncertain outlook amid bearish bias and volatilityThe uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin’s price outlook persists amidst prevailing bearish sentiment and heightened volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Analysts, including prominent figures like Alan Santana, have raised alarms regarding the possibility of a potential sell-off. These warnings underscore the importance of closely monitoring key resistance and support levels in the short term to gauge Bitcoin’s trajectory.Bitcoin’s price outlook remains uncertain amidst a prevailing bearish bias and heightened volatility. Analysts like Alan Santana have issued warnings of a potential sell-off, emphasizing key resistance and support levels to watch in the short term. As Bitcoin navigates through these challenging market conditions, investors remain vigilant, monitoring for signals of a shift in momentum or further downside potential. The cryptocurrency’s ability to reclaim key levels, particularly $65,000, will likely dictate its trajectory in the near term.

March Sees Nearly $1 Billion In Ethereum Netflow To Centralized Exchanges - What’s Happening?


                            The price of Ethereum has not exactly lived up to its promise as the month has gone on, despite a stellar start to the month. While this bearish pressure has been widespread in the general cryptocurrency market, regulation uncertainty has been an additional concern for ETH, igniting a negative sentiment around the “king of altcoins.”
Interestingly, the latest on-chain revelation shows a substantial amount of Ethereum has made its way to exchanges so far in March, suggesting that investors might be losing confidence in the long-term promise of the cryptocurrency.
Are Investors Losing Confidence In Ethereum?
According to data from CryptoQuant, more than $913 million has been recorded in net ETH transfers to centralized exchanges so far in March. This on-chain information was revealed via a quicktake post on the data analytics platform.
This net fund movement represents the largest volume of Ethereum transferred to centralized exchanges in a single month since June 2022. Even though March is still a week from being over, this exchange inflow appears to be a complete deviation from the pattern observed over the past few months.

Chart showing total monthly netflow of ETH on centralized exchanges | Sources: CryptoQuant

As shown in the chart above, October 2023 was the last time cryptocurrency exchanges witnessed a positive net flow. It is worth noting that there was significant movement of Ethereum tokens out of the centralized platforms in subsequent months up until this month.
Meanwhile, a separate data point that supports the massive exodus of ETH to centralized exchanges has come to light. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed on X nearly 420,000 Ethereum tokens (equivalent to $1.47 billion) have been transferred to cryptocurrency exchanges in the past three weeks.
The flow of large amounts of cryptocurrency to centralized exchanges is often considered a bearish sign, as it can be an indication that investors may be willing to sell their assets. Ultimately, this can put downward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price.
Substantial fund movements to trading platforms could also represent a shift in investor sentiment. It could be a sign that investors are losing faith in a particular asset (ETH, in this case).
Moreover, the recent regulatory headwind surrounding Ethereum specifically accentuates this hypothesis.  According to the latest report, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a probe to classify the ETH token as a security.
ETH Price
As of this writing, the Ethereum token is valued at $3,343, reflecting a 4% price decline over the past /4 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is down by 11% in the past week.

Sam Bankman-Fried Getting Ready For Prison Sentence? Government Received Greenlight To Sell Assets


								As Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former chief executive officer (CEO) of defunct crypto exchange FTX readies for his prison sentence, prosecutors have formally requested the court to authorize the sale of two jets linked to the former crypto billionaire. With the defendant and his legal team already in agreement, the final step hinges on  the court’s approval. 

Prosecutors Push For Sale Of Luxury Jets
In a March 22 filing with the United States District Court for the Southern District, US, prosecutors in the government’s case against Bankman-Fried have proposed a court order to sell two multi-million dollar jets connected to FTX and its founder. 
As stated by Atty. Damian Williams in a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan, the government is seeking to conduct an interlocutory sale of two luxury jets, a Bombardier Global 5000 BD-700-1A11 and an Embraer Legacy EMB-135BJ.
According to the filing, the sale of the two private aircraft has been sought to prevent their devaluation, as these assets were previously slated for forfeiture in October 2023 due to their connection to Bankman-Fried’s criminal case.  
Currently, the government has not disclosed the precise selling price for the private aircrafts. However, they have appraised the jets at $15.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively. 
Furthermore, Williams has revealed that the court order was made in agreement with multiple parties including FTX’s former executive, Ryan Salame, the defendant, the founder of Trans-Island Airways, Paul Aranha, FTX debtors, the government, Capital Peak Aviation and Island Air Capital (IAC). 
The attorney disclosed that the Embraer Legacy aircraft will be transported to a Florida airport by the IAC, with the delivery expected within 30 days of the court order. 
As for the Global 5000 aircraft, the filing has revealed that it remains under secure custody, controlled by the United States Marshals Service (USMS). The USMS will manage the jet’s sale proceedings, which will be held in escrow within the enforcement agency’s Seized Asset Deposit Fund (SADF) until further order of the court.

Sam Bankman-Fried Sentence Date Fast Approaching
Sam Bankman-Fried, who was found guilty in November 2023 on all seven counts of fraud by a jury in New York, will potentially face a staggering amount of years in prison for his alleged crimes. The former FTX CEO’s sentence date is fast approaching, scheduled for Thursday, March 28.

Prosecutors in the case are seeking a prison sentence of 40 to 50 years, potentially leading the 32-year-old former crypto billionaire to be incarcerated until the age of 70 to 80 years. Conversely, attorneys representing the FTX founder propose a sentence of approximately five to six years.

Cathie Wood lauds Bitcoin’s use cases in emerging markets 1

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood’s recent discussion about Bitcoin sheds light on its multifaceted role, particularly in emerging markets. During a fireside chat at the Friday Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York, Wood referred to Bitcoin as a “financial super highway,” emphasizing its significant use cases in such regions.Cathie Wood lauds Bitcoin’s use casesArk Invest, where Cathie Wood holds a prominent position, recently entered the market as one of the issuers of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) known as ARKB. This move underscores Ark Invest’s strategic focus on emerging markets and the broader global macroeconomic environment, which has recently been impacted by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to increase interest rates.Wood’s observations about Bitcoin’s relevance in emerging markets were particularly highlighted by the example of Nigeria. The country has emerged as one of the largest adopters of Bitcoin due to the considerable depreciation of its national currency. This scenario illustrates Bitcoin’s dual nature as both a risk-off and a risk-on asset, showcasing its adaptability and appeal across various market conditions.The success of Ark’s spot bitcoin ETF, ARKB, since its inception, has been notable within the landscape of newly introduced bitcoin ETFs. Wood’s comments at the conference also touched upon the growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space, which mathematically suggests a potential for Bitcoin’s price to exceed $3.5 million. While she refrained from providing a specific new price target during the chat, Wood did reference her earlier prediction of a $1.5 million price target for Bitcoin.Institutional interest and price predictionsLooking ahead, Wood expressed a positive outlook regarding Bitcoin’s future trajectory. She emphasized that despite its current value, Bitcoin still possesses significant untapped potential for further growth. This sentiment aligns with the evolving narrative around Bitcoin as a pivotal asset class with substantial utility and investment allure, particularly in the context of emerging markets and shifting global economic dynamics.Wood’s insights underscore the expanding role of Bitcoin as a financial tool that transcends traditional boundaries, enabling seamless transactions and investments on a global scale. The cryptocurrency’s ability to navigate diverse market conditions and its growing acceptance among institutional players further solidify its status as a transformative force within the financial ecosystem.Cathie Wood’s discussion about Bitcoin at the Friday Bitcoin Investor Day conference provides valuable insights into its evolving role in emerging markets and its potential for continued price appreciation.

SEC Delays Decision on Ether ETFs, Casting Doubt on Approval Odds Amidst Growing Skepticism



                    
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to postpone its verdict on the introduction of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) proposed by Hashdex and ARK 21Shares. 



The delay, announced on March 19, occurred shortly before the SEC’s third and final deadline for these applications, setting the stage for a conclusive decision in late May. 




The SEC has scheduled May 24 for its final determination on ARK 21Shares’ application and May 30 for Hashdex’s, marking a critical period for the future of Ether ETFs.



This postponement reflects growing skepticism among analysts about the approval prospects for the eight Ether ETF proposals currently on the table from major firms including BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton. 



Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart expressed a shift in optimism on March 19, citing a notable decrease in engagement between the SEC and the ETF issuers, leading him to anticipate likely denials of the applications by May 23. 




Similarly, analyst Eric Balchunas adjusted the approval probability for Ether ETFs downward to 35%, highlighting a contrast in the SEC’s approach compared to the spot Bitcoin ETF applications, which experienced more open communication.

The public’s confidence in the approval of Ether ETFs by the end of May has also waned, as indicated by Polymarket odds which have fallen to 32% from January’s more hopeful 77%. 



Polymarket, a decentralized betting platform, has seen around $2.2 million wagered on the outcome of these ETF decisions.



In a related development, Grayscale is exploring the addition of staking capabilities to its Ether ETF application. 



Through a consent solicitation statement to Grayscale Ethereum Trust investors, the firm proposed enabling the trust to engage in proof-of-stake validation protocols, potentially providing consideration for the benefit of shareholders. 



This move aims to counteract inflationary pressures from Ethereum’s proof-of-stake protocol and keep pace with competing products offering staking. 



The proposals, requiring approval from over 50% of shareholders, could position Grayscale alongside ARK 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity, who have recently incorporated Ether staking into their ETF offerings.

Coinbase Wants to Launch Futures Contracts These Crypto Assets on April Fools' Day


																The derivatives arm of the largest American cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, intends to launch futures trading contracts for Dogecoin DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) by April 1, 2024.
According to several letters filed with the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) earlier this month, Coinbase Derivatives will launch monthly cash-settled and margin futures contracts for the cryptocurrencies on or after the coming April Fools’ Day.
Futures Trading For DOGE, LTC, And BCH
Per Coinbase’s letters, the firm will list the futures contracts using the self-certification approach under CFTC Regulation 40.2(a). This route allows entities to launch new products without direct CFTC approval; however, they must ensure the offerings adhere to the Commission’s Commodity Exchange Act and rules.
Coinbase Derivatives outlined the contracts’ description, sizes, and structures in the letters, revealing that the settlement methods would leverage a benchmark rate by MarketVector.
The latest development is considered a notable feat for Dogecoin, which began as a joke but has evolved into one of the top-ranking memecoins, rolling in the major leagues with large-cap altcoins.




“Despite its origins as a meme, Dogecoin has achieved substantial market capitalization, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market value at various points in time. Dogecoin’s enduring popularity and the active community support suggest that it has transcended its origins as a meme to become a staple of the cryptocurrency world,” Coinbase stated in one of the letters.
Commodities vs. Securities Futures
Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart called Coinbase’s move interesting. He wondered if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would object to the products being classified as commodities futures instead of securities futures.
Seyffart explained that since Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash are based off of Bitcoin, which the SEC has classified as a commodity, claiming the new contracts are securities would be difficult, especially after the agency’s spot BTC exchange-traded funds approvals. He added that the nature of DOGE, LTC, and BCH may be why Coinbase chose them.
“Honestly, if the SEC would just engage with the industry on making some rules about this stuff, we wouldn’t have moves like this. But at the same time — my job would be way less interesting,” Seyffart added.

Starbucks to End NFT Rewards Program, Paving Way for Future Digital Initiatives



                    
Starbucks has announced the discontinuation of its NFT rewards initiative, the “Odyssey Beta program,” slated to end on March 31. 



This unique program engaged customers with coffee-themed games and challenges, rewarding them with digital collectible stamps as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 




These NFTs offered exclusive benefits and interactive experiences. 



With the closure, the marketplace for trading these digital stamps and the company’s community discord server will also be discontinued. 



Nevertheless, the Odyssey marketplace will pivot to the Nifty marketplace, allowing the ongoing trade and transfer of Odyssey stamps.




This termination aligns with Starbucks’ broader strategic shifts, although specific reasons for the program’s end were not disclosed. 



The company hinted at preparing for future developments in their statement, indicating a strategic realignment. 



READ MORE: Prosecutors Reveal Sam Bankman-Fried’s Plan to Rehabilitate Image Post-FTX Collapse



Launched amidst a tumultuous period for the cryptocurrency sector in September 2022, the Odyssey program was a foray into the NFT world during a time marked by significant downturns in the crypto industry, including the collapses within the Terra-Luna ecosystem and the challenges faced by Celsius and FTX. 



Starbucks chose the Polygon network for its lower energy consumption, showcasing a preference for sustainability in its digital endeavors.



The decision by Starbucks reflects a growing trend among corporations to step back from NFT ventures. Notable examples include GameStop’s withdrawal from its NFT marketplace and Meta’s (formerly Facebook) cessation of NFT features on its platforms. 



More recently, X (formerly Twitter) eliminated the option for premium users to showcase NFT images as profile pictures.



As the NFT market continues to evolve, industry leaders offer optimistic forecasts for its potential in 2024. Vineet Budki, CEO of Cypher Capital, predicts a shift towards NFTs serving practical, real-world applications. 



Similarly, Oh Thongsrinoon of Altava Group envisions NFTs breaking out from their current digital confines into tangible sectors like precious metals and real estate. 



Amidst these developments, the NFT market has shown signs of revival, with a significant uptick in trading volume and record-breaking sales on the Bitcoin network, highlighting a renewed interest and the dynamic nature of this digital asset class.

Why is the U.S. monitoring Russia's crypto activities closely? | Cryptopolitan

Keeping tabs on the world’s digital financial shenanigans, the U.S. has cranked up its vigilance, especially when it comes to Russia’s crypto antics. This isn’t about having a casual peek over the fence; it’s about zeroing in on a sophisticated digital battlefield where currencies like Bitcoin and Tether become the weapons of choice for under-the-radar influence operations.Picture this: two Russians and their tech savvy crews, supposedly under the Kremlin’s directive, have been caught red-handed, orchestrating what the Treasury calls a “malign influence campaign.” This isn’t your average hack job but a full-blown attempt to sway opinions and muddy waters, all with the help of some cleverly disguised websites and the digital cash to keep the lights on. A Closer Look at the Digital DisguiseDiving deeper, the plot thickens with over 60 websites popping up like mushrooms after rain, all staged and ready to play their part in this digital theater of war. These aren’t just any websites; they’re wolves in sheep’s clothing, mimicking legitimate news outlets to spread tailored narratives. And just when you thought it couldn’t get any more James Bond, fake social media accounts enter stage left, amplifying these concocted stories to reach the masses. The cherry on top? Tether wallet addresses linked to these operations, now frozen thanks to the swift action of Tether itself, after the U.S. slapped sanctions on them. This move by the U.S. isn’t just a slap on the wrist; it’s a clear message: we’re watching, and we’re not playing games.But why the intense scrutiny? With an election looming on the horizon, the U.S. isn’t taking any chances. Past ghosts of election interference are still haunting, and the thought of crypto being used as a tool for such activities has the U.S. on high alert. The strategy is clear: expose, deter, and prevent Russia’s well-documented penchant for playing fast and loose with the truth on the international stage. Yet, as much as sanctions are the go-to move, the cunning to circumvent them remains a game of cat and mouse, with Russia having a playbook ready for such scenarios.The Endless Game of Digital Whack-a-MoleThe challenge of keeping up with Russia’s crypto maneuvers is likened to a never-ending game of whack-a-mole by those in the legal trenches. Despite sanctions and public denouncements, the flow of digital currency through networks previously flagged by the U.S. showcases not just resilience but a blatant disregard for international norms. This isn’t just about financial transactions; it’s about the broader implications for national security and the integrity of democratic processes worldwide.The efficacy of sanctions as a deterrent is under scrutiny, with some arguing that while they serve as a temporary roadblock, they fall short of addressing the underlying issues. The conversation among policymakers seems stuck in a loop, with sanctions being the reflexive answer to a problem that’s evolving far faster than the solutions proposed. The real question being whispered in the corridors of power is whether these efforts are truly making a dent in Russia’s digital armor or merely scratching the surface.As the U.S. doubles down on its efforts to safeguard its democratic institutions from foreign influence, the saga of crypto-fueled disinformation campaigns unfolds with each passing day.

'Dirt Cheap L2s?': EIP-4844 Common Misconception Debunked by Bitcoiner


With Ethereum's Cancun-Deneb upgrade successfully activated, EIP-4844 introduced blobs, improved data logistics and managed to reduce fees on L2s. However, its effects should not be overestimated, Eric Wall says.EIP-4844 will not solve throughput and fees issues completely, Eric Wall saysThe narrative of "dirt cheap" transactional fees on Ethereum (ETH) L2s post Dencun activation is a misconception. Despite the major advancement, the design of sequencers still allows for fees spikes in some situations, as explained by cryptocurrency tech veteran Eric Wall. Even given the maximum capacity of blobspace, L2 rollups after Dencun would only scale to 100-1,000 transactions per second (TPS).At the same time, even if a single rollup consumes all the blobspace and is running at maximum theoretical capacity, that does not necessarily mean that the fees will always be low, Wall says.To illustrate his point of view, he recalled some potential "stress-tests" for Ethereum-based networks and L1/L2 sequencers, including extreme buying pressure:Sequencers still have to sequence with limited throughput => fees Fees statistics from the first days with EIP-4844 activated confirmed such estimations as significant fees spikes were observed on OP Stack-based chains.Here are cheapest Ethereum L2s right nowAfter months of preparation, Ethereum (ETH) Dencun upgrade kicked off on the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet on March 13, paving the path for optimized data usage for EVM L2s.As demonstrated by L2Fees tracker, on all dominant L2s — Optimism, Arbitrum, Starknet and zkSync Era — prices of transfer and cross-asset swaps dropped below $0.01 in equivalent.At the same time, for some networks, including the likes of Loopring, zkSync Lite and Boba Network, fees remained almost untouched by Dencun-triggered changes.

Funding Wrap: Investor focus shifts to layer-2s - Blockworks


Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade, the network’s most consequential since the 2022 Merge, went off without a hitch last week, reducing gas fees on many layer-2s to a couple of cents. 
A week later, Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem has become a focus of funding announcements.
The layer-2 infrastructure startup Espresso announced $28 million in Series B funding led by a16z crypto on Thursday. Various layer-2-related firms participated, including Polygon, StarkWare, and Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs.
Read more: Espresso lands $28M to become marketplace for shared sequencing
Espresso is largely known for building a shared sequencer for layer-2s, where rollups can order and process transactions via a shared marketplace, rather than in their own execution environments. This could theoretically make layer-2s more interoperable, though the program is still in testnet. 
“At its core, crypto is a technology movement that builds tools for better human cooperation at a larger scale—especially when the cooperating parties mutually distrust one another. Espresso and Ethereum are the perfect embodiment of that ideal,” a16z general partner Ali Yahya wrote in a blog post. 
The funding follows on $32 million Espresso raised led by Greylock Partners and Electric Capital in 2022.

Two layer-2s also announced noteworthy raises. 
Morph raised $20 million in seed funding led by Dragonfly. Co-founded by Cecilia Hsueh, formerly of derivatives exchange Phemex, and Azeem Khan, previously at Gitcoin, Morph brands itself as a consumer-centric blockchain. Pantera, Foresight Ventures, and The Spartan Group were among other investors in the layer-2, which is also still in testnet. 
The developer behind privacy-focused layer-2 TEN, short for the encrypted network, raised $9 million led by R3, The Block reported. 
Derivatives exchanges
As crypto prices rise, derivatives exchanges where traders can speculate on future crypto asset prices are becoming more popular. 
Rails came out of stealth with $6.2 million in seed funding this week for a self-custody-focused perpetuals exchange. The round saw participation from Slow Ventures, Round13 Capital, CMCC Global, and Quantstamp. Two of the project’s three co-founders previously held leadership positions at the LGBTQ dating app Grindr. 
Institution-focused derivatives infrastructure startup Kemet also announced $5 million in funding led by Further Ventures. 
Further said it felt Kemet is offering the “first true institutional single-access point into the digital asset derivative ecosystem” in a blog post announcing its investment. 
Other notable fundraises

Zero-knowledge infrastructure developer Succinct announced a $55 million Series A led by Paradigm.  
Limited partners at a16z will be able to invest in the VC’s crypto seed and venture verticals through a new general fund Andreessen is raising called Multiplexer, The Information reported.

Marathon Digital's Bold Strategy in the Fierce Bitcoin Mining Industry | Cryptoglobe


                                
On March 22, Fred Thiel, the CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA), joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell Overtime’ to discuss with co-anchor Morgan Brennan the nuances of Bitcoin’s recent performance, including its volatility, and delve into the evolving dynamics of Bitcoin mining and its energy requirements.



Fred Thiel began by addressing Bitcoin’s dramatic recent rally, which saw it hit an all-time high of nearly $74,000. 







Thiel attributed this surge to a combination of factors, including pent-up demand for US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs and a rotation out of miners into these funds. According to Thiel, these ETFs are yet to fully unleash their market potential, as they haven’t started significant marketing efforts to wealth advisors. This, Thiel suggests, indicates a forthcoming wave of investment into Bitcoin that could further drive its value. He also noted the role of economic uncertainties in bolstering Bitcoin’s appeal, emphasizing that the liquidity constraints introduced by substantial ETF holdings have contributed to Bitcoin’s volatility.



Discussing the anticipated Bitcoin halving (expected around 20 April 2024), Thiel offered insights into its potential effects on Marathon Digital and the mining sector at large. He forecasted that post-halving, smaller miners might face financial strain due to a lack of accessible credit and capital, unlike larger entities such as Marathon Digital. Thiel detailed Marathon’s strategy to capitalize on this environment through targeted acquisitions, bolstered by the company’s strong financial position, demonstrating a proactive approach to industry consolidation.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Thiel extensively discussed the power consumption dynamics of Bitcoin mining, especially in the context of competition with AI companies for energy resources. He highlighted Marathon Digital’s strategic advantage in utilizing stranded energy sources, such as solar and wind, which don’t have direct grid connections. Thiel pointed out the flexibility of Marathon’s operations to act as grid load balancers, contrasting with the constant energy demand from AI operations. This capability allows Marathon to contribute positively to grid management, particularly during peak demand periods, according to Thiel.



Under Thiel’s leadership, Marathon Digital is not just navigating the competitive landscape domestically but is also eyeing international expansion to leverage global opportunities. Thiel shared that Marathon is actively pursuing growth across three continents, emphasizing the company’s commitment to sustainable and strategic scaling in the face of burgeoning demand from both the Bitcoin mining and AI industries.



On Friday, the Marathon Digital share price closed at $20.87 (down 4.18% on the day). In the year-to-date period, MARA is down 8.98%.

World’s Largest Asset Manager BlackRock Sees ‘Little’ Demand For Ethereum From Clients ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The world’s largest asset manager with about $10 trillion of assets under management, Blackrock, is not seeing much demand for the industry’s second-largest crypto by market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH).



BlackRock Prioritizing Bitcoin; Ether, Others Take Backseat



BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, revealed that customers of the Wall Street giant have only “a little bit” of interest in ether compared to Bitcoin (BTC).



“I can say that for our client base, bitcoin is overwhelmingly the number one focus and a little bit Ethereum,” said Mitchnick during a fireside chat at the Friday Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York.



At the same time, there is “very, very little” demand for other crypto assets, suggesting that BlackRock is not even exploring other altcoins. 



When asked if BlackRock will soon be introducing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on one of the hottest Solana meme coins at the moment, dogwifhat (WIF), Mitchnick claimed he didn’t know what it was, indicating that there’s a misconception in the cryptosphere that the Larry Fink-led firm will launch a slew of other services.

&nbsp



BlackRock filed paperwork for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in June 2023, and it was approved in January. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has captured some of the largest volumes in the entire ETF market.



Mitchnick postulated that the main reason BlackRock, which was previously skeptical of Bitcoin, decided to introduce a spot BTC ETF was that its clients were consistently voicing their interest in the flagship crypto during both bull and bear markets.



The investment giant is now looking to tokenize financial assets on the Ethereum blockchain. As ZyCrypto reported, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund will be dubbed “BUIDL.” It will allow eligible investors to earn steady U.S. dollar yields by subscribing to the fund via Securitize Markets.



In November, BlackRock also applied to create an ether spot-based exchange-traded fund. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission deferred making a decision on this application earlier this month.

Ripple lawyers challenge SEC chair on crypto stance

In a recent surge of critiques from the cryptocurrency community, prominent pro-XRP lawyers have voiced strong opposition against SEC Chair Gary Gensler. They accuse him of failing in leadership and unfairly targeting the crypto industry. The criticism follows Gensler’s remarks on the necessity of public disclosures by crypto firms, which many saw as an attempt to over-regulate the sector. Notably, MetaLawMan and Bill Morgan, both influential figures within the crypto legal sphere, have been at the forefront of this backlash, highlighting a perceived bias in Gensler’s regulatory stance.MetaLawMan referenced Judge Shelby’s critique of the SEC in the Debt Box case, pointing out alleged misconduct and bad faith within the organization. This case has become a focal point for those accusing the SEC of overreaching in its regulatory efforts. Meanwhile, Bill Morgan expressed his disdain for Gensler’s anti-crypto rhetoric, suggesting that the community no longer values his opinions. Both lawyers emphasize what they see as Gensler’s failure to balance regulation with support for the innovative potential of cryptocurrencies.Ripple battles SEC over crypto regulationsThe backlash against Gensler is not occurring in isolation but amidst a broader context of regulatory actions by the SEC against major crypto entities like Ripple, Coinbase, and potentially Ethereum. These efforts underscore the SEC’s intent to bring the crypto industry under its regulatory umbrella, focusing on issues of registration and public disclosure for investor protection. However, the aggressive stance has led to accusations of stifling innovation and bias against the crypto sector, exacerbating tensions between regulatory bodies and crypto advocates.The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC has drawn particular attention, highlighting the complexities of applying traditional securities laws to cryptocurrencies. Critics argue that the SEC’s approach is not only heavy-handed but also lacks clarity and consistency, creating uncertainty for investors and innovators alike.The debate over crypto regulation and transparencyGary Gensler’s comments on the importance of registration and transparency in the crypto market have ignited a fierce debate about the future of cryptocurrency regulation. While Gensler argues that these measures are crucial for investor protection, opponents see them as unnecessary barriers to growth and innovation in the sector. This division reflects broader questions about how to regulate digital assets without curbing their potential for economic transformation.As the SEC continues to pursue enforcement actions, the crypto community watches closely and is concerned about the implications for the industry’s future. The criticism from pro-XRP lawyers like MetaLawMan and Bill Morgan underscores the growing tension between regulatory authorities and the crypto industry. This sector prides itself on decentralization and innovation.This ongoing conflict highlights the challenges of adapting existing regulatory frameworks to new technological realities. As the debate over transparency, investor protection, and innovation continues, the crypto industry remains at a crossroads, seeking a path forward that accommodates both regulatory concerns and the sector’s unique dynamics.

The Shiba Inu community is celebrating a significant achievement as Shibarium, the Layer-2 scaling solution for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has reached a new integration milestone. The platform has successfully processed over 412 million transactions, a testament to its growing adoption and functionality.BlueBit, a Dubai and Saint Vincent-based centralized exchange, has announced an exciting collaboration with the SHIB community, a partnership that it believes will bring the SHIB and Sparrows communities closer and lead to even greater achievements together. As part of this move, BlueBit has successfully integrated Shibarium, which would provide BlueBit users with access to a broader array of digital assets and cutting-edge blockchain solutions.The integration of Shibarium with major cryptocurrency exchanges is also expected to play a pivotal role in increasing its visibility and usability, attracting a broader audience of users and investors.The latest integration of Shibarium has sparked a wave of excitement in the wider crypto community. The Shiba Inu official X handle has responded with enthusiasm to this milestone, which reflects the platform's potential for future growth.Shibarium's astounding growthShibarium has quickly gained traction since its late August 2023 launch, surpassing 3.8 million in total blocks and a whopping 412 million in total transactions.According to the Shibariumscan explorer, the total transactions for Shibarium are 412,407,305. Total blocks have reached 3,825,223 and wallet addresses are at 1,383,613.

Fourth Largest Crypto Exchange’s Founder Under Investigation


Online reports suggest that Mingxing Xu, commonly referred to as Star Xu, the founder of OKX, is reportedly under investigation in the United States.
Xu swiftly refuted these allegations, expressing his frustrations with the ongoing FUD across social media.
Is OKX Founder Facing Legal Troubles in the US?
Rumors began swirling in the Chinese crypto community when Alvin, a prominent figure, fielded inquiries about Xu’s supposed arrest in the US. Alvin promptly debunked the rumors, suggesting the news was a potential ploy to manipulate OKX’s native token, OKB.

“Many people asked me today if it is true that there are rumors that Xu Xingxing was arrested by the Americans. I think it is most likely a rumor. They want to force OKB to be raped,” a translated version of his post reads.

OKB’s price had seen wild volatility during the past week, dropping to as low as $54 before rebounding to its current value of $57 as of press time, according to BeInCrypto data.

Meanwhile, OKX’s partnership lead, Gala Wen, echoed Alvin’s sentiments, dismissing the claims as false. Wen emphasized Xu’s active role in the company’s US operations, rebuffing any notion of his involvement in legal trouble.

“It’s so fake. The arrests in the United States are public information and anyone can check it on the government website. The American office is very big, and the boss personally comes to handle business. We work hard every day in high spirits,” Wen said.

Notably, this is not Xu’s first brush with controversy. In 2020, he faced scrutiny in China, coinciding with his exchange’s temporary suspension of crypto withdrawals, sparking market concerns.

Interestingly, the current rumors arrive at a time when OKX faces increased regulatory scrutiny across various jurisdictions. Last month, South Korean authorities initiated a criminal probe into OKX’s operations within the country. The authorities accused the exchange of undisclosed activities and employing domestic influencers for promotional campaigns. Additionally, OKX ceased operations in India due to the country’s unfavorable regulatory environment. 
While OKX continues to navigate these global challenges, the US regulatory environment remains hostile toward the emerging industry. Regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have pursued legal action against major exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, prompting some firms to exit the US market.

United Nations discusses the involvement of North Korea in crypto heists 1

A recent report issued by a United Nations panel of experts has shed light on the substantial role of cyber crypto heists in providing foreign currency income for North Korea. According to the United Nations findings, these illicit activities have accounted for a significant portion, estimated at 50%, of the country’s foreign currency earnings since 2017.United Nations releases detailed report on North Korean hack operationsThe United Nations report delves into the extensive involvement of North Korean actors in 58 cryptocurrency heists spanning from 2017 to the present. These nefarious activities have reportedly generated over $3 billion, which has been channeled to fund various national programs, including the development of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).This revelation underscores the critical link between cybercrime and the proliferation of threats posed by North Korea’s weapons programs. In particular, the panel of experts highlighted their investigation into 17 crypto crime events in 2023 alone, where the perpetrators, believed to be North Korean entities, managed to steal more than $750 million.This staggering amount reflects the scale and sophistication of these cyber operations, posing significant challenges to financial security and regulatory frameworks. The report outlines the diverse techniques employed by North Korean hackers to orchestrate these heists and gain control over substantial amounts of cryptocurrency funds.The methods employed by the hackers include social engineering infiltration, third-party attacks targeting vulnerable platforms, utilization of cryptocurrency mixers to obfuscate transactions, attacks on crypto bridges facilitating transfers between different digital assets, and money laundering schemes involving various brokers. The involvement of North Korea in cryptocurrency-related illicit activities has also drawn attention from other security-focused entities.Techniques and recommendations for combating crypto hacksTRM Labs, a prominent cybersecurity firm, has independently assessed North Korea’s crypto crime earnings for 2023, estimating them to be at least $600 million. The firm further highlighted the conversion of these illicit funds into tangible assets through mechanisms like Tron-based UDST and engagement with high-volume brokers, indicative of a sophisticated money laundering ecosystem.In response to these growing threats, the report puts forth crucial security recommendations aimed at mitigating the risks associated with cyber crypto heists orchestrated by North Korean actors. These recommendations include the adoption of robust security measures such as two-factor authentication processes, the use of cold offline wallet storage to safeguard digital assets, and continuous network monitoring to detect and thwart potential attacks.Moreover, the panel advocates for the implementation of targeted sanctions against specific groups suspected to be involved in high-profile cyber attacks linked to North Korea. These groups, identified as Lazarus, Andariel, Bluenoroff, Scarcruft, and Kimsuky, are believed to have orchestrated sophisticated cyber operations targeting financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, and other vulnerable entities.Overall, the United Nations report underscores the urgent need for heightened vigilance and collaborative efforts among international stakeholders to combat the growing menace of cyber crypto heists orchestrated by state-sponsored actors like North Korea. By implementing proactive security measures and targeted sanctions, the global community can bolster resilience against these evolving cyber threats and safeguard the integrity of the financial ecosystem.

The Floki (FLOKI) development team has released its ambitious roadmap for 2024, signaling a strategic shift away from memes and towards utility-driven initiatives. The team shared its roadmap details in a recent post on its Medium blog and official X account.

Valhalla will offer on-chain gaming features, a PlayToEarn model, customizable NFTs, and an expansive virtual world for users to explore and engage with. 



Furthermore, Floki Inu aims to enhance token liquidity by listing FLOKI on the Venus Core Pool. This will enable token holders to leverage their assets to borrow various cryptocurrencies. 



Ultimately, these proposed initiatives underscore Floki Inu’s commitment to fostering financial inclusion and expanding the utility of FLOKI tokens.

Robert Kiyosaki blasts BTC skeptic Peter Schiff for knowing ‘a lot about a little’


Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling personal finance book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has criticized American economist and Bitcoin (BTC) skeptic Peter Schiff over his alleged focus on specific areas of finance.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on March 22, Kiyosaki called out Schiff for his purported limited understanding of financial principles, accusing him of residing in Puerto Rico along with other “money experts” due to their expertise being confined.
In his view, Schiff and other experts reside in the region for lacking understanding in areas like debt and real estate. However, he acknowledged that Schiff possessed knowledge limited to gold and silver.


He suggested that, if Schiff understood how to leverage debt to invest in real estate effectively, he wouldn’t need to reside in Puerto Rico for tax advantages. 

“Because they [Schiff and money experts]  know a lot about a little, but do not know about everything.<…> Nothing wrong with Puerto Rico but I do not want to have to live there with the other money experts. Learn about debt, real estate and taxes and live anywhere in the world and pay zero in taxes,” he said. 

Schiff’s bank tax woes 
The author’s sentiments arise in the aftermath of Schiff’s Euro Pacific Bank coming under scrutiny in a global tax evasion investigation. Some of the account holders are under a probe for alleged tax evasion and money laundering. In 2022, the bank was closed by Puerto Rican authorities due to compliance-related issues.
Meanwhile, the economist maintains that Bitcoin is likely to collapse while dismissing related products such as the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). Recently, Schiff, highlighted the liquidity aspect related to owning a Bitcoin ETF, noting that it is limited to US market hours 
As per a Finbold report, Schiff believes that Bitcoin is likely to face a ‘catastrophic crash’ due to ETFs.

“The more Bitcoin that moves into ETFs, the more vulnerable Bitcoin becomes to a catastrophic crash. That’s because ETF buyers are more likely traders than true believers,” he warned. 

Kiyosaki’s grim economic outlook 
At the same time, Kiyosaki maintained his cautionary outlook for the economy. The financial educator warned of impending economic turbulence. 
However, he also offered a glimmer of optimism, asserting that turbulent times present opportunities for wealth accumulation, particularly for those who understand how to navigate financial markets effectively.
It’s worth noting that Kiyosaki maintains that the traditional financial system is set for collapse while projecting, on several occasions, that the stock market is bound to crash. 
Consequently, the investor has advocated that investors can cushion themselves by venturing into assets such as Bitcoin, gold, and silver. As reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki pointed out that silver remains a notable bargain with the potential to rally.

How Much Money Did Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Lose in the Recent Downturn in the Market? Which Altcoins Are in His Portfolio? - Bitcoin Sistemi


About 10 days ago, the Ethereum price exceeded $4,000, reaching a level not reached since the great bull rally of 2021.
However, ETH has fallen sharply from this local top and is trading at $3,415 at the time of writing.


Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin was one of the names most affected by this decline. Buterin, who was worth $965 million before the decline, lost over $100 million with the downturn and at the time of this writing, he has $839 million.

Almost all of Vitalik Buterin's assets are, unsurprisingly, in ETH. Buterin, one of the legends of the cryptocurrency world, has ETH worth $ 836 million. Then come KNC, SDOG, DINU and THE, which he probably didn't buy but sent to Buterin to attract attention from crypto projects:






KNC: 717 thousand dollars
SDOG: 528 thousand dollars
DINU: 180 thousand dollars
THE: 134 thousand dollars

Buterin, who previously held a large amount of SHIB, donated all of it to an institution fighting COVID-19 in India and attracted the reaction of the memecoin world.

Bitcoin faces GBTC outflows, but predictions signal potential price rebound

The Bitcoin market has recently encountered challenges as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced significant outflows, leading to investor concerns. However, predictions suggest a potential turnaround in BTC price action following next week.GBTC outflows prompt concernsIn recent days, the GBTC has witnessed substantial outflows, with March 22 alone seeing a loss of $170 million. This trend has been compounded by United States Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experiencing a decline in inflows and record highs in GBTC outflows, resulting in five consecutive days of net reductions in assets under management.The timing of these outflows coincides with reports indicating that bankrupt crypto lender Genesis may have been selling its GBTC position, contributing to the downward pressure on ETF trends.Despite the challenges, there are indications that the worst of the sell-off may be over. Investor and entrepreneur Alistair Milne highlighted a significant slowdown in GBTC selling, suggesting a potential shift in momentum.Statistician Willy Woo presented a new model comparing ETF inflows with BTC price action, hinting that the most intense offloading phase might end. While Woo did not disclose specific data for the metric, he expressed optimism that the consolidation phase could lead to a more stable market leading up to the halving event.Optimistic outlook for BTC price actionPseudonymous commentator WhalePanda echoed the sentiment of a potential rebound in BTC price, anticipating a sideways weekend followed by consolidation before a path toward new all-time highs. With many investors shaken out and waiting for lower prices, there is anticipation for a return to price discovery.Despite the challenges posed by GBTC outflows, Bitcoin’s overall sentiment remains positive. The spot Bitcoin products have proven to be the most successful ETF launch in history, with cumulative flows reaching $12.15 billion since their inception. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, one of the ETF providers, emphasized that the bulk of institutional exposure to Bitcoin is yet to come.However, not all commentators share the same optimism regarding GBTC. Crypto author and educator Vijay Boyapati criticized GBTC, suggesting that the ecosystem would be healthier without it. Boyapati attributed GBTC as the product central to the 2022 market collapse and identified its net outflows as a significant headwind to Bitcoin’s current trajectory.While Bitcoin has faced challenges due to GBTC outflows and declining ETF inflows, there are signs of a potential turnaround in price action. Investors remain cautiously optimistic, with predictions indicating a period of consolidation before a possible return to new all-time highs. Despite criticism surrounding GBTC, the overall sentiment towards Bitcoin remains positive, with expectations of increased institutional exposure.

Cops Crack $4.3B Bitcoin Laundering Case After 5-Year Chase - DailyCoin


        
A former restaurant worker has been caught laundering Billions in Bitcoin through luxury goods.



A complex five-year investigation has involved digital forensics and international cooperation.



Authorities have struggled to keep pace with criminals exploiting loopholes in cryptocurrency regulations.
A London resident has been found guilty of entering into a money laundering arrangement involving Billions of dollars in Bitcoin. Jian Wen, whose previous job involved working at a takeout restaurant, was caught with a digital fortune currently valued at over $4.3 Billion.Ex-Takeaway Worker Busted Laundering Billions in BitcoinWen’s scheme involved converting her massive Bitcoin holdings into physical assets like luxury jewelry and real estate. To avoid suspicion, she reportedly posed as an employee of a jewelry company while attempting to purchase expensive properties in London. However, these efforts failed to pass through money laundering checks. Jason Prins, a spokesperson for the department, highlighted their commitment to such complex cases stating, “This verdict and lengthy five-year investigation demonstrates that we’ll leave no stone unturned in our pursuit to catch criminals who look to enjoy the proceeds of illicit funds – no matter how complex the case,”Wen’s claims of acquiring the funds through Bitcoin mining activities were also unsuccessful. Despite these setbacks, Wen managed to purchase tens of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry in Switzerland and properties in Dubai in 2019. The investigation leading to her arrest spanned five years and involved extensive efforts by London Metropolitan Police. UK Case Highlights AML ChallengesThe investigation involved searches of multiple locations, examination of nearly 50 electronic devices, and translation of documents from Mandarin Chinese. A freezing order granted by the High Court allows authorities to further investigate the Bitcoin holdings with potential forfeiture on the table.This case underscores the growing use of cryptocurrency in criminal activity. According to Andrew Penhale, chief crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), criminals increasingly favor cryptocurrencies for money laundering.“Cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used by organized criminals to disguise and transfer assets, allowing fraudsters to enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct,” Penhale said.Wen awaits sentencing scheduled for May 10th, 2024. The case serves as a stark reminder of the challenges law enforcement faces in tackling financial crimes facilitated by cryptocurrency.On the Flipside
The five-year investigation underlines the complexities of tracing and prosecuting cryptocurrency-related crimes.



The report doesn’t detail whether the original fraud involved Bitcoin or if it was converted into Bitcoin later.
Why This MattersThis conviction highlights the evolving tactics criminals use to launder money through cryptocurrency. Not only does it showcase the growing sophistication of law enforcement needed to combat this, but it also raises concerns about potential loopholes in the global regulatory framework for digital assets.The UK is mulling allowing crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for certain investors.  Read more here:UK Mulls Crypto Exchange Traded Notes for Select InvestorsNew regulations in the UK give law enforcement the power to freeze cryptocurrencies.

As the world’s first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has experienced tremendous growth and volatility since its inception in 2009.
As Bitcoin’s price reaches new heights, with the current price at $65,000 and a recent all-time high of $73,777 on Binance, Crypto-Twitter is abuzz with excitement. But why are so many eager to see the rising price of Bitcoin?
The simple answer is the potential for significant profits. Much like the early days of the Internet, risk-takers who recognize the opportunity in Bitcoin stand to benefit greatly as it continues to grow and gain mainstream adoption.
However, the appeal of Bitcoin goes beyond mere financial gain. Proponents view it as a store of value, a means of escaping government oversight, and the payment system of the future. As millennials ponder how many Bitcoins they should own, the answer depends on their individual goals.
21 Million Club
The Bitcoin Clubs Reddit has designated the “21 Million Club” for those who own 1 BTC or more, a reference to the finite supply of 21 million Bitcoins. An even more exclusive group is the “1 Million Club,” requiring ownership of 21 BTCs, as there will only ever be 1 million people capable of holding that amount.
While these clubs have clear membership criteria, a more strategic approach involves accumulating Bitcoin wealth relative to global wealth, with the goal of achieving financial independence in the face of growing global and U.S. debt.
Calculating Your Bitcoin Wealth
A more realistic scenario might see Bitcoin reaching gold’s current market cap of $14.54 trillion.
With this assumption, the amount in BTC to insure $1 million wealth would come up to 1.4447884 BTC.
B-WIT = (1 million/14.548 trillion) x 21 million
B-WIT = 1.4447884 BTC
Let’s examine a few popular Bitcoin price predictions made by market analysts and calculate the number of Bitcoins you would need to own in each scenario to reach millionaire status.
Bitcoin Price Prediction by analysts
Scenario 1: Tim Draper’s Prediction – $250,000 by 2023
Venture capitalist and Bitcoin investor Tim Draper has made a bold prediction that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by 2023. If this prediction were to come true, you would need to own 4 Bitcoins to have a net worth of one million dollars. The calculation is simple: 1,000,000 / 250,000 = 4.
Scenario 2: Winklevoss Twins’ Prediction – $500,000
In the Long Term Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, famous for their early involvement in Facebook and their substantial Bitcoin investments, believe that Bitcoin could reach $500,000 in the long term. If this prediction were to materialize, you would need to own just 2 Bitcoins to become a millionaire. The calculation is as follows: 1,000,000 / 500,000 = 2.
Scenario 3: Cathie Wood’s Prediction – $1,000,000 by 2030
Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach $1,000,000 by 2030. If this ambitious prediction were to come true, you would only need to own 1 Bitcoin to achieve millionaire status. The calculation is straightforward: 1,000,000 / 1,000,000 = 1.
Scenario 4: PlanB’s Stock-to-Flow Model – $288,000 by 2024
PlanB, a pseudonymous Dutch institutional investor, created the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, which predicts Bitcoin’s price based on its scarcity. According to the S2F model, Bitcoin could reach $288,000 by 2024. In this scenario, you would need to own approximately 3.47 Bitcoins to become a millionaire. The calculation is as follows: 1,000,000 / 288,000 = 3.47.
It’s important to note that these predictions are highly speculative and should be treated with caution. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and numerous factors can influence the price of Bitcoin, such as regulatory changes, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment.
Moreover, investing in cryptocurrencies comes with inherent risks. While the potential rewards may be significant, the market’s unpredictability can also lead to substantial losses. As with any investment, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research, assess your risk tolerance, and invest responsibly.
Conclusion:
Based on the popular Bitcoin price predictions analyzed in this article, the number of Bitcoins you would need to become a millionaire ranges from 1 to 4, depending on the scenario.
However, it’s essential to approach these predictions with caution and make informed decisions based on your financial situation and risk tolerance. As the world continues to watch the evolution of cryptocurrencies, only time will tell whether Bitcoin will indeed become the path to millionaire status for many.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Six Financial Giants Pay $70,000,000 Settlement Over Allegations of 'Widespread Fraud and Collusion' - The Daily Hodl


								Eight financial giants are shelling out tens of millions of dollars to settle a decade-long whistleblower lawsuit.
JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Fifth Third Bancorp, Barclays, Bank of Montreal (BMO) and William Blair were sued in 2014, accused of reaping millions in illicit profits by rigging interest rates on municipal bonds.










The whistleblower, identified in the lawsuit as Edelweiss Fund LLC, says the firms have paid $70 million to settle the lawsuit.
Edelweiss accused the group of Wall Street firms of “widespread fraud and collusion” after the state of Illinois hired them to market municipal bonds known as variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) at the lowest possible interest rates.
VRDOs are tax-exempt bonds issued by municipalities to get long-term financing, usually spanning 20 to 30 years.
But instead of marketing the bonds at low interest rates, the banks allegedly inflated the rates to generate millions of dollars in fees and discourage investors from converting the debt securities to cash.
With the settlement “finalized and executed,” the state of Illinois is set to collect $33.6 million while Edelweiss principal Johan Rosenberg will receive $14.4 million as a reward for bringing the lawsuit on behalf of the government. The remaining $22 million will be set aside to pay for the legal expenses incurred by Edelweiss through the years.
Says Rosenberg,
“My goal when I started scrutinizing the manner in which rates on VRDOs were reset in about 2010 was to shine a light on this market because of the benefit the public receives from the critical government projects that VRDOs fund. 
In the years since the litigation began, we have uncovered much that was unknown about how this market is operated and how remarketing agents behave.”

ADA to Reach $1? Cardano Sees Spike in Whale Transactions and Active Addresses ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Cardano (ADA) enthusiasts are eagerly eyeing the $1 mark as the cryptocurrency shows promising growth. Despite lagging in price compared to its peers, recent data reveals a surge in whale transactions and active addresses on the Cardano network, suggesting a bullish trend for the altcoin.







Cardano Network Activity Rising



Recent data indicates a significant uptick in whale transactions on the Cardano network, with 6,810 transactions over $100,000 recorded in the last 24 hours. This surge in whale activity highlights growing interest from large investors in ADA, which could signal confidence in the cryptocurrency’s prospects.



Another positive indicator for Cardano is its network’s increasing number of active addresses. Data from Danogo shows that the monthly active address count reached its highest level since May 2023, with 596,915 active addresses recorded on March 11. This figure is nearly double the count recorded in September 2023, indicating a substantial uptick in user activity on the network.



ADA Price Movement and Resistance at $0.7



ADA/USDT Price Chart: TradingView



Despite these positive network activities, ADA has yet to surpass the $0.8 mark, facing resistance at this level. The cryptocurrency’s price has almost tripled from its low of $0.24 in September, currently trading at $0.63. If ADA can break through the $0.8 resistance level, it could pave the way for a rally towards $1, a price point not seen since April 2022.



The overall cryptocurrency market is showing an upward trend, with many digital assets surpassing their previous all-time highs. This optimistic market sentiment could provide the necessary momentum for ADA to push past $1 in the near future.

Cardano’s Growing Ecosystem



Cardano’s DeFi platforms have experienced significant growth, with the Total Value Locked (TVL) increasing substantially. Since the beginning of 2023, the TVL has surged from approximately $60 million to surpass $487 million as of March 14.



Cardano TVL/ Source: Defillama



The surge in TVL on Cardano’s DeFi platforms isn’t solely due to asset price increases. The number of ADA locked in DeFi protocols has also grown significantly, from 200 million ADA at the start of the year to over 650 million.



Indigo’s collateralized debt protocol stands out in Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, boasting over $120 million in TVL. Minswap, a decentralized exchange, follows closely with $100 million, while lending protocol Liqwid holds $63 million. Minswap has also led in active wallet addresses over the past month, with 30,677 addresses.



As Cardano continues to attract attention from investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, its recent surge in whale transactions and active addresses bodes well for its future price trajectory. If ADA can overcome the $0.8 resistance level, it could signal the beginning of a bullish run towards $1, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency.

Heco Bridge Exploiters Funnel $145,700,000 Worth of Ethereum Into the Crypto Mixer Tornado Cash: PeckShield - The Daily Hodl


								The hackers who struck Heco Bridge, a project linked to Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun, have been funneling their stolen Ethereum (ETH) into the sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash (TORN).
The blockchain security firm PeckShield notes the exploiters sent 40,391.8 ETH worth approximately $145.7 million to Tornado Cash in the past eight days.










Source: PeckShield/X
In November, hackers hit Heco Bridge and the crypto exchange giant HTX, both of which are linked to Sun. According to cybersecurity firm Cyvers, the protocols were hacked to the tune of a combined $100 million – $86 million of which came from the Heco Bridge.
Heco Bridge moves funds between Ethereum and the energy-saving blockchain Heco Chain.
Tornado Cash is an Ethereum-based coin mixing system that helps users conceal their digital assets.
The controversial project was sanctioned by the US in 2022 for national security purposes. One of its founders, Roman Storm, was arrested last year and charged by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for allegedly laundering $1 billion in criminal proceeds, including hundreds of millions of dollars for the Lazarus Group, the sanctioned North Korean cybercriminal outfit.
The DOJ also charged Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Semenov, though he remains at large.
Additionally, one of the project’s developers, Alexey Pertsev, was arrested in the Netherlands on money laundering charges in 2022.

United Kingdom court convicts resident for crypto money laundering 1

A London resident, Jian Wen, has recently faced legal consequences in a United Kingdom court after being discovered in possession of bitcoins valued at over $4.3 billion. Wen’s involvement in a money laundering arrangement has brought attention to the complexities and challenges associated with financial crimes in the digital age.United Kingdom court convicts woman for money launderingDespite her previous occupation in a takeout restaurant, Wen attempted to conceal her illicit activities by posing as an employee of a jewelry company. This tactic, however, failed to pass rigorous money laundering checks when she sought to purchase high-value properties in London. Additionally, her attempts to legitimize her substantial assets by linking them to Bitcoin mining activities were met with skepticism and did not withstand scrutiny.Nevertheless, Wen managed to successfully acquire luxury items such as jewelry worth tens of thousands of dollars in Switzerland and properties in Dubai back in 2019. These acquisitions highlight the potential for individuals engaged in financial crimes to exploit global markets and jurisdictions.The extensive investigation that led to Wen’s arrest and the subsequent seizure of her bitcoins by the United Kingdom authorities spanned five years. The United Kingdom law enforcement agencies, particularly the London Metropolitan Police, dedicated significant resources to unraveling the intricate web of financial transactions and digital asset conversions orchestrated by Wen.Law enforcement’s five-year pursuit and legal consequencesDuring the investigation, authorities conducted searches at multiple addresses linked to Wen and meticulously examined approximately 48 electronic devices. The inclusion of files translated from Mandarin Chinese underscores the international scope of the investigation and the challenges posed by cross-border financial crimes.A report from the British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC) disclosed that the High Court granted the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) a freezing order, enabling them to conduct a thorough recovery investigation. This legal measure aims to recover and potentially forfeit the bitcoins tied to Wen’s money laundering activities, emphasizing the legal consequences faced by individuals engaging in such illicit practices.Andrew Penhale, the CPS’s chief crown prosecutor, commented on the case, highlighting the concerning trend of criminals utilizing cryptocurrencies to disguise and transfer illicit assets. He emphasized the need for robust enforcement measures and collaboration among international law enforcement agencies to combat financial crimes facilitated by digital currencies.The conviction of Jian Wen serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle against money laundering and illicit financial activities in the digital era. It underscores the importance of regulatory vigilance and enforcement efforts to safeguard financial systems from abuse by criminals exploiting emerging technologies like cryptocurrencies.

Zagabond disclosed that he is of Chinese origin, hailing from Harbin, marking his first visit back to his homeland in over five years, a period extending before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The revelation comes amidst a backdrop of intense scrutiny and controversy surrounding the Azuki project, particularly concerning the allocation and management of funds raised through its initial offering.Zagabond’s announcement goes beyond just an identity reveal; it underscores his personal mission to bridge the cultural and technological divide between the East and West.

The community’s demand for accountability led to the hiring of lawyers with the intent to recover the funds from Zagabond, alongside the initiation of a lawsuit against him.However, in a surprising twist, the lawsuit was later withdrawn. The decision, while unexpected, hinted at possible internal resolutions and a move towards reconciling the differences between Zagabond and the broader Azuki community. Further complicating the narrative, Zagabond’s admission in a May 2022 Mirror article revealed his involvement in previous projects such as CryptoPhunks, Tendies, and CryptoZunks within the last year, projects that had varying degrees of success and community reception.The road ahead for AzukiZagabond’s public disclosure and the subsequent unfolding of events represent a pivotal moment for Azuki. The founder’s commitment to transparency and his vision for a culturally cohesive digital ecosystem have set the stage for a potential turnaround in the project’s trajectory. As the Azuki community processes the newfound openness, the focus shifts towards healing and rebuilding trust, with an eye on the future possibilities that Azuki holds as a bridge between diverse cultures and communities.The challenges faced by Azuki and its founder underscore the complexities and growing pains inherent in the rapidly evolving NFT space.

As the project moves forward, the emphasis on cultural connection, transparency, and community rebuilding will be critical in shaping its path. The Azuki saga serves as a reminder of the importance of trust and accountability in the digital age, highlighting the potential for projects to unite and inspire across borders and cultures.

SHIB Price Alert: 50% Transaction Size Drop Signals Major Shift


The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has seen a sharp decline, with the average transaction size dropping by 50% in the last two weeks. This points to a possible change in investor sentiment towards Shiba Inu. The decrease in transaction size might indicate a slowdown from the recent surge in buying, perhaps signaling a wider market reassessment.
Adding to the cautious stance, SHIB’s technical indicators, such as an overbought RSI and bearish EMAs, suggest upcoming corrections. These factors suggest SHIB could be heading into a difficult period, raising questions about its ability to continue the bullish momentum it has shown recently.
Average Transaction Size Is Declining
Analyzing SHIB’s Average Transaction Size for the past month will print an interesting scenario. From February 21 to March 6, it grew from $10,139 to $42,491. That represents a 319.08% growth in roughly two weeks. In that same period, SHIB’s price grew from $0.000009 to $0.000034, a 277.78% growth. As we can see, during the recent bull run, these metrics appear to be correlated.

Then, the average transaction size grew more, and then it started to fall heavily. From $49,816 on March 11 to $22,824 on March 21, a -54.18% drop. In that same period, SHIB price dropped from $0.000033 to $0.000027, a -18.18% decrease. 
Since these two metrics seem to be very correlated in the last few months, this gap between this huge drop in average transaction size and price correction may be closed in the next few days, as SHIB prices potentially drop even more.

SHIB RSI Is Still In The Overbought Stage
Despite undergoing a recent price correction, the SHIB Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains at a high of 81. That signals a potential bearish momentum. This elevated RSI level, significantly surpassing the marker of 70, implies that SHIB could be considered overvalued at the moment. This could set the stage for a possible downward adjustment in its price.
Generally, an RSI value exceeding 70 indicates that the asset may have been subject to excessive buying activity, raising the likelihood of a forthcoming retracement as the market endeavors to find a balance between demand and supply dynamics.
SHIB RSI 7D. Source: Santiment. 
The RSI metric itself serves as a crucial tool in technical analysis, acting as a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements within a range of 0 to 100, based on recent price increases and decreases. SHIB’s RSI progression from 88 on March 11 to 81 by March 21, despite reflecting a modest reduction in buying momentum, unmistakably keeps it within the overbought territory. 
This condition is traditionally interpreted by investors as a bearish indicator, suggesting that the asset has been under considerable buying pressure, which might not be sustainable over time. As a result, the expectation is for SHIB price to potentially decline as the market naturally adjusts to these dynamics, aligning closer to its intrinsic value.

SHIB Price Prediction: Will SHIB Hold The $0.000023 Support?
The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines for SHIB are currently indicating an interesting scenario in their price movement, with the short-term EMA lines nearing a crossover below the long-term EMA lines. This potential crossover is a significant technical indicator that suggests a bearish momentum might be on the horizon, implying that the price could be set to decline if the trend continues. 
Furthermore, the fact that the EMA lines are very close to each other and to the current price line indicates a lack of strong momentum in either direction, suggesting that the market is in a state of uncertainty. When the EMA lines hover near the current price, it often signals a consolidation phase, where the price could break out in either direction depending on market sentiment and upcoming developments.

EMA lines give more weight to recent prices, making them react quicker to market changes than SMAs. They help spot trend directions and potential reversals. A short-term EMA dropping below a long-term one suggests a bearish outlook; a rise above indicates bullish potential.

SHIB’s price is $0.000026, just above the $0.000023 support. If it breaks, $0.000020 could be next. If the trend reverses, it might challenge the $0.000034 resistance, possibly reaching $0.000038. 
Market trends, sentiment, and crypto dynamics greatly influence these scenarios, underlining the importance of monitoring these indicators.

Iceland Prime Minister Makes Statement on Bitcoin and BTC Mining - Bitcoin Sistemi


Icelandic Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir announced in a recent interview that the country plans to prioritize food security over financial gain.
The decision comes in response to recent protests by farmers in Europe and trade disruptions that have highlighted the need for the Scandinavian country to reduce its dependence on imports.


Despite the challenges of farming in Iceland, where glaciers cover a large part of the country, Jakobsdóttir emphasized the importance of agriculture in safety and security strategies. “It's not easy being a farmer in Iceland. The fields aren't great either. But agriculture is an important part of our strategy for safety and security in this world,” he said.

Efforts at food security are combined with an attempt to curb energy-hungry Bitcoin miners who have turned the island into a data center haven. Jakobsdóttir expressed concern that a significant portion of Iceland's green energy is being consumed by Bitcoin mining centers and suggested that the valuable renewable electricity in these centers be transferred to housing and other sectors:






“Bitcoin is a worldwide problem, but data centers in Iceland use a significant portion of our green energy. A new proposal to boost wind energy would “prioritise” green industries to achieve carbon neutrality. “Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which consume a large portion of our energy, are not part of this mission.”

DeFi Farming Game 'Crypto Valleys' Is Giving Players Juicy YIELD on Ethereum L2 Blast - Decrypt

Gaming activity is bubbling up on buzzy new Ethereum scaler Blast, and while one game has already fallen victim to an exploit on the nascent network, another is yielding rave reviews from players while driving Blast’s most-traded token.Crypto Valleys is the game in question, and it initially appears to tread upon similar ground as Pixels, the popular farming game on competing scaler Ronin. But while Pixels is a relatively robust experience akin to traditional video games, Crypto Valleys—at least in its initial incarnation—is focused on keeping DeFi degens coming back to harvest more gains.In the web-based game, you’ll buy NFT-based seeds with the game’s YIELD token and plant them, and then eventually harvest the produce… to earn even more YIELD. Rinse and repeat. Crypto Valleys has more ambitious aims ahead, as spelled out in the game’s documentation and in social media threads, but for now it looks pretty simple and streamlined.The addition of “gacha” elements helps spice things up, coming in the form of NFT seed packs with randomized contents. Gacha games are akin to loot boxes in many popular games, which promise rewards that could range wildly from common to extravagant. You don’t know until you open them, however, which fuels the FOMO.Image: TwitterWant massive YIELD gains from your next crop? Well, those could be found in your next seed pack. Maybe. That kind of alluring possibility is ready-made to drive users to grab their Ethereum wallets, particularly when there’s a surging token driving it all.Crypto Valleys’ YIELD is currently the most-traded token across all of Blast, per data from DexScreener, with about $13 million worth of trading volume over the past 24 hours.The price pumped to about $17 on Thursday and then cooled off into Friday, but has been rising again Saturday to a current price of $13.60 as of this writing. That gives the token a $95 million market cap. The tokens were initially offered for sale in-game at a price of around $0.15 each—just last week.Amid growing buzz around the game, Crypto Valleys gave out a free-to-mint collection of 1,500 character NFTs. The assets now start at about 0.4 ETH, or $1,350 as of this writing, on the secondary market and have yielded over $4 million worth of trading volume so far.Crypto Valleys has drawn comparisons to earlier crypto game DeFi Kingdoms, which wrapped the mechanics of decentralized finance trading into a fantasy role-player.Image: TwitterBut the gacha mechanics, paired with the potential yield opportunities around the booming Blast ecosystem, appear to have supercharged the serotonin hit that players are getting this time around. Players can also earn “Blast Gold,” or special points that go towards the upcoming Blast network token airdrop for users.Over the last couple of days, the hype tweets around finding rare, valuable seeds and sharing farming strategies have been steadily circulating across Crypto Twitter. We’ll see whether degens stick around long enough to watch these digital crops—and the game around them—mature, or if they quickly move on to find the next juicy yield elsewhere.Edited by Ryan OzawaStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Kraken UK's Vision for Bitcoin ETFs: A Step Towards Mainstream Adoption | Cryptopolitan

In a recent statement that has stirred the financial and cryptocurrency sectors, Bivu Das, the Managing Director of Kraken UK, has voiced a strong opinion in favor of introducing Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United Kingdom. The endorsement came during his appearance at the Digital Asset Summit in London, where Das highlighted the evolving landscape of digital assets and the pressing need for the UK to adapt to these changes by embracing Bitcoin ETFs.The changing tide of digital financeSince the UK’s decision in 2021 to restrict such financial products, the world of digital finance has undergone significant transformations. Bivu Das pointed out that the initial concerns which led to the restriction of Bitcoin ETFs, particularly those related to retail investor protection, have been mitigated to a certain extent. The argument is that owning a Bitcoin ETF, as opposed to the actual Bitcoin, could offer a layer of protection to investors, addressing the regulatory concerns that were previously raised.Das emphasized the allure of Bitcoin ETFs, noting their potential for providing decent returns. He expressed concern that the absence of such investment vehicles in the UK market might drive investors towards unregulated platforms in search of similar exposure. This, according to Das, is not in the best interest of the UK’s aspirations to become a crypto hub. He stated, “The UK has always said it wants to be a crypto hub. And it is one of the basic fundamentals potentially for meeting that definition.”Institutional vs. retail: The current state of crypto investments in the UKWhile the countries decision has made strides towards integrating digital assets into its financial ecosystem, evidenced by the recent approval of crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for institutional investors, retail investors remain on the sidelines. The distinction draws a stark contrast to the situation in the United States, where Bitcoin ETFs are accessible to a broader audience, including retail investors.Das highlighted the swift adoption of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and their positive impact on legitimizing Bitcoin within the broader crypto market, especially among institutional investors. The development, according to Das, is a testament to the potential benefits that Bitcoin ETFs could bring to the countries market, not only in terms of investment returns but also in enhancing the credibility and acceptance of cryptocurrencies.A unified call for diversification and inclusionEchoing Das’s sentiments, Coinbase UK CEO Daniel Seifert also voiced support for the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in the country. In a recent interview, Seifert advocated for greater consumer choice in the financial market, implying that the availability of Bitcoin ETFs would be a step in the right direction. “I would say more choice for consumers is always good,” Seifert remarked, underscoring the importance of providing UK investors with a diverse range of investment options.The push for Bitcoin ETFs in the UK represents a collective call for innovation, diversification, and inclusion in the financial sector. By introducing these products, the UK could not only enhance its position as a leading crypto hub but also offer its citizens the opportunity to participate in the growing digital economy in a regulated and protected environment.ConclusionThe advocacy for Bitcoin ETFs by leading figures in the UK’s cryptocurrency sector highlights a growing recognition of the need to evolve with the changing financial landscape. As the world becomes increasingly digital, the integration of cryptocurrency-based financial products like Bitcoin ETFs into mainstream investment options appears not only inevitable but essential.

ETH a security? Celsius clawbacks, SBF says sentence too harsh: Hodler’s Digest, March 17-23 - Cointelegraph Magazine


            
Top Stories This Week



SEC is attempting to classify Ether as a security



The United States Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly issued numerous subpoenas to companies as part of its efforts to classify Ether as a security. 



According to a recent report, an SEC investigation into the Ethereum Foundation could potentially grant the commission regulatory jurisdiction to label the digital asset as a security.



The foundation suggested via GitHub that it may be under investigation “from a state authority.”



Meanwhile, several U.S.-based companies reportedly received requests from the SEC to provide documents and financial records related to dealings with the Ethereum Foundation.



Celsius seeks to claw back $2B in customer withdrawals



Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius is reportedly aiming to recover $2 billion from major customers who withdrew from the platform just before its bankruptcy in July 2022. 



According to a recent report, a Celsius bankruptcy oversight committee has begun contacting customers who withdrew more than $100,000 prior to its downfall, with the goal of using potential returned funds to pay back customers who did not withdraw from the platform in time. 



The committee will offer clawback-affected customers a “favorable rate” if they decide to settle, with the threat of litigation if funds are not returned. 



In addition, customers who settle will have their notional digital assets adjusted based on their July 2022 value, near the nadir of the crypto bear market.







SEC hit with sanctions for its ‘gross abuse of power’ in Debt Box case



A United States district court imposed sanctions on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for acting in “bad faith” in a lawsuit it brought against Debt Box. 



The SEC initially filed a motion to dismiss without prejudice, but that was denied by Judge Robert J. Shelby, who slammed the regulator for intentionally lying to the court about evidence it obtained to secure a temporary restraining order and freeze of Debt Box’s assets last August. 






In its lawsuit, the SEC claimed Debt Box perpetrated a $50-million fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme amid its operations as a software mining license provider, alleging that Debt Box had already sent $720,000 overseas and would flee to the United Arab Emirates and secretly transfer more assets with it if it was notified of the order.



Shelby concluded the SEC misrepresented evidence and that the $720,000 transfer was instead sent within the United States.



Binance offers $5M reward for insider trading tip-offs



Crypto exchange Binance announced that it will offer a $100,000-to-$5,000,000 reward for those who provide them with reports on potential insider trading or corruption within the exchange. 



On March 16, Binance announced it would list the Solana-based memecoin, Book of Meme (BOME). The token was paired with Bitcoin, Tether, First Digital USD and the Turkish lira. 



Ahead of the Binance listing, a crypto whale bought 314 million BOME tokens for $2.3 million on the Raydium decentralized exchange at an average price of $0.0074. After the listing, the value of the tokens pumped to a high of $0.026, making the tokens worth around $8 million. 



After the listing, the trade was flagged, sparking community discussions, with some alleging that this was an insider trade. 



On Reddit, a community member asked if they thought it was a lucky trade or an insider tip, while another floated the idea that the trader could be an insider from Binance.



SBF says proposed 50-year sentence casts him as ‘depraved super-villain’



Lawyers representing former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried stated that a proposed maximum sentence of 50 years in prison for the founder invokes a “medieval” view of punishment and doesn’t accurately reflect the severity of his crimes. 



On March 19, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers, Marc Mukasey and Torrey Young, wrote to Judge Lewis Kaplan in response to the government’s sentencing proposal, handed down on March 15.



“With marked hostility, the memorandum distorts reality to support its precious ‘loss’ narrative and casts Sam as a depraved super-villain,” they stated.







Winners and Losers

Most Memorable Quotations



“Customers still will never be in the same position they would have been had they not crossed paths with Mr. Bankman-Fried and his so-called brand of ‘altruism.’”



John Ray III, restructuring officer and CEO of FTX



“Am I sorry for a company going bankrupt? No. Like, companies go bankrupt all the time.”



Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital






“People can do what they want with their money but sending money to a ‘memecoin presale’ that has a 99.9% chance of rugging is actually just dumb as hell.”



Anthony Sassano, independent Ethereum educator



“I guess it’s that time of the cycle where everyone freaks out about Cardano’s potential and roadmap, so they throw a wave of FUD at us.”



Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano



“Dogecoin’s enduring popularity and the active community support suggest that it has transcended its origins as a meme to become a staple of the cryptocurrency world.”



Coinbase, cryptocurrency exchange



“It will be interesting to watch what, if any, excuse the SEC uses if it were to delay or deny an ETH ETF, given it has already informed the market on ETH being outside its jurisdiction.”



Brian Quintenz, former commissioner of the CFTC







Prediction of the Week



Key Ethereum price metric targets $5.4K ETH in 2024



Ether’s price could reach the $5,400 mark in 2024, according to a technical price indicator used by traders to assess whether a cryptocurrency is overbought or oversold.  



On March 22, Ether’s price was currently trading around the $3,500 mark, approximately 27% away from its all-time high of $4,891 reached on Nov. 16, 2021, according to CoinMarketCap data. 



According to pseudonymous CryptoQuant-verified author Binhdangg, Ether could surpass $5,400 in the high-risk scenario based on the Mayer multiple oscillator, which is a ratio based on comparing Ether’s current price with its 200-day moving average. 



Its price could reach the upper band of the indicator, but that could be much higher than $5,400, Bitfinex analysts told Cointelegraph:




“We expect it to reach oversold condition this year based on the fact that there is a cyclical behavior of the asset to oscillate between the overbought and oversold bands of the indicator. However, this is a dynamic moving average-based deviation, and the upper band may be far above the $5,400 level by the time the price reaches those levels.”




FUD of the Week



Hacker moves $10M from 2023 phishing incident to Tornado Cash



On March 21, blockchain security firm CertiK flagged an account linked to the $24 million hack transferring 3,700 ETH to Tornado Cash. The funds were taken from a crypto whale in a phishing incident on Sept. 6.






At the time, the investor lost $24 million in staked ETH on the liquid staking provider Rocket Pool. The hack was done in two transactions: One took 9,579 stETH, while the other drained 4,851 rETH from the crypto whale.



Scam Sniffer, an anti-scam project, said that the victim signed an “Increase Allowance” transaction, which enabled token approvals for the hacker. With smart contracts, the feature allows third parties to spend ERC-20 tokens belonging to others if given approval.



Old Dolomite exchange contract suffers $1.8M loss from approval exploit



An old contract previously used by the Dolomite crypto exchange has been exploited for approximately $1.8 million, according to a March 20 report from blockchain security platform CertiK and seen by Cointelegraph. 



The exploit affected users who previously authorized approvals to the contract, and the development team recommended revoking approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address that begins with 0xe2466. 



The development team claimed that users who only interacted with the current version on Arbitrum would not be affected. 



They also disabled the faulty contract in an effort to protect users who had not yet become victims of the attack. Even so, the team argued that users should revoke approvals to this contract.

How XRP Ledger's New AMM Makes Crypto Trading Easier Than Ever - DailyCoin


        
The XRP Ledger has embraced Automated Market Makers to revolutionize liquidity and trading within its DeFi ecosystem.



AMMs have replaced manual market making with automatic trading and liquidity provision.



The AMM has opened doors for innovative DeFi applications built on the XRPL.
The XRP Ledger (XRPL) took a major step towards a more robust and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem with the recent integration of Automated Market Makers (AMMs). This novel feature introduces a new paradigm for liquidity and trading on the network, offering exciting possibilities for both developers and users.Dive into XRPL’s AMMPreviously, the XRPL decentralized exchange (DEX) relied solely on manual market making and central limit order books for liquidity. The new AMM integration acts as a native feature within the XRPL DEX, fostering automatic trading and liquidity provision without the need for traditional order books. This innovation creates liquidity pools for asset pairs, where prices are determined algorithmically based on the pool’s asset ratio. This model is particularly beneficial for trading pairs with lower trade volumes, ensuring constant liquidity and price stability.Beyond its core functionality, the XRPL AMM boasts several unique features:
Protocol Native: Unlike other blockchains, XRPL AMM eliminates the need for developers to create separate smart contracts, reducing associated risks and simplifying the development process.



Aggregated Liquidity: Liquidity for all trading pairs is consolidated at the protocol level, preventing fragmentation across individual smart contracts.



Continuous Auction Mechanism: This mechanism allows arbitrageurs to bid for price discrepancies at a discount, promoting immediate arbitrage trading and maintaining stable volatility.



Single-sided Liquidity Provision: Users can contribute to a pool using just one asset, streamlining the liquidity contribution process.



No Miner Extractable Value: The XRPL’s federated consensus mechanism ensures fairness and prevents miners from prioritizing specific transactions.



CLOB DEX Integration: The AMM seamlessly integrates with the existing central limit order book (CLOB) DEX. This integration enables price optimization, automatically determining the most efficient trade execution path, whether through liquidity pools, order books, or a combination of both.
The AMM ecosystem revolves around LP (Liquidity Provider) Tokens. These tokens represent a user’s share in a liquidity pool and grant voting rights on key parameters like trading fees. This feature empowers LPs and fosters a community-driven approach to managing liquidity pools.Unlocking New Applications on XRPLDevelopers can leverage the XRPL AMM through readily available libraries like xrpl.js, xrpl-py, and xrpl4j. These libraries provide a foundation for interacting with AMM functionalities and building innovative DeFi applications. The XRPL developer community also plays a crucial role. The XRPL Developers Discord channel and forums serve as valuable platforms for collaboration, feedback exchange, and ongoing refinement of the AMM feature.The AMM integration opens doors to a plethora of financial and non-financial applications on the XRPL. Developers can now create user-friendly DeFi services like trading platforms, yield farming applications, and more, all powered by the efficiency and liquidity of AMM pools.On the Flipside
While AMMs have proven successful on other blockchains, the XRPL AMM is still in its early stages. It remains to be seen how it will perform in the long term.



While AMMs offer potential benefits, they introduce new risks for users.  Unlike traditional order books, AMMs rely on algorithms that can be susceptible to manipulation or unforeseen vulnerabilities.
Why This MattersBy eliminating reliance on traditional order books and fostering a community-driven approach to liquidity, XRPL’s AMM integration paves the way for a more accessible and dynamic DeFi ecosystem, attracting not only developers building innovative applications but also users seeking new financial opportunities and a voice in shaping the network’s future.Curious why XRP was snubbed by Coinbase for futures trading?

Ethereum Network Flashing Signs of Growth Amid Regulatory Uncertainty and Underperforming Price: IntoTheBlock - The Daily Hodl


								Leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of growth despite its underperformance and the regulatory uncertainty surrounding it, according to market intelligence firm IntoTheBlock.
In a new article, the head of research at the crypto analytics platform says that Ethereum volumes are reaching levels they haven’t seen in years, signaling growth.










“Ethereum has been subject to criticism by many over the past few months. Within crypto, people point to ETH’s price underperforming and traction on Solana as a sign of Ethereum losing its mojo. Beyond crypto, regulators are now reportedly cracking down on the Ethereum Foundation and going after ETH as a security.”
According to IntoTheBlock, this week, the amount of ETH transferred on its mainnet reached its highest point since May 2022 while the amount of ETH on layer-2 scaling solutions recently surpassed 10 million for the first time ever.
Source: IntoTheBlock/Medium
IntoTheBlock says that activity on layer-2s Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), and Base (BASE) is going at over twice the rate than it is on Ethereum’s mainnet. Furthermore, the market intelligence firm says that since ETH’s fees dropped 90% after the Dencun update on March 13th, activity on layer-2 blockchains should ramp up even more.
However, IntoTheBlock does acknowledge that Ethereum has lagged behind crypto king Bitcoin (BTC) and the S&P 500 this cycle.
“Price-wise, there is an argument to be made against ETH relatively lagging behind so far this cycle. However, in terms of on-chain data, Ethereum continues to grow.”
Earlier this month, Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), declined to comment on whether Ethereum counts as security or a commodity, adding to the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the second-largest digital asset by market cap as the regulatory agency is still in the process of deciding whether or not to approve several bids to create ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Ethereum is trading for $3,333 at time of writing, a 3.75% decrease during the last 24 hours.

EU Takes Stand Against Anonymity in Crypto Transactions


The European Union Parliament has taken a significant step by outlawing unidentified self-custody crypto wallets for making payments across the region.
A recent social media post by Patrick Breyer, an EU Parliament member, revealed that the ban received approval from most of the parliament’s leadership committee on March 19. This move is part of the EU’s broader anti-money laundering (AML) legislation.
How Europe’s New AML Regulations Impacts Crypto
The new regulations ban all anonymous crypto payments and cash transactions above certain limits. Specifically, they prohibit cash payments exceeding €10,000 or anonymous cash transactions beyond €3,000. The ban also targets self-custody wallets on mobile, desktop, or browser applications.
Although the law is slated to take effect in three years, there are suggestions that its implementation might be sooner.
Nonetheless, the new regulation is set to reshape how Europeans engage with digital currencies. It has also triggered apprehensions regarding user privacy and financial inclusivity due to its stringent stance against anonymity. Additionally, the regulation could pose significant barriers to innovation and impede widespread crypto adoption in the region.

Breyer, a dissenting voice within the parliament, argued that the ban could impact law-abiding citizens rather than curbing criminal activities. He emphasized that anonymous payments have served legitimate purposes. 
He cited examples such as donations to individuals like Alexei Navalny and organizations like WikiLeaks. Moreover, he highlighted the importance of financial privacy for personal transactions.


Breyer also expressed concerns that heightened surveillance of financial transactions could inadvertently facilitate malicious activities by hackers and encroach on individual freedoms.

“We need to find ways to bring the best features of cash into our digital future. We also have the right to be able to pay and donate in cryptocurrencies online without our payment behavior being recorded for no reason and personally. If the EU believes it can regulate virtual currencies on its own, it has not understood the global internet,” Breyer said.

Similarly, crypto community members have raised questions and concerns regarding the scope of the ban on anonymous payments. One user, in particular, sought clarification on whether the ban would extend to all cryptocurrencies or only those categorized as privacy coins.
Notably, several crypto exchanges, including Binance and OKX, have delisted several privacy-focused tokens for their users in Europe.

Meanwhile, Circle’s Director of Research and Policy, Patrick Hansen, explained that self-custody wallets and payments from such wallets were not banned. Additionally, peer-to-peer transfers are explicitly excluded from the regulation.

“Paying with crypto (for example to merchants) with a non KYC’d self custody wallet will be more difficult/banned depending on the merchants set up. This change, as well as the lower thresholds for anonymous cash payments, has unfortunately been agreed months ago,” he added.

Crypto Community Condemns Emergence of Racist Memecoins


In recent months, memecoins popularity surged within the crypto ecosystem. These assets had captured community attention with their origins rooted in beloved internet animal memes and shared interests among various crypto communities.
However, the frenzy surrounding these assets recently veered into unsettling territory as new memecoins bearing offensive names and symbols, including racial slurs, anti-Semitic references, and Nazi imagery, emerged.

This development sparked swift and severe backlash, drawing condemnation from the cryptocurrency community.
Camila Russo, a respected cryptocurrency journalist, expressed dismay at those purchasing these tokens in the present era. However, she acknowledged the freedom for anyone to create tokens on permissionless blockchains. Still, she stressed the importance of centralized platforms having the discretion to filter and delist such tokens.
Hayden Adams, the creator of Uniswap DEX, echoed similar sentiments, advocating for protocols to be able to block these abhorrent tokens.


“Protocols should be permissionless. But if you run a frontend with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should. I have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash,” Adams remarked.

Due to these developments, DEX Screener, a DeFi token analytics platform, announced plans to reassess its token profile moderation policy.

“We won’t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we’re definitely not here to spread hate,” the platform added.


Interestingly, in response to these negative memecoins, some blockchain users have launched positive alternatives and underlined the favorable developments within the sector. Notably, a memecoin named Stop Racism on Solana has surged by around 19,000% in the last 24 hours.

Additionally, developers behind the Floki memecoin unveiled plans to introduce Floki-powered digital banking services, including debit cards for token holders. This initiative aims to enable users to fund their accounts with Floki and conduct transactions in major fiat currencies like Dollars, Euros, and Pounds. At the same time, the development would also provide banking services to the unbanked population and facilitate global money transfers.

An unnamed fintech company licensed in several countries will create these bank accounts. The account would have access to debit cards and support SWIFT Payments and SEPA IBANs.

“These accounts will be facilitated through a key partner licensed in four key jurisdictions: Canada, Spain, Dominica, Australia, and the UAE. Users will be able to create digital bank accounts and generate debit cards linked to these accounts,” Floki explained.

This move, along with creating a domain name service, is expected to enhance the utility of the memecoin.

“[Floki plans] to introduce a decentralized website service that will allow people to host their decentralized website, blog, or resume using their .floki domain name,” the project added.

Gary Gensler says he wants to disinfect the crypto industry | Cryptopolitan

Gary Gensler, the big cheese at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is not playing games when it comes to the wild west of the crypto industry. It’s like he walked into a saloon, guns blazing, taking aim at the sneaky varmints trying to dodge the law. At a recent discussion at Columbia Law School, Gensler shared that he is all for dragging the crypto cowboys into the sunshine, because, in his book, sunlight zaps germs better than anything. It seems some crypto players think they’re slick, slipping through the cracks of SEC’s rules like they’re greased up. But Gensler’s having none of it. He’s out to slap the mandatory disclosure label on them, making sure everyone knows what’s what. Without it, it’s like a free-for-all, where nobody knows who’s holding aces and who’s bluffing. Gensler reckons a bit of sunlight might just clean up the town.Gensler’s Regulatory ShowdownNow, let’s get this straight. Gensler’s not some lone ranger. He’s got his posse – the SEC – and they’ve been busy rounding up the usual suspects. From Kraken to Binance, and Ripple to Coinbase, nobody’s riding off into the sunset. The SEC wants to lay down the law, make things clear so innovation can thrive without turning into a free-for-all.But here’s the problem. While Gensler’s gang is tightening the noose, they’re also eyeing Ethereum, thinking it might just be the next wanted poster. They’ve been green-lighting some crypto-tied goodies for the trading folk, like those shiny new Bitcoin and Ethereum future-based toys and even the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Talk about mixed signals.Yet, just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water, along come Senators Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler, waving a big red flag about crypto ETFs. They reckon it’s like inviting sharks to a pool party. According to them, letting more crypto ETFs through the door is like asking for trouble, with markets thinner than a cowboy’s patience and ripe for all sorts of shenanigans.A Tug of War in the Wild WestThese senators are not whispering sweet nothings. They’re shouting from the rooftops that Bitcoin, while it’s got its own can of worms, is at least under the spotlight. But other cryptocurrencies? They’re like the murky back alleys of Dodge City. The senators are laying it on thick, asking Gensler to keep a tighter leash on those Bitcoin ETF cowboys, making sure they’re not leading the herd off a cliff.And oh boy, does it seem like Gensler’s caught between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, there’s the success of the Bitcoin ETFs making waves, and on the other, there’s the political bigwigs breathing down his neck. The chatter around town is that the chances of a spot Ether ETF getting the nod are slim, thanks to this whole kerfuffle.It’s like watching a standoff at high noon. Gensler and the SEC are in the middle, with crypto enthusiasts on one side and cautious politicians on the other. The crypto industry’s looking for a hero, but it’s a fine line between lawman and outlaw in this digital frontier.So, there you have it. Gensler’s on a mission to clean up the crypto industry, armed with disclosures and regulations.

Decentralized Oracle Network Chainlink Leads the Crypto Space in Terms of Recent Development Activity: Santiment - The Daily Hodl


								The decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK) is ahead of all other crypto projects in terms of recent development activity, according to the analytics firm Santiment.
Santiment notes that Chainlink is at the top of the list with an average of 451.23 notable GitHub events over the past 30 days.










The smart contract platform Cardano (ADA) is second, clocking 444.7 events with Status (SNT) taking the third spot with 434.5 events.
Status aims to offer users a secure messaging app, crypto wallet and web3 browser via an open-source, peer-to-peer protocol and end-to-end encryption.
The Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 scaling solution Optimism (OP) ranks fourth with 411 notable events, and the decentralized public network Hedera (HBAR) clocked in at fifth with 378.73.
Source: Santiment/X
Santiment notes that it doesn’t count routine updates and uses a “better methodology” to collect data for GitHub events based on a “backtested process.”
The analytics firm has previously said that heavy development activity centered around a crypto project is a positive indication that could mean that the developers believe the protocol will be successful. It also indicates that the project is less likely to be an exit scam.
LINK is trading at $18.31 at time of writing. The 15th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down 1.31% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin's buying frenzy raises concerns among experts | Cryptopolitan

The recent uproar in the Bitcoin market has everyone from casual observers to seasoned investors glued to their screens, watching with bated breath as the digital currency dances on a knife-edge. Critics and enthusiasts alike can’t seem to agree on anything except for the undeniable fact that Bitcoin’s latest antics are stirring up more than just digital dust. A Roller Coaster Ride of ValuationFollowing a tumultuous week that saw Bitcoin’s value take a nosedive by over 15%, only to dust itself off and stage a partial comeback, the digital currency’s market behavior has been nothing short of a high-stakes drama. From soaring to a new zenith and then slipping to lows that had holders white-knuckling their digital wallets, Bitcoin’s price trajectory has been unpredictable. The digital asset, which hovered around $63,000 after a brief dip, seemed to regain its footing, momentarily touching $67,000 before the ground slipped away once more.This financial roller coaster caught the eye of the analysts at JPMorgan, led by the keen-eyed Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, who pointed out that despite the recent market correction, the backdrop for Bitcoin remains overwhelmingly overbought. This observation comes amid a market atmosphere thick with anticipation and speculation, especially as the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold rates steady seems to have provided a temporary buoy for the digital currency’s value.Market watchers and investors are now keyed into several crucial price levels that could dictate the next phase of Bitcoin’s market journey. Should BTC break past the $69,000 mark again, optimism might surge for a continued upward trajectory. However, failure to do so could see the digital asset retreat to lower thresholds, with analysts marking $57,000 and $53,000 as critical watch points.The Halving Horizon and Its ImplicationsThe impending Bitcoin halving event, expected around April 20, is another focal point for market speculators. This event, which will see Bitcoin rewards for miners halve from 6.25 to 3.125 per block, is anticipated to have significant implications for the digital currency’s supply and, by extension, its market valuation. The JPMorgan team has cast a wary eye on this development, noting a significant slowdown in net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, a factor they believe could challenge the sustained one-way net inflow narrative that has buoyed BTC’s valuation in the past.The ETF outflows, which hit $1.8 billion over four days, underscore the cautious stance that many are taking as the halving event draws near. Despite this, there remains a strong undercurrent of optimism in the market, with several price forecasts post-halving painting a bullish picture for Bitcoin. This optimism persists even in the face of more conservative estimates, such as JPMorgan’s own projection of a potential drop to $42,000 post-halving.The significance of the halving event extends beyond mere speculation. It represents a fundamental shift in the Bitcoin ecosystem, affecting supply and, by extension, price dynamics. The reduction in mining rewards effectively doubles the cost of Bitcoin production, a development that has historically acted as a catalyst for price growth. This is due in part to the event’s impact on the supply-demand dynamic, an aspect central to Bitcoin’s value proposition.As we edge closer to the halving, the exact timing remains shrouded in the inherent unpredictability of Bitcoin mining. Despite attempts to forecast the event down to the minute, the stochastic nature of block discovery and the adjustments in mining difficulty make it impossible to pinpoint precisely when the halving will occur.

Hospitality worker caught with $2.5B Bitcoin found guilty of money laundering

A hospitality worker has reportedly been found guilty of money laundering in a United Kingdom specialized court for major fraud cases, following the discovery of $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) in her possession.According to a recent BBC report, the Southwark Crown Court has found Jian Wen of laundering money using Bitcoin to purchase "multi-million pound houses and jewellery." The investigation involved scrutiny of 48 electronic devices and thousands of digital files, many of which were translated from Mandarin.Wen's change in lifestyle was what drew the attention from the authorities. In 2017, she reportedly went from living in a flat above a Chinese restaurant to renting a six-bedroom house in North London costing approximately $21,420 per month.On Jan. 31, Cointelegraph reported that it was the attempted purchase of a $30 million mansion in London that was the ultimate red flag for the authorities to investigate her. During the same year, she reportedly attempted to purchase a series of expensive houses in London but faced challenges passing money-laundering checks, despite her claims of earning millions from Bitcoin mining.Related: German authorities seize 50K BTC connected to piracy websitesThe UK police claimed that the seizure was the “largest of its kind in the UK.” Wen was convicted of "entering into or becoming concerned in a money laundering arrangement," and is due to be sentenced on May 10.CPS chief crown prosecutor Andrew Penhale reiterated digital assets prominent use in criminal activity in recent times:“Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used by organized criminals to disguise and transfer assets, so that fraudsters may enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct.”However, a recent report from the United States Treasury Department contradicts the common claim by authorities that crypto is a popular choice for money laundering, declaring that cash continues to be the preferred option.On Feb. 8, Cointelegraph reported that the Treasury highlighted the anonymity and stability of cash as a means of payment as a primary reason why it remains the preferred method of laundering illicit proceeds.Similarly, stock exchange company Nasdaq recently released its “Global Financial Crime Report,” which highlights data related to financial crime over the past year, and there was no mention of Bitcoin or crypto.Yet, it did estimate that in 2023, around $3.1 trillion in illicit funds flowed through the global financial system.Magazine: China will intensify Bitcoin bull run, $1M by 2028: Bitcoin Man, X Hall of Flame

BlackRock gets candid about potential expansion of crypto products | Cryptopolitan

The asset management firm, BlackRock, is making waves in the cryptocurrency ocean, yet it’s steering its ship with a selective compass. The digital asset frontier is vast, with Bitcoin and Ethereum claiming the lion’s share of the market and attention. However, Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, recently shed light on the company’s strategic focus within this burgeoning sector. According to Mitchnick, while the crypto community’s appetite for a diverse array of products is voracious, BlackRock’s gaze remains fixated primarily on Bitcoin, with a modest nod towards Ethereum, and barely a glance at the rest. BlackRock’s Strategic Dive into Crypto’s DepthsBlackRock’s foray into the cryptocurrency realm isn’t a spur-of-the-moment adventure. It’s a calculated journey that began as far back as 2016. This was a period when the digital currency space was still in its infancy, with the infrastructure, regulatory framework, and client interest all in nascent stages. Mitchnick’s narrative highlights a dynamic strategy, evolving in tandem with the crypto ecosystem’s growth over the years. This evolution mirrors the asset manager’s approach to becoming a stalwart in the space, balancing innovation with caution.The dialogue around cryptocurrency at BlackRock isn’t confined to mere speculation. It’s a comprehensive discourse that spans the spectrum of client sophistication. From seasoned investors to novices, the conversations traverse the basics of blockchain technology to intricate market dynamics and portfolio considerations. This educational endeavor by BlackRock signifies a broader commitment to demystifying the crypto space for its clientele, ensuring they’re well-informed to make prudent investment decisions.The Investors’ Compass: Navigating through Bitcoin and BeyondThe pivot towards Bitcoin, particularly through the lens of BlackRock’s IBIT offering, underscores a significant trend. Investors, both new and those reevaluating their crypto holdings, are increasingly gravitating towards Bitcoin. This shift isn’t just about diversification. It’s a quest for understanding the inherent risks and potential rewards, aiming to integrate these digital assets into a broader, well-rounded portfolio. The discourse isn’t solely fixated on Bitcoin, though. Ethereum gets its share of the spotlight, albeit to a lesser extent, reflecting a cautious yet open-minded approach to portfolio expansion within the crypto domain.As the conversation around cryptocurrency matures, the next big milestones for Bitcoin and its digital counterparts remain a topic of fervent speculation. Mitchnick, however, steers away from pinpointing a singular event or development as the pivotal moment for the industry. Instead, he suggests a gradual, yet inevitable, progression fueled by increasing institutional comfort and sophistication, alongside a deepening collective understanding of the asset class.The scene at the bustling Bitcoin Investor Day in New York, as recounted by Mitchnick, is just a glimpse into the broader journey BlackRock is embarking on within the crypto industry. Amidst a packed schedule and the anticipation of further insights on stage, the firm’s strategy appears both clear and calculated. Focus on Bitcoin, eye Ethereum, and proceed with caution as the crypto universe expands.

Why is the Biden administration coming after Elon Musk now? | Cryptopolitan

Elon Musk, the billionaire who never shies away from a Twitter brawl or a rocket launch, is back in the legal spotlight, and this time it’s the Biden administration that’s shining the torch. You might be wondering, “What’s all the fuss about?” Well, let me break it down for you. Back in the day, specifically in 2018, Musk made waves with a tweet about having the cash ready to take Tesla, his electric car baby, off the public market. This tweet caused quite a stir, leading to accusations from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that Musk was playing fast and loose with investor trust. The drama didn’t end with a tweet; it spiraled into a full-blown legal showdown, culminating in a settlement that saw Musk and Tesla coughing up $20 million each in fines. Musk also had to step down as Tesla’s chairman and agree to have his tweets pre-screened by a legal eagle at Tesla.Fast forward to 2022, Musk, never one to be caged, buys Twitter and renames it X, adding another layer to this already juicy story. But the plot thickens. Musk, feeling muzzled by the settlement’s constraints on his tweeting freedom, decided to challenge the SEC’s leash, calling it an infringement on his right to free speech.A Legal Battle with the SECThe legal tussle reached the ears of the U.S. Supreme Court after a lower court sided with the SEC, essentially telling Musk, “No take-backs on the tweet pre-screening deal.” The Biden administration, through the Justice Department, has now stepped into the ring, urging the Supreme Court to dismiss Musk’s appeal. Their argument hinges on the settlement being a fair measure to prevent Musk from potentially misleading investors again.Musk’s defense team, however, isn’t having any of it. They argue that forcing Musk to get his tweets approved in advance is like putting a gag on him, violating the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, which is all about protecting free speech from government interference. They claim this gives the SEC too much control over Musk’s online musings.Meanwhile, in another corner of Musk’s legal universe, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is revisiting an earlier decision. This case revolves around Musk’s 2018 tweet suggesting Tesla workers would lose their stock options if they unionized. This tweet was ruled as a violation of federal labor law, adding another layer of complexity to Musk’s ongoing legal dramas.The Plot ThickensSo, why is the Biden administration taking a keen interest in Musk’s legal scuffles? It’s not just about a billionaire’s tweets or his leadership style. It’s about setting precedents for how corporate leaders communicate with the public and their employees in this digital age. The administration’s involvement underscores a broader regulatory focus on ensuring that the influential tech and business figures don’t misuse their platforms in ways that could mislead the public or harm workers’ rights.The backdrop to this saga includes not just Musk’s legal battles but also a broader conversation about the power of social media, the rights of workers, and the responsibilities of those at the helm of major corporations. It’s a complex web of legal, social, and ethical questions, with Musk and the Biden administration currently at its center.Musk, for his part, seems undeterred by the legal challenges. His ventures continue to push the boundaries of technology, space, and now social media. Yet, these legal battles serve as a reminder that even the most visionary of entrepreneurs must navigate the regulatory landscapes and legal norms that govern corporate behavior.

AVAX, BCH prices rose 200% in 2023: Will 2024 see higher predictions? - AMBCrypto



BCH and AVAX were up by 75% and 45% in the last 30 days, respectively.
Indicators were bullish on BCH, but thighs might turn bearish for AVAX.

Layer 2 blockchains have gained much popularity in the recent past. However,  Layer 1 chains have also achieved a few milestones, especially Bitcoin Cash [BCH] and Avalanche [AVAX]. AMBCrypto took a look at how these coins are doing currently, considering the market condition. 
A look at Bitcoin Cash and Avalanche’s growth 
While the market remained somewhat volatile in the last few weeks, AVAX and BCH have been performing well comparatively. To be precise, as per a recent tweet from a popular crypto influencer, the two aforementioned coins registered nearly 200% growth during the last year in terms of price. 
According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin Cash was up by more than 75% in the last 30 days. At press time, the coin was trading at $462.81 with a market capitalization of over $9 billion. The good news was that the coin’s trading volume also surged by over 90%, acting as a foundation for the bull rally. 
On the other hand, AVAX was up by 45% in the last 30 days. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $54.65 with a market cap of over $30 billion, making it the 10th largest crypto.
Which way are they headed?
Since both tokens registered promising gains in the last year, AMBCrypto planned to have a look at their metrics to see which direction they are headed as we are about to exit the 1st quarter of 2024. 
An analysis of Santimet’s data revealed that both BCH and AVAX’s weighted sentiment remained in the positive zone. This clearly indicated that bullish sentiment around both tokens was high. 
Source: Santiment
Though sentiments indicated that a further uptrend is possible, AMBCrypto checked both tokens’ daily charts to see what market indicators had to suggest. 
As per our analysis, BCH’s MACD displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover. Its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a sharp uptick, hinting at a bull rally.

Read Avalanche’s [AVAX] Price Prediction 2024-25

However, the situation for AVAX was a bit more complicated. For instance, the MACD displayed a bearish crossover. The token’s price had touched the upper limit of the Bollinger bands and bounced back from there.
 Additionally, Avalanche’s CMF also went sideways. All these metrics suggest that the possibility of AVAX losing its gaining spree is high during the upcoming few days.

Billionaire Investor Anthony Scaramucci Made a Statement About Bitcoin: "Demand Will Grow A Lot" - Bitcoin Sistemi

As part of Bitcoin Investor Day, billionaire Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, shared his views on the future of demand for Bitcoin and predicted a significant increase in the next decade.
Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Scaramucci cited several factors that contributed to this prediction.


The event, which includes individual investors and important corporate participants, aims to make Bitcoin accessible to a wider audience. Scaramucci stated that the change in Bitcoin demand dynamics, especially with the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC and the halving event planned to be held at the end of April, has turned from an individual boom to corporate comfort.
The halving event, scheduled for around the 20th or 22nd of April, will effectively halve the daily supply of new Bitcoin entering the market and could potentially lead to a surge in prices. Scaramucci emphasized the potential impact of this event on market dynamics and said he foresees a significant increase in demand.





However, Scaramucci also acknowledged the unpredictability of market movements, citing the unexpected halving of Grayscale's BTC holdings two months after the Bitcoin ETFs were approved. He attributed this phenomenon to factors such as bankruptcy trustees flooding the market with GBTC and retail investors seeking lower fees from ETF products.

Discussing the broader economic landscape, Scaramucci cited Galaxy Digital's Mike Novogratz's views on the upcoming wealth transfer, saying the $84 trillion owned by U.S. baby boomers is expected to pass on to younger generations. He likened Bitcoin adoption to technological trends, suggesting that younger demographic groups are more inclined to adopt digital assets.


Scaramucci said he was bullish on the future of Bitcoin, citing $1 million Bitcoin predictions from names like Michael Novogratz and Cathie Wood. Scaramucci believes that even if Bitcoin does not reach such astronomical levels, it can establish itself as a digital gold standard.
As the conversation shifted to Bitcoin's role in political discourse, Scaramucci suggested that both political parties in the US may need to embrace cryptocurrencies to avoid offending the millions of voters who own Bitcoin.

Bitcoin ETFs End Week in Net Outflows Amid BTC Pullback - DailyCoin


        
Bitcoin ETFs mark its longest streak of net outflows. 



BlackRock and Fidelity feel the sting of record-low inflows. 



Concerns of Bitcoin dropping more linger. 
Earlier this year, spot bitcoin ETFs set off a speculative frenzy, attracting billions of dollars into the investment vehicle and setting new records every week since its approval on January 10.This mania helped propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $74,000 in March, flaring hopes of a sustained bull run. However, unlike in the recent past, traders appear less than thrilled as the market takes an unexpected nosedive, with Bitcoin dropping to $60,800. As the reigning crypto king struggles with price action, uncertainty ripples through the ETF market, signaling a concerning trend.Bitcoin ETFs’ Dismal WeekTen Bitcoin ETFs wrapped up the trading week with a worrying exit, witnessing outflows exceeding a whopping $800 million. The spotlight of this capital exodus shone brightest on Monday, March 18, as Grayscale’s GBTC saw a record-breaking tidal wave of outflows, setting the tone for the week. This five-day spree of outflows marks the longest seen thus far, beating a four-day streak from January of this year. In lockstep with Bitcoin’s uphill battle to reclaim its previous all-time high and showcase strength, the strong outflows were matched by weak inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT, which commands nearly half the market, first saw a historic low in inflows on Wednesday, March 20, recording $49.3 million. However, outflows plummeted further on Friday to a paltry $19 million in new capital.Fidelity’s FBTC, the third-largest spot bitcoin ETF, also felt the sting of record-low inflows this week, securing only $2.9 million on Thursday, March 21. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas highlights that while the strong outflows correspond with Bitcoin’s underwhelming performance, Genesis’ proposed sale of $1.3 billion GBTC shares is also a culprit.Still, despite the ETFs bleeding out funds, trading volumes remained unwavering, clocking in at $164 billion in the past week. Bitcoin Concerns LingerExperts have brushed off Bitcoin’s current struggles as another correction, pointing to historical patterns. Data suggests that BTC typically retraces by at least 20% over two weeks whenever it hits a new all-time high.While the FOMC’s dovish outlook has provided some reprieve, leading to Bitcoin retracing significantly from its local bottom and trading at $65,000 at press time, concerns about revisiting liquidity below $60,000 linger.Market retracements require time to mature fully, spanning anywhere from two weeks to two months. Yet Bitcoin’s recent tumultuous journey lasted just a week.Should Bitcoin maintain its rally in the weeks leading up to the halving slated between April 12 and 16, concerns of approaching $58,000 can take a break. However, should it falter, the liquidity at the level is likely to be swept.On the Flipside
It is unreasonable to expect BTC ETFs to record positive flows every day.



MicroStrategy and ETF issuers bought at least $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin as it approached $60,000. 



Historically, Bitcoin prices retrace 14-28 days before the halving. With 25 days left until the halving, likely, the event has already been priced in.
Why This MattersBitcoin ETFs ending a day with net outflows is not concerning; however, wrapping up a trading week can be worrisome. The outflows in the previous week provide a glimpse into how unpredictable markets can be and what investors should expect with deep pullbacks, as seen recently.Read the latest DailyCoin Regular:DailyCoin Cardano Regular: USDM Steals the Spotlight and ADA’s Rocky RecoveryThere’s a new king in town: Chainlink Dethrones Cardano as Leading Dev Platform

Polygon zkEVM down due to issues with blockchain sequencer

Ethereum scaling protocol Polygon has announced that its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) is currently experiencing downtime due to an issue with its blockchain sequencer.In a post on X, Polygon reassured its two million followers that the issue is confined to the zkEVM specifically and does not impact any other chain deployed using the Polygon chain development kit (CDK).“This only impacts Polygon zkEVM (which is the only rollup) and does not impact Polygon PoS, Polygon CDK, or any chain that has deployed using Polygon CDK.”Polygon clarified that the problem comes from the blockchain sequencer, which is responsible for organizing and combining transactions into batches before relaying them to the Polygon zkEVM smart contract on Ethereum's main network.The blockchain platform emphasized it is working on fully resolving the issue and has promised to release a comprehensive "post-mortem" statement once the matter is resolved.Polygon posted on X regarding the zkEVM downtime.Several X users were speculating over why the crypto community has remained silent regarding the unexpected prolonged network downtime.A user on X, 0xngmi, asked his 101,900 followers “why is nobody talking about how Polygon zkevm has been down for 10h and is still down?”While another user who goes by the username Mirza.inj, highlighted to his 14,800 followers why "Polygon zkEVM was down for over 10 hours and no one said anything."Related: Immutable, Polygon’s new $100M fund to throw cash at Pixelmon, among othersThis comes only a month after the Solana network experienced a significant outage.On Feb. 6, Cointelegraph reported that block production on the Solana network halted for over five hours before validators restarted the network. Since January 2022, Solana has seen around half a dozen significant outages.In March 2023, Polygon launched the zkEVM to its mainnet beta in an effort to allow developers to deploy smart contracts with increased finality and lower costs.After it was released, Cointelegraph reported that it mimics the transaction execution environment of Ethereum’s mainnet. Polygon claimed that the open-source zkEVM allows decentralized applications (DApps) to scale through transaction batching, unlocking higher performance.Magazine: Slumdog billionaire 2: ‘Top 10… brings no satisfaction’ says Polygon’s Sandeep Nailwal

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Predictions: Is The Bull Run About to Continue?


																TL;DR

Shiba Inu analysts remain optimistic that future peaks are just around the corner.
A possible ascent might be fueled by the asset’s burning program and developments in the Shibarium network.


After a few weeks of trading on the downside, Shiba Inu’s price finally headed north this week, increasing by some 9% in that period.
Numerous analysts are forecasting significant rallies in the near future.
The crypto investor and trader, using the X handle SHIB KNIGHT, examined Shiba Inu’s weekly performance and claimed the token had surpassed an important resistance level. 




The analyst believes people have been accumulating SHIB lately, envisioning new peaks for the valuation should they continue buying at the same pace. 
Earlier this month, Xanrox – an analyst on TradingView – predicted that Shiba Inu would “definitely” take off later this year. 
“Right now, we need to catch the bounce and ride the next wave to the upside. The 0.618 FIB retracement seems to be a great level to buy Shiba Inu, which is at 0.00002249,” they added.
The X users JAVON MARKS and Ali also gave their two cents. The former forecasted a triple-digit price increase based on the “massive strength” that SHIB has shown earlier this year. Ali was less bullish, suggesting a 40% surge is more likely.
Two essential factors that could positively impact the meme coin’s value are the successful execution of the burning program and the further advancement of the layer-2 blockchain solution Shibarium. 
As CryptoPotato reported, the burn rate exploded by 500% on March 21, while total transactions on Shibarium crossed the 400 million mark.

Avalanche Co-founder Emin Gün Sirer Warns Of Risky L2 Projects - Details


								Co-founder of Avalanche blockchain, Emin Gün Sirer, has raised an alert on the infiltration of certain layer-2 solutions, which poses risks to investors. In an X post on March 23, the Ava Labs boss expressed concerns over these “trash” projects while educating users on several of their common characteristics.



Red Flags To Watch For In L2 Projects – Avalanche Co-founder 
According to Gün Sirer, the rise in substandard L2 projects represents the next big hazard in the crypto ecosystem following the crypto exchange heist pulled off by former FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). The prominent crypto figure argued the procedures involved in launching an L2 solution were rather loose, allowing the influx of bad actors who created projects with no actual value. 
In the interest of promoting investor security, Emin Gün Sirer then proceeded to list several red flags that accompany these risky L2 solutions. Firstly, he stated that there is usually a discrepancy between the project’s narrative and technology, i.e., its marketing pitch does not align with its technical implementation. 
Examples of such projects are those with centralized sequencers without fraud-proof, which is against the cryptocurrency principles of decentralization and security. Emin Gün Sirer also highlighted L2 solutions that conduct token sales to raise funds rather than for a specific, practical purpose on the network, indicating it was likely to be a dubious investment. 
Furthermore, the Avalanche co-founder also spoke about L2 projects in which founders sold their personal native tokens before the launch. Regardless of the motive, Gün Sirer characterized a large volume of native token sales pre-launch as a massive red flag. 
Another point the crypto figure highlighted was projects with low-float tokens which allow for artificial inflation of the token’s value through manipulation tactics as commonly done by SBF. Finally, Gün Sirer advised investors to pay attention to project founders’ morals and habits and screening for any form of personal misconduct.

The Simple Authenticity Test By Emin Gün Sirer
In addition to the red flags mentioned above, Emin Gün Sirer also proposed a simple test that could help investors in screening through the masses of L2 projects being launched daily for authentic, profitable ventures. 
Firstly, the Ava Labs founder suggested identifying the main issues – known as “blockers” – in the crypto space at any time. He stated that, for example, issues such as scalability and performance were quite significant until blockchains such as Avalanche and Solana emerged with solutions. 
Emin Gün Sirer believes that supporting multiple use cases on the same platform as well as integration with traditional finance (TradFi) are currently critical issues facing the crypto ecosystem. Before investing in an L2 solution, the Avalanche co-founder advises users to assess where the project offers a genuine solution to these challenges.

Bitcoin Halving 2024: Global Mining Impact: Opportunities and Risks | Cryptoglobe


                                
The next Bitcoin halving is estimated to occur around 20 April 2024. These halving events happen roughly every four years, but the exact date can vary slightly due to minor fluctuations in block creation times on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin halvings are incredibly significant because they directly impact the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation. When the next halving happens, the reward miners receive for successfully validating transactions and adding blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain will be cut in half from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This mechanism is hard-coded into Bitcoin to enforce its finite supply – only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist.



Halvings can potentially influence Bitcoin’s price due to increased scarcity. When new Bitcoins become harder to get, existing ones become proportionally more scarce. If demand for Bitcoin remains high or grows, this increased scarcity could lead to upward price pressure. Additionally, halvings help ensure the long-term security of the Bitcoin network by keeping the mining process profitable. This continued incentive keeps miners dedicating their resources, maintaining Bitcoin’s security and integrity.



Bloomberg reported yesterday that as the next Bitcoin halving event approaches, thousands of older mining computers in the US are set to be decommissioned for resale and relocation overseas. SunnySide Digital, a Colorado-based wholesaler, is preparing its facility to refurbish and export these machines to locations where electricity costs are significantly lower. With electricity being the primary expense for miners, publicly-traded giants like Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) are under pressure to maximize efficiency for continued profitability. Older machines simply may not generate enough Bitcoin revenue to justify US operating costs. Taras Kulyk, CEO of SunnySide Digital, revealed they’ve sold machines to buyers in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Luxor Technology estimates that around 600,000 S19 series machines, a widely used model, are being relocated overseas.



As Forbes reported last month, on February 15, the Ethiopian Investment Holdings (EIH), the government’s investment arm, signed a $250 million agreement with Hong Kong-based West Data Group’s Center Service PLC. This partnership aims to establish state-of-the-art infrastructure dedicated to Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence. This landmark deal, as noted by Kal Kassa, CEO for Ethiopia at Hashlabs Mining, aligns with Ethiopia’s broader strategy to stimulate economic development through technology and attract foreign investment. With the African data center market projected to reach $5.4 billion by 2027 (according to Aritzon Advisory and Intelligence), Ethiopia is positioning itself for significant leadership in this sector.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Miners who choose to export their older machines often do so due to the allure of drastically lower energy prices, Bloomberg explains. This potential cost reduction becomes even more critical in the face of Bitcoin’s halving, which could make it unprofitable to operate less efficient machines in the US. Luxor Technology’s Ethan Vera believes buyers are strategically looking for the cheapest electricity possible.



Bloomberg notes that not all US-based miners sell their older machines. Some, like Nuo Xu, choose to physically relocate to areas with lower costs. Xu intends to explore options in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and other countries, hoping to cut operating expenses, including labor and building materials. Jaran Mellerud, CEO of Hashlabs Mining, echoes this sentiment, highlighting Ethiopia’s competitive hosting fees and increasing appeal to miners due to relaxed regulations.



Bloomberg acknowledges potential risks for US miners operating overseas, including machine damage during transport, security concerns, and the complexities of international logistics. Publicly traded companies also face stricter scrutiny from shareholders, making relocation more complex. Sam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital Inc., exemplifies this by revealing their practice of keeping older machines in storage in case high Bitcoin prices make them temporarily profitable again.



Despite hurdles, the pre-halving upgrade cycle is in full swing. Bloomberg highlights that Bitcoin miners have been preparing for years. The 13 largest public mining companies have apparently invested over $1 billion in new machines since February 2023.

Macro Expert Luke Gromen Says He’s ‘Super’ Bullish on Bitcoin for Next Six to 12 Months - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								Veteran investor Luke Gromen says he sees Bitcoin (BTC) rising over the coming months on the back of a favorable macroeconomic backdrop.
In a new interview with crypto journalist Natalie Brunell, Gromen highlights the US government’s nearly $35 trillion debt.










With the national debt sitting at record-high levels, the macro expert says there’s nothing the Fed can do to stop the resurgence of inflation, which will ultimately drive investors to seek shelter in store-of-value assets like Bitcoin to preserve their wealth.
“I’m super bullish Bitcoin for the next six to 12 months at least, tactically and strategically because whether the Fed hikes or whether the Fed cuts, doesn’t matter. In my opinion, inflation and fiscal deficits are going higher. 
The only way that it doesn’t happen is if the dollar is weakened. Then, fiscal deficits will actually trend lower.  
So my choices are: higher rates [and] more inflation, lower rates [and] more inflation or deficits down with a weaker dollar [means] more inflation [and] more debasement.
I think it sets up really, really well for Bitcoin and critically the fundamentals are there, but when you look at positioning, there’s still a lot of skepticism on Bitcoin, and there’s still $6 trillion-plus sitting in money market funds. There’s still a lot of concern, there’s still a lot of belief that the Fed’s, ‘Oh inflation is picking back up, the Fed is going to come in and smack inflation back down.’ 
No, no, no, no, no. They can try and you could get a pullback… If we go from the Fed going to cut twice this year to the Fed’s going to hike this year, you probably going to get a sell-off in Bitcoin and industrial stocks, stocks, maybe even gold… for like a week or two. 
And then there’s going to be this recognition of, ‘Oh god the Treasury market is dysfunctioning, we can’t have that.’ So that’s going to start the discussion and ultimately 6% rates are going to be more inflationary on a lag than 5.25% because there’s $35 trillion in debt and it’s rising as a percent of GDP now and Fed rate hikes will make it rise faster as a percent of GDP. 
So I’m super bullish Bitcoin because I’ve got fundamentals: they hike, it’s inflation; they don’t hike, it’s inflationary; they don’t hike, it’s inflationary; they cut, it’s inflationary. 
If they want to keep the wheels on the cart, they’ve got to weaken the dollar or continue to weaken the dollar. All of which is good for Bitcoin.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $64,637.

Incoming MATIC Surge: Analyst Predicts $15 Price Target


                            Digital asset analyst with X handle Crypto Patel has recently shared a bullish prediction on MATIC price movement in the coming weeks. This forecast comes amidst MATIC’s poor performance in the last seven days, during which it lost 6.68% of its market value, based on data from CoinMarketCap. 
The Polygon native token had been one of the best-performing assets in 2024 rising by over 76.38% between January to March. However, the altcoin has now recorded a 22.83% decline over the last two weeks, drawing much concern over its future price movement. 

$1.20 Price Level Critical For MATIC Price Surge, Analyst Says
In a post on X on March 23, Crypto Patel presented a bullish case for MATIC despite the token’s current downtrend, naming the forecast the “MATIC BULL RUN ROADMAP.”
Firstly, the analyst stated that a MATIC bullish pennant was being formed. For context, the bullish pennant represents a price pattern that typically follows a string of upward movement in price (the flagpole) followed by a period of consolidation (pennant).

A bullish pennant is characterized by converging trendlines, which indicates the continuation of the previous uptrend once the price breaks out of consolidation. Importantly, Crypto Patel emphasized that MATIC’s bullish pennant was being formed on a higher time frame (HTF), such as the weekly chart. 
Following historical trends, the complete formation of the bullish pennant could result in Polygon native asset experiencing a 100x price increase in the highly anticipated crypto bull run, as observed in 2021.
However, with a focus on short-term targets, Crypto Patel has stated that MATIC reaching the $1.20 price zone on the HTF could trigger a surge to a range of $10-$15, representing a potential 1500% gain on the asset’s current price.  Albeit, in the advent of an unexpected crash, the crypto analyst expects MATIC could be significantly affected but should find support around the $0.60-$0.70 price zone. 

MATIC Price Overview
At the time of writing, MATIC trades around $0.9817 with a 1.30% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume has declined by 31.82% and is valued at $291.65 million. With a market cap value of $9.7 billion, MATIC is ranked the 16th largest cryptocurrency and one of the world’s most prominent digital assets.

Bitcoin ETF Buzz In UK: Kraken Executive Pushes For Market Access


								The simmering debate over Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the UK has reignited, with industry leaders calling for wider access for investors. This comes on the heels of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Bitcoin ETFs in January, sparking a surge in investment and renewed calls for a similar move by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

UK’s Bitcoin ETF Advocacy
Bivu Das, Managing Director of Kraken UK, believes Bitcoin ETFs offer a “basic fundamental” for establishing the UK as a true crypto hub. These instruments allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself, potentially offering a more regulated and accessible entry point.


However, the FCA remains cautious. In 2021, they banned the retail sale of crypto-derivative products, including exchange-traded products (ETPs) backed by cryptocurrencies. This stance, some argue, puts the UK at a disadvantage compared to the US, where retail investors can readily invest in Bitcoin ETFs.
Das contends that the regulatory landscape has evolved since the 2021 ban. He believes ETFs could even alleviate some regulatory concerns, as investors wouldn’t directly hold the underlying Bitcoin. This could potentially pave the way for a more open approach from the FCA.

Bitcoin is now trading at $64.196. Chart: TradingView
There are signs the FCA might be inching towards a more accommodating stance. They recently approved the launch of crypto ETNs, but only for institutional investors. This move, while limited, could be seen as a cautious step towards wider crypto investment opportunities.
While the regulatory body remains cautious, warning of potential risks for retail investors in the volatile crypto market, the FCA’s recent actions suggest a willingness to explore the space further.

Expanding UK’s Investment Options
Coinbase UK CEO, Daniel Seifert, echoes Das’ sentiment. He believes “consumers have more options” with a wider range of investment products like ETFs. This push for increased investor choice aligns with a broader trend towards democratizing access to financial markets.
However, the FCA faces a delicate balancing act. While fostering innovation in the crypto sector is crucial for maintaining the UK’s financial competitiveness, protecting retail investors from potential harm remains a top priority. The high volatility of the crypto market raises concerns about the suitability of such complex instruments for inexperienced investors.
The recent influx of billions into US Bitcoin ETFs highlights the growing investor appetite for these products. This surge in demand could put further pressure on the FCA to revisit its stance. The potential benefits of increased investment and a more robust crypto ecosystem could outweigh the perceived risks, eventually leading to a more open regulatory environment.
The future of Bitcoin ETFs in the UK remains uncertain. The FCA is likely to take a measured approach, carefully evaluating the potential benefits and risks before making any significant changes. However, the growing global acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs, coupled with increasing investor demand, suggests that a more open approach from the FCA might be inevitable.

Dormant BTC Wallets Making Historic Moves; Will This Impact Bitcoin Price?

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently witnessed its largest surge in dormant tokens being traded in over two years. This significant uptick in activity involves Bitcoin tokens that have not been moved for an extended period suddenly changing hands, which analysts believe could soon be a precursor to increased price volatility.Crypto analyst Ali pointed out in a new tweet that Bitcoin has just witnessed its biggest surge in dormant BTC tokens changing hands in more than two years. Historically, such movements have been associated with large holders or "whales," who hold large amounts of Bitcoin and can influence market dynamics due to the size of their transactions.The surge in dormant BTC tokens changing hands might significantly affect Bitcoin's price. Historically, increased activity among dormant tokens has often preceded periods of heightened price volatility in cryptocurrency markets.According to Ali, the increased surge in dormant BTC tokens being traded might signal a potential increase in price volatility ahead. The rationale is that large, sudden transactions can lead to a domino effect, impacting the supply-demand equilibrium and, consequently, the price.In a separate tweet, Ali reported that over 25,000 Bitcoins, worth about $1.60 billion, were moved to accumulation addresses, the greatest influx to these BTC wallets this year and indicating increased whale activity.Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a low of $60,771 in the last week and is now trading at $64,809, with market observers expecting further volatility in the short term. Bitcoin has increased by roughly 128% year on year, while it is down 12.2% from its all-time high of $73,798 set on March 14.According to Ali, critical Bitcoin support levels to watch include $61,100, $56,685 and $51,530. On the other hand, significant resistance points for BTC are $66,990 and $72,880.

Gold Won’t Keep Up With Crypto's Expected 2-3X of Market Cap in Coming Years, According to Analyst Jamie Coutts - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto analyst Jamie Coutts says that gold will vastly underperform digital assets in the current market cycle.
Coutts says on the social media platform X that while he’s bullish on gold, he expects crypto to dramatically outshine the precious metal as markets make way for a “birth of the new asset class.”










“AUM (assets under management) for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) approximately $100 billion (80% Bitcoin). 
AUM for Gold ETPs approximately $190 billion.
I am bullish on gold, but it won’t match the expected 2-3x that crypto should do this cycle.
This is the birth of the new asset class.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
Coutts compares Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto now to the stock market boom of the early 1980s. According to the analyst, millennials will likely be able to outperform inflation with crypto the same way that the baby boomers did with their equities investments over the last 40 years.
“2009 is to Millennials what 1982 is to Boomers.
The great secular bull market in equities started as boomers fully entered the workforce.
The great secular bull market in Bitcoin (and blockchain assets in general) launched as millennials entered the workforce at a time when governments and the boomer generation they represented decided to punish all subsequent generations for their own sins. 
No one was punished for the GFC (Great Financial Crisis) – bonuses were honored – and the regulatory capture by industry (too big to fail banks, big food, big pharma, and big tech) only worsened. The government has decided that the path forward is more debt and debasement than curtailment and honesty.
Bitcoin is the antidote, custom-built for the era of debasement and debt – a new form of hard money synthesized with technology, a financial network that was finally fair and transparent. Furthermore, it is an asset that one can self-custody away from the banks and governments that will confiscate as and when the need arises – as they have done throughout history and are doing today via inflation.”

                        Emin Gün Sirer, the co-founder of Avalanche blockchain, has sounded the alarm on deceptive trends infiltrating certain layer-2 (L2) solutions, posing risks to investors. In a recent post on X, Sirer expressed concerns about these “trash” projects while educating users about their common characteristics and red flags.Sirer believes that the rise of substandard L2 projects represents the next significant hazard in the crypto ecosystem, following the infamous crypto exchange heist orchestrated by former FTX founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). “Trash” L2 Projects Flood the Market
The renowned crypto figure argues that the launch procedures for L2 solutions are relatively lax, allowing bad actors to create projects with little to no value.To safeguard investor security, Sirer outlined several warning signs associated with these risky L2 solutions. Firstly, he noted a discrepancy between the project’s narrative and its underlying technology, indicating a misalignment between marketing claims and technical implementation. For instance, projects with centralized sequencers and no fraud-proof mechanisms contradict the core principles of decentralization and security in the cryptocurrency realm.Sirer also highlighted L2 solutions that conduct token sales primarily for fundraising purposes, rather than having a specific, practical use on the network. Such projects raise suspicions of dubious investments. Moreover, Sirer cautioned against L2 projects in which founders sell their personal native tokens before the project’s launch, considering it a significant red flag.Issue of Low-Float Tokens within L2s
Another concern raised by Sirer is the prevalence of low-float tokens within projects, which can artificially inflate token values through manipulative tactics, similar to those employed by SBF. Lastly, Sirer advised investors to pay attention to the moral conduct and habits of project founders, as any signs of personal misconduct should be considered during the evaluation process.In addition to the mentioned red flags, Sirer proposed a simple test to help investors navigate the vast number of L2 projects being launched daily and identify authentic and profitable ventures. He suggested identifying the main issues, or “blockers,” in the crypto space at any given time. For example, scalability and performance were significant concerns until solutions emerged from blockchains like Avalanche and Solana.Sirer believes that supporting multiple use cases on the same platform and integrating with traditional finance (TradFi) are currently critical challenges facing the crypto ecosystem. Before investing in an L2 solution, Sirer advises users to assess whether the project genuinely addresses these challenges.Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem has experienced substantial expansion over the past year and a half, with a total value locked (TVL) surpassing $27 billion. In October 2023, transaction activity on Layer 2 networks exceeded that of the Ethereum mainnet, with these networks now routinely processing five times as many transactions, according to L2beat.As reported, Ethereum-based layer 2 network Arbitrum now has a market share of 49.17% among layer 2 networks, far surpassing number two on the list, Optimism Mainnet, with its 28.85% market share.The network has also seen a consistent increase in its TVL at least since October last year, rising about 50% from $1.66 billion in October to the current value of $2.51 billion, data from DeFi tracking site DefiLlama showed.

Design Studio TRAME is Creating ‘Generative Craft’ With AI - Decrypt

Generative AI art is “the contemporary movement of our time,” says Ismail Tazisaoud, founder of design studio TRAME. But while artificial intelligence is a cutting-edge technology, TRAME aims to marry it with the human touch of traditional craftsmanship, Tazisaoud told Decrypt's SCENE.The studio’s work was recently on display in Paris, where an apartment in the exclusive Place des Vosges was given over to its "Generative Interiors" concept, showcasing work that brought together traditional crafts with digital design.“We wanted to put this art in the context of an interior, in order to enable people to see these pieces inside their homes immediately,” said Tazisaoud.The studio’s “vision for the future of interior design” presented work from its Craft Nouveau collections, including designers Martin Grasser, Jeff Davis, Alexis André, and Aranda\Lasch in its Gallery Space. All four create designs using generative art tools that are trained to produce outputs tailored to their traditional crafts practices, including cane weaving, stained glass, and physical looms."Generative Interiors" by TRAME. Image: TRAME“With what I call generative craft, we start from the physical,” Tazisaoud said. “We inform the code with the physical constraints of the craft.” That means that from the outset, artists are “expressing themselves physically and digitally,” he added. “They craft a code to be a tapestry, to be a sculpture, to be a mirror.”By imposing the physical limitations of traditional crafts onto generative AI tools, Tazisaoud explained, “You see each pushing the boundaries of the other.” The designer’s inputs generate millions of unique outputs, which they curate before hand-crafting the design into the finished product.Aranda Lasch x Maison L. Drucker. Image: TRAME“That's how you see the craftsmanship pushing the artists, pushing generative art into their practice and starting that conversation,” said Tazisaoud. “Once we generate the output, we know that it's going to work because the algorithm is informed by the physical constraints of the craft, and then we make the physical piece.”To realize their designs, the artists traveled to centers of craft; Alexis André worked with cane weavers who’ve been plying their trade in the French village of Aubusson for six centuries, while Jeff Davis collaborated with stained glass workshop Atelier Loire, who’ve restored windows in the Notre-Dame and Chartres cathedrals."Generative Interiors" by TRAME. Image: TRAME“Technology and craftsmanship is not a new conversation,” said Tazisaoud. “We’re just continuing it.”In the future, generative design will make the creation of collections made out of unique pieces “effortless,” he explained. “We’re getting a lot of interest from traditional design maisons d'édition,” Tazisaoud told Decrypt, explaining that generative AI will enable the design houses to produce 1,000 unique chairs for the same cost as it does to produce 1,000 identical ones now.Although TRAME’s offering is aimed at the niche luxury consumer, Tazisaoud believes that generative art will enable bespoke design to scale to the mass market. “As generative art breaks through, you’re going to see more and more initiatives,” he said. “It wouldn't surprise me if tomorrow IKEA offers a series of a million unique posters at 20 bucks from the same collection.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

However, with a strong six-month gain of 85.80%, the trend might reverse. Short-term, Polygon might struggle to break the $1.13 resistance and may retreat toward the $0.82 support. Investors could see this as a buying opportunity, anticipating potential growth if it moves past $1.13 and targets the $1.27 level. Optimism is risked by both the six-month rise and the past month’s 5.38% decrease, hinting at a possible balance finding in the price.Looking long-term, past performance with an 85.80% increase in six months suggests a robust foundation that could propel Polygon beyond current levels. The $0.92 simple moving average supporting a floor further bolsters confidence. However, should the price slide under $0.82, the next safety net stands at $0.63. Investors should weigh the recent pullback against the larger bullish trend. Long-term success will hinge on Polygon cementing its position above key averages and resistance points, factoring in both the potential for sustained growth and the risk of corrections that follow swift ascents.Jupiter’s Price Soars 39x in Six MonthsJupiter has shown remarkable movement in the last six months, multiplying its value by almost 39 times. Currently sitting at $1.18, it aligns closely with the 10-day average of $1.21, signaling stable recent performance. While the exponential growth in six months paints an exciting picture for those holding Jupiter, it also suggests a possibility of correction as assets rarely sustain such steep inclines without pullbacks. The current price above both resistance levels implies strong momentum on the upside, but it’s crucial to monitor whether Jupiter can hold these gains or will face resistance turning into new support.Looking ahead, the future of Jupiter possesses both potential risks and opportunities. Considering the historical one-month rise of over 134%, short-term traders might see an opportunity to capitalize on this momentum. Yet, the proximity of the current price to the second resistance suggests caution, as breakouts or downturns may happen swiftly. Long-term, if the trend follows past performance, those with patience could be rewarded. However, any growth must be underpinned by justified fundamentals; without them, the risk of a significant retracement to levels such as $0.42 or even $0.30 remains a possibility for Jupiter. As always, balance and vigilance are key.Avalanche’s Growth: Bull Trend Amid Pullback RiskAvalanche has shown strong growth in the past month with a 37.82% increase and an impressive 495.76% soar over six months, hinting at a solid bullish trend. Given the current price stands above its recent resistance levels, we could see further pushes upwards if it maintains the momentum. However, signals from MACD and the 10-day SMA suggest a potential pullback. The all-time high is well above current levels, indicating room for growth. If the pattern of growth persists, achieving new highs could be on the horizon.Despite the positive trend, the nearest support levels indicate that there might be a downside risk. If the price falls beneath $33.98 or even $26.97, this could signal a trend reversal or consolidation phase. The diverse recommendations from RSI, Stochastic RSI, and SMA’s paint a picture of uncertainty. Long-term prospects remain promising considering the 100-day SMA’s buy signal, but short-term volatility could lead to both possible gains for quick traders and risks for those not closely monitoring the market.ConclusionIn conclusion, while a handful of altcoins like Polygon, Jupiter, and Avalanche continue to intrigue the crypto community with their significant movements and market potential, they also come with inherent unpredictability. However, amongst these contenders, BlastUP stands out with the highest potential, bolstered by its promising concept and strategic position within the robust Blast ecosystem. With its community-centric approach and AI-integrated Web3 tools, BlastUP is not just tokenizing potential; it’s engineering a more predictable and dynamic future for DApp launches and crypto investments. Whether you’re longing for steady growth or dynamic innovation, BlastUP seems poised to offer the market a unique blend of both.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Nigerian crypto fee hike invitation for crypto ‘big boys’ - NoOnes CEO

Venture capitalists still see potential in Nigeria despite the suggested increased crypto registration fees. However, the services they can provide may struggle to gain momentum due to government restrictions on peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms aimed at curbing free market promotion, according to Ray Youssef, the CEO of NoOnes, a financial communication and P2P app.A recent report by Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed an amendment to the rules guiding platforms offering crypto services and suggested a hike in the registration fee for crypto exchanges from 30 million naira ($18,620) to 150 million naira ($93,000). Speaking with Cointelegraph, Youssef, who is the co-founder and former CEO of the shuttered P2P exchange Paxful, said the increase is an invitation for the crypto “big boys” like Coinbase and other major companies to operate in the Nigerian market. He emphasized that the government aims to restrict P2P services to address foreign exchange challenges, and exchanges willing to forgo P2P support can operate smoothly in Nigeria. However, this strategy conflicts with the Nigerian crypto market’s strong preference for P2P trading, posing a considerable obstacle for exchanges. However, Youssef remains optimistic about Nigeria’s chance of maintaining its position in the ecosystem despite the recent regulation challenges.Related: Nigerian court orders Binance to disclose all user dataYoussef said the government could use the abundance of P2P traders in Nigeria as an asset and treat crypto stakeholders as allies to understand how to use crypto to the advantage of the nation’s economy.Nigeria is currently the largest P2P crypto market in the world, which came about after the Central Bank of Nigeria banned institutions from buying and selling crypto in 2021. In December 2023, the Nigerian government lifted the 2021 crypto ban, enabling crypto exchanges to apply for licenses in Nigeria.Commenting on the recent partnership between Gluwa and the Nigerian government to improve the adoption of the nation’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the eNaira, Youssef said the government could have taken a different approach when introducing the CBDC by leveraging it to stimulate local economic growth, providing credit to aspiring entrepreneurs and encouraging the younger generation to embrace it.The Nigerian government has often been at odds with cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance ceased operations using the naira on March 8 after Nigerian government criticism of crypto exchanges singled it out in February. In August 2022, Nigeria was named the most crypto-obsessed country in the world by the number of Google searches for “cryptocurrency” or “buy crypto.”Magazine: Bitcoin hits new highs, SEC delays options decision, and stablecoin bill looms: Hodler’s Digest, March 3–9

Bitcoin Exhaustion in Grayscale Amidst Increasing BTC Transfers Coin Edition


							

Grayscale has reportedly moved 266,470 Bitcoins out of their wallets for GBTC redemptions since January 11.
According to Arkham Intelligence, GBTC’s BTC holdings will exhaust in 96 days at the current rate of redemptions.
Colin Wu states that Grayscale is considering lowering fees and launching mini ETFs.




In a recent turn of events, Arkham Intelligence has unveiled asset manager Grayscale’s astounding Bitcoin transfers since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs on January 11. Reportedly, Grayscale has moved a total of 266,470 Bitcoins out of their wallets for GBTC redemptions.













According to the surprising estimations of Arkham Intelligence, GBTC’s Bitcoin holdings will exhaust in 96 days at the current rate of redemptions. The platform added that the transfer of BTC marks a rate of 25.9K BTC per week.





Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu has recently drawn the readers’ attention to Arkham Intelligence’s insights on Grayscale’s Bitcoin transfer and the potential exhaustion of BTC holdings. On his official Wu Blockchain page on X, Wu asserted that Grayscale is considering “lowering fees and launching mini ETFs.”







Recently, Grayscale CEO Michale Sonnenshein assured that the platform’s Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Trust ETF, GBTC, would plummet in price over time. He stated, “I’ll happily confirm that, over time, as this market matures, the fees on GBTC will come down.” Further, he added,










We have seen this in countless other exposures, countless other markets, you name it, where typically when products are earlier in their lifecycle, when they’re new to be introduced, these [fees] tend to be higher. And, as those markets mature, and as those funds grow, those fees tend to come down, and we expect the same to be true of GBTC.” 




Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading at a price much lower than its new all-time high of $73,700. At press time, Bitcoin was priced at $64,367, marking a slight increase of 0.47% in the last 24 hours and 2.15% in 7 days. Despite the daily and weekly declines, Bitcoin experienced a monthly surge of 26.16%.

The true identity of the creator of Bitcoin: who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

In February 2024, 1,000 cryptocurrency enthusiasts were interviewed by Online Gaming Company in order to identify who Satoshi Nakamoto is, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin.
The survey, therefore, attempts to gather the opinion of the cryptographic community on the possible identity of the creator of Bitcoin. Let’s see all the details below. 

Who is Satoshi Nakamoto: the survey on the creator of Bitcoin 
As anticipated, Online Gaming Company conducted an in-depth survey among cryptocurrency enthusiasts to identify who the real Satoshi could be.
In February 2024, among 1000 participants, the goal was to gather public opinion on the alleged identity of the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. Let’s see the top ten candidates based on the survey results.
First place for Nick Szab. 40% of the participants believe that Nick Szabo is the likely Satoshi Nakamoto. His extensive work on digital contracts and the creation of “Bit Gold”, concepts similar to those of Bitcoin, make him a strong candidate according to the participants.
Then we have Hal Finney. 35% of the respondents indicated Hal Finney as a possible Satoshi. His involvement in the first Bitcoin transaction and his deep knowledge of cryptography make him a popular choice.
Still, Adam Back. With 12% of the votes, Adam Back is considered a possible Satoshi Nakamoto thanks to his creation of Hashcash, essential for the proof-of-work mechanism of Bitcoin.
With 6% of the vote, Wei Dai is seen as a potential Satoshi Nakamoto due to his creation of b-money, a precursor to Bitcoin. His early work on digital currency makes him an interesting candidate according to survey participants.
Len Sassaman, with 3% of the votes, emerges as a candidate among a more select group of survey participants. His close relationships with crypto experts and his focus on privacy are cited as points in his favor. 
Some participants also notice the coincidence between his disappearance and the end of Nakamoto’s communications.
Andersen, Mochizuki, Musk and not only among the possible candidates
Gavin Andersen instead ranked sixth with 1.5% of the votes, recognized for his initial contributions to the development of Bitcoin and for his direct interactions with Nakamoto.
Despite his claims under a pseudonym, only 1% of participants believe that Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto. His credibility is being questioned by ongoing debates and the lack of concrete evidence.
Less discussed as a possible Satoshi, Shinichi Mochizuki receives only 0.5% of the votes, mainly due to his limited computer science background and lack of ties to cypherpunk culture.
Elon Musk, instead, with 0.5% of the votes, ranks ninth. While recognizing his genius, participants underline the weakness of his ties to the early days of Bitcoin.
Finally, with only 0.4% of the votes, Dorian Nakamoto closes the list, reflecting the lack of confidence in his alleged ties to Bitcoin.
Regarding this, a spokesperson for the Online Gaming Company stated the following: 
“Curiosity about the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto grows every time the price of Bitcoin increases, especially considering Nakamoto’s alleged possession of over a million Bitcoins. His substantial wealth not only indicates extraordinary wealth, but also highlights his power over the Bitcoin market. With approximately 5% of all Bitcoins in circulation, even small changes in his wallet could influence the entire market. Knowing who Nakamoto is could provide important insights into understanding Bitcoin movements.”
The denial of Craig Wright’s claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto
As mentioned above, recently a British judge issued a ruling denying that Dr. Craig Wright is the pseudonym of Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.
Wright claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin and tried to obtain the copyright on the Bitcoin whitepaper, but his claims were rejected by judge James Mellor.
The cryptocurrency community has greeted Wright’s claims with skepticism, as he has been involved in a legal battle with the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) and a group of Bitcoin Core developers since 2021.
The COPA, with the support of former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, accused Wright of fraud and extortion.
The process, which has recently concluded in a British court, confirmed that Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin whitepaper, nor has he operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
Judge Mellor clearly stated that Wright is not the creator of the Bitcoin system nor the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.
Before the trial, Wright had proposed a resolution of the intellectual property case with COPA, but the organization publicly rejected his offer.

Stake.com: the pioneer of Crypto Casinos

In a world where cryptocurrencies have captured an increasingly large share of financial attention, the emergence of online gambling platforms (Casinos) like Stake.com that exclusively use these currencies was only a matter of time. 

The world of crypto casinos with Stake.com
Among these, Stake.com stands out as a true pioneer in the industry, offering bettors an unprecedented experience that combines the allure of gambling with cryptocurrency technology.
Founded in 2017 and based in Curacao, Stake.com is more than just an online casino. It defines itself as a “crypto casino leader”, allowing its users to bet on a wide range of sports events and gambling games using Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) and even fiat currencies like the US dollar.
However, its history is not without controversy. The company has faced some legal issues in the past, although yesterday’s violation seems to be the first we have heard of. These episodes naturally raise doubts about its reliability and security.
Crypto casinos and the difference with Stake.com
In a landscape where privacy and anonymity have become increasingly important, crypto casinos like Stake.com have gained popularity thanks to the possibility of betting anonymously and without the need to provide personal information through KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. 
This aspect has attracted numerous bettors who wish to keep their identity hidden and protect their privacy online.
However, it is important to emphasize that Stake.com is one of the crypto casinos that applies strict restrictions and policies. 
It is not accessible from all parts of the world and in some cases requires KYC procedures, including user identity verification and fund origin verification. 
Furthermore, the platform closely follows AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and ATF (Anti-Terrorist Financing) policies, demonstrating a commitment to combat illegal activities and ensure a safe and regulated gaming environment.
It is important to note that, although anonymity is an appealing aspect for many users, it is not the only reason why people choose to use Stake.com. 
Many bettors may be attracted by the possibility of using their cryptocurrencies to bet, taking advantage of the growth potential and convenience of digital currencies.
The security of such platforms
The security of online gambling platforms, especially those using cryptocurrencies like Stake.com, is a fundamental concern for users.
These platforms implement a series of measures to ensure the protection of users’ funds and the security of transactions.
Among the main security measures adopted is the use of advanced encryption to protect users’ sensitive data and financial transactions.
In addition, many platforms implement two-factor authentication (2FA) systems to ensure that only authorized users can access their accounts.
Segregation of funds is another common practice, which ensures that user funds are separated from company funds, reducing the risk of losses in case of unexpected events.
Finally, online gambling platforms often subject their systems to regular security tests and collaborate with independent certification organizations to ensure compliance with security and regulatory standards.
Despite these measures, it is always advisable for users to adopt rigorous cybersecurity practices, such as using complex passwords and regularly updating software, to best protect their accounts and funds.
Conclusions
In conclusion, Stake.com represents an innovative breakthrough in the world of online gambling, combining the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies with a safe and regulated betting environment. 
Despite past controversies and current restrictions, the platform continues to attract a wide user base who appreciate the ability to bet anonymously and use their own cryptocurrencies to place bets.
However, it is essential to remember that gambling involves risks and it is important to bet responsibly.
Stake.com demonstrates a commitment to legality and safety, but it is the responsibility of users to be aware of their own limits and make informed decisions.
With a keen eye on AML and ATF policies and a constant focus on the evolution of the sector, Stake.com continues to be a point of reference for those seeking an innovative and engaging online gambling experience.

Does the Bitcoin halving impact cross-chain interoperability solutions?

                            What is Bitcoin halving, and how is it related to cross-chain interoperability?                                        The Bitcoin protocol reduces the supply of new Bitcoin by 50% via the quadrennial Bitcoin halving. This translates into a 50% reduction in revenue (in BTC terms) for Bitcoin miners and poses indirect implications for cross-chain interoperability. Bitcoin halving events, occurring approximately every four years, reduce block rewards for Bitcoin miners. The halving process is hard-coded into the Bitcoin protocol by its elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, as is the finite supply of 21 million Bitcoin (BTC).The last three halvings occurred in 2012, 2016 and 2020. The first Bitcoin halving in 2012 reduced the reward for mining a block from 50 to 25 BTC. The next Bitcoin halving impact is expected to occur in April 2024, and the halving cycles will continue till 2140, when the last Bitcoin will be mined.Cross-chain interoperability refers to the capability of different blockchain networks to seamlessly share information and value. It allows users and assets to move fluidly, fostering blockchain convergence with a more integrated and efficient financial ecosystem. In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin is celebrated for its impact on scarcity and value and stands as a behemoth commanding unparalleled market dominance. However, with its proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism and intrinsic design as a highly non-interoperable chain, the Bitcoin blockchain is disconnected from cross-chain synergy discussions. Bitcoin’s prominence and market dominance still make it relevant to consider in discussions about interoperability, albeit more indirectly.                                                                     Bitcoin halving’s impact on network congestion and transaction fees                                        With reduced mining rewards, miners may compete more aggressively to validate transactions, which can lead to network congestion.The Bitcoin halving is designed to control the issuance of new Bitcoin and maintain the scarcity that underpins its value. A notable consequence of this event lies in its impact on network congestion and transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain. Following a halving event, where block rewards decrease, miners may need to adapt their strategies to maintain profitability. As miners become more selective about transactions in blocks, users offering higher fees gain priority, contributing to a competitive environment. The overall decrease in block rewards, coupled with heightened user activity often observed during halving events, leads to a surge in the number of transactions, intensifying network congestion. This surge, combined with the market-driven response to increasing transaction fees at times of high demand can prompt users to consider alternative blockchains that might offer advantages like lower fees, quicker transactions or better cross-chain compatibility. This trend, while challenging to measure accurately, reflects the dynamic and evolving nature of the cryptocurrency sector.Bitcoin halving events trigger a chain reaction influencing network congestion and transaction fees. Reducing block rewards, changing miner behavior, and increasing user activity creates an environment where transaction fees become more competitive.                                                                     Investors seeking alternatives amid Bitcoin’s decreasing issuance rate                                        As BTC’s issuance rate decreases, investors look for alternative options on other blockchains.Bitcoin halving periods prompt reevaluating the risk and reward dynamics for investors who traditionally viewed Bitcoin as a lucrative investment partly due to its deflationary nature. As the rate of new Bitcoin creation diminishes due to its halving events, its increasing scarcity reinforces its appeal as a “digital gold.”However, the investment dynamics within the cryptocurrency space are complex and multifaceted. Investors, in pursuing portfolio diversification and risk mitigation, often explore alternative blockchain projects offering different features, utility or potential returns.This quest for alternative options among investors necessitates enhanced cross-chain interoperability as investors seek to invest in diverse blockchain projects and fluidly move value and assets across these platforms. Interoperable multichain ecosystems also become crucial, enabling seamless transactions and interactions between different blockchains, thus broadening the scope for investment strategies and risk management.Cross-chain interoperability acts as the bridge, allowing the seamless movement of assets and value across disparate blockchains. As more capital flows into alternative blockchains, the demand for efficient, secure, user-friendly cross-chain interaction mechanisms grows. This, in turn, spurs innovation in the field, creating sophisticated multichain platforms and interoperability protocols that can accommodate a broad range of financial services and products.This interplay between Bitcoin’s issuance rate and investor behavior underscores the broader trend of decentralization and creates an environment for the maturation of the cryptocurrency market.                                                                    The significance of cross-chain interoperability solutions                                        Cross-chain interoperability solutions add a layer of significance to Bitcoin having periods by improving market efficiency and capital allocation.Cross-chain interoperability solutions are pivotal in transforming the cryptocurrency landscape by addressing fragmentation and enhancing liquidity across blockchains. The context of Bitcoin halving events adds a layer of significance to the role these solutions play in improving market efficiency. Cross-chain interoperability solutions may contribute to reducing arbitrage opportunities that arise due to price discrepancies between different blockchains. As assets seamlessly move across interconnected networks, the price differentials between the same asset on different chains narrow, fostering market efficiency. This is especially relevant during periods of heightened volatility, such as Bitcoin halving events, where price disparities can be more pronounced.Bitcoin halving events contribute to increased market volatility and crypto trading activity as investors react to the changing supply dynamics. During such periods, efficient capital allocation becomes crucial for optimizing returns and managing risks. Cross-chain interoperability solutions facilitate this process by enabling seamless movement of assets across various blockchains. Investors can swiftly reallocate their capital to capitalize on emerging opportunities or mitigate potential losses.Wrapped tokens, pegged to the value of assets on one blockchain, exemplify the impact of cross-chain interoperability on liquidity and market efficiency. For instance, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is an Ethereum-based token pegged to the value of Bitcoin. This token allows users to engage with Bitcoin’s value within the Ethereum ecosystem, unlocking opportunities for decentralized finance applications. Users can utilize their Bitcoin value in various financial instruments, such as lending, borrowing and trading, without directly interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain.The relationship between Bitcoin halving events, market volatility and cross-chain interoperability solutions is indirect yet intricate. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, interoperability becomes increasingly crucial, shaping a more interconnected and efficient financial future for blockchain networks and users.

Bitcoin (BTC) Short-Term Holders: Will They Defend $55,000?


An accelerating bull market usually correlates with an increasing influx of new investors. Short-term holders of Bitcoin (STH) – as the on-chain analysis calls them – join the market during the booming bull market. Driven by the desire for a quick profit, they don’t hold assets for long.
However, if Bitcoin price corrects, as in the case of last week’s price action, short-term holders quickly lose ground. Despite this, their behavior and presence in the market are crucial to maintaining a healthy bull market.
What Is the Significance of Bitcoin Short-Term Holders?
Observing the behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders is important because of historical correlations to the BTC price. The STH category includes addresses that hold their BTC for less than 155 days. After crossing this arbitrary limit, addresses become long-term hodlers (LTHs). They hold assets for the long term and are not inclined to sell emotionally.
Naturally, the increase in the percentage of BTC supply held by STHs is inversely proportional to the percentage in the hands of LTHs. Interestingly, the long-term chart of supply in the hands of LTH is also inversely proportional to the price of Bitcoin. This is especially evident during the peaks of successive cycles. The more Bitcoin is sold by long-term holders (red areas), the higher the BTC price is (green areas).

Therefore, the supply in the hands of STH is usually directly proportional to the price of BTC. New, inexperienced market participants buy BTC during increases (red arrows).

They are convinced that since the cryptocurrency has already surged, it will continue to do so (green areas). This fuels a growing circle of new investors and traders who still want to join the momentum of the bull market. Hence the importance of following what short-term holders are doing on-chain.

Short-Term Holders Account for Nearly 50% of BTC Realized Cap
In a recent article, analyst company CryptoQuant pointed out that nearly 50% of Bitcoin’s realized capitalization is in the hands of short-term holders. A particular increase in this indicator can be seen over the past 30 days when the enthusiasm and pace of STH purchases have surged.
Realized dominance of STH / Source: X

“This occurrence, alongside indicating a very high bullish sentiment among short-term holders, reflects a higher dominance of this capital amount in the market over the coming weeks and months.” – the on-chain analysts added.

However, on the other hand, another CryptoQuant analyst wrote that the pace of selling LTH-held assets does not yet suggest a late phase of the cycle. In other words, there is still a lot of potential in the current cycle for buying by STH and an increase in the price of BTC.


“However, we have not yet seen entry into this late stage of the cycle, although sporadic corrections are common, in part due to the highly leveraged nature of the current market,” he stated.

Key Support at $55,000
Finally, well-known cryptocurrency market analyst @PositiveCrypto published his perspective on STH’s behavior on X today. He presented a chart of the realized price of short-term holders.
He stressed that in the ongoing bull market, the curve has already provided support for the Bitcoin price three times (green areas). At the same time, he emphasized that one time the value of BTC dropped below this support, which resulted in a deeper correction in the market.

Realized price of short-term BTC holders / Source: X
The analyst then predicts that if Bitcoin’s ongoing correction were to again lead to the area of the realized STH price, Bitcoin would reach the area of $55,000. Measured from the current all-time high (ATH) of $73,777, this would be a drop of about 25%.
However, even such a deep correction would not disrupt the structure of the long-term bull market. Only the loss of this support and deeper declines could trigger a medium-term bear market, which could dominate the vicinity of the upcoming halving.

Bullish Pennant Formation Signals MATIC's Potential to Reach $15, Says Analyst

Amidst recent concerns over the price movement of MATIC, the native token of Polygon, digital asset analyst Crypto Patel has made a bold prediction, suggesting a potential surge to $15 in the coming weeks. Despite a 6.68% decline in the last seven days, MATIC has captured attention for its impressive performance earlier in the year, with a notable rise of 76.38% between January and March. As investors monitor the cryptocurrency’s trajectory, Patel’s forecast brings renewed optimism to the market.MATIC bull run roadmapAnalyst Crypto Patel’s  Bull Run Roadmap, the focus lies on the formation of a bullish pennant pattern on a higher time frame (HTF), particularly observed on the weekly chart. This pattern, known for its significance in technical analysis, typically emerges following a period of upward price movement, succeeded by consolidation. The bullish pennant is characterized by converging trendlines, a visual representation of market consolidation before a potential breakout.Drawing insights from historical trends, Patel highlights the remarkable performance during the 2021 bull run, where it experienced a staggering 100x increase in value following a breakout from a similar bullish flag pattern. This historical precedent serves as a foundation for Patel’s optimistic outlook on potential price appreciation.In the context of the current market scenario, Patel outlines specific price thresholds to watch. He suggests that if it manages to surpass the $1.20 level on the HTF, it could catalyze a surge towards the $10-$15 range. This projection underscores the potential for significant gains in the near term.MATIC short-term target analysisExpressing a bullish sentiment on Polygon (formerly MATIC) for the long run, Patel indicates confidence in the project’s fundamentals and growth prospects. However, he remains cognizant of the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.In the event of a market crash, Patel identifies the $0.60-$0.70 price zone as a favorable accumulation area for investors. This strategic insight underscores Patel’s proactive approach to risk management and capitalizing on market downturns.While considering long-term prospects, Patel also emphasizes a short-term target for MATIC. He asserts that the token’s ascent to the $1.20 price level on the HTF could catalyze a surge towards the $10-$15 range. This projection suggests a potential gain of up to 1500% from the current price. However, Patel remains vigilant, acknowledging the possibility of an unexpected market crash, which could impact MATIC’s trajectory. In such a scenario, he anticipates the token to find support around the $0.60-$0.70 price zone.MATIC’s current performance and future outlookAt the time of writing, MATIC is trading around $0.9817, marking a 1.30% gain in the last 24 hours. Despite this modest increase, the token’s daily trading volume has declined by 31.82%, standing at $291.65 million. With a market capitalization of $9.7 billion, MATIC holds the 16th position among the largest cryptocurrencies globally. Its performance shortly will likely be influenced by the realization or deviation from Patel’s forecast.Crypto Patel’s bullish prediction on MATIC’s price movement has sparked intrigue within the cryptocurrency community, offering a glimmer of hope amidst recent declines. With the formation of a bullish pennant pattern and the potential for significant short-term gains, investors are closely monitoring MATIC’s performance. However, uncertainties loom, particularly concerning the possibility of market volatility. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, only time will reveal the accuracy of Patel’s forecast and the ultimate trajectory of MATIC.

How Bitcoin Rally Is Impacting Crypto Hiring - Bloomberg Analysis | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent article for Bloomberg News, Olga Kharif reports a promising turnaround in the crypto job market. Kharif points out that after a prolonged downturn, companies like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and even traditional finance giants like Fidelity are actively hiring. This resurgence, she believes, is fueled by Bitcoin’s rally and renewed retail investor interest in the market.







Kraken’s Chief People Officer told Bloomberg:



“Kraken has successfully navigated several bull and bear markets while remaining prepared to scale around true inflection moments. The recent surge in crypto markets reinforces our existing thesis that 2024 is the right time to grow in order to meet the demand ahead of us.”



According to the article, job boards dedicated to the crypto sector paint a clear picture. CryptocurrencyJobs.co reports a substantial increase in job postings, and CryptoJobsList observes a near doubling compared to last year. Even more broadly, the Blockchain Association’s listings surpass 1,700, indicating growing industry demand for talent.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Bloomberg notes that while hiring hasn’t reached 2021’s peak, a steady upward trend since late 2023. Companies, mindful of past over-expansion, are apparently taking a more measured approach. Coinbase, for example, plans “modest” growth after navigating previous layoffs.



Bloomberg highlights that current growth is most visible in business development roles, a sign of expanding operations. Industry experts like Dan Spuller of the Blockchain Association predict continued hiring throughout 2024 and beyond, mirroring potential market strength.



While this resurgence is encouraging, Bloomberg acknowledges that overall crypto listings on platforms like Indeed and LinkedIn remain below pre-downturn levels. Kharif says that this, alongside the reported influx of applicants, creates a competitive landscape for job seekers.

How To Avoid Another SBF Experience In The Coming L2 Cycle - Aval Labs CEO - Coin Edition


							

Ava Labs CEO has highlighted the red flags to consider before investing in new L2 projects.
According to Sirer, ignoring these red flags could lead to an outcome similar to the FTX collapse.
Sirer explained crypto has just a few authentic blockers at a time and users should look out for them.




Emin Gun Sirer, CEO of Ava Labs, has highlighted the red flags users should consider before investing in new L2 projects in the upcoming cycle. According to Sirer, ignoring these red flags could lead to an outcome similar to what happened with Sam Bankman-Fried, whom many people followed based on superficial traits.







Sirer listed the red flags via a recent post on X, noting the absence of a narrative that matches the project tech as the first signal of unsustainability. For instance, he believes centralized sequencers and L2s that lack fraud proofs are unsustainable and are at odds with crypto.



The Ava Labs founder does not support projects that sell tokens now to raise money to do the work that will lead to another technology later. According to him, the third prong of the Howey Test qualifies such exercises as Security Offerings.



In continuation, Sirer compared founders who dump personal tokens pre-launch with Bankman-Fried. He believes their traits are similar, with potentially the same outcomes. He further noted that 8-figure sales pre-launch to “thank the staff” are about the same as Bankman-Fried stealing users’ money because he is an “effective altruist.”



Sirer thinks projects with low-float tokens are risky and unsustainable. He cited Bankman-Fried’s pattern of manipulating low-float token valuations and borrowing against them as an example users should learn from. Additionally, the blockchain expert advised users not to overlook founders’ behavioral patterns. For instance, “founders complaining that they are running out of cocaine” is a signal no one should take lightly.



The Ava Labs founder explained how crypto users can test new projects for authenticity. He noted crypto has just a few authentic blockers at a time. For instance, scalability and performance were the outstanding problems in the last cycle, and Avalanche and Solana provided two approaches to tackle them. 



Sirer believes the blockers for this cycle blockers have to do with supporting multiple use cases on the same platform and integrating with TradFi. He advised users to probe new projects to see if they bring something game-changing to address the significant issues facing crypto.

6000+ Older BTC Mining Devices To be Refurbished and Resold Coin Edition


							

A recent report reveals that 6000+ outdated Bitcoin mining machines are refurbished and resold to miners across nations.
The older machines are in high demand in nations with lower electricity charges, especially in African countries.
Sunnyside Digital CEO Taras Kulyk acknowledges the movement of devices as a natural migration.




According to a recent Bloomberg report, more than 6,000 outdated Bitcoin mining devices in the United States will be refreshed and resold to miners across the world. Amidst Bitcoin’s fluctuations and anticipations of the upcoming Bitcoin halving, the new development is intended to help miners yield profit during the halving event.









The refurbishment of the machines would reportedly take place in a warehouse in Colorado Springs. Later, these devices would be resold to miners across various nations, especially in countries with less electricity costs, like Africa and South America.  



The move is led by Sunnyside Digital, a hardware trader and distributor in Canada. Taras Kulyk, the CEO of Sunnyside Digital, acknowledged the matter as a “natural migration.” He asserted that while electricity is a crucial aspect of Bitcoin mining, miners looking for lower-cost environments are common, especially before Bitcoin mining, which is the miners’ mainstream revenue.



Kulyk stated that he has resold refurbished computers to miners in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Paraguay, and Uruguay in the past few years. Commenting on the increased demand for such devices during the halving period, he added, “This is accelerated by the halving.”









Bitcoin halving, which splits the halving reward in half, reduces the current reward of 6.25 to 3.125 in the upcoming halving slated to be in April 2024. While the halving event happens once in every four years, Bitcoin miners await the event to yield profits.



Older models, such as the S19 series, might not be profitable to run in the US. However, Jaran Mellerud, CEO of Dubai-based Hashlabs Mining, stated that these computers can “generate decent profits and get an extended life if hosted” in parts of Africa.



Reportedly, the price of older S19 computers plummeted from $7,030 in March 2022 to $900 in March 2023. In March 2024, it again fell to nearly $427, and the miners expect a further price drop.

Ripple's CTO Drops Trading Bot Update: How Will It Impact XRP?


Ripple's Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz recently unveiled updates regarding his trading bot, sparking intrigue within the XRP community. The bot, developed by Schwartz, operates on an algorithm reminiscent of XRP Ledger's AMM algorithm. Initially designed for trading on centralized exchanges, Schwartz disclosed that the bot has undergone testing, primarily focusing on Solana.In a recent development, Schwartz disclosed the implementation of a new strategy for the bot, envisioning three distinct AMMs for Ethereum, Bitcoin and Solana. This adjustment, he explains, allows for a more aggressive approach, enabling the bot to take on additional risk while expanding trading opportunities. As per previous estimates, Schwartz expressed optimism about the bot's profitability, estimating an annual return of approximately 11%. Importantly, Schwartz clarified that AMMs are not exclusive to XRP, as they can be created with any two assets supported by XRP Ledger. However, he predicted that AMMs involving XRP will likely dominate, attributing this to the algorithm's bias toward volatility harvesting, particularly advantageous in volatile markets.Meanwhile, controversy surrounds the XRPL AMM, the foundation upon which Schwartz's bot is built. RippleX, the developer arm of Ripple, has identified discrepancies in certain AMM pools, resulting in transaction execution issues.As a precautionary measure, RippleX has advised against depositing new funds into these pools until the discrepancies are rectified. According to the report, the engineering team is working alongside community participants to address the issue, promising timely updates to the community.

Sleeper Altcoins Ready to Break Out for Massive Gains | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin’s value could soar after a key event known as the halving, according to experts. They predict prices might jump by 200%. As Bitcoin prepares for potential growth, attention also turns to other cryptocurrencies laying low. These sleeper altcoins, which are not in the spotlight, might be on the verge of making big moves. Investors and enthusiasts alike are keeping an eye out for these hidden gems that could follow Bitcoin’s lead.BlastUP Presale Hits $2.5 Million: Anticipating the Next Big Thing in CryptoBlastUP, the premier launchpad on Blast, has recently made a splash in the crypto world with its head-spinning debut, raising  $2.5 million in a few weeks. The number of early investors who have already recognized BlastUP’s high potential is growing exponentially.BlastUP is poised to reach roaring success, with plans to empower Web3 tools with AI innovation for fast and quality startup launches. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools and a rich rewards system for all those coming on board.Currently, BlastUP is running its fourth presale stage, offering BlastUP tokens at the lowest price. Buying these tokens now at $0.055, you get a hefty discount of 45.%, as the listing price is set at $0.1.>> Be Among the FIRST!

Currently trading at $1.18, it’s above the 10-day Simple Moving Average of $1.21. This could suggest that Jupiter might push towards the nearest resistance at $0.68 and possibly approach the second resistance at $0.81. If the support levels at $0.42 and $0.30 hold, it might give investors the confidence to sustain or increase their positions, potentially driving the price further up in the short term. However, a dip below these supports could lead to selling pressure.Looking at the longer horizon, the all-time price change isn’t specified, which makes it challenging to gauge the long-standing trend. With the current price above both support levels, long-term investors may be encouraged by the robust gains Jupiter has posted in the past six months. Even if a correction occurs, the price may find a safety net at or above these supports. Nonetheless, high volatility reflected in these massive percentage changes could also mean that Jupiter might face significant fluctuations in the future. Investors should be prepared for both upward potential and downward risks as market dynamics evolve.Impressive Growth for Pyth Network, Upside Ahead?Pyth Network has shown impressive growth with a 56.02% increase over the last month and an even more remarkable 136.48% rise over six months. Considering the current price of $0.90, just under the nearest resistance at $0.92, and considering its all-time high was $1.16456430, there is potential for upward movement. The short-term SMA suggests some selling pressure, but if the price breaks through the resistance levels, we could see a climb towards the second resistance at $1.18. This would be an optimistic scenario for investors looking at the recent price momentum.However, investors must be cautious. The current indicators such as MACD suggest selling, and with the 10-day SMA above the current price, there could be further downside before any significant recovery. In the short term, if the price falls below the nearest support at $0.38, we could see it test the lower level at $0.12. Long-term opportunities still exist, but the recent price data and indicators advise investors to approach with a balanced mindset, recognizing both the risks and the potential for growth.Optimism’s Price Dynamics and Future OutlookThe recent month saw prices dip by 14.30%, but looking at the six-month view, there’s a strong uptick of 168.10%. Right now, at $3.48, Optimism is below both the 10-day average of $3.68 and the 100-day average of $3.50, hinting at potential short-term pressures. However, if momentum shifts, a push past the immediate barrier at $4.32 could open the way to challenge the $4.95 level. With the all-time peak at $4.86501702, nearing that summit might entice fresh interest.In the broader scope, the six-month leap stands as a testament to underlying strength, possibly signaling more room to grow in the long run. But the market can turn swiftly; if it retreats, support lies at $2.95, with a further safety net at $2.20 to catch any significant dips. Investors will be watching these levels closely, as breaching them could signal a shift in sentiment and a reevaluation of the asset’s trajectory. Balancing between these dynamics offers a nuanced outlook for Optimism’s path ahead.ConclusionIn summary, while alternative coins like Jupiter, Pyth Network, and Optimism present intriguing prospects, it’s BlastUP that’s poised for astronomical potential. Anchored in the robust “Blast” ecosystem and bolstered by a compelling concept, BlastUP has already captivated early investors with its presale triumph. Its roadmap envisions a future where AI and Web3 converge, promising innovative growth avenues for blockchain startups. With enthusiasm brewing around its fresh approach and a solid foundation laid, BlastUP stands out as a frontrunner within the throng of aspiring altcoins.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

A 500% Surge Awaits: Top Cryptos of Tomorrow Revealed | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin enthusiasts have reason to cheer. Analysts predict a bright future for BTC prices post-halving, with potential gains of 200%. Such optimism in the digital currency domain spurs a natural curiosity about which cryptocurrencies might dominate tomorrow. Exploring the landscape of up-and-coming cryptos, we delve into those poised for significant growth, mirroring Bitcoin’s anticipated success. Stay tuned for an insightful look into the top contenders expected to make waves in the crypto market.BlastUP Presale: A Beacon of Predictability in the Volatile Crypto SpaceBuying presale tokens may be a good idea, as they are immune to market’s wild swings with their price pinned to a certain level. Predictability is one of the key benefits of presale projects such as BlastUP.BlastUP is the first launchpad on Blast, the only Layer 2 solution with native yield for ETH and stablecoins. In just a few months of its presale, this platform has already raised over $2.5 million which speaks much for its wide recognition among savvy investors.The fifth stage of BlastUP token’s presale is underway, offering a decent chance to invest in a promising asset at a low price.

BlastUP is about to shake up the crypto scene, so get on board before this rocket ship takes off without you!>> Act Fast! Supply of BlastUP Tokens is Limited – Secure Your Spot in the BlastUP Launch! <<Jupiter’s Soaring Price: Risks Amidst Rapid GrowthJupiter’s recent price surge is impressive, with a one month increase of 134.11% and an even more staggering six-month growth of 3844.00%. Looking at the current price of $1.18, sitting above the nearest support level of $0.42, indicates a strong upward trend. If this momentum continues, we could see prices pushing past the second resistance level of $0.81. However, markets are unpredictable, and any negative news could see prices retracting towards the support levels. It’s also important to keep in mind the long-term potential, balancing out the exuberance with a realistic appraisal of growth sustainability.In the short term, Jupiter’s position above the 10-day Simple Moving Average of $1.21 suggests a healthy market sentiment. If the current price can maintain above this average, it could signal further confidence among investors, potentially stabilizing the price above the nearest resistance level of $0.68. In the long-term view, such substantial price advances should be approached with caution. Quick gains often lead to sharp corrections, and a retreat to the second support level at $0.30 cannot be ruled out. Investors should weigh the explosive growth against the risk of volatility in the market.Avalanche’s Momentum Hints at Potential GrowthThe current price of $53.04 shows Avalanche has recently moved up, past the nearest historical resistance level. Considering the one-month increase of 37.99% and the more substantial six months’ surge of 496.48%, the momentum could carry it towards the second resistance at $51.66. If the trend continues, especially with the 10-day average above the current price, a push beyond the recent high could happen in the near term. However, if the market turns, the closest support at $33.98 might be tested.Long-term, Avalanche has performed impressively, with its all-time growth indicating strong market confidence. However, with the price above the 100-day average of $40.44, there’s potential for a retracement if the broader market retracts or hits a consolidation phase. Yet, the substantial growth over the past six months suggests that despite short-term fluctuations, the project has underlying strength that could overcome typical market ebbs and flows, aiming to revisit or even surpass its all-time high of $151.223 in the future.Polygon’s Market Fluctuations Indicate Growth PotentialPolygon’s recent performance shows its value dropped by 5.47% in a month. Yet, in a broader view, it has risen by 85.60% in six months, hinting at strong upward potential. Despite fluctuations, its approach to the second resistance level of $1.27 and current price standing at $0.97 demonstrates potential growth. Long-term success hinges on its ability to break past these resistance levels, which could lead to increased trust and value. Watching how it interacts with the simple moving average of $1.07 in the next few days will be key.In the short term, caution is advised as the recent dip and advice to sell from MACD and SMA 10-days reveal risks of a further drop, potentially towards the nearest support level of $0.82 or even the second support level of $0.63. However, the simple moving average of 100-days at $0.92 suggests underlying strength, and buying recommendations could mean a rebound is in sight. Investors should consider the resilience of Polygon’s technology and market trends to make informed decisions amidst this volatility.ConclusionIn conclusion, while other cryptocurrencies like Jupiter, Avalanche, and Polygon display various degrees of promise, it is BlastUP that stands out with its considerable potential within the “Blast” ecosystem. Investors have already recognized BlastUP’s appeal, as evidenced by its successful presale and innovative integration of AI and Web3 tools. Looking beyond the volatility commonly associated with the crypto space, BlastUP’s established concept and community-first approach solidify its position as the prime contender for substantial growth, offering a somewhat more certain course in an ever-shifting market.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Ancient Ethereum ICO Participant Suddenly Wakes Up


An Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) participant who has been dormant for nearly nine years has transferred a whopping 2,000 ETH out of their wallet. This sum is currently valued at approximately $6.7 million, according to blockchain sleuth Lookonchain.At press time, the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency is sitting at $3,354 on major spot exchanges.Similar transfersThis event is not isolated. Several other Ethereum ICO participants have reemerged after years of dormancy to move their ETH holdings.For instance, on Feb. 20, another participant deposited 1,732 ETH to Kraken following Ethereum's price surge past $3,000.Earlier, on Nov. 29, 2023, a transaction involving 3,000 ETH deposited to Kraken was recorded from an account that received 20,000 ETH at Ethereum's Genesis.Such movements have varied in nature: from large deposits to exchanges like Kraken to diversification across multiple addresses.Possible reasonsOne of the most straightforward reasons for these transactions is the realization of profits. Early investors in Ethereum who purchased ETH at or near its ICO price have seen the value of their holdings increase exponentially. With the current price of ETH significantly higher than at its inception, selling or transferring these holdings can secure substantial profits.Individuals may also transact large amounts of ETH to meet liquidity needs for personal or business reasons. Market sentiment and even technical upgrades might also play a role in this.Notably, the latest ICO-era address was activated shortly following the Dencun upgrade. The upgrade is expected to revolutionize the network by significantly reducing rollup transaction fees and accelerating blockchain operations. It could lower the costs associated with using popular rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism and Starknet by introducing larger data packets known as "blobs."

This Week on Crypto Twitter: An Eye-Popping Meme Coin NFT Sale As Ethereum Legal Worries Grow - Decrypt

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for DecryptThis week saw several surprising developments for the crypto ecosystem—some positive, some troubling. On Monday, an Ethereum NFT of the photo that inspired the Dogwifhat meme and eventual multi-billion dollar meme coin phenomenon sold at auction—for a whopping $4.3 million worth of ETH. That selling price instantly made Dogwifhat the most expensive meme-inspired NFT ever sold, dethroning Doge, the previous reigning champ in that category. The price of Dogwifhat spiked over $3 but has settled around $2.25 as of writing.The eye-popping sale points to the resurgent health of the meme coin economy and the potential full-throated return of the NFT market. The South Korean owners of Achi, the dog featured in the Dogwifhat meme, later divulged that the payday from the NFT sale was far, far more than they ever anticipated. Path, the pseudonymous facilitator of the Dogwifhat NFT sale, told Decrypt the same.The same day as Dogwifhat’s historic sale, Binance found itself embroiled in a minor controversy after accusations circulated on Twitter that an employee of the company may have been behind a suspiciously timed purchase of a new meme coin, BOME, that was shortly thereafter listed on the crypto exchange—a development that sent the token’s price surging.The hubbub—which was partially fueled by the secrecy surrounding how Binance makes key decisions about which coins to list on its platforms—soon grew large enough that the company felt obligated to respond. In a statement posted on Binance’s Chinese-language Twitter account, the company referred to the matter as the “so-called BOME rat warehouse” incident and said it had conducted an internal investigation that concluded that the transaction in question had not been made by a Binance employee. Twitter users still argued, though, that Binance should be more transparent about its token listing process. BOME, for example, was listed only two days after its creation—a fairly unusual move in an industry where such decisions often take months. The greatest surprise of the week came on Wednesday, however, when reports surfaced that the Ethereum Foundation—the Swiss organization that maintains the network’s technical operations—is currently under investigation by an unnamed “state authority.” While the state authority in question has not yet been officially confirmed, subsequent reports confirmed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also been subpoenaing American crypto firms about their relationships with the Ethereum Foundation—prompting fears that the SEC could be preparing a hail mary assault on the Ethereum network itself. Some Twitter users immediately brushed off the news, likely emboldened by the SEC’s recent string of crypto-related setbacks in federal court. Others, though, cautioned that—-regardless of prior results—the prospect of a U.S. government-backed effort to censure one of the most important technical teams in the crypto ecosystem was no laughing matter.  Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ethereum's 41% fall - Is Solana the reason behind it? - AMBCrypto



Trading volumes for top Ethereum-based coins ebbed substantially.
Ethereum’s weekly DEX volumes plunged 25%.

Ethereum [ETH] witnessed a sharp fall in fee revenue this week, suggesting decreased network traffic and user participation.
Ethereum’s meme coin activity slows down
According to on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, Ethereum validators collected a total of $116 million in fees over the week, representing a significant drop of 41.2%.
The slump came amidst decreasing meme coin trading on the network, a space which Ethereum has historically dominated.
Trading volumes for top Ethereum-based coins such as Pepe [PEPE], Shiba Inu [SHIB], and Floki Inu [FLOKI] ebbed substantially over the week.
This happened post a frenzied demand in the first half of the month, as per AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data.
Source: Santiment
The fading meme coin mania was also reflected in the drop in trading volume of Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) — platforms frequently used by crypto degens to swap tokens.
According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of DeFiLlama’s data, volumes of just over $15 billion were facilitated on Ethereum DEXes in the week, marking a 25% drop from the week prior.
Source: DeFiLlama
Ethereum’s loss is Solana’s gain
The decline occurred as investors turned to the Solana [SOL] blockchain to satiate their meme coin appetite. Solana’s total DEX volumes rose 3% over the week.
An avalanche of new meme coins created on the network over the week, brought in more users, and consequently more revenue.
Solana offered a faster and cheaper alternative for degens to flip coins in comparison to Ethereum.

The average transaction fee paid by Solana’s users in the last 24 hours was $0.027, as per SOL’s market value at press time. On the other hand, Ethereum charged $1.19 on average to validate a transaction.
The reduced on-chain traffic meant that fewer native ETH tokens moved, in turn implying lower demand. This partly contributed to a decline of 5% in its value over the week, according to CoinMarketCap.

ChatGPT's Insights on Next Week's Price Trends for Avalanche and Solana | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin enthusiasts have reason to smile as post-halving returns could propel BTC prices to soar by 200%, according to analysts. This surge hints at a bright future for cryptocurrencies across the board. In a ripple effect, ChatGPT’s insights suggest that next week’s price trends for cryptocurrencies like Avalanche and Solana could also see significant movements, highlighting the interconnected nature of the digital asset market.BlastUP Presale: The 1st Launchpad in the Blast Ecosystem is Live!BlastUP is a pioneering launchpad on Blast, the cutting-edge Layer 2 solution that has rapidly reached $1 billion total value locked in just 35 days.

The current price is locked at $0.055, while the price at the DEX listing is going to be $0.1. That makes a whopping 45.% discount, so now is the perfect time to buy BlastUP tokens at the best price.>> Snatch Up BlastUP Tokens Now for Maximum Returns! <<BlastUP token holders can enjoy exclusive perks like early access to token sales, special rewards in IDOs, and the opportunity to earn extra tokens through staking.

The BlastUP token, a cornerstone of the platform, unlocks access to tiered IDO launches, staking rewards, and exclusive loyalty benefits.>> Seize the Chance to Grow Faster and Earn More with BlastUP! <<Avalanche’s Price Surge: 495% Increase in Six MonthsAvalanche has seen a significant rise over the past month, jumping nearly 38%. In half a year, the price skyrocketed by 495%. While the current price is slightly below the 10-day average, it’s above the 100-day average, suggesting a strong uptrend. Given these indicators, growth could continue, possibly retesting the all-time high if the trend persists. Investors should consider both the gains over the last six months and the potential for further growth when evaluating Avalanche for their portfolios.However, trading at $53.08, Avalanche is currently above the nearest support level. The gap between the current price and the nearest support indicates potential volatility. If the price were to dip, it could find support at lower levels, which might present buying opportunities for long-term investors. In the short term, such fluctuations can create risks, but over a longer period, they could offer the chance for entry points if Avalanche remains a strong player in the ecosystem.Solana’s Growth: Potential for New All-Time HighsSolana has seen impressive growth, rising by 57.72% over the past month and a whopping 776.95% over the last six months. With the current price at $170.76 and nearing its all-time high of $267.52, there is potential for upward movement. The short-term momentum indicated by the Simple Moving Average of ten days at $182 suggests that we might see further price increases. If the excitement around recent growth continues, it could push past the nearest resistance level at $182.72 and aim for the next one at $199.73. However, near-term corrections could find support at $100.87 or even lower at $76.03 if the market sentiment shifts.Looking long-term, Solana’s six-month rally could attract more attention and investment, setting the stage for sustained growth. The 100-day Simple Moving Average at $112.33 reflects a strong trend over recent months, which could underpin future advances. Should the trend continue, long-term investors might expect the price to test and potentially break past its historical peak.  ConclusionWrapping up, the optimistic projections for Avalanche and Solana showcase their strong potential in the ever-evolving crypto market. These coins, along with others mentioned in the article, offer interesting opportunities for investors seeking diversity. Yet, amidst this promising backdrop, BlastUP emerges as a standout within the Blast ecosystem. Its innovative concept as the first launchpad and its substantial presale success suggest that BlastUP holds the highest potential for growth. With a visionary roadmap and solid community support, BlastUP is not just keeping pace with the market but is poised to lead the charge for the benefit of its investors and the ecosystem at large.  Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Pundu, with its meme-centric approach, has evidently tapped into a vein of digital culture that resonates with millions worldwide, making it an attractive proposition for those looking to invest in the burgeoning field of digital entertainment and engagement.The power of meme culture in digital venturesAt the heart of Pundu’s appeal is its unabashed embrace of meme culture.

Pundu’s project leverages the universal appeal, creating a platform that not only entertains but also engages its audience in a shared digital experience.The strategy has proven to be incredibly effective, as demonstrated by the rapid fundraising achievement.

The future for Pundu, following the fundraising milestone, appears bright. With a substantial financial foundation now in place, the project has the opportunity to expand its offerings, refine its platform, and perhaps most importantly, continue to innovate within the space of meme culture and digital engagement.As Pundu looks to the future, it does so with the backing of a robust investor base, a clear validation of its cultural resonance, and the potential to redefine the boundaries of digital ventures. The story of Pundu is not just one of financial success; it is a narrative about the power of cultural connection in the digital age, the evolving landscape of investment, and the endless possibilities that arise when creativity and culture converge in the digital realm.ConclusionPundu’s rapid fundraising achievement is a landmark event in the world of digital ventures, highlighting the growing importance of meme culture and digital engagement in shaping the future of investment. As Pundu and similar projects continue to explore the vast potential of the digital landscape, they not only offer new avenues for entertainment and engagement but also challenge us to rethink the very nature of value and investment in the digital age.

US Bitcoin Miners Move Old Equipment Overseas - Here’s Why


								The Bitcoin halving, one of the most anticipated crypto events in 2024, is less than a month away, and miners seem to be in full preparation for its aftermath. The April event is expected to slash mining rewards on the Bitcoin network in half, making the validation of transactions less lucrative.
As of now, miners receive 6.25 BTC for each validated block added to the network. However, the halving will split their revenue to 3.125 BTC for each block. Interestingly, many miners in the United States seem to be making adjustments, including upgrading to more efficient mining computers, to ensure they remain profitable.
Why Bitcoin Mining Machines Are Being Moved Out Of The US
According to crypto-mining services and logistics provider Luxor Technology, about 600,000 S19 series mining rigs, which account for a large proportion of machines currently in use in the United States, are being moved out of the country. The mining computers are being transferred (or sold) primarily to countries in Africa and South America, a Bloomberg report revealed.

The S19 series are older models of Bitcoin mining machines, and they might not be cost-efficient to run in countries like the US, where energy costs are relatively high. This explains why the miners in the country are ditching the older computers for more efficient ones.
The report quoted another major player in the Bitcoin mining industry, saying that while the S19 series and similar models might not be cost-effective to operate in the United States, they “can still generate decent profits and get an extended life if hosted” in certain regions in Africa.
Meanwhile, some miners opt to sell their hardware, with buyers of the old machines operating in parts of the world with cheap power. Many of these buyers are from Paraguay, Uruguay, Tanzania, and, most notably, Ethiopia.
According to Luxor, the upcoming halving event has been influencing the behavior of buyers towards the purchase of old mining machines. “Some buyers are waiting until after the event to purchase older computers, assuming their prices will drop even more,” the company revealed.


Ethiopia: The Next Crypto Mining Hub?
Ethiopia, a country located in the Horn of Africa, is forging a strong reputation for itself in the crypto and Bitcoin mining niche. As inferred earlier, a significant proportion of the old US machines are being transferred to the East African nation.

Ethiopia’s cheap electricity has been pinpointed as the major factor driving this development. The Bloomberg report revealed that electricity is about 3 cents per kWh in Ethiopia, while it ranges between 3 to 6 cents in the US.
Earlier in February, Bloomberg disclosed that Chinese crypto mining companies are increasing their investment in Ethiopia. While China’s strict stance against cryptocurrency is believed to have played a role, Ethiopia’s cheap power seems to have played a bigger part in the firms’ move.

XRP Ledger's AMM Pools Face Tech Issue


RippleX, the developer arm, has identified a discrepancy in a few automated market maker (AMM) pools, which has prevented transactions from executing properly.Its engineering team is working to fix the issue together with community participants.At the same time, RippleX has recommended its users not to deposit new funds into AMM pools for now. It has promised to provide timely updates for the community.Major milestone for XRP LedgerThe AMM went live on the XRP Ledger mainnet on March 22 after two years. According to David Schwartz, the chief technology officer at Ripple, the AMM marked the start of a "longer road" from the initial rollout to future usage milestones.As noted by Schwartz, the introduction of the AMM feature is a "significant moment" for XRP Ledger since it would make it possible to broaden the DeFi ecosystem and attract more liquidity.The AMM model allows ditching traditional order books by creating liquidity pools that determine the prices of assets based on certain algorithms. Some of the key features of AMM of XRPL include aggregated liquidity, continuous action mechanism and single-sided liquidity provision.Main use casesIn his recent blog post, Schwartz outlined numerous use cases for the AMM feature: from financial applications (trading and yield farming) to various non-financial use cases (such as seamless asset swaps).At the same time, the Ripple CTO has cautioned the community about the transactions being "novel and complex," which is why he is suggesting users not to shy away from submitting bug reports and coming up with their own suggestions.

Horoscope crypto from March 25th to 31st

New week, new crypto horoscope dedicated to the upcoming week from March 25th to 31st.
This week will be characterized by two transits:
with the Full Moon in Lunar Eclipse in Libra on Monday 25/3;
Easter weekend.
For several months now we have been dedicating space to the crypto horoscope written by Stefania Stimolo, an expert in astrology and blockchain. It is a weekly column with the horoscope of each zodiac sign available every Sunday only on The Cryptonomist. 
In our slogan “We Tell the Future”, we wanted to delve deeper into the topic, jokingly speaking, with this entertainment column. 

The crypto horoscope
We call it crypto horoscope simply because industry terminology is used. 
Words like NFT, metaverse, and Over-The-Counter to describe actions and scenarios, but also trading terminology like bullish, bull run, bear market, or dump to identify the mood of each zodiac sign during the days of the week.
Obviously, the famous to-the-moon cannot be missing to indicate the mood of that sign! 
In general, you could experience a period of “hard-fork”, intended as an “inner split”, or pass your lightning torch to the next zodiac sign, meaning that the Sun is moving to the next sign. 
Or, simply, you need to reflect on some situations that go into ” verify  “, that is when the planet is in dissonance with the zodiac sign. Not only that, with each new change of guard of the Sun through the constellations of the zodiac, the roadmap  of each sign will touch a new step. 
Obviously no investment advice is given, in fact, it is pure entertainment, just like any other horoscope. It must be said that there are many beginners in the field who have understood the specific crypto terminology also thanks to the horoscope on The Cryptonomist. 
“Don’t Trust, Verify”
Astrology is not an exact science, but it aims to predict the future in its own way. So why not associate the typical phrase of blockchain “Don’t Trust, Verify” here as well. 
And in fact, what the author wants to propose is her interpretation of the planetary transits that occur during the week, describing the reaction of each zodiac sign, following the “logic” of traditional astrology. 
For those who are astrology lovers, they could stay updated just by following the weekly transits that are communicated and somehow influence us. Whether it’s a Mercury Retrograde or the days of the Full Moon. 
Others, on the other hand, could access the dedicated page, which is updated every Sunday, and read the horoscope of their zodiac sign, their rising sign, or why not, even the horoscope of friends and loved ones. 
And so, just for entertainment purposes, don’t waste time and click here to read your horoscope for this week!

Terra founder Do Kwon released in Montenegro

South Korean crypto fugitive Do Kwon has been released from prison in Montenegro as the Supreme Court deliberates on extradition requests from the United States and South Korea. According to a Bloomberg report, he was released on Saturday, March 23. The Supreme Court halted the extradition of the Terraform Labs co-founder to South Korea, suspending a lower court’s ruling.The Terra founder Kwon is currently facing fraud allegations in both South Korea and the U.S. stemming from the Terra Luna collapse, which resulted in the loss of approximately $60 billion in market value in 2022. The prison director Darko Vukcevic reportedly said by phone:“We released Do Kwon from prison as his regular prison term for traveling with fake papers ended. Since he is a foreign citizen and his documents were withheld, he was taken for an interview to the police directorate for foreigners, and they will deal with him further.”The decision to release Kwon reportedly came from the Council of the Supreme Court, which is set to review a decision that could grant or deny extradition to his native South Korea. In South Korea, penalties are comparatively milder than in the U.S., where prosecutors seek to prosecute Kwon for the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin’s $40 billion collapse in 2022.Related: Prosecutors request Changpeng Zhao surrender all passports ahead of sentencingKwon’s lawyer Goran Rodic also confirmed his release. According to state TV, Kwon’s passport has been held back to prevent him from leaving the country. Later on Saturday, Kwon was relocated to a shelter for foreigners, as reported by state TV, citing Rodic, who indicated plans to appeal to a court for Kwon to remain free until an extradition ruling.The Supreme Court’s action followed a challenge by the chief prosecutor in the Balkan nation, who cited procedural errors in the rulings favoring South Korea’s request. Extradition to either country awaits further court deliberations, with no specified timeline provided after the announcement on Friday.Source: WhynotpumpIf extradited to the United States, the Terraform Labs co-founder would likely face eight felony charges filed by prosecutors in March 2023. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 for using falsified travel documents with his colleague, Terraform Labs’ former chief financial officer Han Chang-joon. Authorities from the U.S. and South Korea filed competing extradition requests to have Kwon face fraud charges in their respective countries, but no final decision has been made.Magazine: Decentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century

Popular Altcoin Fails to Produce Blocks on One of Its Subnets for a Long Time - Bitcoin Sistemi


Polygon (MATIC) zkEVM, the Ethereum Layer 2 network that launched around a year ago this week, is currently experiencing a network outage. Multiple block explorers have reported a long-lasting outage since a block was successfully sorted and added to the chain.
A message in the zkEVM section of Polygonscan indicates that the zkEVM mainnet network is currently undergoing unscheduled maintenance and block data may be out of date.


Polygon zkEVM was launched with a symbolic first transaction by Vitalik Buterin on March 27, 2023. The network is a zero-knowledge scaling rollup solution compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Despite its innovative approach, Polygon zkEVM has struggled to gain the traction of similar Layer 2 networks, being traded much less than its competitors.

Polygon (MATIC) official X account made the following statement regarding the outage from their official accounts:






“Polygon zkEVM Mainnnet Beta encountered an issue with its sequencer due to layer 1 reconfiguration. We are working to fully resolve the issue and will follow up with a detailed post-mortem report. This issue only affects Polygon zkEVM (which is a single rollup) and does not affect Polygon PoS, Polygon CDK, or any chain deployed using Polygon CDK. “We look forward to the launch of the second generation zkEVM in the coming weeks.”

From Bytes To Bites: Iceland Prioritizes Food Over Crypto Mining


								Iceland, the volcanic island nation famed for its stunning landscapes and clean energy production, is embarking on a new chapter. In a move that highlights a growing global trend, The country is shifting its focus from supporting the cryptocurrency mining industry towards bolstering domestic food production.
Iceland Pivots: From Crypto To Crops
This strategic decision, driven by a desire for increased food security and a more balanced energy grid, positions Iceland for a greener and more self-sufficient future.
Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir spearheaded this shift, citing the need to prioritize sectors with a more direct impact on national well-being. While crypto mining has played a role in our renewable energy sector, stated Jakobsdóttir, they recognize the importance of a balanced and sustainable approach. By prioritizing food production, the government ensures its constituents have access to a secure and reliable food supply.

Iceland’s abundance of geothermal and hydroelectric power plants has made it a global leader in renewable energy production per capita. This same clean energy has also fueled the rise of crypto mining operations within the country. However, concerns surrounding the environmental impact of crypto mining, coupled with a desire for greater food independence, have prompted this strategic pivot.
The move towards domestic food production presents a multitude of benefits for the country. Increased agricultural output will not only bolster food security but also create new jobs and stimulate the local economy.

According to Jakobsdóttir, the energy demands of the country’s 375,000 citizens should take precedence over data centres and instead use precious renewable electricity for homes and other sectors.


“Bitcoin is an issue worldwide . . . but data centers in Iceland use a significant share of our green energy,” the prime minister said. A new proposal to boost wind power would put more premium on clean industries to achieve carbon neutrality, she added.

The transition to a larger-scale food production industry, however, is not without its challenges. Iceland’s harsh climate and limited arable land necessitate innovative solutions.
Experts believe that advancements in controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) technologies, such as hydroponics and vertical farming, will play a crucial role in overcoming these limitations.
The impact of this decision on existing crypto mining operations in Iceland remains to be seen. While some operations may choose to relocate, others might adapt by utilizing more energy-efficient mining practices. Regardless, Iceland’s strategic shift signifies a growing global conversation about the responsible use of resources and the importance of long-term sustainability.
By prioritizing food security and a robust domestic agricultural sector, Iceland is charting a course for a greener and more self-sufficient future. This decision serves as a model for other nations grappling with similar challenges, demonstrating the potential of clean energy to not only power a digital future but also cultivate a more sustainable food system.

It is worth noting that Dogecoin has significantly outperformed other altcoins over the past 24 hours. In fact, it is the fifth best-performing cryptocurrency in the top 100 over the past 24 hours.According to the latest IntoTheBlock data, approximately 57.62% of addresses are "in the money," holding Dogecoin at a profit. At the same time, 34.15% are "out of the money," indicating holdings at a loss.

Traders Alert As Whale Transfers 8,734 BTC Between Unidentified Wallets - Coin Edition


							

Whale Alert has spotted a significant transaction on the Bitcoin network.
A certain Whale transferred 8,734 BTC, equivalent to $560,821,374, across unknown wallets.
Bitcoin traders are on the alert, awaiting the transaction’s impact on the Bitcoin market.




Whale Alert, a leading blockchain tracker and crypto transactions reporting platform has spotted a significant transaction on the Bitcoin network. In a recent post, the blockchain tracker reported that an unidentified Bitcoin whale transferred 8,734 BTC, equivalent to $560,821,374, from one unknown wallet to another.







Transactions of such nature usually put the cryptocurrency community on the alert, especially during periods of significant market volatility. It attracts the attention of crypto users who might want to scrutinize the transaction to know if the whale intends to sell off or hold on to the crypto asset.









Depending on the transfer details and the wallet types involved in the transaction, users can preempt the whale’s next move and position themselves appropriately. However, Whale Alert did not capture such details in the specified post, as it noted the transaction was between unknown wallets.



Besides enabling investment decisions, crypto transactions of such magnitude reflect the fundamental elements of cryptocurrencies and the possibilities they provide. One crypto user observed it is a reminder of the intricate web transactions that underpin the global financial systems. 



According to the user, while transferring such a large sum can be intriguing, it also reminds the community of the importance of transparency and accountability in financial transactions. Hence, it is crucial to encourage responsible use of resources to benefit users in the long run.









Considering the transaction’s impact on BTC’s price, it did not reflect any significant movement on the Bitcoin daily chart. However, it injected a minor intraday rally on the hourly chart that eventually faded. TradingView data showed Bitcoin opened the trading day at $63,812 and rallied to $64,698 before retracing to close the day at $64,001.

Web3 Watch: Someone bought a CryptoPunk for $16M, again - Blockworks


Two weeks after a CryptoPunks NFT sold for $16 million, a punk has sold for $16 million once again. 
Punk #7084, which changed hands for $16.42 million on Wednesday, is one of nine blueish-skinned alien punks, which are the collection’s most highly-coveted pieces. It narrowly topped the other alien punk that sold this month to become the second-largest CryptoPunk sale ever.  
Read more: Someone bought a CryptoPunk for $16M
The sale appears to have been directly brokered between buyer and seller. 
The punk’s apparent seller, known on X as Peruggia, said he “felt like an imposter” owning punk #7084 without “elevating” the collectible. 
“After over a year of looking around I feel I’ve found the right buyer with the right vision to appropriately elevate this asset,” Peruggia added. Peruggia walks away with quite the windfall, having acquired the NFT for $7.57 million in 2021. 
“Legend,” Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz replied.
First minted in 2017, CryptoPunks were ascendent during the NFT craze of 2021 and remain popular today. The cheapest punk on offer from the 10,000-piece set costs $166,242, and it’s the largest NFT collection by market capitalization, according to NFT Price Floor. 
Changpeng Zhao’s education initiative uses soulbound tokens
As former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao awaits sentencing for money laundering charges in the US, he’s already announced his first post-Binance venture.

Zhao is launching Giggle Academy, a project focused on bringing free basic education to all, he announced via X this week. He added he is hiring for what will be a small team working directly with Zhao. 
Zhao released a “concept brainstorm” for the project dated February 2024 in which he says the Giggle Academy won’t have a native token but will use soulbound tokens — essentially non-transferable NFTs — to certify students’ progress on the platform. 
One interesting stat:

$122.5 million-worth of Solana (SOL) tokens were raised in 27 memecoin pre-sales tracked this week by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT.

Also of note:

Ghostface Killah, a member of the rap group Wu-Tang Clan, “put new exclusive music on bitcoin” as Ordinal inscriptions. 
A developer behind the meme coin SLERF accidentally burnt $10 million worth of pre-sale tokens. The developer’s mea culpa went viral on X, and SLERF ballooned to roughly $300 million in market capitalization this week, per CoinGecko.
MOONS, the former native token of the r/Cryptocurrency subreddit, was up on Thursday as Reddit debuted favorably on the stock market.

Opportunity? XRP enters final phase before official bull run


The value of XRP continues to consolidate above the $0.60 mark, with investors awaiting for the token to initiate any substantial rally towards the coveted $1 milestone.
Regarding what to expect from XRP, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) on March 24, observed that the token is likely on the cusp of a bull run that could potentially propel it to claim $1.
According to the analyst, XRP is entering the final phase before what he termed the “Official Bull Run Announcement.” He noted that the cryptocurrency is mirroring patterns observed during the 2017 cycle, a period marked by significant price surges across the crypto market.


Key insights from the analysis highlight a potential dip in the XRP/BTC pair, with projections indicating a possible decline to as low as $0.00000773 before the anticipated bull run commences.

“The Official Bull Run Announcement is in progress! #XRP is currently mirroring its 2017 cycle, entering the final phase before the official Bull Run Announcement,” he said. 

XRP’s path to $1
Furthermore, the analyst pointed out the 10th ‘W’ technical pattern which he notes is well-aligning with the current market setup. This pattern often precedes significant price movements, adding credence to the belief that XRP may be on the brink of a substantial rally.
In terms of target prices, the analysis provided two potential scenarios for XRP’s trajectory. He suggested that based on the pattern, XRP could target a non-logarithmic projection of  $1 and a logarithmic projection of $1.2.

Impact of the SEC case 
It’s worth noting that the achievement of the $1 milestone by XRP would present a favorable opportunity for token investors, particularly considering its prolonged consolidation below this threshold despite the legal clarity attained in the Ripple and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) case. In the case, Ripple received partial relief after the court declared that XRP was not a security. 
Meanwhile, XRP investors are awaiting the resolution of the case, as it will likely have a significant impact on the asset. In the latest development, the SEC filed its remedies-related opening brief, with the proceedings notably remaining sealed from public view.
Market interest is in the SEC’s arguments for imposing punitive penalties for violations of Section 5 of the 1933 Securities Act.
The SEC could pursue punitive penalties if it can demonstrate that Ripple continued to violate the Securities Act after the initial complaint. 
By press time, XRP was trading at $$0.62 with daily gains of about 1% while over the past seven days, the token is up almost 3%.

AI builds the ideal crypto portfolio for 2024


Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been proven useful for tasks that require gathering and consolidating data, despite being fallible. Finbold then turned to three advanced AIs and asked them to build the ideal crypto portfolio for 2024.
For that, we used OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 Turbo, Antrhopic’s Claude 3 Opus, and xAI’s Grok. Additionally, we asked them to illustrate the portfolio allocations considering a $10,000 initial investment.
Interestingly, there are notable similarities in the three proposed crypto portfolios among some differences in the picks and correspondent weights.


Notably, all three have Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as the two largest positions in an ideal crypto portfolio. Bitcoin weighs 40%, or $4,000 for a $10,000 net worth cryptocurrency investor, in all three AIs. Meanwhile, ChatGPT and Grok allocate $3,000 (30%) in Ethereum, while Claude makes it a $2,500 (25%) investment.
Moreover, the three consulted AIs included Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK), and Polkadot (DOT) with varying shares of the crypto portfolio.
ChatGPT-4 ideal $10,000 crypto portfolio
In particular, ChatGPT-4’s ideal crypto portfolio is made of eight allocations and focuses on diversification. The AI also highlights the importance of constant “Research and Adjustment” to follow the fast pace of the cryptocurrency market.
Binance coin (BNB) features as the third pick with a $1,000 (10%) investment, followed by Cardano (ADA) Solana, and Polkadot; each with $500 (5%). Finally, a $300 (3%) investment in Chainlink and a $200 (2%) diversified allocation in other altcoins and emerging tech.

Claude 3 Opus’s best crypto portfolio
Similarly, Claude 3 Opus picks BNB and ADA as the third and fourth largest cryptocurrencies. The resemblance to ChatGPT’s crypto portfolio continues with DOT, SOL, and LINK, in order. 
However, Cardano has a 10% weight in Claude’s portfolio, while Chainlink goes with 5% and no smaller diversifications.
This AI also notes the importance of thorough research and mentions investors must consider their risk tolerance when making decisions.

Grok AI’s crypto portfolio allocation example
Next, the AI developed by Elon Musk’s X enterprise, Grok, removes BNB and Cardano, while adding Uniswap (UNI) last.
Grok also invests double the other two on Chainlink and Polkadot, for a $1,000 (10%) allocation. Solana has the same weight of $500 (5%) in all three artificial intelligence tools, being Grok’s fifth pick. The decentralized exchange, Uniswap, is the only investment that is not a chain, but a protocol built on other chains. Receiving a $500 (5%) purchase.

In closing, xAI’s chatbot concludes its crypto portfolio is focused on cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, active development, and real-world use cases. Previously, Elon Musk’s AI named the ideal cryptocurrency for payments on X.
All things considered, these guidances should not be the only source of information to build the best 2024 investment strategy.

Terraform Labs Co-Founder Do Kwon to Be Released in Montenegro Amid Extradition Deliberations



                    


Montenegro’s authorities are set to release Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon from prison while his extradition to the United States or South Korea remains undecided. 



Kwon, detained for approximately one year, will be released on March 23 but must relinquish his travel documents to ensure he does not leave the country, as reported by Montenegrin news outlet Vijesti on March 22. 




This decision by the Council of the Supreme Court precedes a review that may either approve or reject his extradition to South Korea, his homeland.



Kwon’s arrest in Montenegro in March 2023 alongside Han Chang-joon, Terraform Labs’ ex-chief financial officer, was due to the use of counterfeit travel documents. 



This arrest was complicated by extradition requests from both the U.S. and South Korea, where Kwon faces charges of fraud, although a final ruling on his extradition has yet to be made.




In the U.S., Kwon would confront eight felony charges filed by prosecutors in March 2023.

Alternatively, South Korea might indict him for fraud and breaches of capital markets law. The destination of his potential extradition remains uncertain.



The plan involves confiscating Kwon’s South Korean passport, which was set to be revoked in 2022 following Terra’s downfall. 



Despite this, Kwon used a falsified Costa Rican passport in Montenegro, claiming it to be genuine, which led to his arrest in 2023.



Additionally, Terraform Labs co-founder Shin Hyun-Seong, also known as Daniel Shin, and others linked to the platform are facing criminal charges for investor fraud. 



Following Terra’s collapse in May 2022, Shin remained in South Korea. 



The collapse brought significant regulatory attention to the platform and played a part in a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market.

                        Sunday, March 24th, 2024 –  Solana meme coin $PUNDU has closed out its presale with a whopping $37 million raise, but Dogecoin20 is still open, and contributors are pushing its presale towards a $10 million hard cap sellout.At the time of writing Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) – an upgraded better version of Dogecoin – has amassed more than $7.6 million from investors in barely a week as meme coin fever continues. Luckily for those arriving late at the party or may have missed $PUNDU, the creators of $DOGE20 have extended the presale. Nevertheless, given the hype and FOMO developing around the token, the initial coin offering is highly likely to sell out early this week given its past fundraising performance, so buyers need to move fast.Dogecoin20 is bringing $DOGE to the Ethereum blockchain and dispensing with the inflationary supply that could hold it back in the future and the computationally expensive mining system the coin still uses. Ethereum is still the No.1 blockchain for decentralized applications and its recent Dencun software revamp has been a roaring success that is already reducing the transaction fees from Layer 2s like Polygon and Optimism. All of this makes Dogecoin20 token even more attractive because it is built on a future-proof architecture that is constantly improving.Dogecoin price is up 7% today as its march higher continues… and Dogecoin20 is coming up fast in its slipstream
Meanwhile, the world’s best-known and most valuable meme coin, Dogecoin, sees its price maintain an upward trajectory despite consolidation in the crowded bitcoin trade.$DOGE is 7% higher at the beginning of the European session on Sunday, priced at $0.1733.Dogecoin20 is currently $0.000208 priced at $0.000164 in what is now the 14th stage of the presale price ladder. Such has been the demand for the $DOGE20 token that the presale has been extended, with the hard cap target moved out to $10 million so that the voracious appetite of legions of buyers can be satisfied.But with the Dogecoin20 presale run rate regularly exceeding more than half a million dollars per day, prospective contributors will need to move in a spritely fashion to secure the lowest available prices. Stage 14 ends either in two days or when the target of $8,183,163 is reached, whichever comes first. The previous hard cap total was $6,315,663 but has now been updated to $10,068,663. On-chain staking passive income means Dogecoin20 is better than Dogecoin  
You get more woof with $DOGE20 – it has the foundation to build a meme coin like nothing that has come before in the Shiba Inu-inspired token world, thanks to its built-in on-chain staking feature.Unlike Dogecoin, this upgraded version deploys Ethereum smart contracts to underpin the mechanics of what is a passive income vehicle, where stakers of $DOGE20 are rewarded with an income stream denominated in $DOGE20. You can start staking as soon as you buy in the presale. Estimated rewards are currently 132$ per annum and more than 21 billion $DOGE20 tokens have been staked.$DOGE20 fixes the $DOGE inflation problem and is attracting big Chinese money
Another aspect to the improvements that Dogecoin20 is bringing is the problem of the infinite supply of Dogecoin. $DOGE20 fixes this emissions problem by introducing a fixed supply of 140,000,000,000.Much of the new money flowing into crypto is coming from China and Dogecoin20 with its ‘best Doge upgrade’ appeal is attracting substantial funding from that quarter, along with Pundu and another coin called $PUMP. In what could be among the biggest presales ever, $PUMP, which is a BNB Smart Chain coin with a massive Chinese following, has raised $280 million.  Whichever chain meme coins are launching on, then, there is a more than ample supply of willing buyers from China and elsewhere – providing a coin can demonstrate it has the potential to hit the mark in the virality stakes, as Dogecoin20 does.Top finance news sites and YouTube crypto are excited about $DOGE20
VIDEODogecoin20 media coverage spans top crypto and finance sites, from The Economic Times,  Business Insider, Benzinga and the Times of India to the likes of Cointelegraph and Bitcoin.com.  Elsewhere, Youtuber Matthew Perry has been letting his 217k subscribers know all about Dogecoin20, going as far as to say it is better than $DOGE. Without a doubt, Dogecoin is still the king of the meme coins and the one to watch. It is this brand power that makes Dogecoin20’s focus on bettering ‘the Doge’ such an investible opportunity. Those who snapped up Dogecoin at its all-time low in May 2015 and held it until today are sitting on gains of 202,045%, according to Coinmarketcap data. With that sort of ROI on the table in the meme coins sector, the sky’s the limit for Dogecoin20. The $DOGE20 price could 100x at launch. $DOGE20 can be bought with ETH, USDT, BNB or with fiat using a card.

Avalanche (AVAX) Founder Emin Gün Sirer Warned For These Projects Getting the Spotlight: "Trash Projects" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Avalanche's Turkish founder, Emin Gün Sirer, issued a harsh warning about the proliferation of Layer-2 (L2) projects in the cryptocurrency market, especially after Ethereum's latest Dencun update.
Sirer warned that many of these L2 projects, which he called “garbage,” are trying to fill the void left by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), who has been accused of fraud. He criticized these projects for using centralized sequencers without anti-fraud practices and for divesting their founders' personal tokens before launch. He likened these practices to manipulation games played by SBF:


“We all ignored the big red flags about SBF because he 'looked smart' and 'made a lot of money.' “And then it turns out he's an idiot, a sociopath, and he's stealing our money.”
Sirer also warned that the next cycle will be even more violent and worse behavior will be displayed:





“It's become really easy to start a garbage L2, and it's pretty easy to do this trick, perfected by a particular chain that gets rebuilt every day, where you find someone who does real work and parrot what they say while taking a photo with Vitalik.”
Sirer summarized several red flags that characterize these “garbage” L2s:



Project discourses that do not match the project technology.
Projects selling tokens now to raise money for future technology development.
Founders selling their personal tokens before launch.
Very low number of public tokens.


Sirer urged the crypto community to be extra careful and cut through the noise by questioning whether a developer is truly bringing something game-changing to address the biggest issues facing cryptocurrencies right now:

“There are only a few real problems in crypto at any given time. For example, scalability and performance were prominent issues in the last cycle, and Avalanche and Solana presented two approaches to overcome them.”

Sirer believes the current issues relate to supporting multiple use cases on the same platform and integration with traditional finance (TradFi).





“Things are extremely easy for garbage L2s, and we may be facing a new group of sociopaths lining up to fill the void left behind by SBF,” Sirer warned.

Bitcoin Futures Volatility Surges: Open Interest Hits $36 Billion Amid Price Fluctuations



                    


Bitcoin investors often crave the excitement of market volatility but usually find the reality less thrilling, especially when a surge in prices is swiftly followed by a sharp downturn. 



This often results in forced liquidations of futures contracts, exacerbating the fall in Bitcoin’s value. 




The Bitcoin futures market, vital for traders wanting to leverage their positions, grows in significance with its expansion, influencing Bitcoin’s price more markedly.



Recently, the aggregate open interest in Bitcoin futures soared to an all-time high of $36 billion on March 21, a significant increase from $30 billion just two weeks earlier. 



Leading the charge, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) recorded $11.9 billion in open interest, overshadowing the inflow to U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since their launch. 




Despite the advent of spot ETFs—which some expected would dampen volatility given their $3 billion average daily trading volume—Bitcoin’s volatility has escalated, contrary to these expectations.



Over the last four weeks, Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility index shot past 80%, the highest in over 15 months, starkly contrasting with the lower volatility seen in traditional markets and even in stocks known for their unpredictability. 



This heightened volatility was highlighted by a dramatic price correction on March 19, followed by a significant recovery the next day, leading to substantial liquidations in the futures market. 



Such volatility not only affects traders but also impacts the general perception of Bitcoin’s risk and its market trajectory.

The futures market serves as a double-edged sword, offering opportunities for leveraged positions but also presenting risks of sharp corrections and liquidations. 



This dynamic can lead to short-term buying pressure if the market reverses from bearish bets, contributing to the observed volatility. 



Some analysts point to excessive leverage or market manipulation as causes, with instances where market movements in related sectors seemingly coincide with major Bitcoin price shifts, though the motivations behind such movements remain speculative.



To understand the impact of futures on Bitcoin’s price, examining the premium on monthly contracts is crucial. 



These contracts, favored by professional traders for their lack of a funding rate, command a significant premium over spot prices, reflecting market sentiment. 



Despite a recent price dip, the sustained high premium on futures contracts indicates a bullish stance among traders, yet the risk of forced liquidations looms large, especially with the substantial open interest in the market.

Top Analyst Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says Monthly Close Below This Level Would Be Catastrophic for BTC - The Daily Hodl


								A top trader who rode the 2023 crypto breakout warns that Bitcoin (BTC) bulls have about a week to avert a potentially catastrophic scenario.
Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 532,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s monthly chart is very close to flashing a strong bearish signal.










The trader shares a chart showing that BTC was rejected at the high time frame resistance of $70,000, suggesting that Bitcoin’s multi-month rally from around $20,000 may be coming to an end.
“Monthly needs to close green otherwise that’s a strong sell signal on the most important high time frame we’ve got.
A close below $56,000 would be catastrophic.
 [Seven] days to go, good luck bulls.” 
Source: DonAlt/X
Zooming in, DonAlt says that Bitcoin bulls must hold BTC’s immediate support at $65,000 to have a shot at ending the current correction. Otherwise, DonAlt warns that BTC is at risk of seeing prices below $60,000.
“Bulls tried but so far haven’t managed to make any significant progress A close below $65,000 might as well be a close below $60,000 in my opinion… Bulls and bears fighting it out at the last line of defense.” 
Source: DonAlt/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that Bitcoin is currently forming a head-and-shoulders formation – a technical pattern that may foreshadow the beginning of a downtrend.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $64,592.

This crypto ‘smart trader’ profited over $1.3 million since March 1


In the cryptocurrency market, smart traders are pseudonym addresses with a profitable record trading cryptocurrencies. Usually, other speculators follow these smart traders to collect insights and, sometimes, mirror strategies. 
Recently, a meme coin boom dominated the crypto landscape in March, creating new profitable traders who made millions of dollars. In particular, the Solana (SOL) account ‘14c7f…3KwJn’ has profited over $1.3 million trading more than 350 meme coins.
The smart trader achieved this impressive result in a month-to-date (MTD) time frame, according to Lookonchain’s post on X (Twitter).


Notably, the highest profit was acquired with the meme coin TWTR. The trade started with an initial investment of 6 SOL, returning 2,066 SOL, for over 34,000% gains. This alone has rendered the smart trader a profit of $360,500, considering a price of $175 per SOL.

Top 10 meme coin trades by the $1.3 million profit smart trader
Looking further, the analysis consolidated the other nine most profitable meme coin trades by ‘14c7f…3KwJn’. NOSTALGIA resulted in a profit of 1,230 SOL, worth $215,250, while Solstream 779 SOL ($136,325).
The other seven meme coins sum to a total of 1,610 more Solana to the smart trader, valued at $281,750.

Interestingly, these speculative maneuvers happened during a huge meme coin boom in March. The cryptocurrency landscape saw a generalized shift toward fun tokens, with Solana Network at the forefront of this mania.
However, meme coins are not advised assets to hold in an ideal crypto portfolio. This class of cryptocurrencies lacks solid fundamentals to sustain any acquired demand in the long term. Finance experts usually describe meme coin speculation risks according to “The Greater Fool Theory,” which says:

“The Greater Fool Theory is the idea that, during a market bubble, one can make money by buying overvalued assets and selling them for a proﬁt later, because it will always be possible to ﬁnd someone who is willing to pay a higher price. An investor who subscribes to the Greater Fool Theory will buy potentially overvalued assets without any regard for their fundamental value. This speculative approach is predicated on the belief that you can make money by gambling on future asset prices and that you will always be able to ﬁnd a “greater fool” who will be willing to pay more than you did. Unfortunately, when the bubble eventually bursts (which it always does), there is a large sell-oﬀ that causes a rapid decline in the asset values. During the sell-oﬀ, you can lose a great deal of money if you are the one left holding the asset and cannot ﬁnd a buyer.”
– Harford Funds blog post: “The Greater Fool Theory: What Is It?”

Therefore, speculators joining the speculative frenzy late, following ‘smart traders,’ may end up with liquidity issues or face potential crashes, losing most of their short-term acquired profits. To avoid these consequences, investors should focus on projects with solid fundamentals and sustainable long-term demand.

Polygon zkEVM Beta Hit by Sequencer Issues: Will It Impact MATIC Price? - Coin Edition


							

The beta version of Polygon’s zkEVM mainnet encountered a sequencer issue.
Other parts of the Polygon ecosystem, like PoS and CDK, remain operational.
Previously, blockchain security firm Verichains identified a critical flaw in Polygon zkEVM.




The beta version of Polygon’s zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) mainnet recently encountered a setback. The Polygon team acknowledged this in a recent post on X, noting its sequencer faced difficulties stemming from a layer one reorganization. 







Per the report, this issue affected the sole rollup on the network and has prompted immediate action from the Polygon blockchain team. Notably, this incident exclusively impacts Polygon’s zkEVM, which is in a nearly complete prototype state.









Other components of the Polygon ecosystem are unaffected, like its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network and chains built with the Polygon software development kit. Moreover, any chains deployed using Polygon CDK also remain operational.



Furthermore, the Polygon team is actively engaged in resolving the problem. It assures the community that a comprehensive post-mortem analysis will follow to shed light on the root causes and outline measures to prevent recurrence.



Despite this setback, Polygon remains steadfast in its commitment to innovation. Anticipation is building for the imminent release of the second-generation zkEVM, promising enhancements to bolster the platform’s performance.









At press time, the incident had no notable impact on Polygon’s ecosystem native token, MATIC. In the last 24 hours, MATIC has only increased by 0.34%, putting its price at $0.9804. The token has also fallen by 5% over the past week, mirroring the broader market downturn.



For the uninitiated, Polygon zkEVM is a layer-2 protocol crafted to bolster Ethereum’s scalability by employing off-chain transaction handling and leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. 



Last September, Verichains, a leading blockchain security firm, identified a critical flaw in Polygon zkEVM. The flaw was found in the zkProver module, rendering the network vulnerable to proof forgery attacks. 



This vulnerability poses a considerable risk to the security and integrity of funds within the blockchain ecosystem’s layers 1 and 2. Notably, Polygon and Verichains have collaboratively fixed the issue.

ETF Investors Are the Strong Hands After Gobbling Up BTC Amid Recent Sell-Off: Bloomberg Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								Bloomberg’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert Eric Balchunas says that ETF investors are currently the “strong hands” that have been buying up the Bitcoin (BTC) dip.
Balchunas tells his 259,000 followers on the social media platform X that while Grayscale has seen outflows from its ETF, most of it is just one entity – Genesis – offloading into spot Bitcoin.










All in all, Balchunas says ETF investors are not the ones behind recent sell pressure and are buying the dip.
“The new ‘Boomer’ ETF investors are the strong ones (as we predicted), it’s other Bitcoin owners behind the selling pressure. I’ll explain: the nine new Bitcoin ETFs have taken in about $1.2 billion in [five days] as price declined 8%. 
GBTC had outflows yes, but it is largely Genesis (we know this for fact), who is simply exchanging GBTC shares for spot BTC, so a net neutral event (plus GBTC is all pre-ETF money).
Add it up, the ETFs have been net buyers of BTC (and none of the new money has left, in fact more has come in). As usual, when it comes to selloffs, the call is coming from inside the house.”
The analyst shares data from previous decades showing that the “boomer” ETF investors have historically held assets with conviction while allocating large amounts of capital when prices drop. He points out that they invested hundreds of billions of dollars into stock market index ETFs in years when equities were plummetting.
“These boomer noobs poured $167 billion into ETFs in 2008 (SPY down 35%) and another $600 billion in 2021 (SPY down 18%). They are tougher than you think. (Although not to say there won’t be some outflows here and there but in my opinion, it will be minimal and over time net positive)”

XRP rises 5% in 7 days, but it could fall soon - Why? - AMBCrypto



Ripple has introduced an automated market maker feature on XRP Ledger.
Key indicators hinted at a possible decline in XRP’s value.

Over 200 liquidity pools have been created on the network since the launch of the long-anticipated automated market maker (AMM) feature on XRP Ledger (XRPL), data from XRPScan showed.


In a blog post published on the 22nd of March, the developer team behind XRPL announced the launch of the XLS-30. This allowed for the integration of the AMM feature on the XRPL. 
According to the developers, this marked a significant upgrade from the preexisting XRPL decentralized exchange (DEX) structure. 
This provided liquidity exclusively through manual market making and central limit order books. 
With the XLS-30, a non-custodial AMM feature is added to the XRPL DEX. It allows users to earn returns for providing liquidity to the network’s pools.
According to XRPScan, the biggest liquidity pool on the network is the USD/USD pair, which has a balance of 5 trillion LPToken.
Much ado about nothing
According to CoinMarketCap’s data, XRP traded at $0.63 at press time. 
While its value rose by almost 5% in the last week, an assessment of some indicators on a daily chart revealed that it may witness a drawback in the coming week.
For example, the value of its Elder-Ray Index, which estimates the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers on an asset, was -0.0028. 
A negative Elder-Ray Index value is a bearish signal, depicting an uptick in selling activity. 
Also, readings from XRP’s Money Flow Index (MFI) confirmed the decline in demand for the altcoin. At press time, the value of XRP’s MFI was 45.16, positioned in a downtrend.
 This suggested a decrease in accumulation momentum and a preference for sell-offs amongst market participants.
Lastly, poised to cross below the zero line, the token’s MACD was under the signal line as of this writing. 
Source: SHIB/USDT on TradingView

Realistic or not, here’s XRP’s market cap in BTC’s terms

A downward intersection of the MACD line with the signal line suggests that the short-term moving average is trending lower than the longer-term moving average. 
It represents a decline in bullish momentum and is often interpreted as a sign that a price decline may happen.

Here's Every Upcoming Star Wars Game You Shouldn't Miss - Decrypt

When Lucasfilm Games awarded Electronic Arts the Star Wars license in 2013, it seemed like a huge coup for the developer. In that time, the publisher managed to release just a handful of Star Wars games, and they weren't without controversy.Most recently, Electronic Arts announced that the first-person shooter from Respawn—the studio behind Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and its sequel, as well as the Titanfall series—has been canceled.But it’s a new era for Star Wars games, and a bunch of studios are working on their own adventures set in a galaxy far, far away. Here’s what to look forward to.Star Wars OutlawsThe reputation for Star Wars as being a story about space wizards named Skywalker or Palpatine is strong—strong enough that we'd rarely get stories about the other corners of the Star Wars universe up until fairly recently.Games are no different. We had a run of excellent games inspired by Star Wars dogfights in the 1990s and 2000s, but it's mostly still Jedi and Sith standing at the head of Star Wars titles. Star Wars Outlaws is one of the highest profile titles to break away from this.Outlaws will follow Kay Vess and her trenchcoat-wearing droid companion Nix as they "attempt one of the biggest heists the Outer Rim has ever seen." Outlaws is set between “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” and is a third-person action title in development from the Ubisoft Massive team behind Tom Clancy's The Division and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.Fans of Ubisoft games like the aforementioned Division and Watch Dogs should keep an eye on this one. Ubisoft hasn't set a release date just yet, but has said it will release this year for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.Star Wars HuntersStar Wars Hunters is a free-to-play, player-vs-player Star Wars title from Zynga. In this game, you'll choose from a cast of new Star Wars characters that include bounty hunters, stormtroopers, and heroes of the rebellion, among others, and team up for 4v4 arena battles. The game doesn't have an exact release date, but is currently set to release this year on Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android.Untitled Star Wars Strategy GameBit Reactor may not be a familiar name, but its team has the cred that matters. The studio began with former Firaxis team members—that studio is responsible for the Civilization and XCOM games, among others. So these guys have the strategy bona fides. And Respawn is working with Bit Reactor to bring the game to life.According to Bit Reactor, this Star Wars title is inspired primarily by turn-based games like XCOM, so we can likely look forward to something along those lines in the future.One of the most beloved Star Wars games is Star Wars: Republic Commando, a first-person strategy game, so there's definitely room to slow things down and get tactical in the swashbuckling universe of Star Wars. Bit Reactor hasn't yet announced a title, platform, or release window for this game.Star Wars EclipseStar Wars Eclipse is an upcoming Star Wars game set in the High Republic period of Star Wars history, in development at Quantic Dream. The High Republic period is the period set from about 500 to 100 years before the Star Wars era we're most familiar with. Anakin Skywalker wasn't born yet, and the Sith seemed like a distant memory.Quantic Dream is the studio best known for Heavy Rain and Detroit: Become Human, both of which are interactive adventure games focused heavily on player decision and branching storylines, rather than more typical game mechanics like action and strategy. With those two pieces of information in mind, we can assume that Star Wars Eclipse will look pretty different from other Star Wars titles.With that said, Quantic Dream hasn't shown much other than a vibes-heavy trailer. We don't know what the game will play like, when it will release, or what platforms it will release on. Quantic has previously been a PlayStation-first developer, but Star Wars games are rarely platform exclusives—so we'll see.Knights of the Old Republic remakeThis one is on the list primarily because it hasn't been officially canceled. A remake was announced in 2021 as a timed exclusive for PlayStation 5, with Aspyr Media working on the remake. Aspyr has been porting and re-releasing Star Wars games for over 20 years, including the latest Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars Battlefront re-releases, so it seemed like shoo-in.Embracer Group, the owner of Aspyr Media, shifted the game to another of its studios, Saber Interactive last year, and just recently announced that it sold Saber Interactive. According to Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, this remake is going along with Saber Interactive in the sale, but that doesn't shed any light on if and when it's coming out. The game has not been officially canceled as mentioned, but you should consider it on the backburner for now.Untitled Star Wars Jedi 3After two critically acclaimed Star Wars Jedi titles, we can say with some certainty that EA and Respawn are working on a third entry. This hasn't yet been officially confirmed, though; actor Cameron Monaghan, who plays protagonist Cal Kestis, has said that the game is in the works. That's not enough to call it official just yet, but it's worth keeping an eye on.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order released in late 2019, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (shown) released in early 2023; that's less than 3 years of development on a full-sized, well-received sequel, in a time when games stay in development for upwards of five or more years before releasing. So if we're going to hear about a new game in the series, we imagine it'll be soon.Untitled Star Wars GameOf all the games on this list, the untitled Star Wars game from Skydance New Media is the one we know the least about. The game is being led by Uncharted 2: Among Thieves director Amy Hennig, who is also directing the Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra game for the studio.Hennig previously worked on a canceled Star Wars game for Electronic Arts with the working title of Project Ragtag. With Hennig currently helming that Marvel game, we expect this one to be quite a ways out, and the studio hasn't said yet what kind of game it will be or given any indication of when we can expect it.Edited by Andrew HaywardEditor's note: All of the games above are expected to be traditional or "Web2" games without crypto or blockchain elements.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Spain to Block Telegram Access: Key Dates Revealed


Spain’s High Court has ordered a temporary suspension of the popular messaging app, Telegram, effective from March 25, 2024. 
This decision comes after several media companies, including Atresmedia, EGEDA, Mediaset, and Telefonica, lodged complaints alleging that Telegram facilitated the unauthorized sharing of their content. Judge Santiago Pedraz sanctioned the suspension to allow a thorough investigation into these claims.
Spain Suspends Telegram
Under this directive, it will be incumbent upon mobile service providers across Spain to implement the blockade against Telegram’s operations. This measure marks a significant development, considering Telegram’s status as the country’s fourth most utilized messaging platform. 
The platform, celebrated for its robust encryption and privacy features, boasts a user base encompassing nearly 19% of the Spanish population.
FACUA, an NGO for the defense of consumer rights, warns of the enormous damages the judicial decision will cause for this messaging application’s millions of users and the companies, organizations, and public and private institutions that disseminate content lawfully through their channels on this platform.


“It’s as if they shut down the internet because there are websites that illegally host content protected by copyright, as if they cut off all television signals because there are networks that engage in piracy,” FACUA Activist Rubén Sánchez said.

The suspension raises questions about the balance between copyright protection and digital freedoms. Telegram, which reported over 700 million monthly active users globally in 2023, is at a critical juncture. The company’s response to the suspension, as well as further commentary from the High Court, remains pending.

This development affects millions of Telegram users and sets a precedent for how digital platforms are regulated in Spain.

9 Cryptocurrencies to Keep On Your Watchlist This Week: Price Analysis - Coin Edition


							

The prices of XEC, BTT, and XLM might extend toward new highs as bulls dominate the charts.
SUI presented a buy signal at $1.46, ALGO sellers became weak while LTC might pull back.
RB flashed a sell signal, FIL’s price might decrease while INJ displayed high volatility. 




After a widespread hike a few weeks ago, the prices of many cryptocurrencies have decreased. While some have made attempts at hitting previous peaks, most have been unsuccessful. However, there have been a select few that have defied the odds. Here is a thorough assessment of nine cryptocurrencies in the market. Read on.



eCash (XEC)



XEC was one of the tokens which outperformed the majority of the cryptocurrencies in the market. At press time, XEC changed hands at $0.000063. This was a 22.75% increase in the last 24 hours.



CoinMarketCap also showed that eCash’s volume jumped by 1,948% within the same period. The rise in volume meant that demand for the token was not artificial. If the volume continues to rise alongside the price, XEC might rise higher.



From a technical perspective, the Bollinger Bands (BB) indicated that volatility had increased around the token, suggesting massive price fluctuations. However, the upper band of the BB also touched XEC at $0.000065, indicating that it was overbought.





The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also hit 80.03 before its recent decrease, confirming the BB indications. However, the RSI reading had begun to increase, suggesting that XEC’s retracement was only for a short period. 



Should bullish momentum dominate the charts, XEC’s price might rise toward $0.000070. On the other hand, the value of the token might decrease if bulls stall their influence.



Bittorent (BTT)



BTT was another token that displayed an uptrend on the 4-hour chart on March 23. Like XEC, the 24-hour volume also increased. But a bearish engulfing candlestick reversed the uptrend later on.



As a result, BTT’s price declined to $0.0000014. However, bulls were trying to push the price back up to $0.0000016 at press time. With the underlying support at $0.0000013, the attempt might be successful.





The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also supported the bias as its reading flipped positive. As it stands, BTT’s price might extend as high as $0.0000018 in the short term.



Algorand (ALGO)



An analysis of the 4-hour ALGO/USD chart showed that the token was coming out of its depression phase. Previously, ALGO’s price had dropped from $0.32 to $0.22. But an upswing in the last 24 hours indicated that the correction might be over.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also backed up this forecast as the oscillator went northward.  While ALGO attempts to climb, traders might need to watch out for resistance at $0.26, and another at $0.29.



If bulls can blast past the resistance, then ALGO might hit $0.30 in the short term. Conversely, bearish resistance might send the price back to $0.22.





Litecoin (LTC)



On the 4-hour timeframe, LTC mirrored a battle between bulls and bears. At press time, the coin was 17.98% down from the peak it reached on March 11. A look at the Fibonacci retracement showed that Litecoin’s price might pull back as low as $79.15.



This was where the 0.786 Fib level was positioned. Meanwhile, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) envisioned a bullish trajectory for LTC. But as of this writing, a red histogram bar had appeared on the AO, suggesting that the upward outlook could be invalidated.





SUI



There was almost no bullish conviction on the SU/UD 4-hour structure. As of this writing, bears continued to dictate the direction of the price as it fell to $1.64. However, the massive decline meant that SUI sellers might soon be exhausted, and bulls might capitalize on that.



Signals from the Money Flow Index (MFI) agreed with this prediction as its reading reversed upwards. Interestingly, the Supertrend also aligned with the MFI, showing a possible buying opportunity at $1.64.





Filecoin (FIL)



Filecoin almost hit $9.50 on March 22. But it encountered rejection at $9.17, leading the price to drop below the psychological $9 region.



From the analysis below, FIL’s price might continue to decline due to indications from the RSI. At press time, the RSI reading was 46.61, suggesting bearish momentum. However, the MACD was attempting to move into a positive territory.



If the MACD becomes positive, the signal from the RSI might take a backseat and FIL’s price might rise toward $10.65. But if the momentum stalls, the price of the token might decline to $8.02.





Arbitrum (ARB)



Despite the massive downturn ARB experienced, the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) flashed a sell signal. At press time, the 50 EMA (yellow) had crossed over the 20 EMA (blue), confirming the bearish bias. 



Furthermore, ARB’s price was lower than both levels. With this trend, the value of the token might be set to hit $1.55 as there was little to no bullish appearance on the charts.





Stellar (XLM)



XLM’s trend of the 4-hour chart depicted a token set to leave the red candlesticks behind for a new high. As of this writing, XLM had gained 3.08% in the last 24 hours, and the Aroon indicator revealed that there could be more.



At the time of wrting the Aroon Up (orange) had a higher ratio than the Aroon Down (blue). Furthermore, the RSI reading displayed increased buying momentum which could help the token price increase.





Injective (INJ)



The INJ market structure was largely bearish at press time.  However, the Bollinger Bands indicated that the token was oversold as the lower band hit the price at $34.75.  This trend meant that INJ might have presented a buy signal considering the high volatility around the token.



In a highly bullish case, INJ’s price might extend to $39.39. For the bearish phase, the 4-hour analysis showed that the cryptocurrency might not slide below $34.80. 





Another indicator we looked at was the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) whose reading was negative. To validate INJ’s bullish outlook, more capital has to flow into the cryptocurrency. If not, the value might decrease much more than the prediction mentioned above.

Bitcoin shows resilience amidst market volatility, gains modestly

Bitcoin (BTC) demonstrated resilience in the face of market volatility over the weekend, posting a modest gain of 0.3. The leading cryptocurrency closed the session at $65,587.76 partially recovering from a 2.57% loss incurred.Grayscale Bitcoin Trust outflows ease, contributing to modest gainsThe decline in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) provided a glimmer of hope for Bitcoin’s price trajectory, contributing to the cryptocurrency’s modest gains. Throughout the week, GBTC witnessed a notable decrease in net outflows, reaching its lowest point on Friday at $169.9 million compared to $358.8 million on March 21. This downward trend signaled a positive sentiment among investors as the trading week drew to a close.However, despite Bitcoin’s overall gain, the BTC-spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market experienced significant net outflows totaling $887.7 million for the week ending March 22. Both the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw declines in net inflows compared to the previous week. IBIT’s net inflows plummeted to $828.3 million, while FBTC observed a decrease to $79.4 million.Navigating Bitcoin’s market sentiment and investor confidenceThe divergence in investor sentiment was evident, with the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Although the index increased marginally from 73 to 74 on Sunday, it remained within the Greed Zone. However, further losses in Bitcoin could prompt a transition towards the Neutral zone, potentially impacting investor confidence.while the decline in outflows from GBTC offered a positive outlook for Bitcoin, the broader trends in the BTC-spot ETF market and investor sentiment underscored the volatility and uncertainty prevailing in the cryptocurrency market. Investors remained vigilant, closely monitoring market dynamics and key indicators to gauge the direction of Bitcoin’s price movements in the near term.Michael Saylor’s perspective and near-term considerationsMichael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, remains steadfast in his optimism despite the fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market. His recent actions and statements reflect a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s potential as a superior asset class. Saylor has been vocal about Bitcoin’s advantages over traditional assets like gold, asserting that Bitcoin will eventually surpass gold as the preferred store of value.Saylor’s perspective on Bitcoin is particularly noteworthy amidst a landscape where celebrity endorsements of cryptocurrencies have become less frequent. Unlike the previous bull market, where numerous high-profile figures endorsed various cryptocurrencies, Saylor’s consistent support for Bitcoin stands out.MicroStrategy, under Saylor’s leadership, made headlines recently with its substantial purchase of an additional 12,000 BTC, amounting to approximately $821.7 million. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation and influence in popular cultureThis acquisition was funded through convertible notes and excess cash and was executed at an average price of $68,477 per Bitcoin. With this latest purchase, MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 205,000 BTC, representing an overall investment of about $6.91 billion. This accumulation of Bitcoin underscores MicroStrategy’s unwavering confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term value proposition.Moreover, Saylor’s influence extends beyond the realm of traditional finance and into popular culture. With rapper Drake’s recent Instagram post about Bitcoin, the digital asset space is likely to garner increased public attention. This intersection of finance and entertainment underscores the growing mainstream acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Who's the Top Dog? The 7 Most Expensive Meme NFTs Ever Sold - Decrypt

Last Monday, an on-chain photo of a puppy in a knit beanie sold for slightly more than $4.3 million. While such a statement might sound absurd—and this might not make a huge difference—the dog featured in the photo was no random hound, but Achi: the Shiba Inu from the iconic Dogwifhat internet meme. At over $4.3 million, the Achi NFT became the most expensive meme NFT ever sold. But it was hardly the first. For years, the healthy overlap of internet and crypto cultures has spawned NFT incarnations of some of the most famous memes of all time.Here’s a run down of the most expensive meme-inspired NFTs ever acquired. 1) Dogwifhat: $4.3 millionThe Dogwifhat meme (cropped). Image: FoundationThis week’s massive Dogwifhat NFT sale—which clocked in at 1,210.759 ETH, worth $4,311,234 at the time of purchase—owes much of its success to the popularity of the original Dogwifhat meme, which emerged online in late 2019. But more than anything else, the piece likely fetched such an eye-popping price due to the runaway success of WIF, a Solana meme coin inspired by the meme that has exploded in value over the last few months. Since its creation in December, WIF has skyrocketed in value. Last week, the token reached a record $3 billion market capitalization, shortly after several WIF community members raised nearly $700,000 to plaster the face of Achi—the dog featured in the meme—on Sphere, the massive LED screen-covered arena in Las Vegas.The NFT photo was auctioned by Achi’s South Korean owners, who netted some $4.1 million on the sale after fees—far more than they ever expected to earn from the photo of their puppy they casually took in 2018, auction coordinator Path told Decrypt. The photo sold to GCR, a prominent pseudonymous crypto trader, via an auction on the digital art platform Foundation. 2) Doge: $4.2 millionKabosu, the meme mascot of Dogecoin. Image: Very.AuctionPrior to last week, the record for most expensive meme-related NFT of all time was held by the godfather of all dog-related memes: the original Doge. That sale made waves back in the heyday of the NFT boom, on June 11, 2021—when an NFT of the original photo that inspired the Doge meme, taken by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato of her Shiba Inu Kabosu, sold for millions of dollars (then a first). The NFT ended up selling for a larger sum of ETH than the Dogwifhat NFT: 1,696.9 ETH. Due to Ethereum’s lower price at the time, though, that sum equaled roughly $4.234 million. The Doge meme wasn’t just integral to internet culture at the time; it was also foundational to crypto, having inspired Dogecoin, the first-ever meme coin.“Doge is perhaps one of the most important memes of internet culture,” Santiago Santos, a member of investment collective PleasrDAO, which purchased the Doge NFT, told Decrypt at the time. PleasrDAO then proceeded to split the Doge NFT into billions of fractionalized tokens, a move that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in value and has since fueled an entire ecosystem of Doge-loving crypto users. 3) Pepe the Frog: $3.5 millionOn October 5, 2021, the original Pepe the Frog Genesis NFT—created by Matt Furie, the artist behind the internet-famous green amphibian at one point co-opted by the alt right—sold for a whopping 1,000 ETH, worth about $3.5 million at the time of sale. Pepe, of course, does not only have cachet in general internet circles; the meme has long been deeply interwoven with crypto culture, and as recently as last year inspired Pepecoin, an Ethereum meme coin that’s seen major success.Feels good man. Image: Matt FurieThe Pepe NFT represents the file of the first-ever comic panel drawn by Furie depicting the character, created in November 2006. It sold to Starry Night Capital, an NFT fund established by crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and pseudonymous investor Vincent Van Dough in 2021.When Three Arrows collapsed in 2022, the liquidator behind the firm’s bankruptcy proceedings seized NFTs in its possession and began selling them off to pay back creditors. Just this week, as part of that liquidation process, Sotheby’s brokered a sale of the Pepe NFT to crypto executive Andrew Kang for an undisclosed sum. 4) Charlie Bit My Finger: $760,999One of early YouTube’s most iconic videos, Charlie Bit My Finger, made the move on-chain during the NFT craze of 2021. Why? The parents of the titular, then-teething Charlie and his older brother saw the success of other meme NFT sales, and hoped to turn their viral moment into funds that might cover both boys’ college tuitions.The gambit worked quite effectively: On May 22, 2021, an NFT of the video sold for $760,999 to Dubai-based collector 3FMusic. At first, the family from the viral video planned to take the video off YouTube after the sale to increase the NFT’s significance. 3FMusic reportedly said they didn’t care if the video remained online, and so it remains on YouTube to this day. 5) Nyan Cat: $590,000Nyan Cat, a pixelated animation of a cat with a Pop-Tart for a torso, first took the internet by storm in 2011. Ten years later, the image’s creator, artist Chris Torres, thought to sell the animation as an NFT. The piece would go on to garner far more interest than many expected, and effectively kicked off the concept of meme NFTs as an asset class.On February 19, 2021—just before NFTs permeated broader cultural consciousness—Torres sold the Nyan Cat NFT for 300 ETH, then worth about $590,000, to an anonymous crypto user.In the months that followed, numerous other creators of famous memes followed Torres’ lead and began auctioning their own iconic images as NFTs—finally allowing them to meaningfully profit off of, and take ownership over, the pieces of internet history they brought into existence. “It kind of became a trend, not just for me, but for many meme artists that created anything since then. It’s always been kind of a struggle,” Torres told Decrypt in 2021. 6) Disaster Girl: $430,000One of those first legendary meme creators to follow Torres’ lead was Zoe Roth, who as a toddler posed in front a burning building with a subtle smirk that’s since become internet shorthand for taking pleasure in chaos. The meme, called Disaster Girl, was a foundational meme of the 2000s.Disaster Girl. Image: Zoe RothIn mid-2021, Roth auctioned an NFT of the original photo from the meme on Foundation. On April 17, it sold for 180 ETH, then worth roughly $430,000. The piece ended up with 3FMusic, the NFT collector who now owns several NFTs on this list. 7) Overly Attached Girlfriend: $411,000Spring 2021 was the heyday for meme NFT auctions; in fact, every piece on this list besides the reigning champ (Dogwifhat) was sold in 2021, in the months following the seminal sale of Nyan Cat.Just weeks after that NFT auction, Laina Morris—the content creator immortalized in a 2012 meme as ‘Overly Attached Girlfriend’—took the dive into blockchain tech herself, auctioning off an NFT of the photo from the meme on Foundation.The sale went swimmingly, with Morris netting 200 ETH, worth $411,000 at the time, for the digital token. The piece went to NFT collector 3FMusic.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Anonymous whales have shifted a staggering half trillion Shiba Inu tokens in the last 24 hours. What is the plan, and are these whales somehow connected to each other? Transactions data will hopefully help us out here.Taking a look at the details, it seems a few key players are moving SHIB between wallets and exchanges. For instance, 77.18 billion SHIB were transferred to a Coinbase wallet, while another 205 billion made their way to and from different wallets, including a major 53.06 billion SHIB to Robinhood's wallet. Are these transactions connected? It's hard to say, but they sure seem coordinated.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewNow, turning to SHIB's price performance, we see it has been on a roller coaster. Currently, SHIB is hovering around the $0.000027 mark. After a major uptick, SHIB is experiencing what looks like a slight pullback. The key support level right now is sitting near $0.000019, a floor it has managed to stay above recently. If it can maintain this level, there is room for cautious optimism.As for resistance, SHIB faces a hurdle at around the $0.000030 level. If it can break through that ceiling, we could witness another growth phase, possibly aiming for highs not seen since the last peak.Looking ahead, if SHIB can leverage its recent movements and the market regains its bullish stance, we might see these anonymous whale activities as the prelude to a price surge. With the market seeming to be on the cusp of recovery after being down for a couple of weeks, SHIB could benefit and possibly see an uptrend.

This Ethereum Layer 2 Network Went Offline for 12 Hours


Polygon’s zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) encountered significant downtime lasting over 12 hours.
Indeed, several crypto stakeholders raised concerns about the network’s inability to produce blocks for several hours. This outage prompted comparisons with Solana, raising questions about the Polygon’s reliability and scalability.
Polygon (MATIC) Goes Offline
Polygon attributed the downtime to a glitch in the protocol sequencer triggered by a Layer 1 reorganization. In Layer 2 networks, a sequencer ensures transaction verification, organization, and compression before transmitting them to Layer 1 chains like Ethereum. The team assured users that efforts were underway to resolve the issue, promising a detailed post-mortem report soon.
Fortunately, other Polygon platforms, such as the PoS chain and the Chain Development Kit (CDK), and protocols utilizing the CDK remained unaffected. The issues have been resolved as of press time, with the network showing activity on PolygonScan.

“The zkEVM mainnet network is completed and re-indexing (internal transactions) is in progress,” an update on the zkEVM section of Polygonscan stated.

However, this incident poses significant challenges for the Layer 2 network, which has struggled since its inception last year. Emin Gün Sirer, the founder of Ava Labs, cautioned against “trash L2s,” noting the potential for fraudulent practices. 
While not explicitly naming any protocol, Sirer highlighted red flags for the Layer 2 ecosystem, urging stakeholders to exercise diligence in their evaluations.


“It has become really easy to launch a trash L2, and it’s fairly easy to do that trick, perfected by a certain chain that reorgs every other day, where you find someone who is actually doing real work and you parrot what they say, while angling for a photo op with Vitalik,” Sirer remarked.

Sirer specifically warned against networks employing centralized sequencers without robust fraud prevention mechanisms. He also warned against “projects that sell tokens now to raise money to do the work that will lead to some other technology later.”

Still, Polygon has announced plans to upgrade the zkEVM protocol in the coming weeks. The firm recognizes the need for enhancements in its current beta phase.

Notably, these issues had little impact on Polygon’s MATIC token. The digital asset recorded a modest growth of more than 2% to trade at $0.9954 as of press time, while on-chain data reveals that Polygon retains a modest Total Value Locked (TVL) of $152 million and a transaction volume of 308,000 in the last 30 days.

Coinbase's Base Hits $2 Billion: Airdrops & Meme Coins Revealed


Coinbase’s Layer 2 solution, Base, has surpassed $2 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), marking a 43.61% surge over the past week. 
This milestone reflects the growing traction and interest in this network, particularly focusing on meme coins and airdrops.
Coinbase’s Base Network on the Rise
Base, engineered on the Optimism tech stack, has been pivotal in scaling Ethereum by enhancing transaction speed and reducing costs, all while maintaining the robust security of the Ethereum mainnet. The success of Base can largely be attributed to its parent company, Coinbase. 
This is a behemoth cryptocurrency exchange with a valuation surpassing $60 billion. Coinbase’s strategic positioning as the custodian for 90% of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and its alliance with giants like Blackrock and Circle have significantly contributed to Base’s momentum. 
Indeed, Jesse Pollak, the architect behind Base, highlighted that a substantial portion of Coinbase’s revenue is funneled into Base’s development. 

“We are ramping up gas grants to let builders get started building for free and build gasless experiences, [as well as] builder grants to reward folks who make a positive impact on base and give them resources to build the next thing. Gas grants will be upfront, with path to scaling. Builder grants will be primarily retroactive because we’ve observed that creates aligned incentives and a strong builder culture,” Pollak said. 


This strategic move reflects Coinbase’s vision of leveraging Base as a gateway for over 110 million users into the crypto market. The platform’s integration with Coinbase’s expansive user base provides a fertile ground for user acquisition, a common challenge for new blockchains.

For this reason, this strategy has led to an unprecedented uptick in Base’s adoption. In March, daily new users hit 800,000, revenue climbed from $18 million to $28 million, and daily transactions soared from 500,000 to 2 million. 
This surge is partially attributed to the Ethereum Dencun upgrade. The implementation of EIP-4844 drastically reduced network fees, making Base a formidable competitor for high-frequency trading.
Base Meme Coins and Airdrops to Watch 

The momentum around Base suggests a growing interest in meme coins and airdrops. With the ecosystem still in its infancy, the potential for discovery and investment in meme coins is vast. 
According to analyst Miles Deutscher, a methodical approach involving the tracking of token trading volumes and holder counts can unveil promising opportunities within this space. Toshi Base, for instance, is a meme coin that stands due to its strong community and its position as a first mover.

“Those who follow my content know I’m a proponent of following the leader when it comes to narrative trading, in this case TOSHI is the leading meme on Base,” Deutscher emphasized.

Moreover, the anticipation of new protocols launching on Base and the potential for ecosystem airdrops presents a lucrative prospect for users and investors. 
Influencer Gargoyle pointed out that the most profitable on Base may have a good chance of launching an airdrop. These include bridges like Across and Stargate, decentralized exchanges like ODOS and Aerodrome, and lending protocols like Moonwell and Seamless. 
Although Base has no immediate plans for a native token, history suggests anything is possible. With opportunities abounding in meme coins and airdrops, Base appears poised for further expansion.

Why Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF Will Run Dry of BTC in 96 Days


Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have significantly impacted the crypto market since their debut in January. Even marker observers have been impressed with the record performance of these financial products. 
However, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), one of the prominent products, has experienced consistent outflows, sparking concerns about its future trajectory.
Grayscale’s GBTC Bitcoin Reserve Depletes
Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics firm, has forecasted that GBTC could deplete its Bitcoin reserves within the next 96 days if the current rate of redemptions persists. 
Since its conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF in January, Grayscale’s Bitcoin balance has plummeted by 266,470 BTC. This marks a significant decline from its initial holding of approximately 620,000 BTC. 
The downward trend is attributed to consistent outflows from GBTC averaging 25,900 BTC per week.

“Grayscale started the year holding 618,280 BTC for their Bitcoin Trust GBTC. They now hold only 356,440 BTC. If they carry on like this, there’s only 14 weeks until they run out for good,” analysts at Arkham Intelligence remarked.

Grayscale’s CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, acknowledged the anticipated outflows, attributing them primarily to profit-taking investors and arbitragers exiting the fund. On the other hand, market observers have attributed the GBTC outflows to its high fee structure. At the same time, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, noted that the past week’s outflows were predominantly from the defunct crypto lender Genesis. 

Grayscale is exploring various initiatives to counteract this outflow trend. Some of these include introducing a mini fund providing a cost-effective alternative to GBTC. Sonnenshein also mentioned the firm’s plan to reduce its 1.5% fee, which stands in stark contrast to competitors’ rates ranging from 0.2% to 0.5%.

“We have seen this in countless other exposures, countless other markets, you name it, where typically when products are earlier in their lifecycle, when they’re new to be introduced, these tend to be higher. And, as those markets mature, and as those funds grow, those fees tend to come down, and we expect the same to be true of GBTC,” Sonnenshein said.

Investment Genius Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is Headed To $1.5 Million - Here’s Why


								Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has reiterated her bullish stance on Bitcoin. The investment mogul, who recently disclosed she allocated 25% of her wealth into Bitcoin, has now predicted the cryptocurrency is on a highway to new highs. 

Particularly, Wood called Bitcoin a “financial super highway,” amidst discussions of its importance in emerging markets. As a result, she reiterated that the price of Bitcoin could end up as high as $3.8 million.
Cathie Wood Reiterates Bullish Stance On Bitcoin
Wood made her very bullish prediction at a Friday Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York. Interestingly, this recent prediction surpasses another one made in January where she predicted that the digital asset could potentially hit $1.5 million by 2030. This means Bitcoin could increase by another $2.3 million after reaching her existing target. 
Wood credits this price growth to a major shift in the global market dynamics as Bitcoin continues to receive adoption, especially in developing countries. She made a case of Nigeria, whose struggle with unprecedented inflation in recent times has pushed its citizens to run to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to hedge against inflation. 
“There are signals that not all is well in the world,” she said.
Interestingly, Wood revealed that Ark Invest, her investment company, has now diverted most of its attention into emerging markets such as this. She also noted that Bitcoin could continue on a price surge as institution interest continues to rise and institutions start to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolio to the cryptocurrencies. 
At the same time, Wood believes the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent greenlight for institutional investment in Bitcoin is a huge driving force for its growth to $3.8 million.
“We think Bitcoin has miles to go,” Wood said.

Bitcoin is now trading at $64.936. Chart: TradingView
What’s Next For Bitcoin?
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $64,256, up by 25% in the past 30 days. Most of Bitcoin’s price growth in the past few months has been centered around the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Wood’s Ark Invest was one of the Bitcoin ETF issuers approved by the SEC and has done relatively well since then. These ETFs have now received a total net flow of $11.269 billion since their launch.

Bitcoin, however, is currently struggling with its price surge. The crypto is now down 12% from an all-time high of $73,780 which it attained earlier in the month. At the same time, Spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed consecutive days of outflows last week amidst the price struggle. On the other hand, Bitcoin continues to attract bullish sentiment from investors and the cryptocurrency could resume its price surge very soon.

EU implements strict ban on unidentified self-hosted crypto wallets | Cryptopolitan

The European Union has dropped the hammer on anonymous crypto transactions. This new rule is not just a small tweak in the financial landscape; it’s a seismic shift. With the stroke of a pen, every crypto payment zipping from one unidentified self-hosted wallet to another just got the boot. Why? Because the EU’s latest anti-money laundering crusade says so. This isn’t about slapping a few wrists; it’s about chaining the whole playground. As of March 19, thanks to a majority nod from the EU Parliament’s leadership committee, the game has officially changed. EU’s Fresh Stance on Money LaunderingThe plot thickens as we dive into the details. The heart of the matter is a new set of laws designed to give money laundering the cold shoulder. The EU Parliament, with its eyes wide open, has decided that unidentified self-custody crypto wallets shouldn’t mingle with “hosted wallets.” This decision didn’t just pop out of thin air; it was the result of a calculated move by the majority of the EU Parliament’s lead commission, spotlighting the issue on March 19.Now, let’s talk characters. Among the chorus of yeses, two voices sang out of tune. Dr. Patrick Breyer, waving the flag for the Deutsch Piraten Partei, and Gunnar Beck from the Alternative for Germany party, stood their ground against the tide. They weren’t buying what the EU was selling.This law isn’t just about giving the anonymous crypto transactions the side-eye. It’s bigger. Cash transactions are also getting a facelift. Imagine walking into a store and the cash in your wallet suddenly feels heavier because, beyond €10,000, it’s a no-go. And let’s not even start on the €3,000 cap for anonymous cash transactions. The message is clear: Big Brother wants to know where your money is going.The Ripple Effect on SocietyAs this unfolds, it’s not just about what the law says; it’s about when it kicks in and who’s keeping score. The clock starts ticking three years after this legislation struts into the spotlight. But whispers in the legal corridors, specifically from the folks at Dillon Eustace, suggest this might hit the ground running way sooner.Then there’s L0la L33tz, an independent journalist, who’s been keeping an eagle eye on the proceedings. According to L33tz, this isn’t the final curtain call. The EU Parliament’s lead committees might have given the nod, but there are more hoops to jump through before this becomes the law of the land.Dr. Breyer, not one to mince words, questions the whole circus. He’s all for catching the bad guys but wonders if stripping away financial privacy is the silver bullet the EU thinks it is. In his view, this move doesn’t just nip crime in the bud; it cuts deeper, slicing into the very essence of financial freedom. His argument? For eons, cash has been the cloak of privacy for society, shielding us from the prying eyes of overreach. This new law, according to Breyer, could spell the dawn of a new age where every penny we spend leaves digital breadcrumbs leading straight back to us.But there’s more. The citizens of the EU aren’t just sitting back and knitting. They’ve been here before. Cast your mind back to 2017, when the EU thought about putting the brakes on cash transactions. The response? A resounding “Heck, no!” from over 90% of those who chimed in. To them, paying in cash wasn’t just about convenience; it was about holding on to a sliver of freedom in an increasingly digital world.And it’s not just the folks on the street. Experts in the shadow economy, like Friedrich Schneider, weigh in, suggesting that these measures are likely just a drop in the ocean when it comes to fighting crime.So, where does this leave us? On the brink of a new era, where every transaction is under the microscope.

What's Behind Shiba Inu Shibarium's Impressive 170% TVL Spike?


Shibarium, the Layer 2 blockchain within the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem, has reached noteworthy milestones, indicative of its growing utility and adoption.
On-chain data shows a remarkable surge in the total value of assets locked (TVL) on Shibarium, marking an increase of approximately 170% within the last two days. The value now stands at $3.85 million, underlining the platform’s expanding utility and user engagement.
Shibarium’s TVL Surged by 170%
Shibarium’s TVL surge can be attributed to the rollout of new features within the ecosystem. Notably, the recent introduction of the DAMN meme coin on the Woofswap decentralized exchange has added to excitement revolving around meme coins across various blockchains. 
Among them, DAMN emerges as a notable contender, garnering significant attention from the Shib army and the broader crypto community. What sets DAMN apart is its feature enabling the burning of Bone Shibaswap, Shibarium’s native gas token, enhancing its appeal.
Shiba Inu market analyst Lucie explained that DAMN was “about the people — primarily BONE holders and the Shibarium community.”


“We’re not spending on marketing; it’s a collective effort to spotlight our ecosystem. A little effort from each one of us can lead to great achievements. Let’s unite and propel forward together,” Lucie said.

Interestingly, DAMN’s price has been on an uptrend since its debut, resulting in significant trading activity on the Woofswap decentralized exchange, which inadvertently impacted Shibarium’s TVL. The DEX currently commands approximately 64% of Shibarium’s total ecosystem activity.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Increases
Recent market data illustrates the Shiba Inu meme coin’s ongoing ascent, coinciding with its ecosystem’s expansion. According to BeInCrypto data, SHIB’s price has surged by over 2.45% within the last 24 hours, reaching $0.00002791. This upward trajectory extends a remarkable growth streak, surpassing 193% in the past month.
Notably, this surge aligns with a surge in short-term investors acquiring SHIB. This class of investors accumulated 64 trillion tokens over the last 30 days, according to analysts at IntoTheBlock.

“Shiba Inu traders with holdings spanning less than a month have seen a remarkable surge, marking a 278% increase in the last 30 days,” IntoTheBlock’s content creator Slim Daddy said.

However, despite this positive momentum, the Shiba Inu ecosystem experienced an unexpected decline in SHIB’s burn rate. Over the previous week, the meme coin’s burn rate dropped by 52%, marked by approximately 360 million SHIB tokens being withdrawn from circulation.

Crypto market's weekly winners and losers - TON, FTM, BONK, JUP - AMBCrypto



ONDO, TON, and FTM had the week’s biggest gains.
INJ, JUP, and BONK were the biggest losers for the week.

Last week was marked by a general decline in bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, which impacted the performance of several assets. 
During that period, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization fell by 7%. Here’s AMBCrypto’s list of the biggest winners and losers from the 17th to the 24th of March.
Biggest winners
Ondo [ONDO]
Ondo [ONDO], the native token of securities tokenization project Ondo Finance, led the cryptocurrency market as the asset with the most gains in the last week. 
Exchanging hands at $0.75 at press time, the token’s value rose by over 57% over the last seven days.
On the 21st of March, ONDO climbed to an all-time high of $0.81. This followed reports that BlackRock had committed another round of capital to launch a tokenized money market fund. 
Although ONDO’s price was up almost 10% in the past 24 hours, the double-digit decline in its trading volume within the same period created a divergence that hinted at a possible drawback in the token’s value. 
Toncoin [TON]
Per CoinMarketCap’s data, TON saw an impressive weekly rally of 46% to rank as the asset with the second-highest gains last week.
The surge in the token’s price was due to the commencement of the first full season of The Open League, which the Ton Foundation announced on 20th March. 
According to the blog post, the program will allow TON-based projects to compete for rewards, and the network’s users will receive rewards for their on-chain activity. 
Through this event, 30 million TON worth around $115 million will be distributed to ecosystem members. 
As of this writing, the altcoin exchanged hands at $5.10, with a 109% uptick in its trading volume in the past 24 hours.
Fantom [FTM]
FTM, the native utility token that powers the entire Fantom blockchain ecosystem, witnessed a 34% growth in its price last week. 
During the week, the token climbed to a 30-day high of $1.18 on 22nd March before witnessing a correction to its current market value of $1.06. 
The double-digit rally in FTM’s value in the last week has been due to the sustained demand for it.
According to its key momentum indicators assessed on a 24-hour chart, despite the general market drawback, FTM investors continue to favor accumulation over selling their holdings for a profit.

Biggest losers
Injective [INJ]
Following an extended period of rally, INJ peaked at $52.38 on 13th March to close the week as the biggest loser. 
Trading at $35.40 at press time, the altcoin’s price fell by 14% in the past seven days and by 32% from its recent peak.
At the beginning of the week, INJ exchanged hands at $41.01. However, as the general market retraced, INJ’s daily trading volume shrunk by 65%, according to Santiment’s data.
 This resulted in a corresponding decline in its value during the period under review. 
Source: Santiment
The low trading volume was due to a decline in demand for the altcoin, on-chain data revealed. Per Santiment’s data, in the last week, the daily count of addresses involved in INJ transactions fell by 33%.
Likewise, the number of new addresses created to trade the altcoin daily plummeted by 14%.
Jupiter [JUP]
JUP, the token that powers Jupiter, the Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX), ranked as the asset with the second-highest losses over the past week. 
At press time, the governance token traded at $1.17, recording a 13% decline in its price during the period under review.
The token attempted to reclaim its $1.4 price mark on the 21st of March, but the buying pressure was not enough to sustain the rally, causing an additional 10% price decline since then.
Extending its weekly losses at press time, JUP’s value was down 3% in the past 24 hours due to a 30% fall in trading volume.
Bonk [BONK]
According to CoinMarketCap’s data, BONK, the Solana-based meme asset, ranked as the token with the third-highest weekly loss. 
During that period, its value plunged by 11%. Although it made attempts at different points to initiate an upward correction, the general market’s bearish sentiment made this impossible. 
Confirming the bearish trend, BONK’s MACD line rested beneath its signal line to suggest that its short-term moving average is trending lower than the longer-term moving average.
 This intersection signals the re-emergence of bears and a rise in selling activity.
Source: BONK/USDT on TradingView
At press time, BONK traded at $0.00002217, seeing a minor 0.23% price rally in the past 24 hours.

Shiba Inu Bulls Optimism For $0.001 SHIB Price In Sight As Shibarium Proves To Be Memecoin Game-Changer ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The Shiba Inu community is in high spirits as Shibarium, its Layer-2 scaling solution, achieves a significant feat by processing over 412 million transactions. This milestone demonstrates the increasing adoption and functionality of Shibarium and reflects the robust growth and enthusiasm within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.



Adding to the excitement, BlueBit, a centralized exchange based in Dubai and Saint Vincent, has announced a strategic partnership with the SHIB community.



This collaboration is expected to strengthen the relationship between the SHIB and Sparrows communities, paving the way for new achievements together.



Shibarium Transactions Milestone



Shibarium Transactions: Shibariumscan



Since its launch in late August 2023, Shibarium has been on a rapid growth trajectory, surpassing 3.8 million total blocks and processing over 412 million transactions.



According to data from the Shibariumscan explorer, the platform has recorded over 412,407,305 transactions, with total blocks reaching 3,825,223 and wallet addresses totalling 1,383,613. Despite its impressive performance, Shibarium has experienced a slight decline in its daily transaction count, which currently stands at 6,700.

&nbsp







The new collaboration between BlueBit and the SHIB community marks a significant milestone for both parties. BlueBit has integrated Shibarium into its platform as part of this partnership, providing users with access to a wider range of digital assets and advanced blockchain solutions.



This integration is expected to enhance Shibarium’s visibility and usability, attracting a broader audience of users and investors.







With Shibarium’s rapid growth comes an increased focus on security. The Shiba Inu development team has implemented several security measures to address this.



One such measure is the adoption of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) within Shibarium’s framework, ensuring greater data privacy and security for users. Additionally, the platform embraces a self-sovereign identity (SSI) approach, empowering users with complete control over their data.



Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis



Shiba Inu experienced a significant price surge, increasing by approximately 300% at the beginning of March and peaking at $0.000045 on March 5. However, following this peak, SHIB’s price declined as holders took yields. This led to a drop in price, with SHIB reaching a low of $0.0000235 on March 16.



Since then, SHIB has been trading in a range, fluctuating between $0.000023 and $0.000030. On-chain data from IntotheBlock supports this price movement, showing that 100.93 trillion SHIB were purchased by 140,030 addresses within this range, with an average price of $0.000026.



In and Out of the Money: IntotheBlock



Looking forward, Shiba Inu is poised to encounter significant resistance from $0.00003 to $0.000037. This range is notable for the acquisition of 29.13 trillion SHIB by 143,770 addresses at an average price of $0.000033. Maintaining within this key range could potentially prevent a 30% decline.



On the other hand, the next support level for SHIB is expected to be between $0.000019 and $0.000023. This range witnessed the purchase of 35.55 trillion SHIB by 47,640 addresses at an average price of $0.000021.



Therefore, Shiba Inu’s ability to sustain the 100 trillion SHIB range could be crucial in avoiding declines to $0.000019, representing nearly a 30% decrease from current levels as bulls highly anticipate the most coveted $0.001 price point.



At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.000027, reflecting a 2.81% drop in the last 24 hours. Shiba Inu remains a topic of interest, particularly in the context of on-chain analytics. Santiment, a leading on-chain analytics firm, has noted that Bitcoin, fiat currencies, and meme coins are the primary focus of traders.

New Restrictions on Anonymous Crypto and Cash Transactions Approved by EU Officials - The Daily Hodl


								European Union (EU) officials are greenlighting new restrictions on anonymous transactions that involve crypto assets and cash.
Reporting on the social media platform X, Patrick Breyer, a German member of the EU Parliament, says that EU officials are banning cash payments over €10,000 ($10,862), anonymous cash payments over €3,000 ($3,258), and crypto payments to hosted wallets with no threshold.










According to Breyer, the crackdown will mean citizens lose much of their financial freedom.
 “Generally prohibiting anonymous payments would at best have minimal effects on crime, but it would deprive innocent citizens of their financial freedom.”
According to Irish law firm Dillon Eustace, the EU will establish the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) to oversee the new rules, which will likely lead to increased supervision for all firms, not just those that will be placed under direct watch.
“AMLA’s presence will not only result in increased AML (anti-money laundering) and CTF (counter-terrorism financing) supervision for selected entities, but for all firms as national supervisory authorities will be under increased scrutiny by AMLA and AMLA’s implementing and/or regulatory technical standards will be binding on all obliged entities, not just those directly supervised entities.”
Regulators in other parts of the world are also looking to crack down on illicit activities centered around digital assets. In 2022, U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said that the Treasury Department would be targeting self-custody crypto wallets.
At the time, Adeyemo said that the anonymity they provide could be exploited by bad actors.

FTX to Sell $1 Billion Stake in AI Firm Anthropic to Pay Off Bankruptcy Debts Amidst Legal Battles



                    
FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that went bankrupt, is in the process of selling its investment in the artificial intelligence company Anthropic, valued at approximately $1 billion. 



This move is part of FTX’s strategy to address its bankruptcy debts, a situation reported by CNBC on March 22. 




Anthropic, an AI firm, is currently evaluating potential buyers for FTX’s stake, with a transaction expected to finalize within the next few weeks. 



Sources close to the situation, preferring anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the financial discussions, informed CNBC of these developments.



The method of sale involves a special purpose vehicle (SPV), a separate corporate entity created to fulfill legal obligations during insolvency situations, indicative of FTX’s current financial state.

Interestingly, the sources revealed that Saudi Arabian entities have been excluded from the bidding process over national security concerns, although it remains unclear if this exclusion pertains to all Saudi investors or just state-related ones. It’s important to note that the shares in question are “Class B” non-voting shares.



The potential sale follows a decision by the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, where Judge John Dorsey authorized FTX to liquidate its Anthropic shares on February 22. 




FTX initially acquired these shares for about $530 million in April 2022, and their value has nearly doubled since, propelled by the surge in generative AI technology, now estimated to be worth around $1 billion.



This development surfaces as FTX’s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, prepares for his sentencing hearing on March 28, after being convicted on seven counts of fraud in November 2023. 



Describing Bankman-Fried’s actions, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams stated, “a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the king of crypto,” and highlighted the scale of the fraud as one of the most significant financial deceptions in U.S. history.

Newly Emerging Cryptocurrency Project Installs Trojans on Users' Computers and Steals Altcoins - Bitcoin Sistemi


A gaming project called Uniapt, which claimed to run on the Ethereum layer-2 platform Blast, was found to be bait used for a fraudulent scheme. The project reportedly tricked users into downloading game files that were actually Trojan viruses.
This method works by convincing innocent users to download these malicious files onto their computers. Once downloaded, these Trojan viruses are designed to steal users' private keys, compromising their security and privacy.



In addition to the fraud, Uniapt successfully applied for and received the Twitter Gold Mark (Yellow Tick). This mark is often seen as a sign of legitimacy and trustworthiness, leading many users to believe in the authenticity of the project.
The X account of the fraudulent project in question is still active and has the yellow tick approved account qualification since December 2023. In addition, the fraudulent cryptocurrency project constantly advises to be careful against fraudsters in its posts on X.

3 best Solana tokens to invest in 2024


The Solana (SOL) ecosystem gained the spotlight in 2024, as investors turned their attention to new tokens launched there. Part of that happened following an impressive meme coin boom using Solana as the layer-1 infrastructure for millionaire trades.
Notably, decentralized finance (DeFi) data from DefiLlama evidence this growth in the ecosystem. The total value locked (TVL) in Solana tokens reached $4.17 billion, a nearly three times increase from the $1.53 billion TVL year-to-date.
Together, the daily volume registered by decentralized exchanges grew from $777 million to $900 million in the same period. This is a direct result of increased trading and investing activity among the best Solana ecosystem coins and protocols.

Best Solana ecosystem coins and tokens to consider investing in
More than just investing in Solana’s native token, SOL, investors can gain exposure to dozens of the ecosystem’s innovative protocols. Finbold selected three of the best projects and their respective tokens being built on the Solana blockchain.
Marinade (MNDE)
First, Marinade (MNDE) is a staking optimization platform that helps investors take the most out of their SOL staking. As Solana is a proof-of-stake network, its security is guaranteed by validators who put their native tokens at stake.
Therefore, staking SOL into the protocol helps improve the network’s decentralization while rewarding the investors proportionally to their stake share. In this context, Marinade aims to facilitate the staking experience and the results with an automated system. 
MNDE is trading at $0.31 by press time, with a TVL of $1.75 billion. This represents a value 22 times higher than the token’s market cap, which suggests an oversold asset in DeFi.

Raydium (RAY)
Second, Raydium (RAY) is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges in the Solana ecosystem. Most Solana tokens are traded in Raydium, which includes the best meme coins from the ecosystem.
With a significant share of the total value locked and volume, RAY is an interesting token to consider investing in. The decentralized exchange has $260 million out of the $904 million 24-hour volume of the ecosystem while trading at $2.04 for a $527 million market cap.

Jupiter (JUP)
Finally, Jupiter (JUP) is one of the new Solana tokens to join its ever-growing list of innovative projects. On that note, Jupiter is a derivative-focused platform, allowing Solana speculators to trade perpetual contracts in a decentralized manner.
JUP is trading at $1.17 with a $1.57 billion capitalization, sitting in the 66th position, according to the CoinMarketCap index. However, only 13.5% of its tokens are circulating after a recent airdrop to Solana’s early investors.
This suggests a not-ideal moment to buy JUP, despite Jupiter being a promising project over 2024.

As observed, Solana is becoming a rich ecosystem with promising tokens and projects for this year. Nevertheless, investors must learn how to identify the best Solana ecosystem coins and their respective entry points to improve results.

5 institutional investors own 22% of the largest Bitcoin mining company


Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) is the world’s largest publicly traded Bitcoin (BTC) mining company. Institutional investors have gradually increased their positions in Marathon despite the block subsidy halving expected in April.
In particular, institutional investors own 38.9% of Marathon’s outstanding shares, holding 104,212,740 out of the 268 million. Finbold gathered this data from Nasdaq, which also shows the top five institutional shareholders of the Bitcoin mining company.
First, Vanguard holds 23.47 million shares (8.76%). Next, BlackRock and Jane Street have 17.19 million (6.42%) and 8.47 million (3.16%), respectively. Morgan Stanley has 6.27 million (2.34%) and State Street is the fifth-largest with 5.42 million (2.02%).


These five institutional investors sum up to 60,837,405 shares and own 22.7% of Marathon Digital Holdings.

Bitcoin halving and its effects on mining companies and institutional investors results
The core revenue of Bitcoin mining companies comes from mining BTC and collecting block rewards in fees and block subsidies. Essentially, miners compete with each other to find the next valid block through proof-of-work, measured in hashrate.
Only one miner (or mining pool) has the right to claim the rewards of each block. In the case of pools, the members will share the reward proportionally to their contributed hashrate.
However, Bitcoin’s block subsidy halves approximately every four years or exactly every 210,000 blocks. Currently, over 98% of the block rewards come from the subsidy, for 900 BTC daily on average. That is the issuance of new BTC units through a ‘coinbase’ transaction.
Within the halving, Bitcoin mining companies will see their revenue cut in nearly half if BTC’s price remains the same. For that reason, stocks like MARA can show some correlation to Bitcoin, price-wise, and its revenue can suffer from this year’s halving.
In conclusion, institutional investors owning a significant part of Marathon and other Bitcoin mining companies show a positive bias towards BTC’s price in the future. As of writing, these finance giants own over one-third of the company’s shares.
This highlights an increased influence from Wall Street over Bitcoin’s security and consensus mechanism. Moreover, the expected revenue drop unveils the challenges of the sector.

Why Did Inflows to Bitcoin Spot ETFs Dry Up? Analysts Comment - Bitcoin Sistemi


Inflows into the 11 new Bitcoin ETFs that received regulatory approval in the US in January reversed this week. A significant $850 million has flowed out of ETFs, causing investors and market watchers to question whether this is a temporary glitch or a sign of a larger pullback for the world's largest cryptocurrency.
Fund inflows into ETFs had previously increased the Bitcoin price to a record level of $73,000 this year. However, the recent decline in its price has dampened investors' interest in ETFs, and bitcoin fell as low as $60,760 at one point this week.


“People looked at how far the Bitcoin price had fallen and decided to wait, no one wants to catch a falling knife,” commented James Butterfill, director of research at crypto investment group CoinShares.

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, recorded inflows of $576 million this week, while little new money entered rival products launched by firms such as Fidelity, Invesco and Franklin Templeton.





These inflows were offset by persistent investor fund withdrawals from Grayscale. The asset manager converted its long-running Bitcoin trust into an ETF in January, but the product carries a much higher management fee than rivals.
“We are approaching a dead zone for these ETF products after the initial pent-up capital frenzy,” warned Ilan Solot, senior global markets strategist at Marex.

Dogecoin Co-Founder Makes Unexpected Bitcoin Statement


In an intriguing twist, the co-founder of Dogecoin, Billy Markus, known for his playful and often satirical takes on the crypto industry, has made a statement that has caught the attention of the crypto community.In a whimsical call to action, Markus urged Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, to reach the astronomical value of 1 million dollars per coin, all while sleeping."Dear Bitcoin, please go to 1 million dollars per coin while i am sleeping. Thanks," Billy Markus, who goes by the name "Shibetoshi Nakamoto" on X, wrote. While the circumstances surrounding Dogecoin's founder statement remain unclear, his recent comment might be tongue-in-cheek given his often humorous takes on the cryptocurrency industry.Dogecoin was created as a joke, making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time. In 2013, software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer launched the satirical cryptocurrency Dogecoin as a way to make fun of Bitcoin.The timing of the tweet also remains crucial, as it coincided with Bitcoin's broad 11% drop from its recently set all-time highs of $73,737. Bitcoin's weakness began when traders began to take profits after it had risen by around 134% in a year.The flagship cryptocurrency was up by 1.39% in the last 24 hours to $65,839, according to CoinMarketCap data. In the past week, Bitcoin fell to as low as $60,760 due to decreasing demand for U.S. exchange-traded funds that hold the cryptocurrency.While some regard the Dogecoin co-founder's remark as a lighthearted joke, others see it as a thought-provoking reflection of Bitcoin's potential to disrupt traditional financial systems and reshape the global economy.As Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream acceptance and adoption, the notion of a $1 million price target, once considered outlandish, may not be as far-fetched as it seems.

Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Hits New Record Amid Chaotic Market Movements


								Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 solution, recently reached an all-time high total value locked (TVL) of over $3.67 million. As if the current bullish sentiment around the Shiba Inu’s ecosystem isn’t enough, its layer-2 solution has now reached a milestone that could lead to a further price surge. 

According to data from DeFiLlama, the total value locked on Shibarium jumped from $1.43 million on March 22 to $3.38 million on March 23, sparking optimism about SHIB’s price.
Shibarium TVL Surges To New Milestone
Shibarium’s total value locked hitting a new high shows the network effect in action. Interestingly, data shows Shibarium’s TVL has spent most of the year below $1 million before crossing over in late February. However, the TVL stands at $3.67 at the time of writing, revealing a positive change in the ecosystem. 
The recent surge in TVL can be particularly attributed to the launch of the DAMN token on WoofSwap, which is a decentralized exchange built on the Shibarium. DAMN quickly gained attention as one of the hottest cryptocurrencies after its launch on March 18. 
According to data from Shibariumscan, this frenzy led to a surge in the number of daily active users to 2,482 on the day of its launch. Similarly, WoofSwap’s TVL has grown by 8,988% in the past seven days. 
Another catalyst for the surge in TVL was the launch of KNINE tokens, a liquid staking solution on the Shibarium blockchain.

Bitcoin is now trading at $65.492. Chart: TradingView
What’s Next For Shiba Inu?
Naturally, Shibarium’s recent milestones have sparked optimism about SHIB’s price as the cryptocurrency is well known to react to updates about the layer-2 network. This growth shows that Shibarium is attracting more users, which could boost SHIB’s price. 
Shibarium’s new milestone saw SHIB rallying 8.8% to $0.00002828 in less than 24 hours. This price rally highlights the close correlation between the growth of Shibarium and the SHIB price.
SHIB is trading at $0.00002806 at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency is in fact, still riding on the back of a 193% gain in the past 30 days despite being 37% down from its $0.00004456 earlier in the month. 

On-chain metrics and investor sentiment point to a continued price surge in the near future. On-chain analytics platform Santiment recently pointed out that Bitcoin, along with SHIB and other meme coins, remained the focus of traders throughout the weekend. SHIB, which naturally has a strong price correlation with Bitcoin, could reignite a surge in tandem.
According to Lucie, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, the price of SHIB could surge by 250% before the next Bitcoin halving which is slated to occur in April.

Dogecoin Soars As Elon Musk's X Payments Gains Ground, Enthusiasts Rally With $800M Boost - Benzinga

Elon Musk's latest endeavors has notably impacted the cryptocurrency market, particularly Dogecoin DOGE/USD.According to the Santiment data, the meme coin, often championed by Musk, saw a remarkable $800 million increase in open interest within three days.Over the past 72 hours, the price of Dogecoin has surged by 35%, hitting a weekly high of $0.17 on Saturday.Also Read: Forget Dogecoin And Shiba Inu — This Meme Coin Has Surged Nearly 70% In Just 24 HoursThe news comes as Musk's X Payments LLC, a social media offshoot of his X motif (X.com, SpaceX, xAI), expands its operational footprint by securing money transmitter licenses in three additional states: New Mexico, Oregon, and Illinois.This development, announced on March 20, 2024, increases the total number of states where X Payments can legally operate to 22.Musk's acquisition of X in 2022 was a step towards transforming it into an "everything app," with integrated payment solutions playing a crucial role.Despite regulatory hurdles slowing down the expansion, adding these states marks significant progress toward achieving Musk's vision to compete with PayPal, where he was previously CEO, as well as Venmo and WhatsApp.Market data indicates that the bullish reaction of DOGE traders to Musk's recent actions has significantly contributed to the ongoing rise in Dogecoin's price.This surge is attributed to speculation that Dogecoin could become the preferred currency for X's payment ecosystem.As X Payments continues to navigate regulatory landscapes and expand its services, the crypto community remains watchful for any developments that could further intertwine Musk's tech and payment innovations with digital currencies like Dogecoin.Now Read: Whopping $33.8 Million Worth Of Dogecoin Shifted To Robinhood — And People Suspect This Person Could Be Behind ItThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image made with Midjourney

                        Friend.tech, a social platform leveraging Web3 technology, has proposed a new ownership model by offering its shares to its users. The move is intended to empower platform users, who were previously mere participants, to become investors with a vested interest in the company’s prosperity. This shift reflects a broader transformation in investment dynamics towards democratization within the digital realm.Friend.tech Users Become Investors
Friend.tech users will now transition from being solely content creators or consumers to becoming actual investors in the platform. The move strengthens the bond between users and the company, fostering a stronger sense of community.This initiative was made possible through an agreement with previous shareholders, including Paradigm, who have consented to transfer the rights of selling tokens directly to the platform’s users.By enabling this transfer, Friend.tech takes a significant step towards a user-centric model, where users not only shape the platform’s future but also share in its success.The shift by Friend.tech opens up new avenues for user engagement and investment within the crypto industry. By providing users with ownership stakes and control over tokens, the company advocates for a more inclusive and equitable approach to technology entrepreneurship and governance. The move challenges the status quo of venture capital financing and signals a shift towards broader user participation and investment. Users are now empowered to directly impact the platform’s trajectory, fostering a cooperative culture.It is also important to note that Paradigm played a key role in the move. Known for investing in innovative technology ventures, the crypto VC agreed to distribute shares among users, signaling a rise in more decentralized and user-focused business models.Friend.tech’s Popularity Drops After Splashy Debut
Friend.tech, launched on August 10, 2023, has become one of the top decentralized applications (dApps) on the Base layer, attracting over 200,000 users and facilitating a trading volume exceeding $230 million.The platform uniquely converts user influence into tradable tokens known as “keys,” allowing users to gain access to a creator’s attention or influence.The model has attracted not only cryptocurrency influencers but also NBA players and esports personalities, broadening its appeal beyond the crypto space.One significant factor contributing to Friend.tech’s popularity was the hype surrounding the Base network, a Layer 2 solution associated with Coinbase.The involvement of Paradigm, an investment firm connected to Coinbase, further increased confidence in Friend.tech’s potential.However, the platform has also faced privacy concerns, particularly regarding the potential for user doxxing due to the link between Twitter profiles and Ethereum addresses.Friend.tech has addressed these concerns by clarifying that the information deemed leaked was actually from their public API, showcasing the platform’s open nature while also highlighting the importance of user caution in protecting personal information.Nevertheless, Friend.tech has seen its popularity drop as of late.According to a Dune analytics dashboard, the project raked in more than $1 million in revenue at its peak last year.However, its revenue has recently fallen to under $15,000 over the past couple of months.

Aptos [APT]: Up by 75% and....? Here's why holders should be wary - AMBCrypto



APT’s price surged by 75% in the last 30 days. 
A few metrics suggested a trend reversal. 

Aptos [APT] has witnessed a massive boost in usage over the last 30 days, reflecting its high adoption. This was corroborated by a rise in its network activity. 
Therefore, AMBCrypto planned to take a look at APT’s state to understand if Q1 2024 will end on a similar note. 
Aptos’ network activity is up
Token Terminal recently posted a tweet highlighting the fact that Aptos’s network usage skyrocketed.
 The blockchain’s daily active users jumped from 64k to 271k over the past 30 days, placing the chain in ninth place across all protocols. 
The rise in network activity also had a positive impact on the token’s price. As per CoinMarketCap, APT’s value surged by nearly 75% in the last 30 days. 
How is APT currently doing?
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Artemis’ data revealed that the blockchain’s network status remained high at press time. 
Notably, its Daily Active Addresses rose. But despite this, APT’s Daily Transactions dropped after a massive spike on 1st of March. 
Source: Artemis
Things in terms of captured value also looked optimistic. This was the case, as both Aptos’ fees and revenue went up in the last month. 
The blockchain was also doing well in the DeFi space, which was evident from the rise in its TVL. 
AMBCrypto then took a look at APT’s metrics to find whether its price action is still responding well to its network activity. As per CoinMarketCap, APT’s price rose by more than 4% in the last 24 hours alone.
 At press time, it was trading at $16.27 with a market capitalization of over $6.4 billion. 
However, a few of the metrics looked bearish. While the token’s price rose, its Open Interest remained low. 
Aptos’ Funding Rate also dropped, meaning that derivatives investors were not buying the token at its press time price.

Read Aptos’ [APT] Price Prediction 2024-25

Moreover, the token’s price had touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands at press time. This might increase selling pressure and put an end to APT’s bull rally. 
Nonetheless, the MACD indicated a clear bullish advantage in the market, and seemed to support the buyers.

Is It True That Anonymous Cryptocurrency Wallets and Transfers Will Be Banned In Europe? Circle Official Made a Statement - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to a report published by Finbold, it has been claimed that the European Union (EU) has banned the use of anonymous self-custody cryptocurrency wallets for cryptocurrency payments of any size.
Patrick Hansen, Strategy and Policy Director of stablecoin company Circle, explained that self-storage wallets are not banned under the new law.


Payments to and from self-custody wallets are also not prohibited, and practices such as peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers, self-custody software and hardware wallets are expressly excluded from the Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), according to Hansen.
However, Hansen noted that, for example, paying merchants with crypto from a self-custodial wallet that is not subject to KYC will be more difficult or prohibited, depending on the merchant's system. According to Hansen, this change and lower thresholds for anonymous cash payments were unfortunately already adopted months ago.






Journalist Vini Barbosa, who first reported on the ban, also published an update. According to Barbosa, the legislation would ban anonymous crypto payments, which they describe as “hosted wallets.” However, there is no consensus on what this provision actually means for anonymous payments from self-storage wallets to self-storage wallets.
Some believe these payments will inevitably be banned along with other already approved laws. Others think it won't be banned.

Here’s Why Dogecoin Rallies 40%, Beating Cardano, Shiba Inu - Coin Edition


							

Dogecoin emerged as a standout performer this week, knocking out Cardano.
DOGE has surged 39.68% from a low of about $0.125 to as high as $0.1746.
Meanwhile, its closest rival in the meme space, Shiba Inu, saw a 3.18% gain. 




In the last few days, Dogecoin (Doge) has emerged as a standout performer, taking the crypto trading community by storm as it knocked out Cardano to become the eighth most valuable crypto. 



DOGE has surged from a low of about $0.125 on Wednesday to as high as $0.1746 in the last 24 hours. This trajectory amounts to a significant 39.68% gain, coming at a time when the market sentiment is mostly bearish. 









Moreover, this shocking performance has further solidified Dogecoin’s leadership position in the meme coin landscape. While recording a 6.31% gain over the past day, its closest rival in the meme space, Shiba Inu, saw only a 3.18% gain. 



Meanwhile, PEPE and Floki have witnessed price declines during the same period. DOGE’s unexpected performance has prompted inquiries into the factors influencing its bullish surge amid bearish sentiments.



On Thursday, the institutional arm of prominent U.S.-based exchange Coinbase disclosed that it secured regulatory approval to list the first leveraged contracts for three tokens, including Dogecoin.



This development comes two weeks after Coinbase filed with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to introduce cash-settled futures for Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. 









Following the CFTC approval, the Dogecoin-based leveraged contract will go live on April 1, seven days from now. Effectively, this strategic move from Coinbase has sparked optimism, particularly for Dogecoin, as it creates a further avenue for trading the meme coin.



Furthermore, in a recent statement, Tesla founder Elon Musk hinted that Dogecoin could be accepted as a payment option for Tesla cars.



Moreover, Elon Musk has previously endorsed the meme coin, among other tokens in the crypto sphere. The longstanding endorsement of Dogecoin by the world’s wealthiest individual has contributed to Dogecoin’s prominence in the crypto market over the years.

Ethereum's Cancun-Deneb upgrade sees mixed results in fee reductions on layer 2 solutions

The highly anticipated Cancun-Deneb upgrade for Ethereum (ETH) has been met with enthusiasm and tempered expectations as it significantly improves the network’s data logistics and fee structures on Layer 2 (L2) solutions. While proponents herald the upgrade’s ability to usher in a new era of reduced transactional fees, cryptocurrency expert Eric Wall cautions against overestimating its impact.Eric Wall’s analysis highlights potential fee spikes despite upgradeAccording to Eric Wall, a seasoned figure in cryptocurrency technology, the prevailing narrative of “dirt cheap” transactional fees on Ethereum‘s L2s post-Deneb activation may be misleading. Despite the enhancements by EIP-4844, Wall points out that the design of sequencers still allows for fee spikes under certain conditions. He emphasizes that even with the maximum capacity of blobspace, L2 rollups post-Deneb activation are only expected to scale to 100-1,000 transactions per second (TPS). Furthermore, Wall underscores that consuming all blobspace and operating at maximum theoretical capacity does not consistently guarantee low fees.The Deneb upgrade, which commenced on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, promised optimized data usage for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Layer 2 solutions. Initial observations from the L2Fees tracker reveal a varied landscape regarding fee reductions across prominent L2 solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Starknet, and zkSync Era. Transfer and cross-asset swap fees on these platforms plummeted to below $0.01 in equivalent, signaling a significant reduction. However, for certain networks, including Loopring, zkSync Lite, and Boba Network, fees remained largely unaffected by the changes triggered by the Deneb upgrade.The response from the Ethereum community to the Deneb upgrade’s impact on transaction fees has been mixed. While some laud the noticeable fee reduction on several L2 solutions, others express concern over the disparities in fee reductions across different networks. The discrepancies underscore the complexity of optimizing fee structures in a decentralized ecosystem with diverse L2 implementations.Ethereum’s Cancun-Deneb upgrade has ushered in notable improvements in data logistics and fee structures on Layer 2 solutions. However, Eric Wall’s analysis serves as a reminder that the effects of the upgrade should not be overstated, as fee spikes remain a possibility under certain conditions. As the Ethereum ecosystem evolves, achieving consistent and universally low transaction fees across all Layer 2 solutions remains an ongoing challenge requiring further exploration and refinement.By staying informed and critically assessing the impact of network upgrades such as Deneb, stakeholders within the Ethereum community can navigate the evolving landscape with greater clarity and foresight. As developments unfold, the quest for scalability and affordability in Ethereum’s transactional infrastructure remains a focal point for innovation and improvement.

9 Altcoins Including DOGE Will Experience Important Events In The Upcoming Dates: Here is the Trend List to Watch - Bitcoin Sistemi

Cryptocurrency analytics firm Layergg has released its weekly token and trend watch list, highlighting key trends and events in the altcoin market.
Dogecoin (DOGE)
Coinbase International is preparing to launch Dogecoin futures on April 1. With April 20th being known as 'Doge Day', it is important to consider the recent tendency for memecoin prices to react sensitively to such events.


Aptos (APT)
Aptos is preparing to make a major RWA (real world assets) announcement in April. There are rumors of a potential partnership with a major asset manager, possibly BlackRock or Franklin Templeton. Details are expected to be announced at the 'Aptos DeFi DAYS' event on April 2.
PENDLE
According to Arthur Hayes, the EigenLayer token could be launched in mid-April. ETHFI's successful launch, which more than doubled returns, has led to renewed attention on Pendle Finance's product. Token releases of upcoming Restaking projects could increase Pendle Finance's momentum.





Phantom (FTM)
Phantom Sonic Mainnet is expected to be released between late March and early April. CEO Andre Cronje is actively involved in promotional activities. While the price currently reflects expected catalysts, strategic consideration is required due to the significant influence of Andre Cronje.
Stacks (STX)
Bitcoin halving is less than a month away. The Nakamoto upgrade is planned for the end of April. Described as the first SEC-compliant blockchain, Stacks continues to attract the attention of global asset managers such as Franklin Templeton.


Ondo (ONDO)
BlackRock announced a $100 million tokenized asset fund. Ondo Finance is the RWA project most associated with BlackRock at this point. It was mentioned as a significant project in Bitwise's “Crypto Use Case 2024” Report, indicating potential additional corporate partnerships.

Toncoin (TON)
Telegram decided to use only TON for advertising payments, which means a monthly flow of 800 million active users. Telegram also has a “potential IPO” catalyst. The TON Foundation's Open League starts on April 1 and will distribute 30 million TON to projects and users in the TON ecosystem.





XPLA (XPLA)
Rumors suggest that zkSync will be released in April. XPLA recently received investment from Matter Labs and is potentially a zkSync-related altcoin. XPLA has acquired the AAA game 'MadWorld' and plans to add two more AAA games soon.
Aerodrome Finance (AERO)
The total locked value of the underlying chain doubled within a month. Aerodrome is seen as the leading DeFi on the Base chain and potentially serves as a Base-linked altcoin. Aerodrome plans to launch Slipstream within weeks. Coinbase Ventures officially announced that it acquired and retained AERO last February.

RippleX addresses XRP ledger’s AMM pool error, advises user caution

RippleX, the development division of Ripple, revealed a technical issue affecting Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools on the XRP Ledger. This glitch disrupts transactions and pools, prompting the management to update users about fund deposits.According to a post on the X social platform, the technical team at RippleX has identified a discrepancy in a limited number of AMM pools on the XRP Ledger, leading to transactions being processed incorrectly. AMM pools are liquidity pools used in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to facilitate trading without the need for traditional order books. In an AMM pool, traders can swap assets directly with the pool rather than with other traders. The pool contains reserves of various assets, and prices are determined algorithmically based on the ratio of assets in the pool.Source: RippleX Due to the continuing technical issue, RippleX has recommended its users no longer deposit funds into the affected AMM pools. This preventive action is meant to eliminate any possible complications that the current glitch may cause. Those with liquidity provider (LP) tokens in these pools are advised to redeem them until the matter is resolved.Nevertheless, RippleX’s technical team is actively addressing the bug, focusing on restoring regular operations within the AMM pools. The company said it is committed to resolving this issue promptly and has engaged with community members to assist in troubleshooting.Related: Coreum advances blockchain interoperability with XRPL Bridge: Enhanced liquidity across 100+ IBC-enabled chainsXRP Ledger (XRPL) users and AMM pool stakeholders are advised to stay tuned for updates from RippleX via its official communication channels. The crypto community has responded warmly to the revealed technical issue affecting AMM pools on the XRP Ledger. A community member identifying as FarhanSiYal13 on the X social platform expressed gratitude to RippleX for the heads-up. He extended his appreciation for the transparency and proactive approach used in addressing the AMM pool discrepancies and applauded RippleX’s diligence in maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem.The recent introduction of the AMM feature by the XRPL has generated significant excitement and support, leading to the creation of over 1,000 liquidity pools, according to an update from XRPScan. This milestone marks a significant expansion in the diversity of assets available within these pools.According to the data, one of the most extensive liquidity pools features the XRP/XCASH pair with the AMM account identified as “rUCLr….ABx6D” and a balance of 273,184,692.307334 LPToken.

Chinese blockchain users dealing with a shocking scam pandemic | Cryptopolitan

The blockchain sphere in China is currently navigating through tumultuous waters, thanks to a cleverly orchestrated scam pandemic that’s left countless investors out of pocket. This isn’t just your run-of-the-mill cyber deception; we’re talking about a sophisticated double-whammy where victims, already burned once, are being scorched again by predators masquerading as their saviors. It’s a harsh reality in the digital age where trust is fragile, and the blockchain, despite its robust architecture, isn’t immune to human cunning and greed. The Double Deception DilemmaAt the heart of this chaos is a particularly sinister scam model that preys on the desperation and vulnerability of investors who have already fallen victim to initial frauds, often involving virtual currencies. Imagine losing a staggering amount of money to a scam, only to be duped again by someone promising to help you recover your losses.This exact scenario unfolded for an individual who first lost 700,000 yuan (about $100k) to a pig butchering scam—a scheme involving fattening up the victim with fake profits before going in for the financial kill. In a desperate bid for recourse, they then turned to what they believed was a legal lifeline, only to be swindled out of an additional 500,000 yuan ($70k) by a phony lawyer. The tragedy of this situation is palpable, highlighting not just the sophistication of online scams but also the profound impact of these crimes on individuals’ lives.Adding an international twist to the tale is the story of Jian Wen, a 42-year-old British citizen found guilty by a London jury of laundering vast sums of Bitcoin. This wasn’t petty cash; we’re talking about laundering for a Chinese fugitive implicated in an almost $6 billion investment fraud. Between 2017 and 2022, Jian helped wash the dirty digital money, showcasing the global scale and reach of these operations. Her lifestyle, upgrading from a fast-food takeaway basement to a life of luxury, punctuates the narrative with a stark visual of crime’s profitability. Despite her denials and the complexities of the case, the conviction shines a light on the intricate networks supporting financial crimes in the blockchain space.A Market Thriving in the ShadowsNow, let’s pivot to the broader picture of blockchain and cryptocurrency in China. Contrary to the Western media’s narrative of a crypto crackdown rendering the blockchain barren in the Middle Kingdom, the reality is nuanced and, dare I say, quite alive. Reports of Binance churning through $90 billion in Chinese crypto trade in a single month last year should tell you something about the market’s vitality. It’s a testament to the resilience of decentralized money and its ability to dodge the heavy hand of governmental control. However, this isn’t just a tale of evasion; it’s a complex dance between regulation and innovation.In China, the mantra seems to be about reading between the lines—what’s not explicitly banned becomes a playground for the astute and the adventurous. This legal gray area allows individuals to hold and trade in crypto, albeit without the safety net of legal protection. It’s a risky game, but one that many are willing to play, driven by the allure of blockchain’s promises and the potential for profit. Beijing’s cautious stance, simultaneously wary of crypto’s challenges and optimistic about blockchain’s possibilities, exemplifies the nuanced approach to digital currencies and technologies. This duality is also reflected in Hong Kong’s ambitious push to become a digital asset hub, signaling a possible strategic play by China to keep its options open while managing the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin ETFs in the UK: Will British Investors Get Greenlight? - DailyCoin


        
Industry leaders have called for wider access to Bitcoin for British investors through ETFs.



The FCA has remained cautious due to Bitcoin’s volatility and a desire to protect retail investors.



The Bitcoin ETF approvals in the US has put pressure on the FCA to revisit its stance.
The approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US has reignited a simmering debate in the UK, with industry leaders calling for wider access for British investors. This comes amid a surge in investment in the US following the January greenlight from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Advocates for Bitcoin ETFs in the UKBivu Das, Managing Director of Kraken UK, sees Bitcoin ETFs as a crucial step towards establishing the UK as a major player in the cryptocurrency industry. These investment vehicles allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. This could potentially offer a more regulated and accessible entry point for those interested in the digital asset. However, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) remains cautious. In 2021, they banned the retail sale of crypto-derivative products, including exchange-traded notes (ETPs) backed by cryptocurrencies. This stance is seen by some as putting the UK at a disadvantage compared to the US, where retail investors can now readily invest in Bitcoin ETFs. Das argues that the regulatory landscape has evolved since the 2021 ban. He believes ETFs could even address some of the FCA’s concerns, as investors wouldn’t directly hold the underlying Bitcoin. This could pave the way for a more open approach from the regulator. There are already signs of a potential shift, with the FCA recently approving the launch of crypto ETNs, albeit only for institutional investors. This limited move could be seen as a cautious step towards opening up wider crypto investment opportunities.Balancing Innovation and RiskCoinbase UK CEO, Daniel Seifert, aligns with Das’ sentiment, believing that a wider range of investment products like ETFs would give consumers more options. This push for increased investor choice reflects a broader trend towards democratizing access to financial markets.However, the FCA faces a delicate balancing act. While fostering innovation in the crypto sector is crucial for maintaining the UK’s financial competitiveness, protecting retail investors from potential harm remains a top priority. The high volatility of the cryptocurrency market raises concerns about the suitability of complex instruments like ETFs for inexperienced investors.The recent influx of billions of dollars into US Bitcoin ETFs highlights the growing global appetite for these products. This surge in demand could put further pressure on the FCA to revisit its stance. The potential benefits of increased investment and a more robust crypto ecosystem could outweigh the perceived risks, eventually leading to a more open regulatory environment.On the Flipside
The FCA might wait for a clearer picture on global crypto regulations before taking a definitive stance on Bitcoin ETFs.



Even if the FCA approves Bitcoin ETFs, additional regulations and oversight may be implemented, potentially impacting product offerings and accessibility.
Why This MattersThis decision by the US could trigger a domino effect, putting pressure on the UK’s FCA to reconsider its cautious stance on Bitcoin ETFs. If the FCA loosens regulations, it could attract significant investment and solidify the UK’s position in the global crypto market, but this hinges on finding a balance between fostering innovation and protecting less experienced investors.Bitcoin ETFs have seen record-breaking outflows recently, after a period of large inflows.

Polygon’s 12 Hour Outage Is Not What You Think. Here's Why - DailyCoin


        
Polygon zkEVM, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has encountered a setback during testing.



This incident was isolated to the zkEVM beta and has not affected other Polygon products.



The zkEVM is still in beta testing and this is not the first time a vulnerability has been identified.
The Polygon team recently acknowledged a setback encountered during the testing phase of their zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) mainnet beta. This issue, stemming from a layer one reorganization, affected the sequencer, a critical component responsible for ordering transactions on the network.Polygon zkEVM Beta Encounters OutageIt’s important to emphasize that this incident is isolated to the zkEVM, which is currently in its beta phase and not yet a fully deployed product. Other functionalities within the Polygon ecosystem, such as the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network and chains built using the Polygon software development kit (SDK), remain fully operational.The Polygon team is actively working to resolve the sequencer issue and has pledged a thorough post-mortem analysis to identify the root cause and implement preventative measures to avoid similar issues in the future.Despite this temporary setback, Polygon maintains its commitment to innovation in the blockchain space. The highly anticipated second-generation zkEVM is expected to address scalability concerns and enhance overall platform performance.As of now, the incident appears to have no significant impact on MATIC, the native token of the Polygon ecosystem. In fact, MATIC has experienced a modest gain of 2.6% on the day. However, it’s worth noting that the token’s price has dipped by 4% over the past week, reflecting a broader market trend.Can Polygon zkEVM Overcome Security Challenges?For those unfamiliar, Polygon zkEVM is a layer-2 scaling solution designed to address Ethereum’s scalability limitations. It achieves this by processing transactions off-chain and utilizing zero-knowledge proofs to verify their validity on the Ethereum mainnet.It’s important to remember that the zkEVM is still under development. Last September, a critical vulnerability was identified in the zkProver module by Verichains, a leading blockchain security firm. This flaw could have potentially compromised the security of funds within the entire Polygon ecosystem. Fortunately, Polygon collaborated with Verichains to effectively address the vulnerability.The zkEVM beta setback highlights the importance of rigorous testing procedures before deploying new blockchain technologies. While the incident itself appears to be contained within the testing environment, it underscores the need for ongoing vigilance and collaboration within the blockchain development community.On the Flipside
The recent vulnerability identified in the zkProver module serves as a reminder that even extensively tested systems can have unforeseen security risks.



While the zkEVM incident is an isolated incident, it’s a setback for Polygon nonetheless.
Why This MattersThis setback for Polygon’s zkEVM, though isolated to the beta phase, underscores the challenges inherent in developing complex blockchain technologies. Thorough testing and collaboration across the blockchain development community are crucial to ensuring the security and stability of these nascent systems, especially as they aim to achieve widespread adoption.To learn more about the new tool by Polygon Labs that simplifies DApp development, read here:Polygon (MATIC) Labs To Scale DApp Development With New ToolCurious about the new $100 million fund for Web3 gaming?

BlackRock’s Clients Expressing ‘Little Bit’ of Demand for Ethereum, According to Head of Digital Assets: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Clients of $10 trillion asset management firm BlackRock are reportedly not showing much demand for the leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH).
Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, says that the firm’s clients are mostly interested in Bitcoin (BTC), the top crypto asset by market cap, leaving only a “little bit” of demand for the top altcoin, reports Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett.










“For our clients, Bitcoin is overwhelmingly the number one priority. And then a little bit Ethereum, and very little everything else.”
Mitchnick also says he acknowledges that the digital asset community wants BlackRock to create a long tail of crypto-focused products. However, he says “that’s just not where we’re focused.”
In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on whether or not to approve Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from BlackRock and crypto asset manager Grayscale. At the time, the regulatory agency said it needed more time to consider the proposed rule change.
Earlier this month, SEC Chair Gary Gensler declined to comment on whether or not Ethereum counts as a security due to the fact that the regulatory body is in the midst of deciding the fate of ETH ETF applications.
Ethereum is trading for $3,332 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

3 cryptocurrencies to watch for this week


The cryptocurrency market has experienced weeks of bullish sentiments led by Bitcoin (BTC), which hit a new all-time high of above $73,000. Although the flagship cryptocurrency has retraced from the record high, the market can still be considered to be in a bullish scenario as Bitcoin attempts to hold its valuation above the $65,000 mark.
It’s worth noting that as the market anticipates the upcoming bullish Bitcoin halving interest, there remains a focus on how investors will react before the event, which has been known to impact the general sector. 
In this line, Finbold has identified the following three cryptocurrencies worth watching for the coming week.


Dogecoin (DOGE)
Meme coins are among the standout categories in the current bull run, attracting significant investor interest amid anticipation of gains similar to those observed in 2021. At the moment, most meme coins have registered losses, but Dogecoin (DOGE) notably stands out, recording double-digit gains over the past week. 
Moving into the new week, DOGE is worth watching due to its potential ability to sustain the gains recorded in the past week. Notably, these gains have seen DOGE overshadow its competitors, including Shiba Inu (SHIB)
It’s worth noting that these gains have come as Dogecoin benefited from its long-term bullish catalysts, notably its association with its vocal supporter, Elon Musk. In this regard, DOGE has stood out after it emerged that X Payments, the arm of X (formerly Twitter) responsible for driving the peer-to-peer payment business, secured three more licenses for money transmitter activities. Therefore, it will be interesting to observe how far the coin will rally amid the X-related news.
By press time, Dogecoin was trading at $0.17, having gained over 3% in the last 24 hours. Over the past seven days, the token is up almost 17%.

Bitcoin (BTC)
The current Bitcoin rally has seen the flagship cryptocurrency break free from historical patterns, particularly hitting a new all-time high before the halving event. At the moment, Bitcoin is struggling to maintain its price above the $65,000 support, with a section of analysts maintaining that the crypto is facing a strong bearish bias.
Notably, a majority of the market is anticipating Bitcoin’s value to plunge in what is termed as pre-halving retrace, making it interesting to monitor its valuation in the coming week.
As reported by Finbold, the $65,000 level remains key, considering that it will influence which direction Bitcoin will move. Particularly, crypto analyst Alan Santana noted that Bitcoin trading below the $65,000 level means that the asset is in trouble of extended losses.
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $65,756, with extended weekly losses of over 3%.

Solana (SOL)
Solana (SOL), a decentralized finance crypto project, remains among the success stories of the current market rally, partly due to meme coins launched on the platform. Indeed, the meme coin frenzy has helped Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) top the charts in trading volume at some point.
Throughout the current rally, the price of Solana has faced significant rejection around the $200 psychological level and is currently trading nearly 10% lower than the previous week’s closing level.
As we move into the new week, Solana’s price trajectory makes it worth watching. With losses recorded in the past week, sustained bearish sentiments for Solana seem likely, and investors will be eyeing possible support levels where buyers might find the Solana price attractive, particularly around the $150 level. 
Furthermore, if Solana’s price manages to flip the $200 psychological level, the chances of an uptrend continuation are high. However, if Bitcoin’s price declines, then SOL could follow suit.
By press time, Solana was trading at $173 with weekly losses of 11%. 
SOL seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold
In summary, the three cryptocurrencies remain susceptible to overall market trends and are likely to face the impact of the high volatility associated with the sector.

ETFs Have Introduced Different Dynamics To The Bitcoin Market - Analyst - Coin Edition


							

Marcin Miłosierny thinks new dynamics are evolving for Bitcoin in the developing bull cycle.
According to Miłosierny, the entrance of ETFs is impacting the Bitcoin market significantly
Miłosierny believes the buying power of ETFs will overshadow the supply squeeze effect of Bitcoin halving.




Glassnode crypto analyst Marcin Miłosierny has highlighted the evolving dynamics of the Bitcoin market in the developing bull cycle. According to Miłosierny, the entrance of ETFs is impacting the Bitcoin market significantly with a potential adjustment to the historical effect of Bitcoin halving.



In a recently posted analysis, the crypto analyst noted that the significant buying power of ETFs will overshadow the traditional supply squeeze effect expected from the halving. Miłosierny believes the ETF-induced dynamics demand a response from traders. He thinks Bitcoin traders need to balance the historical impact of halvings with the contemporary ETFs’ influence on BTC availability and price during the upcoming cycle.



Considering recent developments, Miłosierny believes the Bitcoin market is entering a stage where long-term holders (LTHs) would exert more influence in BTC supply dynamics. He thinks traders should monitor the Long-Term Holder Market Inflation Rate for accurate market prediction. According to the Glassnode analyst, doing so would enable the traders to anticipate market shifts and adjust their strategies accordingly.



One factor Miłosierny considered essential is Bitcoin reaching an all-time high (ATH) before the halving. He thinks this development presents a new scenario, even though the cycle’s progression mirrors past trends if aligned from the April 2021 ATH. The analyst believes the calming influence of ETFs on corrections suggests stability. However, he noted that a potential decrease in ETF demand could amplify market fluctuations.



The newly launched ETFs influenced Bitcoin’s latest rally, pushing the flagship crypto up by over 90% in less than two months. BTC broke above multiple resistances to reach a new ATH of $73,794 before embarking on a retracement due to ETF outflows. 



Bitcoin traded for $64,357 at the time of writing, after a 17% retracement from the ATH, according to data from TradingView. Users expect the rally to continue after the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which would create a supply squeeze for the top cryptocurrency.

Ripple CTO Applauds Launch of AMM Functionality on XRPL Coin Edition


							

Ripple’s CTO has praised the long-anticipated launch of AMM functionality on XRPL.
The AMM brings passive income opportunities for XRP holders through liquidity provision on XRPL DEX.
Currently, 210 liquidity pools are in operation, the largest being the USDC/XRP pair, boasting $178.3K in liquidity.




David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, has praised the long-anticipated launch of automated market maker (AMM) functionality on the XRP Ledger. The RippleX team announced the rollout of the XRPL AMM on March 22, hailing it as a significant evolution of the platform’s native decentralized exchange.









Previously, liquidity on the XRPL DEX depended solely on manual market making. However, with the recent integration, a non-custodial automated market maker has become a central feature of the XRPL DEX.



One of its key advantages is that the AMM brings passive income opportunities for the XRP community as they can become liquidity providers on XRPL DEX. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, expressed his satisfaction with the debut of this liquidity provision service on the XRP blockchain. He noted that it came after approximately two years of hard work.







Furthermore, Schwartz emphasized that this marks the beginning of a journey toward future growth milestones for users, traders, developers, market makers, and others involved in the XRPL community. He eagerly anticipates embarking on this journey alongside the entire XRPL community.



Other members of the XRP community have wholeheartedly embraced the debut of the XRPL AMM. Panos Mekras, the founder of Anodos Finance, extended his gratitude to all who contributed to bringing this AMM to fruition.









Remarkably, the XLS-30 amendment, which introduced the AMM to XRPL, has been undergoing deliberation since last year. In February, it garnered the necessary consensus from XRPL validators.



However, due to a detected bug, the consensus for the amendment was subsequently lost until the issue was addressed. This delay resulted in the launch of the AMM on Friday, March 22.



Since the rollout, participants in the crypto market have established numerous automated market maker pools for XRP. As per data from XRP Explorer XRPScan, there are currently 210 liquidity pools in operation.



Currently, the largest liquidity pool for XRP is the USDC/XRP pair, boasting $178.3K in liquidity and $111.1K in trading volume. This pool has seen 1,716 transactions and 428 swaps involving contributions from 449 individuals. Other active pools include SOLO/XRP, BTC/XRP, FLR/XRP, and USDT/XRP pairs.

Will the Halving Event in Bitcoin Bring a Surge or Correction? Analysis Company Explained - Bitcoin Sistemi

As Bitcoin approaches its halving, analysts from analysis firm Glassnode said one should be prepared for potential volatility.
According to Glassnode, the impact of the halving will likely diminish during this cycle as new institutional demand from Bitcoin ETFs comes into play.


According to analysts, we are approaching the stage of the market cycle where BTC's supply dynamics are increasingly influenced by the actions of long-term holders (LTHs). Their sell or hold decisions can significantly affect market liquidity and sentiment. Therefore, investors should closely monitor the Long Term Investor Market Inflation Rate to anticipate market changes and adapt their strategies accordingly.
Long Term Investor Market Inflation Rate
According to Glassnode, reaching the All Time High (ATH) before the halving presented an unprecedented new scenario. Still, the progression of the cycle mirrors past trends if aligned from the April 2021 ATH. Although the calming effect of ETFs on corrections indicates stability, a possible decline in ETF demand could increase market volatility and highlight the need for strategic caution in trading approaches, according to analysts.






While the halving is often interpreted as a bullish signal for Bitcoin, its immediate impact on the market is largely influenced by psychological factors, according to analysts. The market has occasionally been seen to interpret news as a sell event where market sentiment and price are gaining momentum towards the halving, only to result in significant price corrections shortly thereafter.
For example, in 2016, the market experienced a sharp sell-off from $760 to $540, with a correction of approximately 30% during the halving. This decline was a classic example of market participants reacting to the event itself rather than long-term supply effects, demonstrating the halving's capacity to trigger sudden market volatility.


As we approach the next halving, the market structure suggests that we may witness another significant correction, according to analysts. Such a correction would not only fit historical patterns but also serve as a reset, shaking off short-term speculative interest and setting the stage for the next growth cycle.

Akon cautions fans against requesting for crypto-related content 1

Award-winning musician Akon, renowned for his musical talents and prior involvement in promoting a futuristic city project in Senegal, recently addressed his fans regarding crypto-related messages. Through a video shared on a prominent video-sharing platform, the musician urged his followers not to request him for recordings related to cryptocurrencies. This plea, however, lacked specific explanations for his shift in interest.Akon urges fans against requesting crypto contentsAccording to a report from Protos, the waning enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies among Akon’s entourage could be attributed to the controversies surrounding his failed crypto-city venture. The project aimed to create a city reminiscent of Wakanda in Senegal but encountered numerous challenges and public scrutiny, casting doubts on its feasibility.In late 2022, the artiste publicly acknowledged missteps in managing the project and pledged to reimburse investors who held his token. One of the critical issues plaguing the project was the failure to fulfill financial commitments to the landowners where the proposed city was slated to be built. This failure occurred despite the land being acquired almost a decade prior.Additionally, the native cryptocurrency associated with the project, known as Aikon, was eventually delisted from various crypto exchanges where it had been previously traded. Despite facing setbacks and criticism, Akon had previously defended the project and expressed determination to overcome obstacles. In a 2022 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), he reiterated the project’s ongoing status and even mentioned aspirations of retiring within the city once it materialized.Lessons learned and future outlookTimelines for substantial progress set by Akon’s team in earlier years were not met, leading to growing skepticism about the project’s viability. While Akon’s recent plea to his fans signals a reduced focus on crypto-related activities, he maintains a cautious optimism regarding the future of the project.Reports indicate his belief that the city will witness partial development by 2026, although the path forward appears challenging given the project’s history of controversies and operational setbacks. The evolving narrative around Akon’s crypto-city project underscores broader themes in the cryptocurrency landscape, including the complexities of executing ambitious blockchain-based initiatives, regulatory challenges, and the importance of transparency and accountability in such ventures.Akon’s experience serves as a cautionary tale within the crypto community, highlighting the risks and intricacies involved in bridging innovative concepts with real-world implementation. As the crypto industry continues to mature and navigate regulatory frameworks globally, stakeholders, including celebrities like Akon, are reevaluating their involvement and strategies in this dynamic ecosystem.

Ethereum Faces Price Dip Amid Market Uncertainty, Holds Potential with Major Upgrades and Regulatory Challenges Ahead



                    


Ether recently encountered significant resistance at the $4,100 level on March 12, leading to a 9% drop in its price over the past week, a sharper decline than the broader cryptocurrency market, which saw a 2.5% decrease in total market capitalization. 



This downturn has prompted speculation about the durability of Ether’s current $3,200 support level.




A key potential driver for Ether is the possibility of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), with a decision expected by May 23. 



Yet, Bloomberg’s James Seyffart remains skeptical of approval, stating, “However, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart does not consider approval as his base scenario.”



Despite the price setback, the Ethereum network saw significant upgrades with the Dencun hard fork on March 13, aimed at improving scalability and layer-2 data processing. 




This update has led to reduced transaction fees on platforms like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, bolstering the case for layer-2 solutions among Ethereum users. 



Cointelegraph highlights this trend, noting, “Data indicates a surge in 7-day volumes for Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base by 145%, 144%, and 203%, respectively, thereby alleviating some of the downward pressure on Ether’s price that was attributed to high gas fees.”



However, competition from networks like BNB Chain and Solana, which offer lower base-layer transaction fees, remains fierce.

1Despite this, Ethereum continues to see positive ecosystem developments, even as regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. intensifies, with the SEC investigating connections to the Ethereum Foundation to potentially classify Ether as a security.



The recent SEC actions, especially in light of Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake, have led to a mixed response from the market and industry figures. 



Some, like Van Buren Capital and lawyer Scott Johnsson, view the SEC’s scrutiny as a potential obstacle to Ether ETF approvals, while Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, contends, “The SEC has no valid reason to reject the Ether ETP applications.”



Market sentiment, as gauged by the ETH options 25% delta skew, reflects a cautious stance, with a recent shift from 0% to 5%, indicating skepticism but not outright bearishness towards the $3,200 support. 



Despite this, Ethereum’s position as a leading network, with a total value locked (TVL) of $94 billion and BlackRock’s initiative to launch a tokenized asset fund on Ethereum, underscores its enduring significance. 



This backdrop suggests that, despite current challenges, Ether’s foundational support level remains robust.

Bitcoin price aims for a bullish weekly open - Will DOGE, TON, STX and FTM follow?

Bitcoin (BTC) is on target to end the week in the red, but a positive sign for the bulls is that the price has recovered from the intra-week low of about $61,000 to over $65,000.

Japanese crypto influencer discusses Ethereum’s EIP 4844

Mai Fujimoto, a prominent figure in the Japanese crypto community and co-founder of Intmax, has shed light on Ethereum’s ongoing quest for scalability solutions, particularly focusing on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, also known as proto-danksharding. According to Fujimoto, EIP 4844 presents a promising avenue for addressing Ethereum’s scalability challenges, offering benefits for scaling solutions like zero-knowledge rollups (zkrollups) and Layer 2 chains such as Optimistic by reducing node storage tasks and lowering transaction fees.Japanese crypto influencer hails the significance of EIP 4844In an interview, Fujimoto emphasized EIP 4844’s significance as a “Layer 1 middle ground.” The Japanese crypto influencer explained that while initially functioning as a large block, the blob introduced by EIP 4844 can transition to a smaller block size over time. This adaptability is seen as a breakthrough, although Fujimoto cautioned that its effectiveness might diminish with widespread rollup adoption.Discussing the future of Ethereum Layer 2 scaling, the Japanese concurred with the view that zkrollups hold great promise. She highlighted their potential to make decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like Uniswap scalable, addressing one of Ethereum’s key challenges. Fujimoto also touched upon data availability attacks and how stateless architecture can fortify decentralized applications (dApps) against such threats.Zkrollups and future prospects for Ethereum’s layer-2Comparing Ethereum’s scalability efforts to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, Fujimoto noted the existing progress in achieving almost zero gas fees on Bitcoin. However, she pointed out that Ethereum has yet to develop a comparable solution, given its role not just as a store of value but also as a platform for building complex decentralized applications. This motivated her to co-found Intmax, aiming to tackle Ethereum’s scalability limitations.Within the Ethereum community, discussions on scalability are ongoing, with the introduction of blobs through Proto-Danksharding marking a significant step forward. These blobs serve as temporary storage that nodes can erase after a few weeks, thus alleviating node storage burdens and reducing transaction fees. Fujimoto drew parallels to her earlier interest in the Bitcoin space’s big block vs. small block debate, highlighting the blob solution as a middle ground that caters to both short-term scalability needs and long-term sustainability.Fujimoto’s insights underscore the dynamic landscape of blockchain scalability solutions, where ongoing innovations like EIP 4844 and zkrollups offer promising pathways to address the growing demands of decentralized ecosystems. As Ethereum continues to evolve, the quest for scalable and efficient blockchain infrastructure remains a focal point for developers, entrepreneurs, and industry stakeholders alike.

Macro Factors to Shape Bitcoin Prices: Coinbase's Insights Post-Halving


																All eyes are on the upcoming Bitcoin halving scheduled for mid-April 2024, which will reduce the rewards granted to miners for validating transactions by half. This will mark the fourth occurrence of a halving event in Bitcoin’s history.
Although the market is currently experiencing a downturn, Bitcoin has seen significant growth of more than 150% since mid-October last year. According to the latest “handbook” by Coinbase, this strong performance will continue up to and after the upcoming halving.
Coinbase Warns of Limited Historical Evidence
Even though there’s a chance the halving could positively influence Bitcoin’s performance, Coinbase pointed out that the historical evidence supporting this connection is limited, making it somewhat speculative. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price is influenced by factors beyond crypto-specific events like halvings, indicating that it doesn’t operate in isolation.
It is evident that a significant portion of Bitcoin’s recent surge was propelled more by optimism regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs rather than excitement surrounding the halving. Looking forward, Coinbase said that there are several macroeconomic factors that are poised to influence Bitcoin prices significantly.
Coinbase anticipates the US Federal Reserve to start rate cuts as early as May and initiate a reduction in its quantitative tightening program shortly thereafter.
The handbook also drew attention to the possibility of heightened selling pressure from miners, who may sell a larger portion of their rewards, as well as from companies emerging from bankruptcy, such as former crypto lenders Celsius Network and Genesis Global.
Bitcoin’s On-Chain Analytics
Upon assessing on-chain analytics, Coinbase observed that the current cycle closely mirrors the period from 2018 to 2022, during which the leading crypto asset saw a 500% increase from its lowest point.
Its handbook also shared an interesting observation about the total supply of Bitcoin held by long-term investors – individuals who retain their crypto holdings for a minimum of 155 days. Historically, this timeframe indicates a notable decline in the likelihood of these assets being sold off.
Assuming all other factors remain constant, Coinbase said that the long-term holders are expected to be less inclined than short-term holders to see halvings as a chance to capitalize on market strength by selling.

Goldman Sachs Clients Showing Surging Interest in Bitcoin | Cryptoglobe


                                
BNN Bloomberg is a Canadian business and financial news channel born from a partnership between Bell Media and Bloomberg Media. It offers live market coverage, breaking news, expert interviews, and economic analysis, making it the go-to source for investors, business leaders, and anyone seeking to stay informed about the financial world. Beyond television, BNN Bloomberg’s resources include a website with up-to-date articles, data, and videos, and Canada’s only all-business news radio station.



Per a recent BNN Bloomberg article, the crypto trading space is witnessing a renewed interest, not just from individual “YOLO” traders but also from sophisticated hedge-fund clients associated with Goldman Sachs. According to Max Minton, Goldman Sachs’ Asia Pacific head of digital assets, the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has catalyzed this resurgence of activities and interest within the bank’s clientele. 



BNN Bloomberg’s coverage reveals that Goldman Sachs, having initiated its cryptocurrency trading desk back in 2021, currently offers a range of derivative products, including cash-settled Bitcoin and Ether options, alongside futures listed on the CME. It’s noteworthy, as mentioned in the article, that Goldman does not engage in the trading of the actual cryptocurrency tokens, positioning itself as a bridge between traditional finance mechanisms and the emerging crypto market.



The past year might have been relatively subdued in terms of cryptocurrency engagement, as per insights from Minton shared by BNN Bloomberg, but the onset of 2023 has marked a noticeable uptick in interest. This is evident in the increasing number of clients onboarding, as well as in the growing transaction volumes and pipeline activities observed.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

BNN Bloomberg’s report highlights that the bulk of this renewed interest stems from Goldman’s traditional client base, particularly hedge funds. However, Minton indicated an expansion strategy that aims to encompass a broader client spectrum, including asset managers, bank clients, and a select group of digital asset firms, showcasing the bank’s commitment to diversifying its cryptocurrency engagement.



The utility of crypto derivatives, as BNN Bloomberg notes from Minton’s insights, spans directional bets, yield enhancement, and hedging purposes among Goldman’s clients. While Bitcoin-related products dominate client preferences, there’s an openness to expanding into Ether-related offerings, contingent on regulatory approvals for Ether ETFs in the United States.



Beyond trading, Goldman Sachs is pioneering in the digital asset tokenization space, leveraging blockchain technology. BNN Bloomberg mentions Goldman’s introduction of the GS DAP digital-asset platform and its involvement in a pilot blockchain network designed to streamline connections between banks, asset managers, and exchanges.



Furthermore, according to BNN Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs is not just a participant in the digital asset market but also invests in startups that align with its strategic vision, particularly those innovating in blockchain infrastructure.

Anthony Scaramucci Says ‘Big Bump Up’ in Demand Coming for Bitcoin in the Next Ten Years - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci is optimistic that demand for Bitcoin (BTC) will continue to increase in the coming years.
In a new interview at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York City, Scaramucci says the $84 trillion great wealth transfer from the baby boomers to the younger generation will have a bullish impact on Bitcoin.










The Wall Street veteran notes that 25-year-old investors today already have “a lot of Bitcoin” while their older counterparts own just “a little bit” of BTC, suggesting that demand for the flagship digital asset will ramp up in the coming years as new investors race to gobble up the crypto king. 
“So in the next 10 years, I see it like a big python where Bitcoin is going to get absorbed into the python. There will be a big bump up in Bitcoin demand and that’s coming inside of the next decade.”
Scaramucci says it is well within the realm of possibility for BTC to reach the $1 million level, considering that gold has a market cap of about $14.5 trillion. 
“Michael Novogratz or Cathie Wood, they see a $1 million Bitcoin. A $1 million Bitcoin is a $21 trillion marketplace, gold is $14-$15 trillion. 
They’re suggesting that Bitcoin should trade to a 150% of gold’s overall market cap. Let’s say they’re wrong. Let’s say it trades to its market cap or half of what they’re saying, that’s still inside of the ballpark of what I would consider digital gold.”

Decoding a web of crypto and dreams: The tale of Zhimin Qian | Cryptopolitan

Dreams of grandeur, a fugitive’s flight, and the shadowy realm of cryptocurrency collide in the life of Zhimin Qian, whose ambitions soared as high as becoming royalty in a land few recognize. This saga unfolds with the dreams of Qian, a 45-year-old woman embroiled in accusations of orchestrating a colossal £5bn scam. Her fantastical aspirations didn’t stop at financial success; they extended to being anointed by the Dalai Lama and constructing the largest Buddhist temple in Europe in Liberland, an unrecognized micronation nestled on the Danube. The drama came to light in a London courtroom, where Jian Wen, described as Qian’s “carer and assistant,” was recently convicted in a case of money laundering. The narrative that emerged was cinematic, featuring vast fortunes in bitcoin, international chases, and dreams that blurred the line between ambition and delusion.The Path of Deception and DreamsQian’s story is a stark reminder of the dark side of ambition. From the outset, she was a central figure in a narrative that reads like a thriller. The London police’s discovery during a raid on a Hampstead mansion in 2018 seemed like something out of a movie. The seizure of devices holding 61,000 bitcoin, valued at over £3bn today, marked one of the most significant crypto discoveries by law enforcement worldwide.But who is Zhimin Qian, and how did she find herself at the center of such a vast conspiracy? Born on September 4, 1978, Qian’s past is shrouded in mystery. Before the world knew her as the mastermind behind a billion-pound scam, she was a businesswoman in China. Her company, Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology, launched in 2014, sold investment products with the promise of unreal returns, dabbling in the lucrative yet murky waters of bitcoin mining.Her operations were elaborate, extending to renting Beijing’s prestigious Diaoyutai State Guesthouse for promotional events. Yet, beneath the surface, the legitimacy of her business was questioned, with allegations suggesting that the bitcoin mining operation was a facade to allure investors.The Flight and the Phantom KingdomQian’s aspirations were not confined to financial schemes; they extended to the realms of fantasy. The vision of being recognized as a reincarnated goddess and ruling over Liberland with a Buddhist temple was more than a mere daydream; it was a declaration of her desire for a legacy beyond the material.Yet, the stark contrast between her dreams and reality became evident as details of her life emerged in court. Despite her vast wealth, her existence was marred by isolation and physical ailment, with days spent bedridden, haunted by nightmares. Her digital diary, uncovered by the police, offered a glimpse into her mind, revealing a woman caught between the allure of crypto wealth and the pursuit of a fantastical destiny.As the law caught up with Qian, her world began to unravel. The 2018 raid did not immediately expose the full extent of her dealings in cryptocurrency, but subsequent investigations shed light on the magnitude of her operations. Her intricate web of deceit involved multiple identities and international travel, culminating in her flight from the UK.The pursuit of Qian raises critical questions about the challenges law enforcement faces in the digital age, where crypto assets can be concealed and transferred with a click. Her case underscores the growing concern over cryptocurrency’s role in facilitating criminal activities, casting a shadow over the technology’s potential for innovation.Despite her absence, the trial of Jian Wen served as a proxy for bringing Qian’s actions to light. The conviction of Wen on money laundering charges, while not directly implicating her in the alleged scam in China, highlights the international efforts to combat the misuse of digital currencies.

Is Argentina really dumping dollar for Bitcoin? How? | Cryptopolitan

The streets and online forums of Argentina are buzzing, not with the usual chatter about football or politics, but about something quite unexpected—Bitcoin. You might think that in a country where the dollar has long been king, such a shift would be unthinkable. Yet, here we are, witnessing a significant pivot as Argentinians increasingly cozy up to the idea of stashing their savings in BTC rather than the US greenback. For years, the dance of exchanging pesos for US dollars was as Argentine as tango. However, recent developments suggest a new rhythm is taking over. Data from local cryptocurrency exchange Lemon throws a spotlight on this shift, revealing a surge in Bitcoin investments, hitting record figures over the past year. This trend emerges as the country seeks alternatives to the dollar, amidst the financial strategies unfurling under President Javier Milei’s watch.A Shift Towards Digital GoldDollarization has been a hot topic in Argentina, especially with the election of President Milei, a figure who hasn’t minced his words about integrating the US dollar more deeply into the country’s economy. Despite these ambitions and a polite no-thank-you to an invitation from BRICS, Argentinians seem to be charting their own course, turning their backs on the dollar in favor of Bitcoin.The evidence is in the numbers. Lemon’s recent report highlighted an unexpected surge in Bitcoin transactions, with a record-breaking 35,000 in just one week of March, a stark leap from the 27,000 purchases the week before. This frenzy towards Bitcoin comes at a time when the country’s economy is navigating through troubled waters, with the currency devaluating swiftly under Milei’s administration. The pivot away from stablecoins, which previously accounted for 80% of Argentina’s crypto purchases, underscores a growing appetite for riskier, yet potentially more rewarding, digital currencies.Local firms like Belo, helmed by CEO Manuel Beaudroit, have observed this trend firsthand, noting a tenfold increase in Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions. Beaudroit’s insights reveal a reactive strategy among Argentinians: buy BTC when the market shows any sign of an upturn. This behavior signals a broader acceptance and understanding of cryptocurrencies as viable economic tools, especially in a volatile economic landscape.Navigating Through Economic TurmoilArgentina’s economy has seen better days. The final quarter of 2023 brought a 1.4% shrinkage compared to the previous year, marking a continuous decline over several quarters. Despite beating some analysts’ expectations, this trend paints a bleak picture for President Milei’s administration, which has been pushing a stringent austerity package since taking office.Facing inflation rates soaring over 275%, stringent capital controls, and rising poverty, Argentina teeters on the brink of a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in the United States defines a recession as a significant and widespread decline in economic activity lasting more than a few months. By this definition, Argentina is navigating choppy waters, with its economy contracting 1.6% in the full year of 2023.Amidst this economic backdrop, the country’s agricultural sector, alongside mining and hospitality, has shown resilience, while other sectors like manufacturing, retail, utilities, and finance have faced downturns. Investment, too, has taken a hit, further complicating the economic puzzle Milei’s government is trying to solve.So, why the turn to Bitcoin? For one, it represents a hedge against inflation—a digital fortress against the devaluation of the peso. Moreover, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature offers Argentinians a semblance of financial autonomy, unshackled from the whims of government policies and global economic trends.

SEC Chair Gensler Criticizes Crypto Firms for Dodging Registration, Calls for Enhanced Transparency



                    


SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently highlighted the evasion of registration requirements by certain entities within the cryptocurrency industry. 



In remarks prepared for a Columbia Law School event on March 22, Gensler emphasized the importance of transparency and regulatory compliance, invoking the words of Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis: “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.”




Gensler criticized the reluctance of some crypto market participants to adhere to the SEC’s disclosure regulations, pointing out that such avoidance leads to a lack of mandatory disclosure. 



“There still are those who would like to whittle away at the SEC’s disclosure regime,” he remarked. Highlighting the opacity within the crypto sector, Gensler added, “There are participants in crypto securities markets that seek to avoid these registration requirements. 



No registration means no mandatory disclosure. Many would agree that the crypto markets could use a little disinfectant.”

This stern critique comes amid the SEC’s active enforcement actions against prominent cryptocurrency companies, including Kraken, Binance, Ripple, and Coinbase. 



The ongoing legal battles and the demand from crypto businesses and advocacy groups for clearer regulations underscore the tension between innovation and regulatory compliance in the United States.



Moreover, the SEC’s efforts to bring cryptocurrencies under its regulatory scope have intensified, with moves to potentially classify Ether as a security. 



The past two years have seen the SEC making significant strides in approving cryptocurrency-related exchange-traded products (ETPs) for U.S. exchanges. 



These advancements include investment vehicles based on ETH and Bitcoin futures, as well as the launch of the first spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January.



Gensler’s comments reflect a broader regulatory initiative to ensure transparency and investor protection in the rapidly evolving crypto industry, amidst calls for a balanced approach that fosters innovation while ensuring market integrity.

This Solana Meme Coin Raised Over $100 Million


DAO Maker has achieved a remarkable feat, securing nearly $100 million in a presale for the PUNDU meme coin.
The significant investment contributed within 36 hours reflects a pronounced appetite for high-risk ventures in the crypto market. However, the overwhelming response resulted in an oversubscription, necessitating refunds for contributors who sent funds post-target attainment.
Solana Meme Coins in High Demand
DAO Maker unveiled an impressive $97.6 million raised across Binance Smart Chain and Solana, drawing support from over 20,000 users. PUNDU, introduced by the launchpad just days ago, swiftly captured investor interest, with contributions exchanging SOL and USDT for PUNDU allocations.
This success marks a milestone, establishing PUNDU’s presale as the largest for a meme coin. Most deposits originated from Binance Smart Chain, amassing $60 million. However, the Solana presale address also saw substantial activity. It received 212,404 SOL, equivalent to $37.6 million, surpassing the 33,333 SOL hard cap, highlighting the fervent interest in meme coins within the Solana ecosystem.
While PUNDU awaits its launch date, the meme coin pledges a fair rollout, earmarking 40% of tokens for the presale, another 40% for liquidity pools, and distributing the remaining 10% equally between marketing efforts and long-term exchange listings.

According to crypto investigator ZachXBT, Solana presales have raised more than 796,000 SOL, equivalent to around $149.20 million. Such mania urged Solana Labs Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko to advise investors to “stop” sending SOL presales.

“To me, it’s just a bizarre thing, I think, of people being terminally online and kind of having nothing better to do,” Yakovenko said.



Moreover, the frenzy surrounding meme coins led to the emergence of racist tokens. These meme coins, with offensive names, symbols, and imagery, include racial slurs, anti-Semitic references, and Nazi imagery.

Former Lordstown Motors CEO settled with the SEC 1

Steve Burns, the former founder, chairman, and CEO of Lordstown Motors, has reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding allegations of misleading investors about the demand for the company’s all-electric Endurance pickup truck. As part of the agreement filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Burns will pay a civil fine of $175,000 and is barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for two years.Former Lordstown Motors boss settles SEC lawsuitThe SEC’s investigation into Lordstown Motors began in February 2024 when the company was charged with misrepresenting the sales prospects of its Endurance electric pickup truck. In response, Lordstown Motors agreed to pay $25.5 million to settle the charges. This settlement marked a significant development in the aftermath of Lordstown Motors’ turbulent journey in the electric vehicle (EV) industry.The company was founded in April 2019 as a spinoff of Burns’ previous venture, Workhorse Group. The company went public in the following year through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, DiamondPeak Holdings Corp., which valued Lordstown Motors at $1.6 billion. This move attracted substantial investment, totaling $780 million from investors, as Lordstown Motors aimed to establish itself as a prominent player in the EV market.Like many other EV startups that went public via mergers with blank-check companies in 2020, Lordstown Motors initially experienced a surge in share prices. However, this optimism was short-lived as the company faced challenges in scaling production and fulfilling sales expectations for its electric vehicles. Despite securing investments and partnerships, including support from General Motors (GM) and acquiring a large assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, from GM, Lordstown Motors encountered setbacks in meeting its targets.Challenges and controversies in the EV industryOne pivotal moment for Lordstown Motors was in June 2020 when it unveiled its Endurance electric pickup truck amidst considerable fanfare, including a ceremony attended by former Vice President Mike Pence. At the event, Burns announced an impressive number of pre-orders, claiming 20,000 orders for the truck. However, subsequent investigations revealed discrepancies in these claims, with short seller research firm Hindenburg Research disputing the actual demand for the vehicle.By June 2021, Burns and other executives resigned from Lordstown Motors amid mounting scrutiny and regulatory investigations. The SEC’s investigation found that Lordstown Motors and Burns had made misleading statements regarding the demand for the Endurance truck, particularly overstating pre-orders from commercial fleet customers. This misrepresentation painted an inaccurate picture of the actual demand and contributed to investor confusion.Following these revelations, Lordstown Motors faced ongoing challenges and eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Despite the bankruptcy, the company emerged with a new name, Nu Ride Inc., and a renewed focus on pursuing legal action against Foxconn, alleging harm to its business by the tech giant. The settlement with the SEC serves as a reminder of the regulatory scrutiny and consequences faced by companies and executives in the dynamic and competitive EV industry.

UK Woman Found Guilty of Laundering Bitcoin Tied to $6 Billion China Fraud


																Jian Wen, a former takeaway worker residing in north London, was found guilty of one count of money laundering after she was found with Bitcoin worth over $2.5 billion (£2 billion) in 2018.
Jian Wen assisted a Chinese fugitive known to Wen as Zhang Yadi, whose real name is Qian Zhimin, in laundering the BTC funds.
The Bitcoin Laundering Case
Wen was found with Bitcoin valued at over £2 billion, which she had been involved in converting into assets such as multi-million-pound houses and jewelry. Despite living in a flat above a Chinese restaurant in Leeds when she first became involved in criminal activity, Wen’s lifestyle saw a drastic upgrade.
Wen’s attempt to legitimize her newfound wealth by claiming to have earned millions through legitimate Bitcoin mining was not believed. She also faced difficulties passing money-laundering checks when attempting to purchase expensive properties in London.
The investigation revealed that another suspect named Zhang Yadi is believed to be the mastermind behind the fraud. Prosecutors alleged that Wen aided Zhang in converting stolen funds amassed through fraudulent wealth schemes targeting thousands of Chinese investors.




During the investigation, British police seized wallets containing more than 61,000 BTC, constituting one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures globally. The initial estimates valued the Bitcoin funds at around £2 billion, but due to price fluctuations, it has since increased to approximately £3.4 billion.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has obtained a freezing order from the High Court as part of a civil recovery investigation that could lead to the forfeiture of the Bitcoin.
Wen Found Guilty of Money Laundering
During the trial, Prosecutor Gillian Jones disclosed that Zhang entered Britain in 2017 with a fake passport amid Chinese authorities’ probe into the fraud. Zhang sought to convert the stolen funds, initially turned into Bitcoin for their transfer out of China, and used Wen as a “front person.”
Her defense portrayed her as a victim deceived by Zhang, emphasizing her intent to provide a better life for her son. However, the prosecution argued that Wen should have been aware of the illegal source of the funds, given Zhang’s criminal activities and efforts to evade Chinese authorities. Despite this, jurors found her guilty of one count of money laundering.
Andrew Penhale, the chief crown prosecutor at the CPS, noted organized criminals’ increasing use of cryptocurrencies to disguise and transfer assets. He stated that this case illustrates the significant proceeds available to such fraudsters.
Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Prins, who led the investigation, emphasized the international nature of the operation, highlighting how criminals exploit cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.
Wen is scheduled to be sentenced on May 10 while the hunt for Zhang continues as she remains at large.

Cryptocurrency Market Statement from Goldman Sachs: "Customers Started to Show Interest Again" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Goldman Sachs' hedge fund clients are also showing renewed interest in cryptocurrency markets.
This follows the recent approval of ETFs, which has led to a resurgence of interest and activity in the crypto space.


“Many of our largest clients are active or exploring becoming active in this space,” Max Minton, Goldman's Asia Pacific head of digital assets, said in an interview.
Goldman Sachs, which launched its crypto trading desk in 2021, currently offers cash-settled Bitcoin options and Ethereum options trading in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures listed on CME. However, it does not trade the underlying cryptocurrencies.





Minton noted that although last year was quieter, there has been an increase in customer interest, new customer acquisitions, transaction flow and volume since the beginning of the year.
The majority of demand comes from Goldman's existing clients, particularly traditional hedge funds, according to Minton. The bank is also expanding to a “broader customer base,” including asset managers, bank customers and select digital asset firms.


Clients use crypto derivatives for a variety of purposes, including directional investments, yield enhancement and hedging. While interest in Ethereum-related products may change depending on whether Ethereum ETFs gain approval in the US, Bitcoin-related products still make up the majority of customers' focus.

In addition to trading, Goldman is also active in tokenizing traditional assets using blockchain. The bank has launched a digital asset platform called GS DAP and recently participated in a pilot test on a blockchain network connecting banks, asset managers and exchanges.





Goldman has also invested in startups that are strategic to its vision and the evolution of the digital asset market structure, particularly blockchain infrastructure companies.
“We have a portfolio and will invest when it makes strategic sense,” Minton concluded.

282 US Banks Suffer 'Toxic Combo' That Could Trigger Collapse, With $900,000,000,000 in Total Assets at Stake: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A total of 282 US banks with $900 billion in total assets are suffering from a “toxic combo” that could push them to the brink of failure, according to a new report.
According to the consulting firm Klaros Group, the banks in question simultaneously have large levels of exposure to commercial real estate and significant unrealized losses on their balance sheets, reports CNBC.










Klaros Group won’t disclose the names of the banks that may need to raise capital or merge to survive, fearing the information could spark bank runs.
To compile the list, Klaros looked at regulatory filings known as call reports for 4,000 banks, scanning for firms whose commercial real estate loans are over 300% of capital.
That group was then cross-referenced with banks that also have unrealized losses on bonds and loans which pushed capital levels under 4%.
Klaros co-founder Brian Graham says the size of its list shows regulators have a big challenge ahead.
“If there were just 10 banks that were in trouble, they would have all been taken down and dealt with. 
When you’ve got hundreds of banks facing these challenges, the regulators have to walk a bit of a tightrope.”
Of the 282 banks, 16 hold between $10 billion and $100 billion in assets, and the majority of the banks on the list hold less than $10 billion in assets.
Although the names of the financial institutions are shrouded in secrecy, CNBC notes that New York Community Bank (NYCB) is clearly a high profile name on the list.
The bank recently revealed that its losses in the fourth quarter of last year were $2.4 billion worse than previously reported, and $4.165 billion in deposits have exited the bank in the last few months.

Altcoin Trader Reveals Secrets to 1,000X Gains


Altcoin trader Rekt Fencer has caused a stir with his candid revelation on achieving a staggering 1,000X gains through meme coins. 
Fencer’s strategy, centered on the concept of ‘sniping’ new token launches, is allegedly profitable even for those with investors modest capital.
Secrets to Trading Meme Coins
Fencer explained one of the easiest methods to achieve significant returns with meme coins. This approach, while controversial, has shown to be effective for him in a market where timing and information are everything.
The key to Fencer’s method lies in meticulous pre-analysis and constant monitoring of the market for new listings. By utilizing resources like DEX Screener, traders can identify trending narratives and potential catalysts that could drive the price of newly listed meme coins. 

“The longer the narrative in the Top Gainers, the stronger it becomes,” Fencer noted

Moreover, Fencer shed light on the critical role of sniper bots in executing this strategy. These bots are designed to buy tokens as quickly as possible at launch. Therefore, they can significantly increase the chances of securing a token before its value skyrockets. 
Among the recommended tools are BONKbot for Solana on-chain trading, BananaGun for Ethereum and Solana, and Unibot, a popular choice for EVM and soon Solana.

“To buy tokens as fast as possible, you need to use sniper bots. There isn’t a universal bot that works perfectly for every chain. Each bot has its own customization instructions. Mastering this skill isn’t easy, but the rewards that follow will more than compensate for your efforts,” Fencer added.

However, Fencer’s method is not without its risks. The volatile nature of meme coins and the potential for crypto scams underscore the importance of diligence and risk management. Investors are advised to verify the security of tokens through platforms like Rug Check and Coin Scan. Traders must also be prepared for the possibility that not every investment will yield the anticipated returns.
Despite the inherent risks, Fencer’s strategy offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential rewards of cryptocurrency trading. By combining thorough research, strategic use of technology, and an understanding of market dynamics, traders can position themselves to capture significant gains.

Bitcoin to Reach $1 Million? Insights and Predictions from Anthony Scaramucci | Cryptoglobe


                                
Reflexivity Research, a subsidiary of DeFi Technologies, held its first-ever Bitcoin Investor Day in New York City on 22 March 2024. The event sought to merge traditional financial principles with the innovative potential of Bitcoin.



Hosted by Anthony Pompliano, the co-founder of Reflexivity, the conference featured prominent discussions about the role of Bitcoin in both traditional and institutional finance. Distinguished speakers, including Cathie Wood, Anthony Scaramucci, and Mike Novogratz, addressed a diverse audience of institutional investors, capital allocators, and entrepreneurs.



At this event, Yahoo Finance reporter Brad Smith managed to get an interview with Anthony Scaramucci, the Founder and Managing Partner of SkyBridge Capital. 



Scaramucci began by commending the event’s organizer, Anthony Pompliano, for making Bitcoin accessible to a broad audience, including individual investors and major institutional investors. He highlighted the transition of Bitcoin from being primarily driven by retail demand to gaining institutional comfort. This shift was largely attributed to the recent approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. SEC, which provided a regulated investment vehicle for institutions.



Scaramucci pointed to the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected around late April 2024, as a critical event. The halving will reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market by half, from 900 to 450 bitcoins per day. He suggested that if the demand pace remains steady, this supply cut could significantly push Bitcoin’s price up.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Scaramucci attributed the significant outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. to a combination of factors. He mentioned bankruptcy trustees from firms like beleaguered crypto companies such as Celsius selling off their GBTC holdings and traditional GBTC investors switching to the more cost-effective spot Bitcoin ETFs. 



Scaramucci discussed the impending great wealth transfer from baby boomers to younger generations, emphasizing Bitcoin’s potential role. He drew parallels between the early adoption of the internet by younger people and the expected increase in Bitcoin adoption by the same demographic. He projected a significant increase in Bitcoin demand over the next decade, potentially raising Bitcoin’s market cap to rival or exceed that of gold.



He also touched upon the growing political importance of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, predicting that candidates’ stances on digital currencies could influence future elections. Scaramucci noted that there is increasing pressure on politicians to adopt pro-cryptocurrency positions to secure votes from the significant number of cryptocurrency wallet holders in the U.S.



On the topic of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), Scaramucci shared insights into the discussions within the U.S. government about adopting a digital currency. While he personally does not support the idea of CBDCs, he acknowledged the inevitability of their development, especially if other major economies like China and the European Union move forward with their digital currencies.



Finally, Scaramucci spoke about the current trends in the equity market, particularly concerning AI companies. He suggested that if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as expected, it could provide a boost to the market, including AI stocks. However, he advised investors to focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market movements, echoing his advice to Bitcoin and AI investors to hold onto their investments for long-term gains.

ADA at $10 Price In View As Cardano Surpasses Ethereum (ETH), Other Top Blockchains In Developer Activity ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Cardano (ADA) has emerged as a leader in developer activity, surpassing Ethereum (ETH) and other major blockchain networks. The surge in GitHub commits reflects Cardano’s commitment to innovation and growth, positioning it as a frontrunner in the competitive blockchain landscape.



GitHub commits are updates or modifications made to a project’s code on the GitHub platform using the Git version control system.



Each commit represents a specific change to the codebase, like adding features, fixing bugs, or enhancing performance. Commits include a message explaining the changes, aiding collaboration and progress tracking in software development.



Impressive GitHub Commit Numbers



IntoTheBlock reports that Cardano’s ADA is currently the cryptocurrency with the highest development activity and weekly engagements, surpassing major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). Following ADA, Avalanche (AVAX) takes the third spot, with Litecoin (LTC) ranking fourth.







Between March 11 and 17, Cardano recorded an impressive total of 978,780 commits on GitHub, showcasing its proactive approach to advancing its platform. In comparison, Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform, trailed behind with 407,170 commits during the same period.

&nbsp



This significant lead in GitHub activity underscores Cardano’s dedication to attracting developers and enhancing its ecosystem.



The rise of Cardano’s developer activity also sheds light on the broader trend of increasing engagement across layer-1 (L1) blockchain protocols. Avalanche (AVAX) recorded 315,770 commits, demonstrating a strong commitment to innovation and growth. 



Similarly, Litecoin (LTC) and Tron (TRX) showed notable developer engagement, with 84,110 and 79,380 commits, respectively. Despite these efforts, these networks still lag behind Cardano in terms of overall developer activity.



Developer engagement is a critical metric for evaluating a blockchain protocol’s potential growth and evolution. High-commit counts indicate an active developer community working on decentralized applications (dApps) and improving the network’s capabilities.



This continuous development work is essential for enhancing the functionality and resilience of the blockchain network over time.



Cardano Price Performance vs. Developer Activity



ADA/USDT Price Chart: TradingView



Despite Cardano’s strong developer activity, its price performance has not mirrored this success. ADA has been trading below the $1 mark since April 2022 and is currently priced at $0.63, reflecting a 0.18% surge in the past 24 hours. Despite the positive GitHub commit data, ADA has experienced a decrease of 20.66% over the past week.



However, several analysts have recently expressed optimism about the asset, forecasting a new record high in the coming days. For instance, X user Ali Charts drew parallels between the coin’s current performance and its past bull cycle, suggesting a potential “parabolic” surge to reach as high as $10.

Bitcoin's volatility might rise in the days ahead - Why? - AMBCrypto



This was the largest spike in the movement of BTC’s dormant supply in more than two years.
Whales continued to add Bitcoin exposure to their portfolios.

Bitcoin [BTC] consolidated in the $64k — $67k range over the week, facing a stiff resistance at $68k.
At press time, the king coin was exchanging hands at $64.14k, 12% lower than the all-time high (ATH) hit earlier in the month, according to CoinMarketCap.
What to expect next?
However, days ahead could witness a significant bout of volatility. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, many previously inactive BTCs started moving between addresses on the 23rd of March.
In fact, this was the largest spike in the movement of BTC’s dormant supply in more than two years.
Source: Santiment
For much of 2023, dormant supply across major age bands hit new highs, signaling a market strategy of caution and HODLing.
But with Bitcoin’s price zooming to new highs in 2024, these long-term holders began chasing profits, freeing up more Bitcoins for active trading. Typically, fall in dormant supply precedes volatility and price surges.
Current market structure supports price increase
Notably, most of the long-term holders were in a state of profit, AMBCrypto analyzed using Glassnode’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss metric.
This market phase, dubbed as one of belief, has historically aided further price increases, as shown below. The market top, generally associated with euphoria and greed, was still a long way off.

Whales continue to stockpile
Meanwhile, whales were making full use of the suppressed market to add more Bitcoin exposure to their portfolios.
The number of unique entities holding at least 1k coins jumped to 1,616 on the 23rd of March, the highest since February 2021.

Whales exhibited their optimism in the derivatives markets as well. At press time, nearly 58% of all whale positions on Binance were long on Bitcoin, as per Hyblock Capital.

Nigeria’s crypto fee hike predicted to foster innovation 1

In the dynamic landscape of Nigeria’s crypto market, recent regulatory proposals have sparked discussions among industry experts and stakeholders in the country. The suggested increase in crypto registration fees and government restrictions on peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms have raised concerns but also highlighted potential opportunities for collaboration and innovation.Nigeria’s SEC increases crypto registration fee A report from Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recommended amending rules for platforms offering crypto services, proposing a significant hike in registration fees for crypto exchanges from 30 million naira ($18,620) to 150 million naira ($93,000). This proposed increase has drawn attention to the challenges faced by crypto exchanges operating in Nigeria and their ability to adapt to evolving regulatory requirements.Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes and a prominent figure in the crypto space, provided insights into the potential implications of these regulatory changes. Youssef, who co-founded Paxful, a P2P exchange, noted that while the fee increase may attract larger players like Coinbase to the country’s market, it also signals a shift towards limiting P2P services, particularly in response to foreign exchange challenges.The country’s crypto market has shown a strong preference for P2P trading, making it a cornerstone of the ecosystem. However, government restrictions aimed at addressing foreign exchange concerns could pose significant hurdles for exchanges that rely heavily on P2P transactions. Despite these challenges, Youssef remains optimistic about Nigeria’s potential to navigate these regulatory complexities and maintain its position as a key player in the global crypto landscape.Opportunities amidst regulatory evolutionThe lifting of the CBN’s ban on crypto transactions in December 2023 marked a pivotal moment for the industry, allowing crypto exchanges to apply for licenses and operate more openly in the market. This regulatory shift signaled a recognition of the growing influence and importance of cryptocurrencies in the country and globally.Youssef also commented on recent partnerships between crypto firms and the Nigerian government, such as Gluwa’s collaboration to enhance the adoption of the eNaira, Nigeria’s central bank digital currency (CBDC). While these partnerships present opportunities for innovation and collaboration, they also underscore the need for a balanced regulatory framework that fosters growth and protects investors and consumers.Despite recent challenges, Nigeria remains one of the most crypto-obsessed countries globally, as evidenced by the high volume of Google searches related to cryptocurrencies. This enthusiasm reflects a strong interest and potential for continued growth and innovation in the Nigerian crypto market.Nigeria’s crypto market faces regulatory hurdles with proposed fee increases and P2P platform restrictions. However, stakeholders like Youssef see these challenges as opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and continued growth in the industry. Balancing regulatory requirements with market dynamics will be crucial in shaping the future of Nigeria’s crypto ecosystem.

Why Iceland is slowly pulling out of Bitcoin now | Cryptopolitan

Shifting away from the whirlwind of Bitcoin and its energy-guzzling operations, Iceland is steering its focus towards ensuring its dinner tables don’t feel the harsh sting of global disruptions. With the world showing its rough edges, Iceland’s top brass has decided it’s time to dig their heels into the soil, quite literally, and give farming a much-needed hug. This move isn’t just about getting dirty in the fields; it’s a bold statement against the reliance on digital currency mining that’s been sucking the country’s power dry. The recent uproar from European farmers and the constant hiccup in trade routes have been a wake-up call. According to Iceland’s Prime Minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, in conversations with financial bigwigs, it’s been clear that betting the farm on imports isn’t a safe gamble anymore. Iceland, known for its icy landscapes rather than lush farmlands, is tackling this head-on. The country’s leaders are not just thinking about the next harvest; they’re planning for a future where they’re not at the mercy of international supply chains.A Shift Towards Self-SufficiencyJakobsdóttir’s blend of environmental and economic strategy is a clear signal that Iceland is changing lanes. The country’s abundant renewable energy resources have been a beacon for Bitcoin miners from around the globe. This influx has transformed Iceland into a sanctuary for data centers, all hungry for a piece of the green energy pie. However, this digital gold rush is starting to lose its luster.The prime minister’s latest maneuver is not just about curbing the appetite of these data behemoths. It’s a broader vision to repurpose the nation’s renewable resources towards more pressing needs, like heating homes and supporting industries that touch every Icelander’s life directly. With a population just shy of 400,000, the focus is shifting to ensure that their energy needs aren’t sidelined for cryptocurrency’s sake.Jakobsdóttir’s stance is clear: while Bitcoin might be making waves globally, it’s not going to ride the renewable energy wave in Iceland any longer. The proposal to boost wind energy is a nod towards industries that align with the country’s goal of carbon neutrality, leaving Bitcoin and its ilk in the rearview mirror.The allure of cheap hydroelectric power drew a slew of data centers to Iceland’s shores. But this digital attraction has been a double-edged sword. Research by Luxor indicates that these crypto operations are hogging more electricity than all Icelandic households combined. This imbalance reached a tipping point over the winter, pushing fish-processing plants to resort to oil and diesel – a solution that’s as unsustainable as it is undesirable.Rebalancing Iceland’s Economic and Environmental ScalesThe backdrop to these changes isn’t just local. Europe’s broader challenges with food security and balancing agricultural output with environmental goals are casting a long shadow. Countries like France and the Netherlands are in a tightrope walk, trying to keep their farming sectors alive while adhering to stringent climate objectives.Iceland’s own foray into boosting farm output through a new funding system and trials in corn cultivation marks a significant pivot. With the majority of animal products locally sourced, the push towards growing more cereals and vegetables domestically is a step towards dietary independence. The emphasis on self-reliance is not just about pride; it’s a strategic move in an increasingly isolationist global landscape.The economic script is also undergoing revisions, with Iceland’s central bank holding interest rates steady in a bold stance against inflation. Despite expectations of a cut, the decision underscores a commitment to stabilizing the economy amidst fluctuating global conditions. This financial discipline, coupled with efforts to support those impacted by natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, paints a picture of a nation that’s not just reacting to immediate threats but planning for a resilient future.

Bitcoin: History suggests BTC will be up and running again after... - AMBCrypto



BTC’s price moved marginally in the last 24 hours. 
Market indicators hinted at a few more slow-moving days. 

Investors might have been worried about the last few days, as Bitcoin’s [BTC] price witnessed multiple corrections. 
However, they must not lose hope, as this might just be yet another re-testing phase, which could end with another bull rally. 
What history suggests 
The last week did not witness high volatility in terms of BTC’s price action, as the king of cryptos’ value moved marginally. A similar trend was also noted in the last 24 hours. 
According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, BTC was trading at $64,796.66 with a market capitalization of over $1.27 trillion. 
However, there were chances for the coin’s price to turn volatile over the days to follow. Moustache, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet mentioning how BTC was in a “re-testing” phase. 
If history is to be considered, BTC might soon begin a bull rally, as the coin turned bullish when its price entered a similar pattern back in 2017 and 2020. 
Therefore, AMBCrypto checked Bitcoin’s metrics to see the chances of the coin actually kick-starting a bull rally. 
Metrics look bearish though
Despite a historical bull pattern, Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics continued to look bearish. For example, it’s aSOPR was red, as per our analysis of CryptoQuant’s data. 
This meant that more investors were selling at a profit. In the middle of a bull market, it could indicate a market top. 
Its Binary CDD followed a similar trend, meaning that long-term holders’ movements in the last seven days were higher than average. If they were moved for the purpose of selling, it may have a negative impact.
Source: CryptoQuant
Nonetheless, other metrics told a different story. Bitcoin’s exchange reserve was dropping at press time, indicating that selling pressure on the coin was low. 
Additionally, its Funding Rate and Taker Buy Sell Ratio was in the green, suggesting that buying sentiment was dominant in the derivatives market.
Source: CryptoQuant
AMBCrypto then checked BTC’s daily chart to find out which direction the coin was headed.

Our analysis of TradingView’s chart suggested that investors might as well witness a few more slow-moving days, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved sideways near the neutral zone.
 The Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed a similar trend, indicating that chances of less volatile price movement were high.

Ripple Devs Caution Against Using XRPL’s Newly Released AMM - DailyCoin


        
XRPL recently embraced AMM to catalyze liquidity and trading on its platform. 



Before the feature could take off, the new AMMs are experiencing serious issues. 



Ripple developers are cautioning against using the new AMMs for the time being. 
The XRP Ledger (XRPL) recently took a major step towards expanding its DeFi ecosystem by launching its new Automated Market Markers (AMMs.) The new addition aimed to unlock additional avenues of liquidity and trading on the network for both developers and users. Yet, as anticipation reached a fever pitch, technical issues emerged, raising concerns about the new feature. Ripple Devs Identify a Serious ProblemRippleX, the development arm of Ripple, cautioned users not to use the newly launched AMM pools on the XRP Ledger, citing technical issues affecting the new feature. In an official notice, Ripple developers flagged a major discrepancy in several AMM pools on the XRP Ledger, which caused transactions to be processed incorrectly. According to the devs, the glitch affected how the DEX payment engine routed liquidity through AMM pools and order books. As a precaution, RippleX suggested refraining from depositing new funds into AMM pools to avoid further complications. The developers also advised users with LP tokens in AMM pools to redeem them until the issue is resolved. Ripple Developers have assured that they are working to resolve the issue alongside community participants. At press time, RippleX announced they were reviewing a proposed fix with the community. For extra added security, DailyCoin urges users to prioritize their safety and stay up to date with authorized communication from Ripple developers. Avoid clicking unverified links and ask for help from officials.On the Flipside
Previously, the XRPL relied solely on manual market making and central limit order books for liquidity. 



While AMMs have proven successful on other blockchains, the XRPL AMM is still in its early stages. It remains to be seen how it will perform in the long term.



While AMMs offer potential benefits, they introduce new risks for users.  Unlike traditional order books, AMMs rely on algorithms susceptible to manipulation or unforeseen vulnerabilities.
Why This MattersXRPL’s adoption of an AMM for its DEX platform marked a significant milestone. However, encountering such issues can cast doubt on the feature and impact stakeholders’ confidence. Still, Ripple’s prompt response to the issue is commendable and positions the company to uphold its reputation. Read how Bitcoin ETFs were faring in the wake of the market tumbling:Bitcoin ETFs End Week in Net Outflows Amid BTC PullbackMore on XRPL’s new AMMs:How XRP Ledger’s New AMM Makes Crypto Trading Easier Than Ever

No, EU Is Not Banning Anonymous Crypto Wallets


A flurry of claims about an EU-wide ban on anonymous crypto wallets and transactions has been debunked by industry expert Patrick Hansen. In a lengthy thread on the X social media network, Hansen has explained what the EU's Anti Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR) actually entails for the industry.  Understanding the AMLR's reachThe AMLR, contrary to widespread belief, does not single out cryptocurrency regulations. Instead, it serves as a broad anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) framework applicable to a range of institutions deemed "obliged entities" (OEs).These entities span financial sectors, including crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). They also extend to non-financial institutions prone to AML/CFT risks (such as sports clubs and gambling services).Importantly, the regulation explicitly exempts providers of non-custodial wallets from its obligations.Impact on anonymous transactionsA crucial aspect of the AMLR is its application to CASPs, including exchanges and brokers regulated under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. These providers are required to adhere to standard KYC/AML procedures, including customer due diligence (CDD).This means the prohibition of anonymous accounts and services for users of custodial crypto businesses. Additionally, CASPs are barred from offering accounts for privacy coins, a practice already commonplace in the global crypto exchange landscape due to existing AML rules.Nothing new?Despite Hansen's criticisms of certain AMLR provisions, the regulation, as he points out, largely reaffirms existing AML/CFT rules for CASPs and OEs.It has not introduced radically new restrictions on self-custody payments, wallets, or peer-to-peer transfers.According to Hansen, the regulation poses an "extremely limited" impact on the crypto sector within the EU.

SEC v. Ethereum: What to Expect and Why It Is Crucial to Crypto Market

What is happeningThe SEC is intensifying efforts to classify Ethereum as a security, issuing subpoenas to companies involved with the Ethereum Foundation. This move casts doubt on the approval of Ethereum ETFs, following the SEC's recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs.If Ethereum is classified as a security, it could face stringent trading regulations. This might entail increased paperwork and restrictions on buying and selling Ethereum for retail traders in the U.S. Additionally, companies involved with Ethereum may need to adhere to regulations similar to those governing stocks and bonds, potentially introducing complexity into their operations.Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake model in 2022 prompted the SEC's scrutiny, despite previous statements suggesting Ethereum's commodity-like status. The investigation's outcome could impact Ethereum's regulatory status and the approval process for Ether ETFs, adding uncertainty to the crypto industry.The SEC's investigation into Ethereum involves companies being subpoenaed to provide documents and financial records regarding their interactions with the Ethereum Foundation, responsible for governing and developing the Ethereum blockchain.The probe gained momentum after Ethereum's transition to a "proof-of-stake" governance model in September 2022, prompting the SEC to reconsider Ethereum's classification as a security. This shift away from Bitcoin's energy-intensive model provided a new pretext for the SEC's scrutiny.SEC's positionUnder Gary Gensler's leadership, the SEC has signaled a broader regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies, particularly those utilizing proof-of-stake models. However, Ethereum's approval for ETFs tracking Ether futures by the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has added complexity to its regulatory status.Despite CFTC's view of Ether as a commodity, the SEC's investigation into Ethereum's security status has led to speculation and uncertainty within the crypto industry. The potential declaration of Ethereum as a security could further complicate the approval process for Ether ETFs and raise questions regarding CFTC's oversight of Ether futures markets.Gensler suggested that Ethereum's transition to the "proof-of-stake" mechanism, where coin holders earn rewards by staking their assets, might subject Ether to securities regulations. This change from the previous "proof-of-work" method used by Ethereum resembled a significant shift in how the blockchain operated.Why it mattersWhile Ethereum's legal status has long been ambiguous, recent developments suggest a push by the SEC to label it as a security. This contrasts with previous statements indicating Ethereum's resemblance to commodities rather than securities. On March 22, the SEC extended the deadline to May 30 for its decision on Grayscale's Ethereum Futures Trust ETF.If Ethereum is labeled a security, it could face stricter trading regulations, posing challenges for investors and exchanges. Delisting Ethereum from exchanges and the impact on projects built on its blockchain are major concerns. Using a registered security for everyday transactions, like paying gas fees, would be impractical.Crypto industry reactsRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is positive the SEC will lose the case:
Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal noted that ETH's status as a commodity has long been established:

FTX creditor disputes John Ray's letter to SBF, claims misinformation | Cryptopolitan

As the FTX saga unfolds, it’s turning into a Hollywood-worthy script, minus the popcorn and happy endings. Recently, Sunil, a creditor with a vested interest in FTX, threw a curveball into the mix. According to Sunil, John Ray’s correspondence regarding Sam Bankman-Fried is not just off-base; it’s flying into the realm of fiction. And oh, how the plot thickens. The Allegations: A Deep DiveSunil’s accusations aren’t just grave; they’re seismic in the context of FTX’s meltdown. For starters, the claim that FTX, under new leadership, has been anything but a guardian angel to its creditors is startling. Picture this: Solana, a cryptocurrency with the agility of a greyhound, being offloaded at $60 when the market was batting its eyelashes at $170. And let’s not even get started on the mystifying $1 billion Mysten saga. It’s like selling your umbrella in the midst of a downpour and then wondering why you’re drenched.But wait, there’s more. When John Ray swaggered into the CEO’s office, FTX had 105 Bitcoins in its digital vault. No small change, right? But what about the 55 million or so Solana tokens? Crickets. It’s like finding out your favorite magician has been hiding more than just rabbits in his hat.The real kicker, however, is the alleged backdoor left ajar by Alameda, SBF’s other brainchild. This isn’t just a tiny oversight; it’s a gaping hole through which cryptocurrencies could have vanished into the ether, making it impossible for creditors to reclaim their digital treasures. And who was supposedly in on this grand illusion? None other than Sullivan and Cromwell (S&C), according to insider whispers, who apparently were as helpful as a screen door on a submarine in stopping this debacle.The Counter-Narrative: A Battle of PerspectivesJohn Ray’s letter, on the other hand, paints a different picture. In it, he dons the cape of the hero, tirelessly working alongside a team of professionals to salvage what remains of the FTX shipwreck. According to him, their efforts have been Herculean, involving governance restructuring and asset protection that could rival Fort Knox’s security. Ray’s narrative suggests that without their intervention, FTX’s assets would be little more than a footnote in the annals of cryptocurrency calamities.Ray further contends that it’s precisely because of the Chapter 11 proceedings that assets like Solana had the breathing room to bounce back. In his view, the court process has been the lighthouse guiding FTX’s ship away from the rocks, enabling the recovery of assets that now offer a glimmer of hope to creditors.But here’s where the paths diverge. Sunil and his camp see the situation through a lens tinted with skepticism. They argue that the actions taken have not been in the best interest of FTX’s creditors. Instead, they see a narrative being spun that deflects blame onto external forces and previous management, painting current efforts in a heroic light that perhaps isn’t fully deserved.At the heart of this dispute is a fundamental disagreement over the path FTX has taken since declaring bankruptcy. On one side, there’s a belief that the new management’s actions have been akin to rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, with questionable decisions and a lack of transparency about the full scope of assets and liabilities.On the other, there’s a narrative of a phoenix rising from the ashes, with Ray and his team portrayed as the architects of a miraculous recovery. This story speaks of tireless efforts to right wrongs, chase down culprits, and somehow, against all odds, start making creditors whole again.

Saito - A Paradigm Shift in Blockchain Applications - Brave New Coin

Richard Parris is a co-founder at Saito - a self-sufficient Layer 1 Blockchain designed for devs that provides the foundation for building open and scalable web applications.
Why you should listen
Saito is a new type of layer-1 blockchain that powers peer-to-peer applications. Saito delivers a new economic model for blockchain. Saito Consensus aligns incentives for all participants, paying nodes for scale while remaining open.
Saito is designed to create a real economy running on this network, that supports an open ecosystem of peer to peer applications, where users are sovereign and own their data, and providers that serve them best are most profitable.
Saito Consensus eliminates the sybil attacks, majoritarian attacks,and several other attack vectors common in proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms by correcting the collective action problems buried in their incentive structures.
When users send transactions into the network they add cryptographic routing signatures that specify the first-hop node(s) to which they are sending their transaction(s). Receiving nodes add similar routing signatures as they forward these transactions, creating an unforgeable record within transactions of the path they have taken into the network.
These routing paths can be examined to confirm the amount of “routing work” available in a transaction. Transactions without valid routing paths contain no routing work. The amount of routing work in any other transaction is its total fee halved with each hop beyond the first that the transaction has taken into the network.
The blockchain maintains a “difficulty” for block production that is measured in routing work. Nodes produce blocks when they have enough routing work in the transactions in their mempool to meet difficulty criteria. Blocks which do not contain the required amount of routing work are invalid according to consensus rules.
While most of crypto uses a Web 2 model with token integrations or a federated model reliant on volunteer work, Saito applications operate in true, peer-to-peer Web 3 and are self-funding.

BlackRock's ETF could flip GBTC in Bitcoin holdings within 3 weeks

The amount of Bitcoin in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF could overtake crypto asset manager Grayscale’s GBTC within the next three weeks, assuming no drastic changes in current flows. As of March 22, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF held 238,500 Bitcoin (BTC) on its books — worth $15.5 billion at current prices, but has touted an average daily inflow of approximately $274 million — roughly 4,120 in new Bitcoin entering the fund every day. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) reports that it still holds an estimated 350,252 BTC — worth $23 billion at current prices. It has been experiencing an average daily outflow of roughly $277 million, or roughly 4,140 BTC daily, over the last fortnight. GBTC outflows ramped up last week. Source: FarSide InvestorsAssuming no drastic changes in the rate of the inflows and outflows, BlackRock could overtake Grayscale in terms of total Bitcoin held by April 11. This date could come even closer if BlackRock’s inflows were to return to the prior week’s daily average inflow of 7,200 Bitcoin, meaning the flip could occur in 10 days. VIDEO“BlackRock is going to flip Grayscale soon,” YouTuber George Tung said in a March 20 video on his CryptosRUs channel.“I say within the next two weeks — it’s going to happen.”If BlackRock surpasses Grayscale, it will officially become the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin in the world. Related: Bitcoin price clear for new record high as GBTC outflows drop to $170MOn March 18, GBTC notched a staggering $643 million in net outflows, its largest day of bleeding on record. While the flows leaned up a little in the following days, the heightened volume of outflows saw several analysts warn of potential downward volatility in the price of Bitcoin.Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wasn’t too concerned by the GBTC-led outflows and predicted the exodus could be over almost entirely within the next few weeks. Additionally, Blachunas speculated that the majority of last week’s outflows came from bankruptcies of crypto firms such as Genesis and Digital Currency Group due to their “size and consistency.”On March 10, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF officially outpaced MicroStrategy’s holdings of the cryptocurrency. As of the time of publication, MicroStrategy holds 214,246 BTC on its books after purchasing an additional 9,000 BTC on March 19.

Trader Predicts Rallies for Chainlink and One Under-the-Radar Gaming Altcoin - But There’s a Catch - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst believes that rallies are in sight for a couple of altcoins including the native asset of the decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK).
Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 211,300 followers on the social media platform X that he sees LINK rallying close to $26.










But before Chainlink could surge to a level last seen over two years ago, Inmortal sees the altcoin dropping to as low as $15.
“LINK: $15-$17 is a good range to add to spot bags. Quite simple.”
Source: Inmortal/X
At time of writing, Chainlink is trading for $18.30.
Next up, the trader is also bullish on the gaming-focused crypto project Beam (BEAM). Inmortal shares a chart suggesting that BEAM may dip below $0.025 before launching an over 100% surge.
“BEAM: holding a bag from $0.018. $0.027 would be a dream spot to add more.” 
Source: Inmortal/X
At time of writing, BEAM is worth $0.032.
The crypto strategist is also keeping a close watch on Dogecoin (DOGE) rival Floki (FLOKI). The trader shares a chart showing how FLOKI is massively outperforming DOGE this cycle.
“FLOKI vs. DOGE.
The chart speaks for itself.” 
Source: Inmortal/X
The trader previously predicted that Floki would mirror Dogecoin’s price action during the last bull market and rally to a new all-time high of $0.0018, a rise of about 680% from current levels.
“FLOKI is about to do what DOGE did in 2021.
It’s memecoin season and Floki will be the best performer, in my opinion.” 
Source: Inmortal/X
At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.00023.

                        The South Korean exchange Bithumb is looking to step up its IPO plans – and could look to launch a fast-tracked initial public offering as the crypto bull market continues.Per Hanguk Kyungjae, Bithumb is looking to “accelerate” its proposed KOSPI listing.Bithumb IPO: Exchange Takes Decisive Steps
The media outlet reported that Bithumb announced that the exchange will spin off its holdings operations into a separate company. It is tentatively naming this firm Bithumb Investment.The firm published a regulatory filing document on March 22 detailing its plans.The new firm will take control of Bithumb’s holdings, investments, and real estate operations.Meanwhile, the entity currently known as Bithumb Korea will focus on operating the crypto trading platform.The company plans to divide shares in Bithumb using a 6:4 ratio. It will put the plan before a meeting of shareholders on May 10.If the shareholders approve, Bithumb Investment will officially launch on June 13, the media outlet reported.Shareholders will reportedly be told they will “receive new shares in the new corporation in proportion to their existing shares.”The firm made no mention of ongoing court cases, including a probe into alleged market manipulation supposedly conducted by the mysterious “real” owner of Bithumb.Instead, it appears the firm wants to distance itself from such matters. It seems to want the IPO’s success or otherwise to stem from its core exchange business.Could Bithumb Bring Forward its Listing Plans?
Bithumb-related business has boomed in recent months. The firm was, until recently, offering commission-free trading in a bid to claw back market share from its biggest rival Upbit.A retail Bitcoin (BTC) trading renaissance has also seen trading volumes rise in South Korea. The nation is famously crypto-keen. But it has a tiny pool of platforms that have fiat-crypto trading licenses.Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko)The exchange hopes that the spinoff will “further increase the possibility of IPO launch” by creating an entity that is “centered on the exchange business,” the media outlet noted. It added:“New businesses outside core exchange operations will be pursued with speed through new corporations – without being restricted by the Bithumb IPO bid.”A Bithumb spokesperson said the move would “promote efficiency.” The official added that it would also “boost the growth” of “exchange operations” with “separate ownership” models.Bithumb has previously said it is eyeing a 2025 KOSPI debut. The new move could potentially see the exchange fast-track its listing.Regardless of the timing, however, the exchange is likely to win its bid to become the first South Korean trading platform to go public.Upbit’s operator Dunamu is considered “too large” to debut on the KOSPI. Talk of a Coinbase-inspired NYSE Dunamu listing went cold during the 2022 bear market.Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko)However, another Upbit-related firm is also looking to launch its own IPO bid, namely the neobank K Bank.K Bank provides fiat on/off ramp-style banking services to Upbit customers. The partnership has seen K the Bank user base grow exponentially over the past few years, and could also see the bank launch on the KOSPI in the near future.

Base Memecoin Bots Drive Gas Fees to Pre-Dencun Levels - DailyCoin


        
Gas fees on the Base have reached pre-Dencun levels. 



A handful of traders are behind the sudden surge. 



Memecoins appear to be the main culprit behind the high prices. 
Ethereum marked history this month, rolling out its highly anticipated Dencun upgrade to the mainnet, much to users’ excitement. The upgrade was set to mark a major step in the network’s scaling vision, promising to immediately scale up Layer-2s such as Base and usher in a new era of use cases. Initially, the upgrade held up to its promise, significantly decreasing gas on Base by 99% and propelling daily transactions on the network fivefold. However, before the L2 could benefit from the exceptionally low fees and subsequent network activity, gas fees went up.Bots Drive Up Base Gas PricesEthereum’s Dencun upgrade greatly rekindled excitement within the Layer-2 ecosystem and propelled platforms like Base to new heights thanks to the low-fee guarantees. Before Dencun, Base hosted about 440,000 transactions every day. However, this number increased to two million following the upgrade. With growth on the network showing no signs of slowing down, the network was poised for more. However, things quickly took a turn as gas fees surged 2000% on March 20, peaking at an average of $2 in the face of network congestion. While fees quickly dropped back to their normal $0.2 threshold amid calmer activity levels, they picked up pace again on the weekend, hitting $1.9—an 1100% increase.Average transaction fees on Layer 2 networks. Source: Dune. Interestingly, while Base’s fees endured a rollercoaster of fees, gas on other layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and ZKsync remained relatively consistent, staying below $0.001. Data sleuth Michael Silberling quickly noticed the discrepancy, linking it to three anonymous contracts engaged in high-frequency memecoin trading. Silberling notes that much of the rush on Base stemmed from automated actors targeting memecoins and likely arbitrage and setting higher than usual gas fes for priority. According to the expert, the influx of trading bots on the network translated into higher demand and prices for meme coins on Base, leading to high gas fees.On The Flipside
Memecoins have garnered much hype recently, surging as high as 100%. 



Despite the promise of blobs, some experts have cautioned that Layer 2 fees may rise again as more chains jump in and the blobs fee market becomes more saturated.
Why This MattersThe surge in Base’s gas fees highlights how larger wallets can manipulate prices on the network by artificially boosting demand with the help of trading bots. Despite the Dencun upgrade’s goal of scaling up Layer-2s by reducing fees, Base’s case demonstrates how bots can quickly undermine its impact.Read why Ripple Devs are asking users to stop using XRPL’s new AMMs: Ripple Devs Caution Against Using XRPL’s Newly Released AMM Bitcoin ETFs wrap up its trading week in net outflow:Bitcoin ETFs End Week in Net Outflows Amid BTC Pullback

Dogecoin up 5% in 24 hours: Thank you, social media? - AMBCrypto



DOGE’s price has risen by over 5% in the past 24 hours.
This rally may, however, be short-lived, as key indicators hinted at a decline.

Dogecoin’s [DOGE] price rose by over 5% in the past 24 hours due to a hike in its social activity within that period, data from crypto analytics platform LunarCrush revealed.
According to the data provider, individual interactions involving the meme coin, including socially driven engagements and actions such as likes, comments, retweets, and upvotes, totaled 30 million in the past 24 hours.
AMBCrypto found that out of the top 50 meme coins by market capitalization, DOGE witnessed the highest social volume during the period under review. 
Source: Santiment
Trouble lies ahead?
An assessment of DOGE’s price performance on a 24-hour chart revealed that it may shed some of its gains in the coming days.
Firstly, the coin’s Aroon Up Line (orange) returned a value of 28.57% at the time of press. An asset’s Aroon indicator tracks its trend strength and potential trend reversal points in its price movements. 
When the Aroon Up line is close to zero, the uptrend is weak, and a trend reversal is likely.
Also, DOGE’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) returned a negative value of -0.04. This indicator measures the flow of money into or out of an asset over a specified period.
 When it is negative, as in this case, it indicates liquidity outflow from an asset and a rise in selling pressure.  
A negative CMF value is a sign of market weakness and is often interpreted as a signal to take short positions. 
Further, a look at DOGE’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed that the bearish sentiment was significant in the meme coin’s market. 
Readings from this indicator revealed the MACD line crossed below the signal line on the 15th of March, marking the beginning of a bear cycle in the short term.
Confirming the bearish pressure on DOGE’s price, the dotted lines that make up its Parabolic SAR indicator rested above its price.

This indicator identifies potential trend direction and reversals. When its dotted lines rest above an asset’s price, it is viewed as a sign that selling activity is high. 
Traders take it as a signal to exit long positions or initiate short positions.

Prices and news of the crypto PEPE, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA)

How are the Pepe (PEPE), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) coins performing within the crypto market? Let’s see below an overview regarding their prices and the latest news about them. 

Crypto volatility: a case study on Pepe Coin
Despite the wide variety of meme coins in circulation, with some emerging on platforms like Solana, pioneers like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) continue to dominate the market. 
These tokens are not only known for their ‘humorous origins’, but also for their increasing utility and the ever-growing community that supports them.
Pepe (PEPE), in particular, offers an intriguing case study. After a rapid increase of 700% in just four weeks, the price of PEPE against the US dollar encountered significant resistance between $0.0000087 and $0.0000117. 
This resistance could be the prelude to a medium-term correction, highlighted by the formation of a double top pattern and descending divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI).
Currently, the price of PEPE is around $0.00000726, with a -2.42% change in the last 24 hours. Despite this drop, the current level is important as it surpasses significant past resistances. 
The fluctuation between the high and low of the last 24 hours suggests an ambivalent market.
With the RSI at 48.34, PEPE is in a neutral zone, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a promising buy signal with a rising green histogram.
Although PEPE has shown potential for significant gains, investors must be cautious given the intrinsic fluctuations. Furthermore, the upcoming Bitcoin halving could catalyze further growth, but the market response remains uncertain.
Solana’s economic security challenges Ethereum
While the total value locked in the Solana (SOL) staking system reaches 70 billion dollars, cryptocurrency enthusiasts wonder about the economic reliability of Solana compared to its main competitor, Ethereum (ETH).
According to Jun Soo Kim from Apybara, a staking platform. However, some supporters of Ethereum (ETH) question these evaluations, highlighting the potential risks in SOL staking.
Most of the locked SOL coins are controlled by the Solana Foundation or affiliated venture capital companies, while the daily inflation of 20 million dollars affects the overall supply of SOL. 
This raises doubts about the actual economic security offered by SOL staking, especially for average investors.
According to Staking Rewards, Ethereum and Solana remain the top cryptocurrencies in terms of value locked in staking. 
However, Solana sees a significantly higher percentage of its supply locked up compared to Ethereum, suggesting a different level of investor involvement.
The founder of Solana, Anatoly Yakovenko, addressed criticisms about the economic security of SOL, also highlighting the centralization in Ethereum’s staking system. 
However, he emphasized the importance of controlling one’s private keys as the foundation of true economic security.
In conclusion, as the comparison between Ethereum and Solana in the staking world continues, the complexity and importance of economic security in blockchain networks emerge.
The price of the crypto Cardano compared to Pepe and Solana
The value of Cardano (ADA) is currently in a consolidation phase, with a slight price correction highlighted by a chart mostly in red for the entire week. 
Despite the 13% decrease in the price of Cardano, investors maintain an optimistic attitude towards its potential to reach $2 by 2024. 
Currently, the price of Cardano (ADA) is around $0.6274, with a slight decrease of 0.65% in the last day. 
Even though it has been a tough week for the Cardano token, with a 13.57% decrease in its value, the monthly and yearly performances show an increase of 8% and 68% respectively. 
With a market capitalization of $22.37 billion, ADA ranks among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, occupying the ninth position according to CoinMarketCap. 
However, the total market value has experienced a slight decrease of 9%, along with a 24% drop in trading volume, which recorded $5.77 million.
The recent price movements of Cardano indicate a period of consolidation or a slight correction. Investors seem to be adopting a cautious strategy, leading to a lower number of trades and a modest price decrease.
Some analysts claim that Cardano is currently in a strong position, approaching a key support level at $0.54 after a descent from the peak of $0.69. 
This level is considered crucial, as in the past it has marked a trend reversal. If ADA were to maintain this support and start rising, it could aim to surpass the immediate resistance at $0.60 and reach even higher levels, such as $0.67.

European Parliament approves ban on anonymous crypto transactions - Crypto Briefing




A majority of the European Parliament’s lead committees have approved a ban on anonymous cryptocurrency transactions made through hosted crypto wallets, as part of the European Union’s expanded Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing laws.The new AML legislation, approved on March 19, applies limits for cash transactions and anonymous cryptocurrency payments. Under the new rules, anonymous cash payments over €3,000 will be banned in commercial transactions, and cash payments over €10,000 will be completely banned in business transactions. The European Parliament’s ban on anonymous crypto transactions applies specifically to hosted or custodial crypto wallets offered by third-party service providers, such as centralized exchanges.MEP Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party of Germany), one of only two members who voted against the ban, argues that the legislation compromises economic independence and financial privacy. Breyer claims that the ability to transact anonymously is a fundamental right and believes that the ban would have minimal effects on crime but would, in effect, deprive innocent citizens of their financial freedom.
“With the gradual abolition of cash, negative interest rates and the twisting of money supply at any time threaten card blocking. The dependency on banks is increasing menacingly. Such financial incapacitation must be stopped,” Breyer said (translated by Google from German) in a press release defending his position.
Breyer also expressed concerns about the potential consequences of the EU’s “war on cash,” including negative interest rates and the risk of banks cutting off the money supply. He emphasized the need to bring the best attributes of cash into the digital future and protect the right to pay and donate online without personal transactions being recorded.The crypto community has had a mixed response to the EU’s regulatory measures. Some believe the new AML laws are necessary, while others fear they may infringe on privacy and restrict economic activity.Daniel “Loddi” Tröster, host of the Sound Money Bitcoin Podcast, claims that the practical hurdles and consequences of the recent legislation is of this opinion, citing its impact on donations and the broader implications for cryptocurrency use within the EU.
“Anyone who would like to donate anonymously can no longer do so with the new regulations. In practice it cannot be prevented, but if the donation recipient operates a hosted wallet, the crypto custodian (which is regulated in the EU) could face restrictions from politicians,” Tröster said (translated by X).
Opponents of the ban argue that unlike cash, which is entirely anonymous, cryptocurrency transactions can be traced on the blockchain, and law enforcement has successfully prosecuted criminals by detecting unusual patterns and identifying suspects. They also point out that Virtual Assets are of minor relevance to the global financial system, and there is insufficient evidence on the volume and frequency of their usage for money laundering.The legislation is expected to become fully operational within three years from its entry into force.

FTX, BlockFi Claimants Scammed For Millions Via Fake Emails - DailyCoin


        
Scammers are targetting FTX and BlockFi claimants with fraudulent emails. 



The emails appear very convincing. 



Scammers have managed to net millions in the past week. 
FTX and BlockFi creditors are still left waiting for their reimbursement as we enter the second since their subsequent debacles. The sluggish and painstaking process appears to be testing their patience, creating an opening for scammers to prey on their frustrations. Recently, fraudulent schemes posing as FTX and BlockFI have multiplied, luring unaware users with the promise of instant withdrawals and netting millions of dollars from unsuspecting users. Scammers Lure FTX and BlockFi UsersBlockchain sleuth Plumferno raised the alarm on X regarding a sophisticated email phishing operation targeting victims of the defunct crypto firms FTX and BlockFi. According to Plumferno, scammers have managed to siphon off funds exceeding $7 million in just the past week.Plumferno reported that hackers allegedly exploited the compromised email list from Mailer Lite’s data breach in January, setting the stage for this grand scheme. The blockchain investigator first took notice of the scam following an influx of nearly $4.5 million in ether landing in the scammer’s wallet in the past week. In addition to pilfering crypto, scammers also made off with blue-chip NFTs, including Mutant Apes, Otherdeed, and more. The bad actors particularly targeted dormant wallets belonging to FTX and BlockFi claimants.User reports reveal that scammers sent them very convincing fake emails promising ‘significant progress in their restructuring efforts.’ According to a screenshot of the scam emails, claimants were instructed to process their wallets by connecting them and signing an authorization transaction. How Should FTX and BlockFi Users Stay Safe?Considering the sophistication of the scammer’s email, it’s evident malicious actors have refined their methods. While identifying scam emails involves looking for telltale signs like inconsistent grammar, requests for private keys, and prompts to click suspicious links, these emails lacked such issues, which is why FTX and BlockFi users must exercise extra caution.Screenshot of scammer’s email. Source: Twitter.It’s very important to perform your due diligence.  Although some fraudulent emails could seem convincing, any updates regarding the defunct crypto firms can be easily verified through their official communication channels or reputable news sources.Additionally, it’s important to note that FTX’s restructuring plan has yet to receive approval, with reimbursements likely to start by the end of Q2 2024. Interestingly, users will be paid in cash and not cryptocurrency based on November 2022 rates, per the latest court documents and details. Besides that, here are a few tips to protect yourself:
Double-check links, websites, and emails. Avoid clicking any link unless it’s from a verified source.



Promptly report any suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities or departments.



Seek assistance from official channels and prioritize your safety and security.



Verify and scrutinize all addresses, including contracts, senders, and others, before taking any permanent actions.

Base TVL doubles in a month as pundits tip memecoins to drive adoption

Ethereum layer-2 network Base’s total value locked (TVL) has doubled in less than a month, reaching $2.13 billion, while commentators say it could become the next epicenter for memecoins.Base notched $1 billion in TVL on Feb. 27, 226 days after its launch in August. However, the network managed to breach the $2 billion market just 25 days later on March 23, according to data from L2 Beat.Change in total value locked on the Base chain over the last 30 days. Source: L2 BeatUSD Coin (USDC) is the largest token by natively minted value at $600 million, while Ether (ETH) is the largest token by canonically bridged value at $798 million.Some industry pundits believe that memecoins could drive the next wave of adoption on Base and potentially take some of the memecoin market share away from Solana“Solana had a crazy #memecoin season [and] thousands of millionaires were made overnight,” said X user Dami-Defi to its 62,100 followers on March 24.“But now attention is shifting to another chain - #BASE,” Dami-Defi added.


Degen (DEGEN) and Base God (TYBG) are among the largest Base memecoins, boasting market caps of $143.4 million and $65.9 million, according to CoinGecko — though these are still far below other more recently popular memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).The Solana memecoin craze has been headlined by Dogwifhat (WIF), which has attained a market cap of $2.7 billion since it launched in early December, according to CoinGecko.Meanwhile, Book of Memes (BOME) and Slerf (SLERF) have already amassed market caps of $2.7 billion since launching on Solana earlier this month.Normie (NORMIE), Briun Armstrung (BRIUN) and Brett (BRETT) are among the other Base memecoins that are being speculated on by traders.Related: Memecoin trader nets $8.9M profit in an hour, raising ‘insider’ allegationsOther pundits, such as Andrew Forte, director of business development at blockchain solutions firm Dappd, are bullish on Base because its creator firm Coinbase is building a native smart contract wallet that will allow its 100 million registered users to trade on Base without needing to remember seed phrases or private keys.“There are going to be several billion dollar memecoins on base that will get an easy listing on Coinbase and goto all the normies,” said X user Wizard of SoHo to his 97,000 followers.“Fading Base SZN” is a “bad” idea, they added.Base recently notched a record 2 million transactions in a day on March 16 following the Dencun upgrade on Ethereum.

Top Analyst Reviews Bonk (BONK) Rival Cryptocurrency Bonk For Higher Returns | Cryptopolitan

In the ever-competitive realm of meme cryptocurrencies, where the whims of the market can elevate a digital asset to stardom or plunge it into obscurity, Shiba Budz (BUDZ) emerges as a formidable contender to Bonk (BONK). This new entrant is not just challenging the status quo but is reshaping the landscape of investment opportunities within the meme coin ecosystem. A top analyst has recently turned the spotlight onto Shiba Budz (BUDZ), providing an in-depth review that pits it against the established Bonk (BONK) and concluding that it may offer higher returns for those looking to diversify their portfolios.The Bonk (BONK) PhenomenonBonk (BONK) has been a favorite among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, known for its rapid ascents and equally swift descents in the volatile market.

However, like many meme coins, Bonk (BONK) has faced challenges in sustaining momentum, with investors constantly on the lookout for the next big opportunity.Enter Shiba Budz (BUDZ)Shiba Budz (BUDZ) enters the scene as a vibrant and promising alternative to Bonk (BONK), equipped with a strategy that appears to transcend the typical meme coin blueprint.

Tron’s Bitcoin layer-2 plan could see ’wrapped’ USDT flow into Bitcoin

Layer-1 blockchain Tron is considering a Bitcoin layer-2 solution that would support a “wrapped” version of Tether (USDT), potentially allowing billions of dollars of liquidity to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem.In February, Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, announced a roadmap for Tron’s Bitcoin layer-2 solution in an X post, which would allow stablecoins and tokens to move between Tron and Bitcoin.“This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin,” said Sun at the time. Speaking to Cointelegraph, a Tron spokesperson said the plans would “likely” involve creating a wrapped version of USDT. The Tron network is currently home to more than half of USDT’s $104 billion issued across multiple blockchains. “As the home of leading stablecoins like USDT, we bring significant liquidity and stability to the table,” Tron told Cointelegraph on Feb. 22.The integration would likely attract new users to the Bitcoin ecosystem and expand the network’s use cases, particularly in decentralized finance, they added.Sun said a Bitcoin layer-2 solution would allow Tron-based tokens to interact and interoperate with Bitcoin “seamlessly.”“[It will aim to] maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!”Source: Justin SunThe Tron spokesperson said the plan is only in its concept phase but will “likely” go ahead.For the time being, the firm will leverage existing cross-chain protocols to bridge USDT and other tokens between Bitcoin and Tron. Part of Tron’s plan also involves collaborating with several Bitcoin layer-2 protocols.TrSource: Tron DAOA rival stablecoin to Tether, USD Coin (USDC) could be a different story as Circle, its issuer, ceased minting USDC on Tron in February.The Tron spokesperson said a recent surge in community interest to expand Bitcoin’s functionality and scalability was one of the main reasons why it considered building a layer-2 solution.Developing decentralized applications on Bitcoin could potentially improve Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dynamics, too, as fees would be denominated in BTC, they added. Related: Y Combinator calls on startups to build stablecoin, metaverse, AI solutionsMeanwhile, Tron’s decentralized autonomous organization, Tron DAO, is also looking to build a user-friendly wallet and toolset to support Bitcoin-based Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares predicted in January that a Bitcoin-based stablecoin may emerge in 2024 that could rival the speed and cost of other stablecoins in the industry.Liquid-based Tether (L-USDT) is one of the few United States dollar-denominated stablecoins currently circulating on a Bitcoin layer-2 network.Magazine: Bitcoin ETFs make Coinbase a ‘honeypot’ for hackers and governments: Trezor CEO

XRP and Dogecoin Can Hit $1 by End of 2024, NFTFN Can Do the Same in 3 Months | Cryptopolitan

The prolonged crypto winter of 2022-2023 sent shivers down the spines of investors. However, recent months have witnessed a heartening uptick across the board. 2024 has ushered in a wave of bullish sentiment, revitalizing the spirits of crypto enthusiasts. Fueled by optimism, new and seasoned investors are flocking back to the dynamic world of crypto.Three tokens in particular have captured attention with their ambitious price targets: XRP, Dogecoin, and NFTFN. XRP and Dogecoin, established players, aim to reach $1 by the end of 2024, while the newcomer NFTFN hopes to achieve the same feat within a mere three months. Let’s delve into the factors that could potentially fuel these climbs and explore the inherent risks involved.XRPRipple‘s XRP, a token designed for facilitating international payments, has long held promise. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC casts a shadow, but recent developments suggest a potential resolution. A favorable outcome could spark a surge in investor confidence, propelling XRP towards the coveted $1 mark.Potential SEC Settlement: A full and final settlement with the SEC would remove a significant cloud hanging over XRP. This could attract institutional investors who might have previously stayed on the sidelines due to regulatory uncertainty.Growing Adoption: Ripple continues to forge partnerships with financial institutions for cross-border transactions. Increased real-world use cases could significantly bolster XRP’s value.>> Be Among the FIRST! Get the Exclusive Perks From NFTFN Presale <<DogecoinDogecoin, the internet’s favorite meme coin, continues to defy expectations. While initially conceived as a joke, it has developed a loyal following and a surprisingly robust market cap. The following factors may push DOGE’s price towards $1 this year:Community Power: Dogecoin boasts a passionate and highly engaged community. This dedicated base can create significant buying pressure, driving the price upwards.The “Dogecoin Effect”: Social media hype and celebrity endorsements can have a surprisingly strong influence on Dogecoin’s price. A well-timed tweet or a positive mention by a prominent figure could trigger a buying frenzy.NFTFNNFTFN, a pioneer in the web3 fintech sector, has disrupted the NFT trading space with its innovative approach. Backed by the likes of Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal and boasting partnerships with industry titans like Google Cloud and Binance Smart Chain, NFTFN appears well positioned to reach a valuation of $1 in the next quarter. Some of the factors that makes NFTFN appealing to retail traders and small-scale investors are:Democratizing NFTs: NFTFN aims to make blue-chip NFTs more accessible through innovative financial instruments like NFT Perpetuals, allowing investors with lower capital to participate.Bridging the Gap: They aim to simplify the NFT market for newcomers by offering user-friendly tools and educational resources.Riding the NFT Wave: The NFT market is experiencing explosive growth.

Macro Outlook: Will This Week's Core PCE Data Move Crypto Markets?


																Crypto markets rebounded over the weekend following the Fed’s rate decision on March 20, but this week also has a lot of key economic data.
The week will be shorter, with TradFi markets closed for a holiday on March 29 for Good Friday. However, investors are awaiting Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech to get more clues on the central bank’s policy outlook.


Economic Calendar
The first main report that could impact markets is the fourth quarter 2023 US GDP data due to be released on Thursday, March 28. This third and final reading is expected to confirm that economic growth was an annualized 3.2%.
Consumer Sentiment Index and Consumer Inflation Expectation reports are also due on Thursday. They are used to gauge consumer sentiment, confidence levels, and views of long-term inflation.




The annual inflation rate for the United States was 3.2% for the 12 months ending February, which is still higher than the Fed’s target.
Friday will see the release of February’s Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which reflects the average amount of money consumers spend monthly, excluding seasonally volatile products such as food and energy.
This index is used by central bank policymakers as their primary inflation gauge. Higher-than-expected CPI and PCI numbers a few weeks back created a lot of market volatility as inflation remains stubbornly high.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also speak on Friday on “Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy,” potentially offering insight into the economic outlook for the coming months. The current probability that the FOMC will keep interest rates unchanged in May is 89.1%, according to CME data.
Global Macro Investor CEO Raoul Pal stated that “macro summer” has arrived, which means a boom in risk-on assets such as tech stocks and crypto as liquidity improves.
Crypto Market Outlook
Crypto markets had a volatile week last week but appear to have stabilized over the weekend. Total capitalization gained 2.5% over the past 24 hours to reach $2.67 trillion during Monday morning trading in Asia.
Markets have declined 7.5% from their multi-year peak earlier this month as Bitcoin ETF fervor abates.
BTC was changing hands for $67,000 following a 4% gain on the day as it recovered. The asset is currently 10% down from its March 14 all-time high.
ETH prices have also increased by 4%, reaching $3,470 this Monday morning in Asia. Most of the altcoins were seeing smaller gains aside from Solana (SOL), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Internet Computer (ICP).

                        Decentralized finance aggregator ParaSwap has addressed a critical vulnerability in its recently launched Augustus v6 smart contract and has commenced the process of returning cryptocurrency assets to affected users. In a recent post on X, the team said that all assets have been returned to wallets that were successfully recovered by white hat hackers. Additionally, permissions to the Augustus v6 contract have been revoked to prevent further exploitation.213 Addresses Yet to Receive Funds
While the majority of users have had their assets returned, ParaSwap has identified 213 addresses that have yet to revoke allowances to the flawed contract. Revoking allowances involves disabling or terminating the contract’s functionality on the blockchain, ensuring it no longer has access to users’ wallets and tokens.If your wallet “have not received them yet, your wallet is still vulnerable, PLEASE REVOKE ALL RELEVANT PERMISSIONS!” they wrote. The vulnerability in the newly launched smart contract was discovered by ParaSwap last week. Thanks to the timely intervention of white hat hackers, a significant loss of assets was prevented. The platform promptly took action by submitting a comprehensive report to the appropriate authorities, initiating an investigation into the stolen funds.ParaSwap is working closely with blockchain analytics and security firms, Chainalysis and TRM Labs, in an effort to identify the hacker addresses and trace the movement of the funds. The team has also reached out to the identified hacker addresses through on-chain messaging, urging the return of the stolen user funds.If the hacker fails to respond by March 27, ParaSwap will assume that the funds have been unlawfully appropriated, and they will pursue all available legal avenues to recover them.Initially, the losses incurred were relatively small, with preliminary findings indicating that the hackers managed to abscond with only $24,000 before the vulnerability was discovered.The vulnerability was detected in ParaSwap’s Augustus v6 smart contract on March 20, just days after its launch on March 18. The contract aimed to enhance token swaps and reduce transfer fees. Upon discovering the vulnerability, ParaSwap promptly paused the application programming interface (API) and secured the funds through the assistance of white hat hackers.Hacks Continue to Haunt Crypto Industry
Hacks and exploits have become a mounting concern in the crypto industry, particularly within the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. According to a report by Immunefi, a total of $1.8 billion was lost to crypto hacks and scams in 2023, with 17% of the losses attributed to the North Korean Lazarus Group. In individual incidents, hacking accounted for over $65 million (97.54%) of the stolen funds in February 2024.As reported, bad actors have stolen $38.9 million from various Web3 projects in the first month of 2024.One of the first major crypto hacks of the year occurred when Radiant Capital experienced a $4.5 million loss due to an empty market exploit.Gamma Strategies, another affected platform, fell victim to a flash loan attack on January 4, shortly after the Radiant Capital incident.

                        Goldman Sachs’ hedge fund clients are reportedly showing increased interest in crypto derivatives, spurred by the resurgence of the crypto market.The bank officially launched its crypto trading desk in 2021. It then began to facilitate various Bitcoin-linked trades, including Bitcoin non-deliverable futures and CME BTC futures, following years of contemplation dating back to 2017.Currently, Goldman offers cash-settled Bitcoin and Ether option trading, alongside CME-listed Bitcoin and Ether futures. However, it does not directly trade the actual underlying crypto tokens themselves.Max Minton, Goldman’s Asia Pacific head of digital assets, told Bloomberg in a recent interview that the recent approval of ETFs has reignited interest and activity among the bank’s clients. Minton noted that many clients are either currently active in the crypto space or are considering entering it.Goldman Sachs Clients Embrace Crypto Derivatives for Diverse Purposes
According to Minton, there has been a noticeable increase in client interest, onboarding, pipeline, and trading volume since the beginning of the year.A majority of this demand stems from Goldman’s existing clients, particularly traditional hedge funds. However, the bank is also broadening its client base to include asset managers, banking clients, and specific digital asset firms.He mentioned that clients are using crypto derivatives for various purposes, such as directional bets, yield enhancement, and hedging.Bitcoin ETF Launch Sparks Market Optimism
The development follows Bitcoin’s recent surge to a record high above $72,000, triggered by the Bitcoin ETF launch and anticipation around the upcoming halving event.Despite Bitcoin retracing to around $67,075 as of Monday, the outlook for crypto derivatives remains bullish. A quarterly report from Genesis Trading last year predicted substantial expansion in this sector, driven by a significant decrease in spot market liquidity and a growing trend towards the use of derivative instruments.Currently, most Goldman clients appear to be primarily focused on Bitcoin-related products. However, there is potential for a shift in interest towards Ether-related products if Ether ETFs receive approval in the US.Mathew McDermott, Goldman’s head of digital assets, expressed optimism about the approval of Ether ETFs back in January.The SEC is expected to make its initial ruling on a spot Ethereum ETF by May 23.

Bitcoin (BTC) in a Position To Witness Bullish Momentum Reversal, According to Analyst - Here’s His Forecast - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed analyst says he sees Bitcoin (BTC) ending its current correction and witnessing another leg up soon.
In a new video update, crypto strategist Kevin Svenson tells his 74,100 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may undergo a momentum shift after printing a bullish technical pattern on the low time frame.










“Bitcoin is in a position to potentially, on the four-hour chart, put in a higher low [at $64,800], which would be an inverse head and shoulders, which would be an indication of a momentum reversal, an increase in demand, a trend reversal in the short term.”
Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube
Traders sometimes watch for an inverse head and shoulders pattern as it often suggests that a bullish reversal is in sight.
With BTC successfully retesting the diagonal resistance as support, Svenson is now predicting a rally above $76,000. He also notes that the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), a momentum indicator, is flashing a bullish signal.
“Bitcoin bullish daily close. We closed above the resistance trend.
MACD histograms starting to show positive momentum returning.” 
Source: Kevin Svenson/X
Svenson previously said that Bitcoin is in the midst of a parabolic rally that could propel BTC to as high as $90,000. He also said that Bitcoin will likely witness a big surge in volatility once BTC reaches his price target.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $67,143, up 4.46% in the past day.

Bitcoin Charts Show Chances of a Bullish Breakout


							

Bitcoin reserves on exchanges are dropping while prices gradually move higher.



The shorts also appear to have capitulated, said analyst @martypartymusic.



There is a possibility of Bitcoin “going to the moon” from here, said the analyst.




The price of Bitcoin appears to be nearing a bullish breakout, according to a prominent crypto analyst on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Notably, the leading digital asset has been unable to reclaim its $70,000 price level since making a new all-time high of $73,000 earlier in March. 



In the X post, analyst @martypartymusic pointed out that the Bitcoin “shorts appear to have capitulated” and there is a possibility of prices “going to the moon.” 



The data shared by the analyst suggests that traders who had been betting on the price of Bitcoin to decrease (shorting it) have closed their positions en masse. There is a possibility of a short-term increase in the price of Bitcoin as these shorts cover their positions by buying back Bitcoin, adding to the buying pressure in the market.



Another chart posted by the analyst showed the correlation between Bitcoin reserves on exchanges and the Bitcoin price. The data from the 2020 halving event depicts that the amount of Bitcoin on exchanges sees a gradual dip as the leading digital asset’s price trajectory gains upward momentum around the halving event. 



A similar trend is currently being witnessed ahead of the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, as the Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have witnessed a gradual dip and the prices are gradually reaching new highs. 



As reported earlier by Coin Edition, on March 12, analyst CryptosRUs hinted at Bitcoin’s bullish rally to $140,000 in just 18 days. While the scenario has yet to play out, the analyst also stated last week that the proposed interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve will result in an imminent Bitcoin supply squeeze.

RippleX Identifies a Technical Glitch: Users in Dilemma


							

RippleX reveals a technical issue that affects the Automated Market Maker (AMM) pool on the XRPL.



David Schwartz comments that the issue is not caused by the single-sided deposit feature.



The team urges users to stop depositing new funds to the AMM pool and redeem LP tokens.




Ripple’s development division, RippleX, has recently disclosed a technical glitch that affects the Automated Market Maker (AMM) pool on the XRP Ledger. Providing more clarity to the matter, Ripple CTO David Schwartz shared an X post, asserting that the technical issue was not caused by the single-sided deposit feature.







Schwartz’s post came in response to RippleX’s official message revealing a “discrepancy” that led to the disruption of transactions and liquidity pools on XRP Ledger. RippleX cited, “The discrepancy affected how the DEX payment engine routes liquidity through AMM pools and order books in some complex payment path scenarios.”







On March 22, the Ripple team announced the successful integration of AMM on XRPL. Schwartz also joined the celebration by acknowledging the team’s two-year-long efforts to bring  “AMM live on XRPL.”



Notably, AMM pools are the liquidity pools used in decentralized exchanges (DEXs). They focus on facilitating trading without traditional order books.



In his recent X post, Schwartz elaborated on the single-sided deposit feature of AMM. According to his post,




“Single-sided deposits allow for a more streamlined user experience, but can lead to price impacts when pools have less liquidity. It’s best for users to review the price impact in their tooling before submitting a transaction and front-end apps should display this information to users.” 




Further, RippleX cautioned its users to stop depositing new funds to the AMM pools. In addition, the team also requested that the users holding LP tokens redeem them. Moreover, the platform assured its community that the issue would soon be fixed as the “engineering team is working to resolve the issue alongside community participants.”

                        Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel warned that smaller miners will face financial strain following the Bitcoin halving event in April.In a CNBC interview published Friday, Thiel highlighted the disparity in access to capital and equipment financing between smaller and larger miners in the current mining market cycle.He noted that while larger miners have had the opportunity to raise capital, smaller miners have faced challenges in scaling due to limited access to financing options.“Post halving I think you’ll see the smaller miners come under financial stress, which will enable the bigger miners to consolidate the industry,” he said.Marathon Digital’s Expansion Strategy in Anticipation of Bitcoin Halving Stress
He added that Marathon has prioritized addressing this issue and recently finalized two acquisitions, with intentions to continue acquiring assets in the future.“We have quite a heavy balance sheet. We’re ready to go as opportunities arise. But you have to be very prudent, you have to do these things at the right prices,” he said.Marathon recently announced its acquisition of a Texas Bitcoin mining facility from Applied Digital for about $87m in cash. This facility, situated adjacent to a wind farm, boasts a capacity of 200 megawatts (MW).In January, the company finalized the acquisition of two mining facilities located in Texas and Nebraska. This transaction, totaling around $179m, secured 390 MW of mining capacity and involved the termination of competitor Hut 8’s management of the facilities.Marathon’s acquisitions align with its goal of expanding its operations before the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected around April 20. This event, which occurs every four years, will halve block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Consequently, smaller companies in the sector are expected to face challenges like capital access and high energy expenses.Marathon Achieves Record Revenue in 2023
In 2023, the company experienced a surge in revenue, culminating in substantial profitability. Its fourth quarter and annual earnings report unveiled record-breaking revenue of $387.5m for the year, marking a 229% increase compared to the previous year.“2023 was a record-breaking year for Marathon, during which we achieved our primary objectives of energizing our fleet of previously purchased mining rigs and optimizing our performance,” Thiel said.

Profitable Trader and Analyst on YouTube Picks Three Cryptos That Can Turn $500 into $50,000 in the Blink of an Eye | Cryptopolitan

Investors are always on the lookout for the next big opportunity, the diamond in the rough that could turn a modest investment into a windfall. With the rise of social media and platforms like YouTube, a new breed of traders and analysts has emerged, offering insights and recommendations to eager followers. One such individual, known for his uncanny ability to spot lucrative opportunities, has recently made waves by highlighting three cryptocurrencies that he believes have the potential to turn $500 into $50,000 in the blink of an eye. Let’s delve into his picks and explore the potential behind each of them.Retik Finance (RETIK): Bridging the Gap Between Traditional and Digital FinanceRetik Finance (RETIK) is a revolutionary blockchain project that seeks to bridge the gap between the cryptocurrency and traditional fiat worlds. With its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi), Retik Finance aims to provide individuals, enterprises, institutions, and governments with a seamless interface for conducting financial transactions across both realms. One of the standout features of Retik Finance is its introduction of the Retik DeFi Debit Cards, which seamlessly merge the benefits of traditional debit cards with the power of decentralized finance. These debit cards empower users to spend their cryptocurrency holdings in real-world transactions, offering a tangible bridge between the digital and physical realms of finance. With features such as cash withdrawals from ATMs worldwide, anonymity, and privacy, as well as cashback rewards in $RETIK tokens, the Retik DeFi Debit Cards provide users with unparalleled flexibility and convenience. What’s more, Retik Finance has made headlines by launching its debit cards a year ahead of schedule, showcasing its commitment to innovation and efficiency. As the project gears up for its exchange debut, investors are eagerly awaiting the listing of RETIK tokens and the commencement of the vesting period, which promises to unlock significant value for early adopters.Cosmos (ATOM): Building the Internet of BlockchainsCosmos (ATOM) is a blockchain project that aims to solve the scalability and interoperability issues plaguing the current generation of blockchains. With its unique approach to building an interconnected network of blockchains, Cosmos has garnered attention for its potential to revolutionize the way we think about blockchain technology. At the heart of the Cosmos ecosystem is the ATOM token, which serves as the native currency of the network. By providing developers with open-source tools to create their interoperable blockchains, Cosmos is laying the groundwork for what it calls the “internet of blockchains” – a decentralized network where different blockchains can seamlessly communicate and transact with one another. One of the key innovations of Cosmos is its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which enables blockchains within the ecosystem to share tokens and data effortlessly. This not only enhances the overall liquidity of the network but also opens up a world of possibilities for developers looking to create unique and interoperable blockchain applications. With a market cap of $5.35 billion and a steady stream of developments, Cosmos is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for scalable and interoperable blockchain solutions.Stellar (XLM): Making Money Move Easily and FastStellar (XLM) is a decentralized, public blockchain that aims to facilitate fast and affordable cross-border transactions. With its focus on peer-to-peer connectivity, Stellar has emerged as a popular choice for individuals and institutions looking to streamline the movement of money across borders. At the core of the Stellar network is the XLM token, which serves as the native currency and facilitates transactions on the platform. Unlike many other blockchain networks, Stellar prides itself on its speed, efficiency, and low transaction fees, making it an attractive option for users looking to transfer value quickly and cost-effectively. In addition to its focus on payments, Stellar has also garnered attention for its commitment to social impact and financial inclusion. Through initiatives such as the Stellar Community Fund and Stellar Aid Assist, the project has demonstrated its dedication to using blockchain technology for positive social change. With a market cap of $4.37 billion and a growing ecosystem of partnerships and integrations, Stellar is poised to play a significant role in shaping the future of finance.ConclusionIn conclusion, the tokens Retik Finance, Cosmos, and Stellar present compelling opportunities for investors seeking significant returns. With their innovative solutions and ambitious visions, these tokens have the potential to transform the financial landscape and generate substantial wealth. As highlighted by the trader and analyst on YouTube, the prospect of turning a $500 investment into $50,000 is not merely theoretical but within reach. By capitalizing on the unique strengths and promising trajectories of these tokens, investors may find themselves on the path to financial success and prosperity in the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency.Visit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):Website: https://retik.comWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdfTwitter: www.twitter.com/retikfinanceTelegram: www.t.me/retikfinance

Goldman Sachs hedge fund clients are piling back into crypto this year

Goldman Sachs’ clients have reportedly started to make the jump back into crypto this year, with appetite renewed by the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds.Max Minton, head of digital assets for Goldman Asia Pacific, said that many of his firm’s largest clients had recently become active or were “exploring getting active” in the crypto sector, according to a March 24 report from Bloomberg. Minton added that much of the increased appetite for cryptocurrency stems from the approval of ten new Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in January, which rubber-stamped the crypto assets as being a more integral part of traditional markets. “The recent ETF approval has triggered a resurgence of interest and activities from our clients.”Minton explained that the bulk of the fresh demand comes primarily from Goldman’s existing clients by way of his firm’s options and futures offerings, with hedge funds being the most involved of its clients. Goldman Sachs reported a record $2.8 trillion in assets under management at the end of 2023.Notably, Goldman currently does not offer any spot crypto products to its clients, despite having launched its first crypto trading desk in 2021. The desk only provides exposure to crypto derivatives, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) options and futures. “It was a quieter year last year, but we’ve seen a pickup in interest from clients in onboarding, pipeline, and volume since the start of the year,” Minton said.Minton said that Goldman’s clients were primarily using their derivatives to gain exposure to the volatility of crypto as well as making weighted predictions on where prices were headed in the mid-term. Related: Crypto markets need ‘disinfectant,’ says SEC chairBitcoin-related products stood as the most popular investment vehicles among active clients, added Minton. Minton also looked to the potential approval of a spot Ether ETF in the U.S. as potentially shifting his firm’s institutional clients toward Ether. However, Bloomberg ETF analysts have pegged the chances of an Ether ETF approval by May at just 35%, with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s prolonged “radio silence” to would-be fund issuers being seen as increasingly bearish. Source: Eric BalchunasRegardless of an ETF approval, Minton added that Goldman would seek to expand into “a wider universe of clients,” including asset management funds, banks, and more specialized crypto asset firms in the future.

Russian Central Bank, Finance Ministry to Settle Crypto Differences

                        The Russian Ministry of Finance says it wants to settle its long-standing crypto policy differences with the nation’s Central Bank.According to the media outlet RBC, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said he was “sure” his ministry and the bank would soon “come to an agreement” on crypto regulation-related matters.Russian Central Bank Eager to Break Crypto Impasse?
Speaking at an event held at a state-run financial university, Siluanov said:“I am sure that [the ministry] and the Central Bank will come to an agreement. This issue has been discussed for several years. We cannot prohibit the circulation of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, we need to regulate this [market]. I am sure that we will find a solution.”The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have been locked in an unproductive crypto policy-related impasse for years.The government agency wants to regulate and tax crypto exchanges and traders, but the bank has previously called for a China-style blanket ban.The ministry tried to break through this impasse in early 2022, when it unveiled a comprehensive draft bill on crypto regulation.The bank shot back with its own rival bill, proposing an almost total ban on all crypto-related activities.Neither bill made it past the committee stage at the State Duma, and the crypto sector has remained in limbo ever since.This led to a downgrading in the nation’s FATF compliance rating last month, and calls from government bodies to fast-track regulation.However, the war in Ukraine and resulting Western sanctions appear to have forced the Russian Central Bank’s hand.The bank has grudgingly conceded to soften its stance on industrial crypto mining, which is now booming in Russia.It has also agreed to make some concessions on the use of crypto as a payment tool in international trade.And it is here that Siluanov sees common ground for legislation. He said there was a “need to work together with the Central Bank on the issue of identifying possible options for using cryptocurrencies for settlements, both within the country and abroad.”The Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, speaking in 2023. (Source: CGTN/YouTube)Russian Crypto Mining Industry Booms – Will Bank Make Concessions?
The minister also claimed that the bank had “agreed to hold a meeting to discuss [crypto] mining.” He said:“We need to talk about what can and cannot be done with cryptocurrency. We have now agreed, with the Central Bank, to discuss the issue of mining. We must talk about whether [mined coins] can be used to make settlements within the country and in international settlements.”However, the bank is unlikely to make such sweeping concessions. The bank’s long-serving Governor Elvira Nabiullina has repeatedly stated that she will not tolerate crypto’s “entry into the Russian economy.”Indeed, Siluanov admitted that both the ministry and the bank were “inclined” to ensure that mined tokens were used “for external payments.”Such talk could resurrect plans to create a state-owned crypto exchange that essentially buys Russian miners’ coins and sells them to firms that pay for overseas goods in crypto.Russian Mining Tax Windfall on the Cards?
Russian crypto miners have said legalizing their industry could provide the state with a $540.3 million windfall in tax revenue.Industry chiefs have claimed they are ready to invest $4 billion in new multi-purpose data centers, which could also save Moscow $32.4 million in tech investment.Miners have become frustrated at Moscow’s refusal to legalize their industry, instead leaving it in a quasi-legal grey zone.Crypto mining is neither legal nor illegal in Russia, a fact that has led to much legal frustration in the nation.They have also hit back at the Ministry of Energy’s controversial plans to hike their electricity tariffs by up to five times.

ParaSwap begins returning crypto after critical smart contract bug

Decentralized finance aggregator ParaSwap has begun returning crypto to users after addressing a critical vulnerability in its newly launched Augustus v6 smart contract last week. The DeFi platform team posted on X on March 24, stating it has returned all assets to wallets that were successfully recovered by white hat hackers and have also revoked permissions to AugustusV6.Source: ParaSwapAccording to ParaSwap, 213 addresses currently still have not yet revoked allowances to the flawed contract. Revoking a smart contract usually involves disabling or terminating its functionality on a blockchain and preventing it from accessing the user’s wallet and tokens.Last week, ParaSwap said it had discovered a vulnerability in a newly launched smart contract but timely intervention by white hat hackers prevented a large loss of assets from the platform.In a separate update, the team stated that it had taken the first step by submitting a comprehensive report to the appropriate authorities, kickstarting the investigation into the stolen funds.ParaSwap is collaborating closely with blockchain analytics and security firms Chainalysis and TRM Labs and is “actively engaged in identifying hacker addresses and tracing the movement of the funds.”The team added that they had initiated contact with the identified hacker addresses through on-chain messaging, urging the return of the stolen user funds.If the hacker does not respond by March 27, “we will assume you appropriated the funds with unlawful intent, and we will pursue all criminal, legal, and administrative avenues,” to recover them, it added.At the time, the losses were reportedly small, with initial findings revealing that the hackers got away with just $24,000 before the vulnerability was discovered. Related: ParaSwap evades hack targeting Augustus v6 contract vulnerabilityParaSwap discovered the vulnerability in its newly launched Augustus v6 smart contract on March 20, only days after the Augustus contract went live on March 18 aiming to improve token swaps and reduce transfer fees. The platform paused the application programming interface (API) after discovery and secured the funds through a white hat hack.Magazine: Bitcoin ETFs make Coinbase a ‘honeypot’ for hackers and governments: Trezor CEO

Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Shared by Elon Musk! - Bitcoin Sistemi


X owner Elon Musk asked today why Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin left X.
Responding to Autism Capital's post, which thinks Vitalik Buterin should return to the X platform, Musk said, “Why did Vitalik Buterin leave X?” asked.


Vitalik Buterin has been active on Farcaster, a cryptocurrency-centered Twitter-like social media platform, for a long time. At this point, Buterin said in February, “Farcaster has gotten to the point where it's pretty useful as a Twitter alternative for a lot of people. I think the channels actually make it *better* in a lot of ways.” he said.
Stating that Ethereum founder Vitalik should return to X, Autism Capital stated that Farcaster cannot win the culture war and said:






“Vitalik needs to go back to X. Farcaster will not win the culture war.
If Butrerin wants Ethereum to shine, it should be more involved with platform X, not isolating itself on an island with select peers.
“If it mobilizes the larger community here on platform X, it will have a much greater impact.”

Buterin has approximately 180,000 followers on Farcaster, where his account is linked to the Ethereum Name Service address vitalik.eth, while he has 5.2 million followers on X.

MakerDAO: Watch out for this if you hold MKR - AMBCrypto



MKR’s value has risen by almost double digits in the last week.
Key technical indicators have confirmed the possibility of a further rally.

The value of Maker [MKR], the governance token of the stablecoin lending platform MakerDAO, has surged by almost 10% in the past 24 hours, and appears primed to extend its gains this week.
According to CoinMarketCap’s data, MKR exchanged hands at $3,246 at press time. A double-digit uptick in trading volume has accompanied the price rally in the past 24 hours. 
MKR to see more gains
An assessment of some key technical indicators hinted at the possibility of further growth in MKR’s price. 
First, its Elder-Ray Index, which estimates the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market, was positive at press time.  
A positive Elder-Ray Index value is a bullish signal, depicting an uptick in buying activity. 
AMBCrypto’s readings of this indicator revealed that it has consistently returned positive values since the 9th of March. Since then, MKR’s price has climbed by over 50%, defying the general market pullback.
Within the same period, MKR’s MACD line has rested above its signal line, confirming the bullish trend in the token’s spot market. 
When an asset’s MACD line crosses above its signal line, it suggests that the short-term moving average is trending higher than the longer-term moving average. 
This is a bullish sign, as it indicates the re-emergence of the bulls and a rise in accumulation pressure. 
Further, the token’s momentum indicators were spotted above their respective neutral lines, indicating that the demand for MKR outpaced its distribution.
 Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 63.42, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 66.
These indicators showed that market participants preferred to buy more MKR rather than sell their holdings at these values.
Likewise, MKR’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) laid above the zero line, and trended upward at the time of writing. A positive CMF value is a sign of strength in the market.
 It indicates an inflow of liquidity into an asset and is a good indicator that the price rally may be sustained. 
Source: MKR/USDT on TradingView
The ball is in your court
MKR’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio assessed on a seven-day moving average was 98%. 
This showed that its press time price is significantly higher than the price at which most investors acquired their tokens, suggesting that MKR might be overvalued.
Source: Santiment

How much are 1,10,100 MKRs worth today?

While this may seem like a net positive for MKR, Some traders view a high MVRV ratio as a bearish signal. 
This is because it allows investors who acquired the asset at lower prices to sell at its higher price, which may lead to downward pressure on the price.

Michael van de Poppe thinks the altcoin market will continue to rally in the coming months.



According to Poppe, the coming rally will coincide with a consolidation in Bitcoin price.



Altcoins’ total market cap (Total 3) has maintained a classic uptrend since October last year.




Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Michael van de Poppe thinks the altcoin market will continue to rally into the coming months despite a recent correction. In a recent post on X, Poppe noted the coming rally will coincide with a consolidation in Bitcoin price.







Poppe used a screenshot of the “Total 3” weekly chart on TradingView to explain his analysis. It is a chart containing data on the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC and ETH. The shared data showed that Total 3 is on an uptrend and recently formed a swing-high of $788.9 billion.



Meanwhile, Poppe’s screenshot reflected a pullback in the metric that saw it attempt to print a first bearish weekly candle in the past seven weeks. The analyst remained bullish amid the dropping value and considered it a healthy development for the current uptrend.



Poppe’s analysis showed the uptrend, which started last October, has broken above multiple resistances. He highlighted $402.16 billion and $449.05 billion as the first two resistances that succumbed to the uptrend. He further noted $583.01 as a recent resistance the metric has converted to support.









From the presented chart, Poppe’s highlights showed he does not expect Total 3 to fall below the $583.01 region before continuing upward. He considers it a “healthy correction” on the altcoin market cap that would trigger the next phase of the altcoin season.



Data from TradingView shows Total 3 has rejected the pullback as of the time of writing. The attempted bearish weekly candle ended with a bullish pullback, with the chart showing early signs of an uptrend continuation.



Considering historical levels, Total 3’s next stop is projected at $840 billion, representing the next significant resistance. Climbing above that level will see the altcoin market cap head for a new all-time high (ATH) to surpass the existing ATH at $1.131 trillion, according to data from TradingView.

Bitcoin and Ethereum See 3% Gains as Halving Looms - Decrypt

After sinking as low as $63,000 over the weekend, Bitcoin has rebounded and posted a 3% gain to start the week.At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is $66,964. Despite its 2.5% dip over the past week, BTC has still managed to surge 31% in the past month thanks to bullish momentum from traders.There's now less than a month left before the next Bitcoin halving, which will see the reward paid to miners cut from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.  At the time of writing, it looks like it'll occur on April 19, according to NiceHash. But the exact date changes all the time. That's because halvings occur every 210,000 blocks and aren't scheduled to happen on exact calendar days. And although new blocks tend to take 10 minutes to be processed, it varies.Over the past week, the Bitcoin price has been volatile. And there's reason to believe it will continue to exhibit volatility leading up to the halving, Beam CEO Andy Bromberg told Decrypt. That's because investors tend to second-guess whether they've appropriately priced in the halving.Ethereum, on the other hand, has also exhibited positive momentum, with a 2.6% gain over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is $3,452. ETH nearly slipped below $3,000 at one point last week, but has been steadily climbing since Sunday morning.Still, Ethereum has seen its price increase 17% in the past month.At the end of last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission again delayed its decision on an application to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum ETF. It now has until May 30 to decide whether to approve, deny, or delay once again.Meanwhile, execs watching and waiting for some good news on Ethereum ETFs are trying to find a silver lining for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalzation.“Spot Ethereum ETFs will gather more assets if they launch in December versus if they launch in May,” Bitwise Chief Information Officer Matt Hougan said on Twitter. “TradFi needs more time to digest the Bitcoin ETFs.”Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ripple v. SEC case update: Crucial XRP briefing filed


As the cryptocurrency community awaits the final decision in the courtroom standoff between blockchain company Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the agency has submitted its opening brief regarding institutional XRP sales.
Indeed, in line with the previously published schedule, the SEC submitted, “under seal, its opening remedies-related brief and supporting documents” on March 22, according to an X post shared by legal expert and popular commentator on the case, James K. Filan, on March 23.
According to the defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, these documents “are not public yet” and the regulator will file the “public, redacted versions” by March 26, 2024, after which Ripple has to submit its opposition brief by April 22, 2024, and the SEC’s reply is due May 6, 2024.



SEC Ripple lawsuit progress
As a reminder, Judge Analisa Torres ruled in July 2023 that Ripple’s sales of XRP to retail buyers did not constitute securities sales but that the institutional XRP sales were, in fact, securities. Therefore, the sides in the SEC Ripple lawsuit are now trying to agree on the damages that the blockchain firm has to pay.
In the more recent developments related to the Ripple SEC case, the regulator had requested the above remedies briefing deadlines, which suggested their extension from the previous dates, also giving Ripple nine additional days to file its own opening brief – which the Judge had subsequently approved.
Meanwhile, members of the crypto community are at the edge of their seats, watching any Ripple news or XRP lawsuit news with care, looking for clues on when the SEC vs. Ripple will finally end, as well as betting on the XRP price prediction targets depending on the outcome.
For now, the XRP price stands at $0.632, suggesting a very minor decline of 0.03% in the last 24 hours, an increase of 3.84% across the previous seven days, and an accumulated 16.08% gain in the last month, according to the most recent chart data obtained by Finbold on March 25.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: How High Will BTC Go in 2024?


																Bitcoin (BTC) is down 2% on the weekly scale. It is currently priced at $67K, just shy of its ATH from 2021. Despite the sudden correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market last week, both retail and institutional analysts believe the next target for BTC could be well above $90K by year’s end.
Analysts from the global investment firm Bernstein raised their BTC price forecast from $80K to $90K. The new price target comes following BTC’s run-up to $73K.
With a new bitcoin bull cycle, strong ETF inflows, aggressive miner capacity expansion, and all-time high miner dollar revenues, we continue to find bitcoin miners compelling buys for equity investors seeking exposure to the crypto cycle —analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote on a research report on Thursday.
Since most market observers agreed there’s a lot more room for the crypto asset, given that the Bitcoin halving is scheduled for early April, $80K now seems to fall short.
Moreover, Berstein expects a hashrate reduction of 7% following post-halving shutdowns.
Bitcoin Price Forecast: $97K
Titan of Crypto suggested a bullish outlook for Bitcoin with a target price of over $97K. The trader highlighted that BTC has regained its Tenkan—also called Conversion Line—a key indicator that shows potential support and resistance areas on different timeframes.




According to the chart shared by the analyst, BTC is breaking out from a bull flag pattern, and if confirmed, it could lead to a target price of $97,400.


On the other hand, popular analyst Trader Tardigrade (TATrader_Alan on X) denoted a bullish engulfing pattern observed in Bitcoin’s daily chart. This candlestick pattern signifies a shift in market sentiment.
In this specific scenario, buyers are gaining control over sellers, the analyst said.
The two examples below show BTC had risen from 30k to 50k and from 40k to 66k after the Bullish engulfing pattern appeared. It is anticipated BTC will have a decent BULL RUN upcoming.

                        An industry expert, on Sunday, has ‘debunked’ claims that the European Union has banned anonymous crypto wallets and transactions.On Saturday, reports spread across the industry, claiming that the EU’s recent anti-money laundering (AML) law specifically targets banning anonymous crypto accounts.However, industry expert Patrick Hansen addressed these claims, clarifying that the law does not specifically target cryptos.“Yesterday was a prime example of why crypto Twitter (and often crypto media) should not be trusted when it comes to crypto policy,” he wrote on X (Twitter).“Let’s debunk claims that the EU is banning anonymous crypto transactions or self-custodial wallets.”He stressed that the law “is not a crypto regulation,” but a broad framework that applies to all financial institutions. These includes CASPs (crypto-asset service providers), as well as services that are prone to AML risks such as gambling services.“The AMLR will apply to all CASPs (exchanges, brokers etc.) that are regulated under MiCA,” Hansen wrote. “These CASPs will need to follow standard KYC/AML procedures like customer due diligence (CDD) etc.”Further, on contrary to the rumors regarding an outright ban on anonymous crypto wallets, the AML includes provision for them. According to Hansen, this rule is already included in the existing AML regulation where custodial wallets cannot provide services to anonymous users.“Also, CASPs will not be allowed to provide accounts for privacy coins. This is already existing business practice across the world – not only in the EU.”Additionally, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, already prohibits crypto listing with built-in anonymisation function. “As such, this is nothing new either,” he added.EU’s AML Law Has Nothing New for Cryptos?
Hansen wrote that the regulation largely reaffirms existing AML rules for CASPs. The law poses an “extremely limited” impact on the crypto sector in the EU region, he noted.Furthermore, the law has not introduced radically new restrictions on self-custody payments, wallets or peer-to-peer transfers.“Therefore, you will be able to use your self-custody wallets for buying goods/services in the EU without any restrictions.”The final text was agreed by the ECON committee in the EU in March and it only needs to pass final approval in the EU Parliament’s plenary and the EU Council.

Bitcoin Buying Spree: Robert Kiyosaki Set To Buy 10 More BTC Before April" | Bitcoinist.com


								Acclaimed Author and Bitcoin bull Robert Kiyosaki has once again displayed his confidence in BTC, revealing his intentions of increasing his holdings as he predicts significant gains for the largest cryptocurrency asset.
Robert Kiyosaki Targets Bitcoin At $100,000
Robert Kiyosaki reiterated his positive view on Bitcoin in a recent X post where he spelled out his thoughts on the digital asset and disclosed his ambitions to purchase an additional 10 BTC before the month of April. The author cites the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event as the true motivation behind his plans to acquire 10 more BTC.
It is noteworthy that the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving is anticipated to take place in less than 30 days from now. The event is believed to have the potential to be the next big trigger for the entire crypto market.

He further provided an accumulation strategy for investors who are concerned about affordability, suggesting, “If a buyer is unable to afford a whole BTC, they could want to think about purchasing 1/10 of the coin through Satoshi’s or the new ETFs.”
The post stated:
I am buying 10 more Bitcoin before April. Why?  The “Having.” If you can not afford a whole Bitcoin, you may want to consider buying 1/10 of a coin, via the new ETFs or Satoshi’s.
According to Robert Kiyosaki, if the aforementioned strategy plays out very well, an investor could own an entire BTC by the end of the year. Kiyosaki is very bullish about the leading crypto asset as he expects BTC to hit the $100,000 threshold by September this year.
He also advocates acquiring Silver coins, especially the United States silver eagles, if an investor is not interested in BTC. His friend Andy Schectman claims that the silver supply, which was formerly plentiful, is almost depleted. The reasons behind this is that China’s real estate market is toast, and smart money is aware that the US is the world’s biggest debtor nation. 
Additionally, since 1990, Japan has been undergoing a depression; Germany is also experiencing one; mom-and-pop consumers are surviving solely on credit cards; banks are having troubles; and global conflict looms. 
As a result, Kiyosaki is urging investors to consider investing in silver in order not to be poor given the current economic uncertainty around the world today.
Investing In Fiat Currencies Is Not A Smart Idea
Fiat currencies, sometimes considered fake money, are dangerous to save with, according to Kiyosaki and his associates Andy Schectman and Michael Saylor. This simply suggested that investing in fiat currencies is not a smart move, and those engaging in the act are bound to end up poor in the future.

Thus, they advise everyone to invest in either silver, gold, or Bitcoin, citing that silver is the most affordable among these assets, and nearly everyone in the world can afford one silver coin or BTC Satoshi. “Coin prices for Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver are approximately $70,000, $2,500, and $35.00, respectively,” Kiyosaki added.

XRP’s 3-Day ‘W’ Pattern Signals a Potential Rally in the Coming Months - Coin Edition


							

EGRAG CRYPTO has spotted a ‘W’ pattern on the 3-day XRP chart.



According to the analyst, the identified pattern is a bullish signal that could send XRP to $1.16.



EGRAG CRYPTO’s ‘W’ pattern for XRP spans seven months, beginning from July 2023.




EGRAG CRYPTO, a prominent member of the XRP community on X, has spotted a ‘W’ pattern on the 3-day XRP chart. In his recent post, the renowned analyst identified the spotted pattern as a bullish signal that could see the altcoin rally to $1.16 soon.







The spotted ‘W’ pattern spans seven months, beginning from July 2023 after the XRP price surge that followed Ripple’s partial victory in court. Since then, XRP began an alternating trend of dips and rallies in an overall sideways direction.



According to EGRAG CRYPTO, the ‘W’ pattern formed by XRP aligns exceptionally well for a potentially significant move. He expects XRP to bounce off the current support around $0.59 to retest before breaking the next resistance around $0.75. XRP has tested that level twice since July last year.



Meanwhile, the renowned analyst projects two possible targets for XRP in the event of the breakout. He spotted a non-logarithmic target of $1.02 for XRP and a logarithmic target of $1.16. Hence, in the event of logarithmic growth, EGRAG CRYPTO expects an early surge in XRP price before slowing down to terminate at the projected target.









Although many XRP supporters expect the cryptocurrency to rally alongside other altcoins, EGRAG CRYPTO did not rule out the possibility of a further price dip. He thinks a break below $0.59 could see the altcoin fall to the next support around $0.445. However, he considers that a worst-case scenario, as the overall XRP momentum remains bullish.



XRP traded for $0.63 at the time of writing after bouncing off the $0.59 support region, according to data from TradingView.

DED memecoin causes community outrage after airdrop allocation reduced

Changes to the airdrop of the new Polkadot-based memecoin DOT is $DED (DED) have generated widespread community criticism after the initial allocation was reduced.The initial airdrop allocation was reduced from 100% of the token supply to just 5% to create a longer financial runway for the memecoin, explained one of its pseudonymous developers, Giotto De Filippi, during a March 24 X Spaces:“Once you distribute 100%, you run out of ammunition… Because the voters were not willing to fund the project, it makes more sense to distribute less, and the rest of the tokens can be used to finance the project.”DED started trending on X on March 23 after members of the Polkadot community spun up the memecoin in an effort to capitalize on the memecoin frenzy and bring more attention to the Polkadot ecosystem. Investors holding Polkadot (DOT) were eligible for 36 DED tokens for every 1 DOT held.Retail sentiment turned sour after the team reduced the initial airdrop allocation. Pseudonymous crypto investor Orlando took to X to voice his concerns in a March 23 post:“Like everyone else, I’m disappointed with how the DED situation unfolded. The treasury spent money, and many people recently bought and held DOT, driven by the excitement around this experimental DED memecoin. I hope the team will find ways to compensate holders for these mistakes in the long term.”Over 85% of the DED airdrop supply has already been claimed with over 1.3 million eligible addresses, according to Dune data. Unlike other popular memecoins, DED’s airdropped supply is frozen until future exchange listings to reduce sell pressure.Related: Memecoin trader nets $8.9M profit in an hour, raising ‘insider’ allegationsMemecoin frenzy continuesThe launch of the Polkadot-based token comes during a period of increased retail interest in memecoins. Last week, Book of Meme (BOME) rose over 1,100% on the weekly chart, briefly becoming the 130th-largest token by market capitalization.BOME is part of a series of new memecoins that raised money for unreleased coins through a controversial presale model. Presales for these Solana-based memecoins raised over $100 million worth of Solana’s (SOL) token in the three days leading up to March 18.Other blockchain networks are also trying to capitalize on the frenzy. On March 21, the Avalanche Foundation announced a $1 million liquidity mining incentive program for Avalanche-native memecoins and community-owned tokens.Related: Solana to outpace Ethereum in consumer applications — Former head of growth

                        Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is facing tax evasion charges in Nigeria, as the dispute between the exchange and Nigerian authorities escalates. The country’s tax watchdog, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), announced the charges against Binance and revealed that two Binance executives have been detained by the government, local media outlets reported Monday.The charges were filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja and include four counts of tax evasion, encompassing allegations of non-payment of Value-Added Tax (VAT), Company Income Tax, failure to file tax returns, and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through the Binance platform.Binance Executives Detained by Authorities in Nigeria
The two detained executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, both senior officials at Binance, are currently in custody under the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The Nigerian government accuses Binance of neglecting to register with the FIRS for tax purposes and violating tax regulations within the country.One of the charges focuses on Binance’s alleged failure to collect and remit various types of taxes as required by Section 40 of the FIRS Establishment Act 2007.This section specifically addresses the non-deduction and non-remittance of taxes, outlining penalties and potential imprisonment for entities found in violation.The charges detail specific instances where Binance is accused of violating tax laws, such as the failure to issue VAT invoices, hindering the determination and payment of taxes by its subscribers. According to the FIRS, any company conducting business exceeding N25 million annually is obligated under the Finance Act to pay taxes like Company Income Tax (CIT) and collect and remit Value Added Tax (VAT).“Any company that conducts business exceeding N25 million annually is deemed, by the Finance Act, to be present in Nigeria,” the FIRS noted in a statement.“According to this rule, Binance falls into that category. So, it is obligated to pay taxes like Company Income Tax (CIT) and also collect and remit Value Added Tax (VAT). However, Binance did not adhere to these requirements, thus violating Nigerian laws and potentially facing investigation and legal action for this infraction.”US Pressured to Assist Detained Binance Executives
There has been mounting pressure on the Biden administration to intervene and secure the release of the detained Binance executives.The administration is facing increasing calls to take swift action in securing the release of Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, who have been detained by the Nigerian government since February 26, 2024.The U.S. Chamber of Digital Commerce made an appeal through a blog post on its website on March 15, leading the charge for urgent diplomatic intervention to address what it deems a grave injustice.As reported, Binance recently had to discontinue all services involving Nigerian local fiat currency, the Nigerian naira (NGN), after regulatory scrutiny. The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange said it would suspend NGN withdrawals after March 8. Earlier, the Nigerian government imposed a staggering $10 billion fine on Binance as part of a crackdown on the platform in an effort to stabilize the nation’s local currency.

Battle Of Titans: Bitcoin Leads S&P 500, Michael Saylor Asserts Amid Disagreement


								The allure of Bitcoin continues to spark debate, with proponents touting its skyrocketing value and critics warning of a potential bubble. This weekend, a prominent crypto advocate and CEO, Michael Saylor, reignited the discussion by showcasing Bitcoin’s impressive gains compared to traditional assets.

Bitcoin Debate: Saylor Vs. Schiff
Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm, shared a chart highlighting the leading crypto’s over 430% growth against a backdrop of more modest gains from established investment options like the S&P 500 (56%) and gold (7%). This, according to Saylor, underscores Bitcoin’s position as a dominant investment force.


However, not everyone is convinced. Renowned economist Peter Schiff, a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, remains unconvinced. He expressed concern over Saylor’s aggressive investment strategy, particularly MicroStrategy’s recent acquisition of over 9,000 BTCs. Schiff emphasizes the inherent volatility of digital currencies, highlighting the potential for significant losses, especially considering MicroStrategy’s leveraged purchases.



Saylor, however, remains unfazed by the recent price dip (nearly 12%) following Bitcoin’s record high. He views volatility as a natural market phenomenon, even coining the phrase “volatility is vitality” to emphasize its role in a healthy market. This confidence extends to MicroStrategy’s investment strategy. The company has significantly increased its holdings, now totaling over 214,000 BTC, showcasing their long-term faith in the digital currency.
The contrasting views of Saylor and Schiff represent the ongoing debate surrounding Bitcoin. Proponents like Saylor point to its historical growth trajectory and its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. They believe the digital asset’s limited supply (21 million coins will ever be mined) makes it a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.

Risks And Regulations
However, skeptics like Schiff highlight the risks associated with BTC price fluctuations. Unlike established assets with underlying fundamentals like company performance or resource scarcity, Bitcoin’s value relies heavily on speculation and market sentiment. A sudden shift in investor confidence could trigger a dramatic price drop, leading to significant losses for investors like MicroStrategy.
Further complicating the picture is the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate this new asset class. Stringent regulations could stifle innovation and adoption, potentially hindering Bitcoin’s future growth.

Polygon zkEVM restarts after hitch while Bitbot presale hits $1.3 million



                    

                    
Polygon zkEVM halted operations following a sequencer issue.
MATIC price was poised above $1.00 despite the negative development.
Meanwhile, Bitbot reached stage 7 of its presale, with growing interest in Telegram bots pushing the total raised amount to over $1.3 million.

Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta is back online after a sequence issue caused an outage, the Polygon team has announced. 
MATIC price held strong despite the setback while investors keen on opportunities in the Telegram bots space flocked to Bitbot. The project’s presale has surpassed $1.3 million.
Polygon zkEVM resumes operations after outage fix
Polygon Labs announced early Monday that the mainnet beta of Polygon zkEVM was back online after facing an extended outage over the weekend.
MATIC, the native token of the Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development platform, traded up after holding onto gains despite the sequencer issue that saw Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta go offline for several hours.
Per the update, which Polygon offered via X, the Polygon zkEVM core team was able to apply a fix after the Emergency Council for Polygon zkEVM activated an emergency state. Engineers have been able to resolve issues with L1 settlement of the zkEVM mainnet beta.
Notably, the network hitch only impacted the zkEVM beta. All other ecosystem components, including Polygon PoS and Polygon CDK were not impacted.
The price of MATIC was in a positive territory over the 24-hour timeframe, up 4.1% at the time of writing. This put MATIC at $1.04.
Bitbot to debut world’s first non-custodial Telegram bot
Crypto trading is on the upward trajectory and traders keen to access opportunities traditionally limited to institutional investors have looked to Telegram trading bots.
These customs apps offer institutional-graded trading tools directly from within the Telegram app, and a popular among crypto traders.
Bitbot, a new entrant into the market, has captivated the community by offering the first-ever non-custodial trading bot on Telegram. The key to Bitbot’s attractiveness is its focus on user security.
Unlike other trading bots, Bitbot is designed to have users retain control of their private keys. Integration with Knightsafe provides for this self-custody architecture, with tools such as anti-MEV and anti-rug complementing the overall safety and privacy of users.
AI trading tools, including automated sniping, add to Bitbot’s outlook as a top crypto trading bot. There’s also a revenue-sharing program where BITBOT holders are guaranteed a share of bot’s daily revenue.
Bitbot powers through presale
Polygon (MATIC) traded in the green on Monday as top cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum looked to bounce to key resistance levels. 
BTC and ETH were poised at $67k and $3,450 respectively, with bulls likely to eye $70k and $4k in coming weeks.
While prices could dip amid other market conditions, the overall picture is bullish in the latter stages of the year. Bitbot, which aims to dominate the Telegram bots market, could ride tailwinds in the sector to the moon.
This outlook is likely fueling Bitbot’s presale pace. Currently in stage 7, the project has raised over $1.37 million. The BITBOT price has jumped to $0.0134 and will rise until the final stage 15. 
With BITBOT price programmed to increase to $0.02 in the final presale stage, the early bird could be looking at significant returns when the non-custodial bot hits the market.

Ripple Developer Makes Call for Canary Network Amid XRPL Glitch

Developers within the Ripple Labs and XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem are amplifying conversations regarding the creation of a Canary Network for the layer-1 blockchain.Canary Network: Key reasonsThe call was first sparked by Wietse Wind, the cofounder of Xumm Wallet who believes having a testing ground before all major upgrades and products go live on the XRP Ledger mainnet is necessary.The launch of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) feature on XRP Ledger was a celebrated event. However, this celebration was short-lived as the feature experienced a bug that forced it to a halt. In Wietse Wind’s argument, if there had been a proper testing ground, such a technical glitch could have been avoided.In his proposal for a Canary Network, WietseWind noted that the protocol will have to have its assets, like a native token and stablecoins. He also pointed out designing a protocol that will mimic the XRP Ledger mainnet in all features so that testing can give the same real-life scenario as the main ledger. The Xumm founder pointed out that the Canary Network needs to have a massive decentralization element, one that will accommodate traders, developers and all key stakeholders within the ecosystem.Fitting with other L1 networksThe call for an XRP Ledger Canary Network is not unfounded as it will position it in line with other blockchain networks like Flare and Songbird. Ethereum, for instance, has many testnets ranging from Goerli to Holesky and Sepolia, among others.Before any major Ethereum upgrade goes live on the mainnet, it is first deployed on these testnets where the necessary adjustments are done. The recently launched Dencun Upgrade passed through many of these testnets, and it came with no hiccup as the XRP Ledger AMM suffered afterward.Per Wietse Wind's proposition, conversations are likely to progress in this regard in the coming days in line with the development of the Canary Network.

DigiFT Unveils Inaugural RWA Depository Receipt Tokens for On-Chain Investor Protection


							

DigiFT announces U.S. Treasury Bill depository receipt tokens, offering direct beneficial ownership of the underlying U.S. Treasury Bill



DigiFT states that the circulating tokens have intricate legal structures, posing challenges for investors to grasp their legal implications.



DigiFT’s CEO highlights how this addresses a key challenge in the RWA market.




According to a DigiFT report, DigiFT, the inaugural licensed exchange facilitating on-chain transactions of real-world assets, has announced U.S. Treasury Bill depository receipt tokens, which offer direct beneficial ownership of the underlying U.S. Treasury Bill.



DigiFT has developed a token issuance model deploying the depository receipt (DR) structure on-chain, addressing a “challenge” in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. DigiFT ensures tokens represent token holders’ direct beneficial interest in the underlying asset while enabling seamless settlement on-chain.



According to the DigiFT statement, the tokens currently in circulation are “wrapped” in complex legal structures, making it hard for investors to understand the legal implications. The tokens that are to be issued reportedly provide a solution to this problem as they will provide a more plain-sailing legal framework. 



Henry Zhang, DigiFT’s founder, and CEO, stated, “DigiFT’s innovative DR structure addresses a pain point in the current RWA market, empowering investors with direct ownership of underlying assets and returns.” The CEO reiterated that DigiFT remains committed to expanding the universe of traditional financial assets in the Web3 space through the DR model.



The report mentioned that the DigiFT U.S. Treasury Tokens (DRUST) would be the inaugural offering in a series under the DR structure, providing direct backing from AA+rated, highly liquid U.S. Treasury bills. Moreover, the report suggested that tokens would be ideal for stablecoin issuers and Web3 product developers/managers seeking regulatory-compliant treasury and cash management solutions. DigiFT announced in December that it had been awarded the coveted Capital Markets Services (CMS) license and recognized as a Recognized Market Operator (RMO) by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

Economist Alex Krüger Bullish on One Under-the-Radar Layer-One Altcoin, Says Crypto ‘Can Get Crazier’ - The Daily Hodl


								Widely followed economist Alex Krüger is bullish on one overlooked layer-one crypto project amid what he believes is the earlier stages of a digital assets bull run.
Krüger tells his 168,000 followers on the social media platform X that many more people are about to hear about Core (CORE), a blockchain that aims to leverage the advantages of Bitcoin’s (BTC) proof-of-work system (POW) plus the attributes of proof-of-stake (POS).










Says Krüger,
“There are two kinds of people in crypto.
Those who have heard about CORE.
And those who will.”
Source: Alex Krüger/X
At time of writing, CORE is trading for $0.73, up 13% in the last 24 hours.
In a new interview on the 1000x podcast, Krüger says that Bitcoin and crypto’s current bull run is largely driven by flows into spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which he says are only just beginning.
According to the economist, despite a recent price correction for Bitcoin and many altcoins, he thinks it makes sense to stay long at least until the BTC halving, when miners’ rewards are cut in half.
“The thing is: the ETF flows are so large, that in my opinion, they are just beginning. That sustains and enables this level of absolute insane degeneracy. 
That’s what’s happening here. If you are concerned that this is actually a good place to basically hedge your spot holdings using futures or perps to unhedge once it flashes and hedging part of it – a small percentage… That being said, I think it makes a lot of sense to keep on riding into the halving, at least. 
Things are crazy, but things can get crazier, and we make the most money in the part where it gets really, really f*cking crazy. So if we’re just getting rational to protect profits, yeah that works but you leave most of the money on the table.”

'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' Author Robert Kiyosaki Says He's Buying 10 Bitcoin Before April Halving, Sees King Crypto Rallying To This Level By September - Benzinga

The Bitcoin BTC/USD rally has cooled after peaking at $73,750.07 on March 14th. However, the leading cryptocurrency has shown some signs of upward momentum since the weekend. Against this backdrop, “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki took to social media on Monday to urge investors to buy Bitcoin.Kiyosaki’s Bullish Call Cites Halving EventKiyosaki stated his intention to purchase 10 more bitcoins before April, specifically citing the upcoming “halving” as his motivation. He acknowledged affordability concerns for some investors, suggesting, “If you can't afford a whole Bitcoin you may want to consider buying 1/10 of a coin, via the new ETFs or Satoshi's,” he said.He further hinted at the possibility of Bitcoin becoming more accessible to retail investors: “If the Bitcoin process works as designed you may own a whole Bitcoin by the end of this year.”See Also: 10 Best Cryptocurrencies Of MarchThe Bitcoin Halving: A Supply SqueezeThe “halving” event Kiyosaki refers to is expected to be the next major catalyst for cryptocurrency. Scheduled to occur in April, it will see the reward for mining new blocks cut in half. In simpler terms, miners will receive 50% fewer bitcoins for verifying transactions. This event happens roughly every four years and is programmed to occur once every 210,000 blocks are mined. It will continue until the network reaches its maximum supply of 21 million bitcoins.Halving’s Impact: Reduced Supply, Potential Price IncreaseThe halving event is generally viewed positively by Bitcoin traders because it reduces the number of new bitcoins entering circulation. This, in turn, restricts supply and could theoretically push the price upwards.Kiyosaki’s Price Prediction: Bitcoin to $100,000?Kiyosaki expressed his belief that Bitcoin could rally to $100,000 by September 2024. He also referenced comments from Bitcoin bull and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who has previously stated that those who insist on saving fiat currency will remain poor.Alternative Investment OptionsKiyosaki also offered alternative asset recommendations for investors hesitant about Bitcoin. Unsurprisingly, he reiterated his support for precious metals like gold and silver. “If you are not into Bitcoin, I suggest buying silver coins, preferably US silver eagles,” he stated.Kiyosaki then quoted comments from Andy Schectman, President of precious metals dealer Miles Franklin Ltd. Schectman suggests that the readily available supply of silver is dwindling, prompting him to maintain a standing order for $1 million in “junk” silver (pre-1964 US silver coins). He attributes this trend to several factors, including:
The U.S.’ status as the world’s largest debtor nation



China’s struggling property market



Ongoing economic stagnation in Japan



Recessionary fears in Germany



Consumer reliance on credit cards



Potential instability in the regional banking system



The looming threat of a global conflict
Kiyosaki’s Final Thoughts: Invest SmartlyKiyosaki concluded his message by urging investors to make informed decisions and consider acquiring at least one silver coin or a Satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin). “Bitcoin is about $70,000 a coin. Gold is about $2,500 [per] coin. Silver is about $35.00 a coin,” he noted.At last check, Bitcoin rose 4.69% over the past 24 hours to $67,176.98, according to Benzinga Pro data. Gold futures rose 0.33% to $2,167.15 and silver futures edged down 0.21% to $24.79.Read Next: Dogecoin Leads Cryptos Higher In Weekend Rally: A Look At Memecoin’s Technicals

ParaSwap Refunds Users as Augustus V6 Hacker Faces Ultimatum - DailyCoin


        
ParaSwap has refunded some users affected by a vulnerability in one of its contracts.



The platform later contacted the hacker and issued an ultimatum.



It remains unclear how much was stolen following the vulnerability.
Decentralized finance (DeFi) aggregator ParaSwap has commenced returning crypto assets to users recently affected by a critical vulnerability in one of the platform’s newly deployed contracts.On March 20, ParaSwap identified a vulnerability in its Augustus V6 contract, allowing hackers to drain funds from over 386 exposed wallets when approved. The platform paused the contract and conducted a white hack to secure funds for users who were at risk.ParaSwap Disburses User Funds, Issues Ultimatum to HackerAccording to a recent update on X, ParaSwap has returned crypto assets to wallets that revoked their permissions to the Augustus v6 contract and were successfully recovered by white hat hackers.A few hours later, the ParaSwap team shared another post detailing its steps to identify the hacker and launch the investigation into the stolen funds.In addition to submitting a “comprehensive report to the appropriate authorities” and collaborating with Chainalysis and TRM Labs to trace the movement of the funds, ParaSwap initiated contact with the hacker via on-chain messaging, urging them to return the stolen user funds.The platform advised the hacker to transfer the funds directly to a specific address by March 27 or face serious consequences.“If we do not hear back from you by Wednesday, March 27, 2024, 23:00 UTC we will assume you appropriated the funds with unlawful intent and we will pursue all criminal, legal, and administrative avenues available for the purpose of recovering the misappropriated funds,” ParaSwap wrote.Although there is a likelihood that ParaSwap might recover the funds if the hacker heeds the call, it remains unclear how much was exactly stolen.How Much Was Stolen?While ParaSwap initially said only four addresses were compromised on March 20 and lost a total of $24,000, blockchain security firm Cyvers reported that the Augustus V6 contract vulnerability resulted in a total loss of $123,500.Meanwhile, of the 386 addresses exposed to the vulnerability, only 173 have received their funds, and 213 addresses have yet to revoke allowances to the flawed contract. Per ParaSwap, these addresses are still vulnerable and might be exploited.Read how AirDAO was recently exploited:AirDAO Loses 35.2M AMB and 125 ETH to a Uniswap Pool ExploitStay updated on how FTX and BlockFi claimants were scammed for millions:FTX, BlockFi Claimants Scammed For Millions Via Fake Emails

Why Tomorrow (March 26) Will Be Pivotal For Ripple And XRP


								In the XRP lawsuit, the next crucial phase is set to commence for Ripple Labs against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tomorrow. Defense lawyer James K. Filan has recently casted the spotlight on March 26.
The SEC has already submitted its opening remedies-related brief along with supporting documentation, albeit under seal, to the court. This step is a significant progression in the protracted legal dispute that has spanned several years. Filan’s statement via X emphasizes the forthcoming public disclosure of these documents, slated for no later than March 26, 2024.

“The SEC has filed, under seal, its opening remedies-related brief and supporting documents. These documents are not public yet. Public, redacted versions will be filed no later than Tuesday, March 26, 2024,” Filan communicated, highlighting the importance of this date in the context of the Ripple vs. SEC case.
Ripple Vs. SEC: What To Expect
It’s crucial to understand the nature and significance of an “opening remedies-related brief.” This document represents a foundational element in the litigation process. Essentially, the opening remedies-related brief is the initial submission by a party—in this instance, the SEC—outlining the specific legal and financial remedies it seeks from the court against the opposing party, Ripple Labs.
The amount of remedies that the SEC is demanding is eagerly awaited. In particular, it will be interesting to see how much the SEC demands for the institutional XRP sales after the start of the legal dispute.
As Bitcoinist reported, US District Judge Analisa Torres has ordered Ripple to provide its financial statements from 2022-2023 and contracts about “Institutional Sales” of XRP in February, which the SEC argues are essential for determining an appropriate remedy.

Despite Ripple’s assertion that details regarding its financial health are both irrelevant to the case and highly confidential, the court has found such information potentially significant to the remedy stage of the proceedings. In its motion, the SEC contended that access to the company’s financial data is crucial for establishing the scale and nature of penalties and remedies that should be applied.
Just a few days ago, Ripple Labs and the SEC presented a detailed schedule for the remedies phase to the Southern District Court of New York. This agenda outlines the procedures for sealing and redacting court documents pertinent to the remedies phase of the lawsuit—a critical aspect of the proceedings that will determine the legal and financial repercussions for Ripple Labs

March 22, 2024: The SEC filed its remedies brief under seal.
March 25, 2024: A meeting between the SEC and Ripple to discuss and finalize the necessary redactions is happening today.
March 26, 2024: The SEC’s deadline to file a public, redacted version of its opening brief.
April 22, 2024: Ripple’s deadline to file its opposition brief.
April 23-24, 2024: A planned meeting to finalize redactions for Ripple’s documents. If necessary Ripple will file a public, redacted version of its opposition brief.
May 8, 2024: The SEC’s deadline for the public submission of its reply brief.

The provided timeline offers clarity on the immediate procedural steps. Despite this clarity, there remains a level of uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of the case. Speculation about potential delays persists, particularly concerning whether the SEC may request an extension.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.63218.

Goldman Hedge Funds Clients Surge Into Crypto After ETF Nod


							

Goldman hedge funds pivot to crypto after the US approves Bitcoin ETFs, signaling a market interest shift.



Goldman’s crypto strategy focuses on derivatives, not spot products, amid ETF-driven demand.



Investment in blockchain tech and tokenization projects reflects Goldman’s commitment to digital assets.




Goldman Sachs’ hedge-fund clients have reportedly increased their activities in the crypto options space, sparked by the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This shift, as noted by Max Minton, the head of digital assets for Goldman Asia Pacific, highlights a growing interest and engagement from the firm’s influential clientele. 



Minton’s comments, part of a March 24 Bloomberg report, reveal that this renewed enthusiasm is largely driven by the U.S. authorization of ten new Bitcoin ETFs. This event occurred earlier in January, marking a key moment for crypto assets within traditional market frameworks.




 “The recent ETF approval has triggered a resurgence of interest and activities from our clients.” 




According to Minton, the introduction of these ETFs has not only validated cryptocurrencies’ place in the financial markets but also reignited Goldman’s clients’ interest in the sector. Minton explains that the majority of this renewed focus is channeled through Goldman’s futures and options offerings, with hedge funds being particularly active. This surge in activity comes after a relatively quiet period last year, indicating a notable shift in the market’s dynamics since the start of the year.




“It was a quieter year last year, but we’ve seen a pickup in interest from clients in onboarding, pipeline, and volume since the start of the year,” Minton said. 




Despite Goldman Sachs’ impressive $2.8 trillion in assets under management by the end of 2023, the firm currently does not provide any spot cryptocurrency products. Instead, its offerings are concentrated on crypto derivatives, including Bitcoin and Ether options and futures, first introduced with the launch of its crypto trading desk in 2021. These products allow clients to navigate the volatility of the crypto market and make informed predictions on price movements.Additionally, Goldman Sachs is exploring the tokenization of traditional assets using blockchain technology. The firm’s involvement in this area includes the development of the GS DAP digital-asset platform and participation in a blockchain network pilot designed to connect banks, asset managers, and exchanges. Furthermore, Goldman’s investments in startups, particularly those developing blockchain infrastructure, underscore its focus on shaping the digital asset market structure.

Dogecoin surpasses Cardano as competition with new Telegram bot token heats up



                    

                    
Dogecoin overtakes Cardano to become the 8th largest crypto.
Dogecoin’s surge is fueled by social media buzz & market surge.
Bitbot, a new telegram bot project, raises $1,378,018 in its seventh stage of the ongoing token presale.

In a dynamic turn of events, Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged ahead, overtaking Cardano (ADA) to become the 8th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
This comes amidst intensifying competition in the cryptocurrency market, fueled by the emergence of innovative projects such as Bitbot, a new Telegram bot token.
Dogecoin price up 100% in a month
Over the past month, Dogecoin’s price has seen remarkable price movements, experiencing a significant surge of over 100.83%.
Recent market dynamics suggest that this rise may be attributed to the buzz created by social media influencers.
According to data from crypto analysts, Dogecoin’s price surge is closely correlated with increased social media activity.
The uptick in the number of interactions on various social media platforms has propelled the price of DOGE upwards.
However, despite this apparent correlation, technical analysis of Dogecoin’s price movements paint a more cautious picture.
Bitbot: the new Telegram bot token
Amidst the flurry of activity in the cryptocurrency market, Bitbot has emerged as a notable player, offering users a unique trading experience directly within the Telegram platform.
Bitbot is a non-custodial Telegram trading bot that aims to level the financial playing field by providing users with institutional-grade tools in a secure and user-friendly package. It allows users to trade directly from Telegram while maintaining full control of their assets.
Bitbot offers a range of features designed to enhance the trading experience, including automated sniping, limit orders, copy trading, and yield optimization. These tools are accessible to all users, irrespective of their trading experience, making advanced trading capabilities accessible to a wider audience.
Ongoing Bitbot presale
Currently, Bitbot is in the midst of the presale phase of its native token ($BITBOT), offering investors the opportunity to participate in its early stages of development.
At the current presale stage, the presale price of Bitbot tokens (BITBOT) is set at $0.0134 per token.
However, with each stage of the presale, the price is set to increase, with the next stage price expected to be $0.0141 per token.
The presale has already raised a significant amount, signalling investors’ interest in the project’s potential.
Is it good to invest in Dogecoin or Bitbot now?
As investors weigh their options in the cryptocurrency market, the decision to invest in Dogecoin or Bitbot hinges on various factors.
While Dogecoin’s recent price movements have been impressive, technical indicators suggest caution, indicating a potential reversal in price direction.
The Aroon indicator for Dogecoin indicates that the upward trend may be weakening, potentially signalling a reversal in price direction.
Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has returned a negative value, suggesting an outflow of liquidity and increased selling pressure.
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator further confirms a downward trend, with the MACD line crossing below the signal line on March 15.
These technical indicators collectively indicate weakness and a short-term downward trend in the market, despite the recent surge in Dogecoin’s price.
On the other hand, Bitbot offers a novel approach to cryptocurrency trading, with its unique features and innovative platform garnering attention from investors.
However, ultimately, the decision to invest in Dogecoin or Bitbot depends on individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and market analysis.
With both options presenting opportunities and risks, investors should conduct thorough research and seek professional advice where necessary before making investment decisions, seeing that crypto investments come with market volatility risks.

BlockDAG Dominates SEI and Cardano Ecosystem with its $7.9 Million Blockbuster Presale



                    


Navigating the crypto market requires a keen eye on platforms that stand out for their innovation, stability, and potential for growth. Amid fluctuating prices of SEI and strategic moves within the Cardano ecosystem, BlockDAG has surged ahead with its notable sale of 3838 mining devices across four presales, amassing over $7.9 million. This examination delves into the market dynamics, highlighting BlockDAG’s emergence as a distinctive force in the decentralized world, aiming to equip investors and traders with the knowledge to make sound decisions.



Examining SEI Price Movements



The price of SEI has exhibited varied performance, with a 14.84% decline noted over the past month. Despite this, SEI has maintained a bullish stance, evidenced by a 113.72% increase in the last quarter and an impressive 306.18% rise over the past year from its previous value of $0.200283. SEI achieved its highest value on March 16, 2024, reaching $1.14, and is currently in a phase of stability, showcasing a low volatility rate of 6.06 and counting 12 positive days out of the recent 30. This contrast between the recent decrease and strong gains in the medium to long term offers a balanced view of SEI’s market performance.








Cardano’s Ecosystem: Steady Advancement



Cardano has made strategic advancements in the crypto market, underscored by EMURGO’s support for NMKR, enhancing Cardano’s Web3 presence, tokenization capabilities, and overall utility. Although it has moved out of the top 20 in CoinGecko’s rankings, Cardano’s focus remains on long-term growth and establishing a robust foundation in the blockchain sector through careful enhancement of its infrastructure.







BlockDAG Presale Goes Global: Raises $7.9 Million



BlockDAG stands out with its accessible, security-focused design and innovative features that surpass many in the Proof of Stake category. Its approach allows for simultaneous transaction processing, introducing a level of transparency uncommon in traditional blockchain models. BlockDAG serves as a comprehensive platform for decentralized applications, meeting diverse needs from logistics to financial services and digital identity management.







With over $7.9 million raised and more than 3838 miners sold quickly, BlockDAG’s financial success underscores its potential as a leading investment option. Touted as the top crypto purchase of 2024, BlockDAG is celebrated for its blockchain innovations and growth potential, bolstered by a $2 million giveaway ending on April 15, which has sparked widespread interest and community involvement, reinforcing BlockDAG’s strong market presence.




BlockDAG’s Emergence



Comparing the volatility of SEI’s price, the strategic development within the Cardano ecosystem, and BlockDAG’s expanding network, BlockDAG presents the most compelling opportunity for generating future wealth. Its combination of ease of use, high security, and growth potential positions it as the premier investment choice for forward-thinking investors. Exploring BlockDAG’s presale might just be the start of a profitable crypto investment journey.

Binance follows Circle and drops USDC support on Tron

Crypto exchange Binance will cease deposit and withdrawal support for TRC-20-based USD Coin (USDC) tokens in under two weeks.On Feb. 20, USDC issuer Circle announced plans to discontinue support for the stablecoin over the Tron blockchain, stating that the decision aligns with “efforts to ensure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.” Circle also stopped minting USDC on Justin Sun’s Tron blockchain on the same day and said it would gradually phase out support for the blockchain network entirely.Source: CircleCircle’s decision to discontinue support for USDC on Tron had a domino effect, as Binance — the crypto exchange with the highest trading volume — followed suit. On March 25, Binance announced its decision to cease support for Tron’s TRC-20-based USDC deposits and withdrawals from April 5.Crypto investors using Binance have been given 12 days to convert, transfer or cash out their TRC-20 USDC tokens from Binance.

Indonesian NFT ‘selfie guy’ makes $1.8M in memecoin comeback

The Indonesian college student who earned a million dollars selling nonfungible tokens (NFTs) of his selfies in 2022 has made a comeback, raising $1.8 million in a memecoin presale.In January 2022, Sultan Gustaf Al Ghozali minted NFTs with photos of himself that he took every day for five years. The collection, called “Ghozali Everyday,” gained support from crypto community members, netting Ghozali, who was still a student, over $1 million.When Ghozali graduated from college in 2023, he posted on X that he would finally stop taking selfies. He said he was lucky to have made money from the “stupidest idea” he came up with. Source: GhozaliAfter disappearing from X for months, Ghozali reappeared as interest in memecoins surged. On March 24, he announced the second iteration of Ghozali Everyday — a memecoin and NFT hybrid project on the Base blockchain. Ghozali’s memecoin presale address. Source: EtherscanSince its launch, Ghozali’s presale has surpassed its 400 Ether (ETH) cap. At the time of writing, the presale address reached 527 ETH, around $1.8 million. However, Ghozali wrote on X that he would refund those who sent more ETH after the cap was reached. Amid the Bitcoin (BTC) uptick, interest in memecoins has resurfaced, driven mainly by Solana traders. Data showed that presale projects on Solana raised $100 million in just three days from March 15 to 18. Community members described the Solana memecoin frenzy as “peak degeneracy,” with users blindly sending Solana (SOL) tokens to founders announcing “presales” without any guarantee that they would get any tokens back. Related: Trader fumbles $1M bag after selling a Solana memecoin earlyIn addition to the Solana network, the total value locked (TVL) in crypto exchange Coinbase’s layer-2 network, Base, has doubled as investors eye the blockchain as the next epicenter for memecoins. On March 23, Base’s TVL reached $2.13 billion. Some industry pundits believe that after Solana’s meme season, the attention might slowly shift to Base, and there could be potential crazy runs in the layer-2 network. However, on March 14, asset manager Franklin Templeton published an investor note warning that memecoins have “no inherent value or utility.” Despite this, the asset manager recognized that meme-based tokens have the potential to give investors fast gains.

GBTC outflows meet ‘incredible demand’ ― 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week

Bitcoin (BTC) launches into the last week of March within striking distance of old all-time highs.BTC price action is displaying renewed energy as the market consolidates higher — can bulls manage a return to price discovery?That is the best scenario on the table for the monthly close. Bitcoin’s hardwon comeback contrasts with last week’s grim mood, which witnessed precipitous losses.The retracement from current all-time highs near $74,000 at one point passed 17%, and while still modest by bull market correction standards, it made many nervous.This week, the landscape is different — at least so far. A CME gap to the upside has become one to the downside, and investor anticipation of a fresh attack on the highs to come is climbing, not falling.Combine that with an inbound mining difficulty increase and classic bullish signals are plain to see.Beyond Bitcoin, a classic set of macroeconomic triggers is waiting in the wings to potentially inject some added volatility into risk assets.Cointelegraph takes a closer look at these issues and more in the weekly rundown of near-term BTC price catalysts.BTC price returns to crunch resistance zoneIn strong contrast to before, the weekend was mostly a success story for Bitcoin bulls.BTC/USD 1-week chart.

While this is, in fact, $1,200 lower than the previous week, it canceled out the majority of recent losses, which saw BTC/USD reach local lows of less than $61,000 on March 20.Now, a gap to the downside on CME futures markets is the target to watch for popular analyst Mark Cullen.When they appear over a weekend, gaps either up or down form a common price lure, with BTC/USD “filling” them within days or even hours when the new trading week begins.“Lets see if that CME gap gets filled in the next 24hrs,” Cullen wrote in part of a post on X, adding a chart showing what he described as “areas of interest.”BTC/USD chart.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Payments? Grok AI by X (Twitter) Says Yes


X’s (formerly Twitter) AI, Grok, has opened up new possibilities for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. With a nod towards enhancing user financial interactions, Grok suggested that users can engage in Dogecoin (DOGE) transactions directly through the platform. 
This notion hints at X’s leap into the cryptocurrency market, placing Dogecoin alongside traditional payment methods.

When asked, “Can I send or receive DOGE on X?,” the mobile version of Grok said the process is remarkably straightforward for those looking to engage in DOGE transactions. 
According to X’s generative AI, users wishing to send Dogecoin must first ensure their X wallet is funded with DOGE. By selecting the “Send” option within the app, users can then enter the recipient’s X username or their unique Dogecoin wallet address, specify the amount, and finalize the transaction. 
Receiving DOGE follows a similar user-friendly procedure. Grok suggested that by accessing the “Receive” function, users are presented with their exclusive Dogecoin wallet address, which can be shared with potential senders or linked to their X username, facilitating the receipt of funds.


However, the desktop version of Grok painted a different picture, stating that X currently does not support direct Dogecoin transactions. It hinted at possible future integration, advising users to keep an eye on updates from X and Elon Musk.

“At the moment, there is no direct support for sending or receiving Dogecoin (DOGE) on the X platform. However, recent developments and rumors suggest that crypto assets like DOGE could be integrated into the platform’s payment offerings in the future. It’s essential to stay updated with the latest news and announcements from X and Elon Musk to be informed about any changes or updates regarding Dogecoin integration,” the desktop version of Grok stated.

This discrepancy raises questions about the platform’s direction concerning cryptocurrency integration and its support for Dogecoin.

This news could signal a significant shift for DOGE holders in how they use and accept the altcoin for payments. Indeed, such an integration could solidify Dogecoin’s position within the crypto market as more than a meme coin.

Bitcoin to $100K in September? 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' author claims... - AMBCrypto



Kiyosaki aims to buy 10 more Bitcoins before the halving event. 
The investor urged his followers to consider Bitcoin as a hedge.

Serial investor and author of Rich Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, seeks to buy an extra 10 Bitcoin [BTC]  to take advantage of the pre-halving discount. 
The king coin has been in a “re-accumulation” phase since the second half of March, consolidating recent losses below $68K. 
Kiyosaki’s move follows his mid-term bullish conviction of BTC price appreciation after the halving event in April, with a Q3 price target of $100K. 
Kiyosaki: Catalysts for possible BTC rally to $100K by Q3 2024
Kiyosaki nudged his 2.5M X (formerly Twitter) followers to consider buying 1/10 of Bitcoin if they can’t afford whole coins. 
Citing post-halving and fundamental risks in traditional global markets, Kiyosaki stated, 
“I expect Bitcoin to be $100K by September 2024.”
To uncover the underlying challenges across traditional markets in advanced economies, the investor expounded; 
“The “smart money” knows the US is the biggest debtor nation in the world; China’s property market is “toast;” Japan has been in a depression since 1990; Germany is sliding into a depression, mom and pop consumers are living on credit cards; banks are in trouble; and the world is on the brink of war.” 
To alleviate and hedge against these risks, Kiyosaki recommended gold, silver, or Bitcoin. However, like Michael Saylor, he cautioned against over-relying on fiat money. 
“Please don’t be a poor person saving fake (fiat) money.” 
Many analysts and key halving cycle theorists have predicted bullish prospects for BTC’s post-halving event in mid-April.
Last week, Standard Chartered raised its end-year BTC prediction by 50%, from $100K to $150K. 
Similarly, Bernstein analysts raised the end-year BTC target from $80K to $90K, citing 
“Strong ETF inflows and aggressive miner capacity expansion.” 
Ergo, Kiyosaki’s prediction of $100K by September 2024 is closer to Bernstein’s end-year targets. 
However, an AMBCrypto report established that BTC’s short-term prospects were still bearish. 
At the time of writing, BTC traded at $67.0K with a crucial overhead bearish order block on the 4-hour chart around $66.9K — $67.99K.
 If the price moves above this order block, a renewed short-term bullish intention could be apparent.

Binance executive reportedly escapes detention as Nigeria files tax evasion charges

Update 11:30 am UTC: This article has been updated to include quotes from Binance.A Binance executive detained by the Nigerian authorities has reportedly escaped detention using a fake passport, according to reports in a local publication citing sources familiar with the matter.The news comes as other reports claim the Nigerian government has launched criminal proceedings against the exchange for tax evasion. According to local media, the charges were filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday.Binance executive Nadeem Anjarwalla and his colleague Tigran Gambaryan have been detained in a guest house for several weeks in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. However, Anjarwalla reportedly fled detention on Friday, March 22, after he was taken to a nearby mosque for prayers. Anjarwalla reportedly flew out of Abuja on a Middle East airline. However, it is unclear how he managed to board the international flight, as his British passport, with which he entered Nigeria, remains in the custody of the Nigerian authorities.According to an immigration official, the Binance executive fled Nigeria on a Kenyan passport, and authorities are now trying to determine how Anjarwalla acquired the passport, as he had no other travel documents while in custody.According to reports, the men were granted several privileges while in detention, including using cell phones.Anjarwalla, the regional manager for Binance in Africa, and Gambaryan, a United States citizen who is the head of Binance’s criminal investigations team, were taken into custody upon their arrival in Nigeria on Feb. 26. "We were made aware that Nadeem is no longer in Nigerian custody. Our primary focus remains on the safety of our employees and we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to quickly resolve this issue," a Binance Spokesperson told Cointelegraph.The men were detained after a magistrate court in Abuja received a criminal complaint against them. Related: Binance says it trained investigators in Nigeria under government cooperationThe court allowed the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to hold the two individuals for 14 days. It further mandated that Binance give the Nigerian government access to data and details of Nigerian traders using its platform. However, after Binance refused to comply with the court decision, the court extended the detention of the officials for an additional 14 days to prevent the tampering of evidence. The Nigerian government has taken strict measures against individuals and organizations involved with terrorist financing and money laundering linked to the Binance crypto exchange. According to government reports, the Binance exchange has been used to launder nearly $21 billion.Magazine: Is measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024? Big Questions

Bitcoin Exchange Binance Decided to Reduce Its Support for This Network! USDC Deposits on the Network Have Been Suspended! - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a move that mirrors Circle's recent decision, Binance announced its decision to discontinue support for USD Coin (USDC) deposits and withdrawals via the Tron (TRC20) network, effective April 5, 2024 at 05:00.
Binance Announces Suspension of USDC Deposit and Withdrawal Support via Tron Network
This decision comes in response to Circle's announcement to discontinue USDC support on the Tron network, prompting Binance to regulate its services accordingly.


Starting from the specified date and time, USDC token deposits via TRC20 will no longer be credited to users' accounts on Binance. This development shows that Binance's ecosystem is moving away from TRC20-based transactions for USDC.

Despite this change, users will still be able to trade USDC on the Binance platform, ensuring continued access to the popular stablecoin.





More importantly, USDC deposits and withdrawals via other supported networks will not be affected by this decision, and users will be offered alternative channels to manage their USDC holdings on Binance.
This move underlines Binance's commitment to adapting its offerings in line with market developments and user preferences, ensuring a seamless and efficient trading experience for its global user base.

Can Ethereum Break Through $4,000 Amid SEC Scrutiny? - Coin Edition


							

An analyst has asserted that ETH remains on track to reclaim the $4,000 mark.



The conclusion emerged from a bullish pattern observed on ETH’s four-hour candlestick.



However, Ethereum is reportedly under the SEC’s scrutiny, dimming the prospects for $4k.




Market Watcher Captain Faibik has argued that Ethereum (ETH) could be on a path to reclaim the lost $4,000 price amid a potential regulatory hurdle. In a recent analysis of ETH’s trajectory on X, Faibik disclosed that the $4,000 target has become evident.



The analyst reached this conclusion after observing ETH’s established candlestick patterns in the four-hour timeframe. Specifically, he observed a bullish breakout through a descending wedge pattern, a known technical formation that marks the end of an asset’s consolidation phase. Accordingly, the analyst declared that the $4,000 threshold for Ethereum is on the horizon.







At press time, ETH trades at $3,468, having increased by 4.3% over the past 24 hours. Interestingly, the asset only needs a 15.34% rally to reclaim the $4K threshold. Meanwhile, Ethereum traded at $4,067 early this month, one of its peak points in 2021. While the Bitcoin market correction caused Ethereum’s price to dip below the threshold, ETH witnessed more pronounced declines within the last seven days.



In particular, ETH crashed to as low as $3,070 on March 20 following reports of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) working silently to classify the asset as a security. The reports suggest that the SEC has requested financial records from U.S. companies involved in transactions with the Ethereum Foundation. 









Notably, the regulatory body has not issued an official statement regarding this development at the time of press. However, the revelation has elicited diverse reactions among notable figures.



For instance, Anatoly Yakovenko, the founder of Solana, remarked, “If the state is against Ethereum, then I am against the state.”



Additionally, pundits see the development potentially impacting the regulator’s decision on the pending applications for Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a widely awaited approval that they believe will further impact ETH’s price. Besides, the SEC has just deferred its decision on Grayscale Futures ETF.

                        SOL has jumped by over 6% in the past 24 hours, with the Solana price rising to $186 on a day when the market as a whole has recovered by 3%.Today’s lift means that SOL is still down by 7.5% in a week, yet it sits on a 25% gain in a fortnight and an 83% increase in the last 30 days.The coin has also ballooned by 800% in the past year, making it the best-performing top-20 coin of this period.And with the market looking as though it’s about to bounce back after a short-term correction, the Solana price could rally considerably in the coming weeks and months.Solana Price Prediction as SOL Bounces 6.7% – New Rally Starting?
SOL’s chart has reached a point where the token is ready for a recovery breakout, with its indicators moving in positive directions.Its 30-day average (yellow) flipped its 200-day average (blue) this morning, forming a golden cross that often signals stroke rallies to new levels.Source: TradingViewIt’s in this context that SOL’s relative strength index (purple) is also suggesting bullish things, with its level rising from 30 at the end of last week to nearly 70 today.This suggests strong buying pressure, with a level of 70 allowing for further gains before the coin enters decidedly overbought territory.What’s also interesting is that Solana’s trading volume has risen from $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in just under 24 hours.This is potentially a signal that big volume is about to return to the token, with the past few days witnessing several big SOL transfers.SOL undoubtedly remains one of the most in-demand alts in the market, which will help the coin push to new heights as it regains its momentum from earlier in the month and from February.There are a number of factors that could help boost the market and, by extension, the Solana price.These include an improving macroeconomic picture (in particular a softening Federal Reserve), hopes of Ethereum ETFs, and the upcoming Bitcoin halving.Solana will benefit more than many other alts during any market surge, given its strong fundamental position.Its TVL now stands at $4.4 billion, with its 1,500% increase in the past year following from spikes in NFT and meme coin usage on its network.Its price could therefore continue to rise steadily in the near future, potentially reaching $200 in a couple of weeks and $250 by the summer.Diversification into New Low-Cap Alts
SOL is undoubtedly one of the major altcoins to watch this year, yet traders can widen their exposure to upside by diversifying their portfolios into smaller cap alts as well as bigger tokens.There are numerous highly promising new tokens in the market right now, with several presale coins looking particularly good as they prepare to list.For example, Green Bitcoin (GBTC) is an ERC-20 token that has raised over $8 million in its sale, which is entering its final stretch.Styled as an environmentally friendly version of Bitcoin (BTC), Green Bitcoin has the same hard cap of 21 million tokens that has helped to make BTC the biggest cryptocurrency.Yet it adds an environmentally friendly twist on this deflationary formula, in that it operates on the proof-of-stake Ethereum blockchain, which is much less energy intensive.It also enables staking, meaning that the coin may become even more deflationary than BTC itself, since holders will be locking their tokens up for long periods.What’s interesting about Green Bitcoin’s staking model is that it offers a unique predict-to-earn form of staking, which invites stakers to predict future BTC price movements.If they predict correctly they receive greater rewards, something which should incentivize more staking.So because of the hard cap and strong staking incentives, the GBTC price could rally substantially and sustainably once it lists.Investors can buy it as part of the its presale by visiting the official Green Bitcoin website, where 1 GBTC costs $1.1062.This the final price before the sale ends, so interested traders are advised to act quickly, otherwise they may miss out on one of the biggest launches of 2024.Visit Green Bitcoin Now

Shiba Inu Takes Over The Internet: Google Searches Climb as Global Interest Surges


                            Shiba Inu (SHIB), the self-proclaimed “Dogecoin Killer,” is back in the spotlight with a surge in both search interest and token price. Google Trends data reveals a global increase in searches for “Shiba Inu” and related queries, indicating renewed investor optimism for the meme coin.

Shiba Inu Surge Sparks Enthusiasm
This increase comes after a quiet period for the memecoin. However, the past month has been nothing short of phenomenal. Search popularity reached a seven-day peak of 100 on March 16th, though it has settled at a still-healthy 48 – significantly higher than January’s levels. Phrases like “Why is Shiba Inu going up?” and “Shiba Inu All-Time High” have also seen a significant uptick, reflecting investor curiosity and potential buying interest.
While the interest is global, specific regions are leading the charge. Pakistan, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Canada, and Nigeria have emerged as the top search originators for SHIB in the past week. This geographically diverse interest suggests a broad-based appeal for the meme coin.

Source: Google Trends
This renewed interest coincides with a remarkable price rally. SHIB’s value has skyrocketed over 180% in the past month, reaching a two-year high of $0.000045. This bullish run fueled speculation of a retest of its all-time high above $0.000088. However, the market has since witnessed a correction, bringing SHIB’s price down slightly.
Despite the correction, the enthusiasm within the Shiba Inu community remains high. The long-term goal of reaching $0.01 per SHIB token continues to be a hot topic, although analysts caution it might take several years to materialize.

Bitcoin is now trading at $66.780. Chart: TradingView
Shibarium And Market Recovery
To achieve this ambitious target, the developers are focusing on Shibarium, the project’s Layer-2 scaling solution. Shibarium aims to become a thriving smart contract hub, potentially attracting more users and driving up demand for SHIB.
Experts believe several factors are contributing to the current Shiba Inu frenzy. The broader cryptocurrency market has shown signs of recovery after a recent slump, potentially boosting investor confidence in meme coins like SHIB.
Additionally, ongoing developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as Shibarium and the burning initiatives to reduce the overall token supply, might be fueling investor optimism.

Whether SHIB can maintain its current momentum and reach its long-term price goals remains to be seen. However, the recent surge in search interest and price rally is a clear indication that the “Dogecoin Killer” is back in the game, attempting to capture the hearts (and wallets) of memecoin enthusiasts worldwide.

Robert Kiyosaki says he’s buying more Bitcoin in March; Here’s why


With Bitcoin (BTC) back on its bullish path and even more gains excepted after its April halving, Robert Kiyosaki, the famous investor and author of the bestselling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ said he would be buying more of the maiden cryptocurrency in March.
Specifically, Kiyosaki explained that he was buying “10 more Bitcoin before April” when the halving is happening, adding that he expected the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset to hit the price of $100,000 by September 2024, as per his X post on March 25.
Furthermore, as he pointed out:



“If you can’t afford a whole Bitcoin, you may want to consider buying 1/10 of a coin, via the new ETFs or Satoshis. (…) Almost everyone in the world can afford at least one silver coin or one Bitcoin Satoshi.”

Indeed, the finance educator was referring to the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved earlier this year, marking an important step for the crypto sector and its acceptance in the mainstream.
‘Poor’ save fiat currency, Bitcoin is ‘smart money’
Moreover, Kiyosaki advised heeding the words of Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy and prominent Bitcoin advocate, and his views, particularly those shared in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, in which he referred to people saving fiat currency as “poor.”
As for those who prefer to stay out of Bitcoin, the ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ author has a solution: “silver coins, preferably US silver eagles,” as it is “the most affordable for the most people” of the three “smart money” assets that, in his opinion, include Bitcoin, gold, and silver.

“Because the ‘smart money’ knows the US is the biggest debtor nation in the world; China’s property market is ‘toast;’ Japan has been in a depression since 1990; Germany is sliding into a depression, mom and pop consumer are living on credit cards; banks are in trouble; and the world is on the brink of war.”

Robert Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin price prediction
It is also worth mentioning that Robert Kiyosaki has earlier shared his Bitcoin price prediction according to which he saw the original crypto asset as changing hands at a price of $100,000 by June this year, indicating his exceptionally bullish sentiment around it.
However, he later increased his Bitcoin price target for 2024 to a whopping $300,000 in the context of the recent crypto sector rally that saw its largest asset by market capitalization soar to nearly $74,000 and surpass its previous all-time high (ATH) from 2021.
Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin at press time stood at $66,872, recording a 2.49% gain on the day, dropping 1.29% across the previous week, and making an advance of 31.27% on its monthly chart, according to the most recent data retrieved by Finbold on March 25.

Tron (TRX) Price Notes First Downtrend Since August 2023


The Tron (TRX) price took a downturn towards the end of February, just as most of the crypto market began trending upwards, with many even marking new all-time highs.
This bearishness will likely continue going forward as trend indicators signal a drawdown for the altcoin.
Tron Price Downtrend Begins
Tron price was noting a potential rise over the past week, which failed to trigger a recovery for the asset. The ongoing decline has considerably impacted the overall growth of the crypto asset and the network. 
The project is losing traction among users, which can be observed by the fall in the number of users on the network. Weekly average users have taken a hit in the past two weeks, falling by 10% from 5.79 million to 5.25 million.

Additionally, a chunk of the TRX supply is awaiting a profit trigger, which, by its looks, will not take place anytime soon. About 1.36 billion TRX bought within the $0.1165 to $0.1205 range is hanging in uncertainty and might fall back into the loss-bearing territory.

This is because all signals point towards potential decline, which would turn the aforementioned price range into a resistance zone.

TRX Price Prediction: One Downtrend Ends, Another Begins
Tron’s price is trading at $0.1174 at the time of writing after failing to breach the barrier marked at $0.1219. The decline, while seemingly halted, is potentially set to continue going forward. This is because the crypto asset that has been trading below the Ichimoku Cloud is now noting a confirmed downtrend.
The Ichimoku Cloud is a technical analysis tool that indicates support, resistance, trend direction, and momentum. Generally, when the price is below the cloud, bearish outcomes are possible; however, as the cloud turns bearish, the asset is expected to trade further lower.
Such is the case with Tron price as well since the Ichimoku Cloud turned red over the last 48 hours. This is a signal confirming a downtrend for TRX, making this the first such instance in seven months since August 2023.

Thus, Tron’s price could note a further decline, potentially sending it to test the support level of $0.1123.

On the other hand, Ichimoku Cloud is known to be a leading indicator, and given the recent attempt at recovery, TRX might stabilize for a while. If so, Tron’s price could observe consolidation and continue moving sideways, potentially breaching $0.1219, invalidating the bearish thesis.

Real-World Assets Exchange Launches US Treasury Bill Tokens


DigiFT recently unveiled its latest offering in the form of US Treasury Bill depository receipt tokens. This innovation introduces direct beneficial ownership in US Treasury Bills to the blockchain. 
The significance of this launch lies in its approach to solving a longstanding issue within Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization—the challenge of legally and accurately representing ownership and interest.
US Treasury Bill Tokens Now on Real-World Assets Exchange
The concept of depositary receipts has a rich history in facilitating international investment, dating back to their inception in the 1920s. Traditionally, these instruments enabled investors to access foreign markets with relative ease. Adapting this established structure, DigiFT aims to address the legal representation of token holders’ interests in Real-World Assets.
Currently, the market is saturated with wrapped tokens, which often come entangled in legal frameworks that obscure direct ownership. This can pose significant hurdles for investors seeking to navigate the implications of their investments. By contrast, DigiFT’s deployment of depository receipt tokens offers a clear, legally coherent framework. 
This model simplifies investment comprehension and ensures investors have a direct claim on the returns of the underlying assets.

Read more: What is The Impact of Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization?
Henry Zhang, Founder and CEO of DigiFT, highlighted the importance of the DR structure. It helps address market needs, particularly in terms of direct ownership and return on investment. 

“DigiFT’s innovative DR structure addresses a pain point in the current RWA market, empowering investors with direct ownership of underlying assets and returns. Looking ahead, DigiFT remains committed to expanding the universe of traditional financial assets in the Web3 space through the DR model, offering better investor protection and transparency,” Zhang said. 


As the first licensed Real-World Assets exchange, DigiFT merges deep financial insights with advanced technological capabilities. The newly launched US Treasury Tokens (DRUST) are emblematic of this fusion, providing a regulated, blockchain-based option for managing treasury and cash flows. Highly liquid US Treasury Bills directly back these tokens, which appeal to a broad spectrum of institutional investors.

These Are Last Week's Top Performers as Bitcoin (BTC) Eyes $67K (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin recovered most of the recent price falls in the past 12 hours or so, and the asset has gained more than five grand since the Friday low.
Several altcoins have outperformed it, with SOL nearing $190, while NEAR and ICP have soared by double digits.
BTC’s Recovery
Last week didn’t go all that well for the primary cryptocurrency. It all started with a price drop on Monday that pushed the asset south hard. The landscape worsened on Tuesday with a drop below $61,000 amid fears of the upcoming US FOMC meeting.
Once that took place and the Fed didn’t pivot from its current monetary policy, Bitcoin went on a roll and soared by about seven grand in the next day or so. However, that didn’t last long, and BTC started losing ground on Thursday and Friday, culminating in a price drop to $62,500.
The weekend saw a recovery attempt that was halted at $66,000. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency started gaining traction once again this morning, soaring to $67,500 for the first time in days.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


As of now, the asset has lost some value and sits inches below $67,000. Still, its market cap has reclaimed the $1.3 trillion level, and its dominance over the alts is up slightly to 49.3%.

Last Week’s Top Performers
On a daily scale, SOL, AVAX, TON, BCH, NEAR, OP, and ICP have gained the most value. ICP stands in a league of its own with a massive 23% surge.
The situation on a weekly scale is slightly different for some, though. SOL, for example, is down by 7%, and so is AVAX. DOT, TRX, ADA, and ETH are also in the red.
In contrast, Toncoin has jumped by more than 35%. ONDO has trumped all other top 100 assets by charting a 92% surge that has pushed its price above $0.9.
The total crypto market cap has regained some of the recently lost value and stands above $2.650 trillion.

Bitcoin (BTC) Looking for a Breakout, Ripple (XRP) Adoption on the Rise, SHIB Price Predictions: Bits Recap March 25


																TL;DR

Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded from the previously ongoing correction, gaining 3.3% in the past 24 hours and briefly exceeding $67,500.
Ripple’s XRP received increased support from several cryptocurrency exchanges ahead of a promising trial with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggled recently, but analysts remain optimistic about a future rally, highlighting significant opportunities and resistance levels that have been overcome.



Is BTC Gearing up for a Massive Rally?
Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed a slight price decline at the end of last week, dropping below $63,000 over the weekend. However, the bulls took the offense today (March), bringing the asset to green territory. The primary cryptocurrency is up 3.3% on a 24-hour scale, briefly crossing the $67,500 mark.
BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko
Numerous experts believe the following months will be quite eventful for BTC’s valuation, based on important upcoming events like the halving. 
The event, which occurs roughly every four years, reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, thus making the asset scarcer and potentially more valuable in the future. Historically, it has been a precursor of a major bull run for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Those willing to learn more about it, feel free to check our video below:




VIDEO
Another factor that might positively impact BTC’s price in the near future is a possible pivot from the Federal Reserve on its anti-inflationary policy. America’s central bank hinted about cutting the interest rates at some point this year, which could result in increased investor interest in riskier assets such as Bitcoin. Recall that the Fed kept the benchmark unchanged after their most recent FOMC meeting.
XRP Gains More Support
Despite not experiencing any significant price spikes recently, Ripple’s XRP has become the subject of adoption from numerous cryptocurrency exchanges. The latest spree was started by the US-based Atlantis Exchange, which introduced trading services with the asset on March 17.
Shortly after, BitMEX joined the club, allowing users to deposit, convert, and trade the cryptocurrency on BitMEX Spot. The company also described the XRP Ledger as “a faster, more energy-efficient alternative to the Bitcoin blockchain.”
Bitrue also hopped on the bandwagon, opening eight new XRP base spot trading pairs. Some of those include XRP/SHIB, XRP/PEPE, and XRP/BONK. 
The recent wave of support comes a month before the trial between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm seemingly has the upper hand, securing three partial court wins last year. 
SHIB Forecasts
The popular meme coin recorded an impressive triple-digit increase last month but has been struggling to recover from the most recent market correction. Nonetheless, many analysts remain optimistic that another substantial rally is on the horizon.
The X user SHIB KNIGHT examined the token’s weekly performance, suggesting the asset’s price had surpassed an essential resistance level. They envisioned new peaks for SHIB should investors continue accumulating at the same pace. 
Xanrox – an analyst on TradingView – was even more bullish, predicting that Shiba Inu would “definitely” take off later this year. 
“Right now, we need to catch the bounce and ride the next wave to the upside. The 0.618 FIB retracement seems to be a great level to buy Shiba Inu, which is at 0.00002249,” they added.

Volatility is Vitality: Michael Saylor on Bitcoin


							

Michael Saylor pointed out that Bitcoin has outperformed all major investment options.



BTC has given a 432% ROI since August 10, 2020, while S&P 500 has given an ROI of 56%.



Saylor stated that “volatility is vitality” in an X post, highlighting the nature of Bitcoin. 




MicroStrategy’s former chief executive and Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, took to social media platform X to highlight the performance of Bitcoin (BTC) since August 10, 2020, and compare it with the ROIs of other investment options.



In the X post, Saylor highlighted that “Bitcoin is winning” while noting that the digital asset has gone up by 432% since August 10, 2020. At the same time, S&P 500 has given an ROI of 56%, while NASDAQ is up by only 50%. 



Meanwhile, gold gave only 7% returns since the mentioned time frame, while silver and bonds gave negative returns of -13% and -19%, respectively. 



Last week, Saylor stated that “Volatility is Vitality” in an X post, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s dynamic price movements are a part of the digital asset market’s fundamentals.



Notably, Saylor has been a huge Bitcoin bull since 2020, recently stating that Bitcoin represents the digital transformation of capital. The former MicroStrategy chief executive believes that Bitcoin’s price is driven by its major use case of “capital preservation and appreciation.” 



In March 2024, Bitcoin witnessed a price surge from $61,000 to a new all-time high above $73,000. At the time of writing, the price of the leading asset stands at $67,000, just below BTC’s previous ATH of $69,000. As per CoinMarketCap, the price of BTC is up almost 5% in the past 24 hours, while the trading volume is up 27.85%. The market capitalization of Bitcoin stands at $1.3 trillion, according to the data.

DigiFT Launches First US Treasury Bill Tokens for Direct Ownership on Blockchain | Coinspeaker



For the crypto industry, DigiFT is the first firm to launch the first D.R. tokens linked directly to the US treasury bill. 

Interest in depository receipt (D.R.) tokens is on the rise. DigiFT is the latest to join the trend, offering customers the opportunity to access the United States Treasury Bill directly on the blockchain.
In an official announcement on Monday, March 25, the company introduced the first-ever Treasury Bill depository receipt tokens representing direct beneficial ownership of the underlying US Treasury Bill.




A Significant Milestone Achievement
The concept of introducing D.R. tokens to the financial markets began in the late 1920s when JPMorgan Chase unveiled the first American Depositary Receipt (ADR) to facilitate the trading of British retailer Selfridges shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
Since then, the use of depository receipts has gained momentum with the introduction of Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) in the 1990s by international banks to cater to investors outside the United States.
Companies in different sectors are also using the concept to offer their customers access to other financial products unavailable in their ecosystem.
However, for the crypto industry, DigiFT is the first firm to launch the first D.R. tokens linked directly to the US treasury bill.
The move marks a significant milestone in the progression of blockchain-based finance, providing increased accessibility, transparency, and investor empowerment within the real-world asset ownership sector.
Backed by AA+ rated Short-term US Treasury Bills
The new offering is the first of a series available under the D.R. structure, DigiFT US Treasury Tokens (DRUST). Each digital asset is backed by AA+-rated, highly liquid, short-term US Treasury Bills.
According to the announcement, the product is tailor-made for stablecoin issuers, Web3 product developers, and managers seeking regulatory-compliant treasury and cash management solutions.
The tokens are also available to institutional and accredited investors worldwide through their authorized self-custodial wallets using fiat currencies and stablecoins.
The company, based in Singapore, said the D.R. tokens are designed in compliance with existing regulations to safeguard investors’ rights and protection on-chain. Unlike existing Real World Assets (RWAs), the product offers a straightforward legal framework.
DigiFT to Bring More Traditional Financial Products to Blockchain
The products are also designed to tackle the current legal challenges facing RWAs on the blockchain. According to DigiFT, DRUST aims to address the lack of a clear regulatory framework enabling tokens to accurately represent the direct beneficial interest of token holders in the underlying asset while facilitating settlement on-chain.
The company also plans to expand its business offerings in the future by bringing more traditional finance products into the crypto market through the D.R. model.
“DigiFT’s innovative D.R. structure addresses a pain point in the current RWA market, empowering investors with direct ownership of underlying assets and returns. Looking ahead, DigiFT remains committed to expanding the universe of traditional financial assets in the Web3 space through the D.R. model, offering better investor protection and transparency,” Henry Zhang, the CEO of DigiFT.

What is Macro/Crypto Summer? Don't Miss Out, Says Expert


                            In a thread on X (formerly Twitter), Raoul Pal, a renowned trading guru and the founder/CEO of Global Macro Investor and Real Vision, has illuminated the crypto community about the advent of what he terms as the “Macro/Crypto Summer.” This period, according to Pal, is not just a fleeting season but a significant phase in the financial and cryptocurrency markets, deeply rooted in the cyclical nature of the global economy.
Why The Macro/Crypto Summer Matters
Pal elaborates on the concept of the “Macro Summer,” explaining it as a pivotal phase in “The Everything Code” cycle, closely following the Financial Conditions Index, which historically precedes the cycle by approximately ten months. The ISM (Institute for Supply Management) index, a key indicator of economic health, often bottoms out during this period, marking the start of GDP growth.

Pal’s thesis draws attention to the “near-perfect 3 1/2 year cyclicality” in the ISM business cycle, propelled by liquidity dynamics and the debt refinancing cycle at its core. He underscores the significance of liquidity: “And that is driven by liquidity, which bottomed at the end of 2022… macro summer and fall are all about liquidity rising and is a core part of The Everything Code thesis.”

This influx of liquidity is crucial for tech stocks, which historically thrive during these phases. Yet, it’s Bitcoin and, more broadly, the cryptocurrency market that exhibit the most dramatic responses. Pal presents staggering growth figures from past Macro Summer and Fall seasons to underscore his point:

Bitcoin: Saw increases of “2012/2013: +146x, 2016/2017: +30x, 2020/2021: +8x…”
Ethereum: As an altcoin during the 2016/2017 and 2020/2021 cycles, it achieved “2016/2017: +1,770x, 2020/2021: +41x.”
Altcoins (excluding ETH): Witnessed an aggregate market cap rise of “+24x” in the last cycle.

“Wild! When we just look at Altcoins ex-ETH (we only have shorter data for the last cycle), the entire market cap rose +24x! And that includes thousands of worthless tokens that didn’t rise, so I’m not just cherry-picking winners here,” Pal remarked.

DOGE, a popular meme coin, is mentioned by the expert as another prime example of the “power of Crypto Summer and Fall,” with its value experiencing significant multipliers – “2016/2017: +136x, 2020/2021: +370x” – in the aforementioned cycles.
These figures underline the significant influence of macroeconomic cycles on crypto valuations, with Pal pointing out the alignment of these cycles with Bitcoin’s halving events. “Crypto summer has started and fully develops post-halving,” he states, highlighting the interconnectedness of these cycles with the broader financial landscape.

Notably, Pal’s analysis doesn’t stop at the past; it looks forward, suggesting that liquidity is expected to rise all the way into the end of 2025. This anticipation is rooted in a complex interplay of global financial mechanisms, including the potential for increased US money printing in response to a massive ramp-up in interest payments and changes in Fed Net Liquidity and the Treasury General Account (TGA).
“Will the US join the summer party? […] I know it seems impossible now, but the US is on the verge of a massive ramp-up in interest payments. […] at some point – the balance sheet will stop shrinking, which is enough to unleash liquidity into the system. […] I cannot see how they don’t massively expand liquidity, one way or another.
Meanwhile, Pal predicts that it won’t be just the US injecting liquidity into the financial systems in the coming months. “I’ve no idea whether it’s China, the EU, Japan or the US that drives this or maybe a bit of all. Time will tell,” he remarked.
GMI total liquidity index projection | Source: X @RaoulGMI
Pal attributes his investment strategies, especially in tech and crypto, to the insights gained from The Everything Code. This approach has prepared him for the unfolding Macro Summer, with a keen eye on the altcoin market and the so-called “Banana Zone.” He concludes:
But the bigger game is yet to be played out as Alt season arrives and we fully enter the Banana Zone. The Banana Zone cometh, and it is a huge wealth-generating machine. Patience will be rewarded. In the meantime, don’t fuck this up. #DFTU

This leading Bitcoin Mining Nation Aims to Shift Focus Elsewhere


In a significant shift that may redefine its economic landscape, Iceland is contemplating a move away from its burgeoning Bitcoin mining sector. The country will address more pressing concerns related to food security and energy sustainability. 
Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir voiced her apprehensions about the nation’s energy consumption patterns. Especially in light of the increasing demands from the cryptocurrency mining industry.
Bitcoin Mining Threatens Iceland’s Sustainability, PM Warns
Iceland, nestled atop the Mid-Atlantic ridge, is a haven for Bitcoin miners, thanks to its abundant renewable energy resources. The country’s vast reserves of hydro and geothermal energy have made it an attractive destination for data centers dedicated to the energy-intensive process of Bitcoin mining. 
However, this has led to an unprecedented surge in energy consumption. Currently, the country consumes about 120 MW of power, making it the most Bitcoin-mining-dense region globally.

The Prime Minister expressed concerns over the sustainability of this energy consumption, especially considering the adverse impacts on other vital sectors like agriculture. 

“Data centers in Iceland use a significant share of our green energy,” Jakobsdóttir remarked, 

This revelation comes at a time when the global balance of Bitcoin mining is experiencing a shift. New players are continuously entering the mining scene. Thanks to its cheap electricity and entrepreneurial spirit, Iceland, once a pioneer in industrial-scale Bitcoin mining, is now reevaluating its stance in light of broader economic and environmental considerations.

The island’s alarming reliance on imports for basic food staples underscores the decision. With only 1% of grains and 43% of vegetables produced domestically. Jakobsdóttir’s proposed pivot towards bolstering food production signifies a strategic redirection of Iceland’s renewable energy resources to support more sustainable and essential sectors. This will ensure energy security for households and industries beyond crypto mining.
Crypto Mining Industry Prepares for Post-Halving Shake-Up
This strategic shift is reflective of a broader trend within the crypto-mining industry. Which is bracing for significant changes after the anticipated Bitcoin halving event in April. Industry experts, including Marathon Digital Holdings CEO Fred Thiel, have warned of the impending financial pressures on smaller miners. Which could lead to a consolidation in favor of larger players with more robust financial backing.

“Post halving I think you’ll see the smaller miners come under financial stress, which will enable the bigger miners to consolidate the industry,” Thiel stated.

In navigating a crucial change, Iceland views its shift as more than just a way to secure energy and food. It’s also a sign of its dedication to sustainable growth.

Hence, Iceland is redirecting its renewable energy from crypto mining to vital fields such as agriculture. This move showcases Iceland’s ability to merge tech progress with eco-friendly practices and economic stability.

Next-Gen Blockchain Breakthroughs: L2 Projects to Watch | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin’s value could rise after its next halving. Experts think it might go up a lot. This event makes people look at new blockchain updates. These updates, called L2 projects, are the next big step for blockchains. They make things faster and safer. Our article looks at these exciting projects on the rise.BlastUP Presale Hits $2.5 Million: Anticipating the Next Big Thing in CryptoBlastUP, the premier launchpad on Blast, has recently made a splash in the crypto world with its head-spinning debut, raising  $2.5 million in a few weeks. The number of early investors who have already recognized BlastUP’s high potential is growing exponentially.BlastUP is poised to reach roaring success, with plans to empower Web3 tools with AI innovation for fast and quality startup launches.

In the short term, if momentum continues, pushing past the nearest resistance level of $1.08 might not be a far reach. Considering its current price of $0.8172, and recent one-month increase, Mantle could potentially test the second resistance level at $1.27. However, if it fails to maintain this upward movement, the price might retract towards the nearest support level of $0.6339.Looking long-term, Mantle has established a considerable increase, which could attract more interest. If it builds upon this performance, sustaining the rise could introduce a new support level closer to its current price, minimizing risks of a significant drop. Nonetheless, with any investment, uncertainties exist. Market dynamics could shift, and if sentiment changes, the price could slide towards the second support level of $0.3739, reaffirming the need for cautious optimism in the evolving landscape.Polygon Value’s Trend and Future OutlookIn the recent month, Polygon’s value has grown by about 4.63%, showing a stable upward trend which could continue pushing prices towards the first resistance at $1.13. If this momentum holds, it might not be long until we see a retest of the second resistance level at $1.27. Investors should watch if the current price of $0.99 can maintain above the 100-day average of $0.92, which could signal continued growth. However, should the price fall, there’s substantial support near $0.81, and even more at $0.63, which could provide buying opportunities but might also indicate a trend reversal if broken.Over the past six months, Polygon has soared impressively by nearly 94%, suggesting a strong long-term potential. But, to reach or even surpass its all-time high of $3.003, sustained buyer interest and market support are needed. Long-term risks include potential declines below current and near-term support levels, which might cause uncertainty. On the upside, maintaining above the 10-day moving average of $1.04 could further solidify the bullish outlook, encouraging new investments and possibly initiating a push towards earlier peaks, fostering a positive long-term scenario for Polygon.ConclusionIn conclusion, while other L2 projects like Mantle and Polygon have shown potential for growth and offer exciting prospects for the crypto community, BlastUP stands out with its remarkable presale success and robust integration within the expansive Blast ecosystem. Its forward-thinking approach, marrying AI with Web3 services, sets a strong foundation for its role as a leading launchpad platform. BlastUP not only promises a unique combination of benefits for its users but also exemplifies the innovative spirit driving the blockchain industry forward. Given its ambitious plans and the ecosystem it inhabits, BlastUP may indeed hold the highest potential among its peers.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Cheatsheet: Ethereum and L2s on track to beat Bitcoin for active addresses - Blockworks


This is Cheatsheet, a primer on what you should know about crypto today.
There are times in every market cycle where stuff just goes up because bitcoin isn’t going down.
Today is one of those days. Internet computer (ICP) is the best performing crypto at the top end of the table, gaining 20%. 
The pupper with the woolly hat (WIF) is close behind with a 16% bounce. WIF spent most of the past week in the red after a healthy 30% retracement, and is still one of the worst performing top-100 cryptocurrencies over the past seven days.
Cryptocurrencies for alt blockchains Quant (QNT), NEAR and TON (TON) are close behind, with between 15% and 11% over the past day. 
Ondo DAO (ONDO), the governance token for the treasury-focused DeFi protocol Flux Finance, is somewhere in the middle, having gained 13.4% across the past 24 hours and a healthy 86% over the past week.
Bitcoin (BTC) at $67,000 is otherwise up 2.1% to ether’s (ETH) 1.4%. eCash (XEC), ronin (RON) and stacks (STX) are the worst of the front-page, each slipping between 6.5% and 4.2% today as of 9:15 am ET.
On-chain mail
Polygon PoS has eclipsed Ethereum mainnet for monthly active unique addresses for the first time ever — but the latter’s layer-2s are together pulling in even more.

Polygon PoS’s active unique addresses hit 6.24 million in February to Ethereum’s 5.89 million (three-month moving average).
Ethereum plus its four major layer-2s’ average hit 13.73 million last month to Bitcoin’s 13.98 million.
zkSync is the most popular Ethereum layer-2 with a moving average 27% higher than Arbitrum (3.12 million to 2.45 million).

Bitcoin has always had far more unique active addresses than Ethereum. Five years ago, in 2019, Bitcoin had nearly four times as many: 12.2 million to 3.2 million.
Ethereum mainnet’s unique active addresses more than doubled over the next two years. The network’s count has however been shrinking ever since it peaked at 7.57 million in June 2021, around the top of the previous bull market.
All growth has instead shifted to popular layer-2s Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and zkSync, which have altogether seen more active addresses per month than Ethereum mainnet since July last year.

If their current growth continues, there will soon be more active addresses on Ethereum and its layer-2s than Bitcoin.
Polygon PoS is often mislabeled as a layer-2 network for Ethereum. It’s functionally its own layer-1 network with a unique set of validators.
Bitcoin’s average monthly active addresses has grown only 13% in five years.



The Ethereum ecosystem has recorded a large uptick in growth since mid-2022
Crypto business
Bitcoin is quiet. But perhaps a little too quiet. Crypto stocks have inched higher but it doesn’t exactly feel like they’ve earned those gains.

Almost every crypto stock opened higher this morning, led by miner Cipher Mining and bitcoin hoarder MicroStrategy, up 7.14% and 6.57% on Friday’s close as of 9:35 am ET.
Griid is down 9.3% after a rollercoaster end to last week, which saw a sudden 40% pump only to lose it all within the same session.
Cipher Mining is the best performing mining stock over the past month, now up 50%.

Bitcoin has decoupled from tech stocks over the past two weeks. BTC’s 30-day correlation with QQQ — which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 — hit 68% on March 14, per TradingView. At the time, both QQQ and bitcoin hovered around their respective all-time highs.
Now, bitcoin is only 10% correlated with the cubes and could soon return to inverse territory. Bitcoin has often traded with negative correlation with tech stocks over the past year, after spending most of 2022 trading more in tandem.
Coinbase’s correlation with tech stocks hit its lowest point ever last month, sinking as low as -65%. It has since swung back up to 68% over the past week.
Read more: Coinbase announces offering of $1B in convertible notes

COIN and bitcoin are meanwhile trading practically in tandem: 94% correlation, its highest point since January 2022.
Coinbase is currently worth $63.69 billion — around $400 million less than Nintendo but slightly higher than Monster Beverage.
All bitcoin mining stocks are worth $23.46 billion (about the same as Vodafone), up nearly three times since November.

Cathie Wood on Bitcoin's Surge to $1.5M: ARK's Vision for 2030 | Cryptoglobe


                                
DeFi Technologies subsidiary, Reflexivity Research, hosted its inaugural Bitcoin Investor Day in New York City on March 22, 2024. The event aimed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the transformative power of Bitcoin. Anthony Pompliano, Reflexivity’s co-founder, moderated discussions featuring industry leaders like Cathie Wood, Anthony Scaramucci, and Mike Novogratz, who explored Bitcoin’s evolving role in both individual and institutional investment strategies.



According to a report by CoinDesk, during a fireside chat at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference, Cathie Wood, who is the ARK Invest CEO and CIO, shared her insights on Bitcoin, describing it as a “financial super highway.” It is worth noting that ARK Invest launched the ARKB, a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), in the U.S. on January 11.



Wood highlighted the current macroeconomic environment, noting the shockwaves sent through global markets by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes. She pointed out the particular impact on countries like Nigeria, which has seen a rapid adoption of Bitcoin in response to the country’s currency depreciation. This scenario, according to Wood, positions Bitcoin as both a hedge against risk (a risk-off asset) and an investment opportunity (a risk-on asset).



The conversation touched on the broader implications of Bitcoin’s adoption worldwide, especially in emerging markets where traditional financial systems face challenges. 



While she refrained from providing a new price target for Bitcoin, she recalled her previous prediction of a $1.5 million price point, suggesting a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency’s future.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Back in January, during a conversation on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Wood delved into Bitcoin’s prospects with co-anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin.



Wood, renowned for her insightful predictions in tech and finance, reiterated ARK Invest’s optimistic outlook on Bitcoin. She cited the “Big Ideas” report by ARK Invest, which lays out the critical factors behind their Bitcoin valuation forecast. The report presents a scenario where Bitcoin might hit approximately $600,000. More strikingly, Wood pointed out that their more optimistic scenario, now more likely following the U.S. SEC’s nod to several spot Bitcoin ETFs, anticipates Bitcoin’s value reaching $1.5 million by 2030.



Wood discussed Bitcoin’s importance, portraying it as history’s inaugural global, decentralized, digital, and rule-based monetary system. She conveyed that Bitcoin ushers in a significant transformation in the worldwide financial landscape.



When asked if Bitcoin needs to transition from an asset to a recognized currency to attain these valuations, Wood confirmed such a shift. She referenced ARK’s inaugural analysis of Bitcoin in 2015, still accessible on their website, which examined Bitcoin’s capacity to meet money’s three classic functions: a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. Wood’s analysis confirmed Bitcoin’s capability to fulfill these roles.



Exploring the nexus between artificial intelligence and Bitcoin, Wood mentioned a “Bitcoin Brainstorm” session held with their partner, Bitcoin Park in Nashville. This discussion explored how the amalgamation of AI and Bitcoin could transform the labor market, especially in terms of the gig economy in regions like Africa, where changes are already taking root.

Bitcoin (BTC) Started the Week with a Rise: Here are the Possible Reasons for the Rise - Bitcoin Sistemi

There was a rapid increase in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices as global markets embraced the beginning of the easing cycle of central banks.
More than $100 million in short selling occurred in the last 24 hours, indicating a significant change in sentiment in the cryptocurrency world.


As the Asian trading day began, both Bitcoin and Ethereum were in the green; BTC was trading at $67,300, up 4.9%, while Ethereum was trading above $3,400, up 4.7%.

Analysts attribute this bullish trend to BlackRock's recent announcement of a fund targeting tokenized products on the Ethereum network called BUIDL.





Bradley Park, an analyst at CryptoQuant, suggests that the market has reacted positively to this development. However, the increase in prices came at a cost for short sellers.
Data from CoinGlass reveals that over $100 million in leveraged futures positions have been liquidated, with approximately $60 million in short BTC positions and $42.8 million in short Ethereum positions.


One factor contributing to Bitcoin's rise is the slowing selling pressure of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Analysts think Genesis' share sale may have facilitated the exit of GBTC, allowing Bitcoin to gain momentum.
At the macroeconomic level, the stage is set for further upward movement. Last week, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) unexpectedly lowered its benchmark interest rate, setting off a wave of global easing.





While the Central Bank of Mexico also cut interest rates, the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England also laid the groundwork for liquidity expansion in the coming months.
On the other hand, the dovish statements from the FED last week also helped the market recover.

Hospitality Worker Convicted in UK's Largest Bitcoin Money Laundering Case



                    


In a landmark case, Jian Wen, a former hospitality worker, has been convicted of money laundering in a UK court specializing in significant fraud cases, following the discovery of a staggering $2.5 billion in Bitcoin under her control. 



The Southwark Crown Court’s ruling came after a detailed investigation into Wen’s financial activities, which included the purchase of luxury properties and expensive jewelry. 




This investigation examined 48 electronic devices and thousands of files, many in Mandarin, the BBC reported.



Wen’s sudden shift in lifestyle from residing above a Chinese restaurant to renting a lavish six-bedroom house in North London, with a monthly rent of $21,420, signaled the authorities to her trail. 



Moreover, her attempt to buy a $30 million mansion in London was a critical lead that prompted further scrutiny by the officials, Cointelegraph noted.




Wen’s ambitious real estate ventures in London, coupled with her inability to pass money-laundering checks despite claiming substantial earnings from Bitcoin mining, raised suspicions.

The UK police branded the case as the largest Bitcoin seizure in the country, with Wen convicted for her involvement in a money laundering arrangement, awaiting sentencing on May 10.



Chief Crown Prosecutor Andrew Penhale stressed the growing use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in criminal operations, facilitating asset disguise and transfer by fraudsters. 



Contrary to the authorities’ stance on cryptocurrencies being widely used for money laundering, a recent US Treasury Department report argued that cash remains the preferred medium for such illicit activities, due to its anonymity and stability.



Adding to the discourse, Nasdaq’s “Global Financial Crime Report” shed light on the financial crime landscape, noting that approximately $3.1 trillion in illicit funds circulated through the global financial system in 2023. 



Interestingly, the report did not specifically mention Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, indicating a broader perspective on financial crime beyond the digital currency realm.

Are spot Bitcoin ETFs dying slowly? - What is going on? | Cryptopolitan

The cryptocurrency scene is currently witnessing an unexpected twist in the tale of Bitcoin ETFs, which had once enjoyed a meteoric rise in the financial markets. Following the green light from U.S. regulators for 11 new Bitcoin ETFs in January, there was a reversal of fortune this week as we saw a significant outflow of funds. Observers and investors alike are now on their toes, wondering if this $850 million departure is a mere hiccup or a forewarning of a deeper downturn in the world’s premier cryptocurrency. After a bullish run that saw Bitcoin’s value soar to a record $73,000, the recent price dip has seemingly doused the flames of investor enthusiasm. This week, Bitcoin’s price took a dive to as low as $60,760, causing many to second-guess their investment strategies. James Butterfill from CoinShares pointed out, “People have looked at how much the price of bitcoin has fallen and they’ve decided to hold off, nobody wants to catch a falling knife.”The Tug of War in ETF LandWhile BlackRock, the global leader in asset management, boasted inflows of $576 million this week, its competitors weren’t as fortunate, witnessing minimal new investments. However, Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF, which transitioned from a trust in January, is facing a stiff headwind due to its higher management fees, leading to sustained withdrawals. Ilan Solot of Marex chimed in, saying, “We’re approaching a dead zone for these ETF products where the initial frenzy of pent-up capital has come in already.”Adding another layer to this complex scenario is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April. This quadrennial occurrence, which cuts the miners’ rewards in half, is anticipated to have a long-term bullish impact on Bitcoin’s price, despite the current climate of uncertainty.A Battle of TitansIn the meantime, a fascinating race is unfolding between BlackRock and Grayscale. With BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF now holding 238,500 Bitcoins and enjoying daily inflows of around $274 million, it’s rapidly closing the gap on Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF, which currently holds an estimated 350,252 Bitcoins. The latter, however, has been experiencing daily outflows of roughly $277 million over the last fortnight.Should the current trend persist, BlackRock is poised to dethrone Grayscale as the world’s top institutional holder of Bitcoin by April 11. This forecasted shift has even caught the attention of crypto influencers like George Tung, who speculate that BlackRock’s ascendancy could occur within a mere two weeks.Interestingly, the GBTC experienced its largest daily outflow on record on March 18, totaling $643 million. Despite this, senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes that the tide of outflows, significantly influenced by the bankruptcies of crypto firms like Genesis and Digital Currency Group, could soon subside.Moreover, BlackRock’s recent overtaking of MicroStrategy in Bitcoin holdings marks another milestone in the ETF saga. Following an additional purchase of 9,000 Bitcoins on March 19, MicroStrategy now holds 214,246 Bitcoins, yet finds itself outpaced by BlackRock’s aggressive acquisition strategy.As we navigate through this tumultuous phase, the dynamics between inflows and outflows, along with the impending halving event, paint a picture of a sector at a crossroads. The Bitcoin ETF landscape is evolving, with each development offering a new perspective on the future of cryptocurrency investments.

Binance exec accused of tax evasion flees Nigeria during mosque visit


A Binance executive detained in Nigeria and accused of tax evasion offenses has fled the country, according to local media.
Nadeem Anjarwalla was detained with fellow Binance exec Tigran Gambaryan late last month shortly after Nigeria banned several crypto exchanges from operating in the country. It was announced today that the pair, along with Binance itself, were officially accused of four tax offenses by Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service.
The charges filed in the Abuja Federal High Court last Friday claim the defendants failed to submit tax returns, were complicit in helping users evade taxes while using the Binance platform, and failed to pay value-added tax (VAT) and company income tax. 
“Binance did not adhere to these requirements, thus violating Nigerian laws and potentially facing investigation and legal action for this infraction,” a statement from the state tax agency said.

According to local media reports, Anjarwalla fled the country last Friday using a Nigerian passport. He apparently escaped the guest house in which the pair were staying after being led to a mosque to pray. 
Authorities are reportedly trying to determine the destination of his flight and where he supposedly acquired the Nigerian passport after his British passport was previously confiscated.

Why Is The Price Of LUNC And USTC Up Today?


                            The prices of LUNC and USTC have both seen a considerable boost in the past day. But although there has been a bit of a recovery in the crypto market, another reason entirely is behind this surge in price and it has everything to do with the currently incarcerated founder of the Terra blockchain, Do Kwon.
Terra Founder Gets Released
Do Kwon, the founder of the billion-dollar Terra blockchain, which collapsed in 2022, has been in prison in Montenegro for months now after being apprehended with fake travel documents. Since then, there have been numerous efforts by both the United States and South Korean governments to get the founder extradited for prosecution in their respective countries to no avail.

Between the two countries vying for extradition, there have been reports that the Montenegrin court is leaning toward extraditing him to South Korea to face charges for the collapse of the blockchain. Despite this, the founder remains in Montenegro as a final decision on his extradition has yet to be made.
While the courts deliberate on where to send the founder, Do Kwon has finally secured a release from prison in Montenegro. According to the release reports, Do Kwon is expected to remain in the country until the courts decide his fate.
Prison Chief Darko Vukcevic confirmed Do Kwon’s release from prison as he says that the disgraced founder has served the entirety of his sentence for the fake travel documents. He was reportedly released on Saturday, March 23, and is currently under house arrest.
LUNC And USTC React To Do Kwon’s Release
The prices of USTC and LUNC have reacted positively to the news of Do Kwon getting released on Saturday. After the news made the round, the prices of both altcoins saw a significant uptick, turning green despite the crypto market continuing to struggle.

The LUNC price saw an over 10% jump from its Sunday lows of $0.00015, reaching as high as $0.000172 before correcting back downward. In the same vein, the USTC price also recorded a 10% increase during this time, going from $0.028 to peak at $0.031.
So far, both altcoins have been able to maintain their gains in the last day, which could signal a continuation in the uptrend. Right now, there is not much resistance for both assets and if Bitcoin continues to rise, then both USTC and LUNC are expected to follow.
At the time of writing, LUNC is trading at $0.0001672 with a 24-hour gain of 9.4%, and USTC is trading at $0.0303 with a 24-hour gain of 5.39%, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Shiba Inu Explodes 7% in an Hour: Is the SHIB Bull Run Back?


																TL;DR

The global cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged, with leading cryptocurrencies and meme coins experiencing significant gains.
Shiba Inu’s price spiked, improving profitability for the majority of its holders.


The cryptocurrency sector has headed north in the past few hours, with the global market capitalization surging above $2.75 trillion and leading digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana, and Binance Coin (BNB) being well in the green.
The meme coin niche experienced a boost, too, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) is among the best performers. The price of the self-proclaimed Dogecoin-killer spiked by 7% in the past hour (per CoinGecko’s data), while its market capitalization exceeded $17 billion.

SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko
The latest surge puts over 63% of the coin’s holders into profitable territory (at least on paper). In comparison, over 90% of SHIB investors were underwater in September last year when the valuation was struggling to take off.




Some analysts believe Shiba Inu is yet to experience a significant pump, with SHIB KNIGHT and JAVON MARKS envisioning triple-digit increases in the near future.
The asset is not the only meme coin witnessing substantial gains today (March 25). Dogecoin (DOGE) is up 4.5% on a 24-hour scale, Pepe Coin (PEPE) has jumped by 9%, whereas dogwifhat (WIF) has soared by 20%.

Catch up on Asia's top crypto stories of the week | Cryptopolitan

Asia’s crypto scene has been buzzing with activity, packed with a mixture of warnings, regulatory shifts, and market dynamics that could give any crypto enthusiast a run for their money. This week, we’re diving deep into the heart of the continent’s digital currency developments, unearthing the stories that have stakeholders on the edge of their seats. With the crypto world’s ever-evolving industry, staying updated is not just a necessity; it’s a survival tactic. Regulatory Warnings and Legal BattlesStarting off with Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has stepped in to clear the air around the misuse of its name in the crypto sphere. Some opportunistic entities have been misleading the public, pretending to be part of the prestigious Hong Kong Dollar Digital Pilot Scheme. The HKMA was quick to clamp down on these claims, emphasizing that legitimate companies involved would never seek public funds under the scheme’s guise. Similarly, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) flagged suspicious websites masquerading under the name “KKR Global,” luring unsuspecting victims into a web of fraudulent crypto investments.Crossing over to South Korea, the crypto exchange scene is witnessing an unusual trend with Tether (USDT). The premium rates for USDT have soared, particularly on platforms like Upbit and Bithumb, drawing attention to a possible surge in demand or speculative trading activities in the region.In legal arenas, Terraform’s co-founder Do Kwon finds himself a free man, albeit confined to the Balkans, as he navigates through a maze of international criminal charges. Meanwhile, Three Arrows Capital’s founder Kyle Davies is playing a game of geographical chess, attempting to avoid a fate similar to his colleague by staying clear of Singapore.On a more personal note, Azuki’s founder Zagabond, chose an event in Shanghai to share his roots, born in Harbin, China. This revelation comes at a time when the Eastern and Western crypto communities seem more eager than ever to bridge their differences and unite under the banner of blockchain and digital currencies.Market Movements and Strategic ShiftsThe narrative also shifts towards the dynamics of the market and strategic decisions by key players. Hong Kong-listed Yuxing Technology made a significant pivot in its investment strategy by converting its Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings into stablecoins, amounting to a hefty $14.4 million. This move reflects a cautious yet optimistic outlook towards the stability offered by digital currencies like USDC and USDT, amidst the volatile nature of the crypto market.OKX, a major player in the crypto exchange domain, announced its withdrawal from the Indian market, citing regulatory challenges. This decision underscores the broader regulatory uncertainty and the need for clear guidelines that can foster a healthy crypto ecosystem across Asia.Victims of sophisticated scams have also been a focal point, with reports of individuals being lured into “pig killing” schemes and fraudulent legal advice, culminating in substantial financial losses. These incidents serve as a stark reminder of the dark underbelly of the crypto world, where vigilance and due diligence are paramount.In the grand scheme of crypto regulations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has thrown in its two cents, urging Pakistan to widen its tax net to include capital gains from cryptocurrency investments. This advice is part of a larger dialogue with the country, aimed at securing financial stability and ensuring a comprehensive tax regime that captures the evolving nature of digital currencies.

Boeing CEO Vows to "Fix What Isn't Working," Will Step Down from Role by Year End - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Boeing (NYSE: BA) CEO Dave Calhoun announced his plans to step down from his position by the end of the year, marking a significant leadership change for the aerospace giant. Boeing’s stock gained in premarket trading, up 4.12% at the time of writing.



Boeing CEO to Step Down by End of 2024



In announcing his departure, Calhoun emphasized the global scrutiny on the company, stating, “The eyes of the world are on us. We are going to fix what isn’t working, and we are going to get our company back on the track towards recovery and stability.”



The company also revealed that Larry Kellner, Boeing’s chairman, will not seek re-election as a board director, and former Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) CEO Steve Mollenkopf has been elected to succeed him. Additionally, Stan Deal, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, is retiring, with Stephanie Pope, Boeing’s COO since January, set to replace him effective immediately.



The leadership shakeup comes amidst a tumultuous period for Boeing, which has faced over five years of issues with its airplanes.



The company has been grappling with the fallout from two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019, resulting in the loss of 346 lives. More recently, an Alaska Airlines 737 Max experienced an incident where a door plug blew out during flight.



These problems have led to multiple groundings, safety concerns, and staggering financial losses, with Boeing incurring over $31 billion in cumulative losses. In a letter addressing the Alaska Airlines (NYSE: ALK) incident, CEO Calhoun described it as “a watershed moment for Boeing” and reiterated the company’s commitment to resolving issues and restoring stability, echoing the sentiments expressed in his departure announcement.





Boeing Stock Up in Premarket After Leadership Change Announcement



On March 22, Boeing’s stock closed at $188.85, up $1.15 (+0.61%) from the previous close of $187.70. In pre-market trading on March 23, as of the time of writing, the stock price increased to $197, up $7.79 (+4.12%). During the March 22 trading session, Boeing’s stock price fluctuated between $188.19 and $192.94, while the 52-week range spans from $176.25 to $267.54. The trading volume on March 22 was 7,826,970 shares, lower than the average of 10,128,668 shares. Boeing’s current market capitalization is $115.224 billion, and the stock has a 1-year target estimate of $232.93, suggesting a potential upside from current levels.

Investor Hesitation Blamed as Crypto Investments See $942M Weekly Outflow: CoinShares


																Investment products in digital assets witnessed a significant weekly outflow of $942 million, breaking the continuous seven-week streak of inflows reaching $12.3 billion.
According to the CoinShares, this shift can be attributed to investor hesitation.
Hesitant Investors Cause US ETF Inflows Dip
The latest edition of Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report revealed that the trading volumes in Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) remained high and reached $28 billion for the week. The figures, however, were two-thirds lower than the previous week’s figures.
Despite a recent price correction leading to a reduction of $10 billion in total assets under management (AuM), they still stand above the highs from previous cycles, currently at $88 billion.
CoinShares blamed the recent price correction on investor hesitancy, which resulted in significantly reduced inflows into new ETF issuers in the United States, amounting to only $1.1 billion. This partially offset the substantial outflows of $2 billion from incumbent Grayscale during the previous week.
The asset manager also stated that the “poor sentiment” wasn’t confined to the US alone. In fact, Sweden, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Germany also experienced outflows of $37 million, $25 million, $35 million, and $4 million respectively, over the past week.
Decoupling from this widespread sentiment, Brazil and Canada, on the other hand, witnessed inflows totaling $9 million and $8.4 million, respectively, during the same period. Meanwhile, Australia settled for $1.4 million in weekly inflows.
Bitcoin Dominated 96% of The Flows
CoinShares’ data further revealed that investments focused on Bitcoin products experienced outflows of $904 million outflows, thereby accounting for 96% of the total flows. Products allowing traders to short Bitcoin saw only $3.7 million in weekly outflows.
Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano investment products were also hit by outflows during the same period, amounting to $34 million, $5.6 million, and $3.7 million, respectively. However, the remaining altcoin market performed positively, with net inflows reaching $16 million. Notably, Polkadot received $5 million, Avalanche $2.9 million, Litecoin $2 million, and XRP $1.2 million in inflows over the past week.

3 cryptocurrencies to turn $100 into $1,000 in April


April is likely to be the biggest month for cryptocurrencies so far in 2024 – a major achievement given that Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high in March, and the U.S. saw the approval of its first-ever spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January.
The month will probably feature major moves in the crypto market, mostly centered on and driven by the halving event.
A recent crypto market bloodbath also ensured that many cryptocurrencies are, at press time, below their current yearly high thus presenting multiple value buying opportunities for prospecting investors.


Finally, April could also be big for meme coins as not only are many new ones being released on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, but it wouldn’t be out of character for a prominent influencer – such as the billionaire Elon Musk – to make an April’s Fools joke leading to a pump.
Bitcoin (BTC)
While Bitcoin has already seen a major rise in 2024, the coin is likely to be the main star of April due to the halving event which will reduce mining rewards and render extracting the rest of the cryptocurrency’s finite supply much harder. 
Despite its high price, history shows that BTC could surge significantly in the coming months as it has, after the previous halvings, jumped in value anywhere between tenfold and a hundredfold no matter the jump-off point.
Even should the rally be less significant than in the past, Bitcoin recently stabilized roughly around $67,000 after a brief expedition above $70,000 and the price targets for 2024 remain overall bullish with some – such as the one made by the prominent investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ Robert Kiyosaki – going as high as $300,000.
Despite the current pause which even saw BTC drop 1.56% in the last 7 days and 0.16% in the latest 24 hours, the world’s premier cryptocurrency rose significantly since the start of 2024. Bitcoin is 57.24% in the green year-to-date (YTD) with a press time price of $66,836.

Cardano (ADA)
Since late 2023, Cardano (ADA) has both managed a major price surge that saw it rise from $0.24 in October to $0.64 on Monday, March 25, and started establishing a pattern on major rallies followed by corrections which, ultimately, lead to new even greater rallies.
ADA 1-year price chart. Source: Finbold
Should Cardano continue following the trajectory that already saw it surge 80% in 52 weeks, and rise 6.43% in 2024, it could soon aim to reclaim its old-all-time highs above $2.80.
There have been several developments indicating that such a drive might be in the making. The number of smart contracts on Cardano’s Plutus v1 and v2 has been growing steadily and the first quarter of 2024 saw four times as many added as the entire 2023.
Additionally, there has been a broad and high interest in ADA as evidenced by the fact that Cardano has been adding, on average, 2,000 new wallets each day since January 1.
Dogecoin (DOGE)
While nothing is guaranteed when it comes to meme coins, there is a distinct possibility many of the internet joke-based cryptocurrencies will experience significant rallies in April. 
Indeed, the current phase in the crypto market already saw several rags-to-riches stories with newer cryptocurrencies such as Dogwifhat and Slerf (SLERF) in which traders cashed out millions relatively quickly.
Dogecoin (DOGE), the world’s oldest meme coin, remains a strong contender into 2024 and, along with its prominence, it is well positioned for a rally as – even should there be no repeat of history – the start of April may see it surge as investors bet that Elon Musk will repeat his X joke from 2023.
DOGE 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold
Still, having surged 135.97% in the last 52 weeks, 99.36% in the last 30 days, and 15.61% on the weekly chart to $0.176 – a high not seen since late 2021 – Dogecoin remains a risky if promising bet.

                        Amidst a surging interest and a trading volume that has recently crossed the $100 million mark, Bonk (BONK) coin’s price trajectory has caught the eye of investors worldwide. With a remarkable 160% increase in the last month and an unprecedented 640% upswing since the start of 2024, holders of Bonk are reaping the benefits of its explosive growth. As Bitcoin’s value climbs, it catalyzes a market-wide enthusiasm, propelling investments into various cryptocurrencies, including meme-driven Bonk. The coin’s listing on the Binance exchange in 2023, which saw trading volumes soar to $600 million, has bolstered beliefs in its potential to stand toe-to-toe with established memecoins, further amplifying its allure to a global pool of investors. Despite the market’s inherent volatility, the outlook on Bonk remains optimistic, with predictions suggesting a possible rise to $0.0000385 by the end of March, underscored by a growing demand and positive sentiment within the meme coin sector.Bonk (BONK) Surges Amidst Bitcoin Rally and Growing Altcoin Interest
Bonk (BONK) has recently witnessed significant growth, propelled by the rising tide of alternative cryptocurrencies and the influential wake of Bitcoin’s market movements.

Dovish Comments from Fed Officials: Impact on Bonk (BONK) Coin Price
When Federal Reserve officials lean towards dovish policies, favoring economic growth over curbing inflation, it spells good news for cryptocurrencies like Bonk (BONK). Such policies often lead to lower interest rates and more money flowing in the economy, making borrowing cheaper and investments in assets like Bonk more attractive. As investors look for alternative places to park their funds, Bonk’s price could see an uptick.The dovish comments also tend to weaken the US Dollar (USD), as lower interest rates make it less appealing. This decrease in the dollar’s strength further enhances the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies as alternative investments.
Fed’s growth-focused stance potentially lowers interest rates.
Bonk (BONK) becomes more appealing with increased liquidity and a weaker USD.
Bonk Price Prediction
In today’s technical analysis of BONK, the asset closed at $0.00002312, marking a 4.06% decline. The analysis reveals critical price levels to watch: a pivot point at $0.000024 sets the immediate tone, with resistance levels poised at $0.000026, $0.000027, and $0.000029.Bonk Price PredictionSupport levels are established at $0.000022, $0.000021, and $0.000020. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 50, indicating a balanced force between buyers and sellers. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.000024 corroborates with the symmetrical triangle pattern observed, signaling a consolidation phase within a $0.000024 to $0.000021 range. A breach beyond this range could catalyze a decisive price movement. Presently, BONK exhibits a bearish outlook below $0.000024, yet a surge above this threshold could shift the momentum towards a bullish stance.Embracing the Future: Dogecoin20 Unleashed

Solana Gets New NFT Standard, Metaplex Will Give Fees to DAO for Potential MPLX Rewards - Decrypt

The Metaplex Foundation revealed Monday that it is launching a new non-fungible token (NFT) standard for Solana that is cheaper to mint and easier for developers to work with—and crucially, given recent congestion, it requires substantially less Solana network compute too.The Metaplex Core standard, the Foundation exclusively shared with Decrypt, is billed as a next-generation NFT standard for the Solana network, cutting mint costs and network demand by more than 80% compared to the existing Token Metadata standard on Solana.“Core is a culmination of our learnings since we introduced the first Solana NFT standard back in early 2021,” Metaplex Foundation Director Stephen Hess told Decrypt. “It rethinks the concept of digital assets on Solana from the ground-up, optimizing for cost, extensibility, and performance.”Minting an NFT with the Core standard could cost as low as 0.0037 SOL (about $0.70), the Foundation said as an example, compared to 0.0220 SOL ($4.25) with the Token Metadata standard. While Solana’s Bubblegum standard for compressed NFTs (or cNFTs) remains cheaper, it also has certain trade-offs and is still only intended for mass-scale mints.Metaplex Core is entirely focused on NFTs, not fungible tokens, and as a result has been streamlined substantially for developer use. While the Token Metadata standard must interact with multiple Solana accounts, Core reduces that total to just one—something that Metaplex says can “improve network performance for Solana more broadly.”But streamlined doesn’t also mean limited, the Foundation suggests. That’s because Metaplex Core comes with substantial plugin support, letting developers bake in various additional features such as “built-in staking” and “asset-based point systems,” according to a release.Further documentation shared with Decrypt shows that Core could unlock advanced collecting mechanics on Solana, such as burn-to-mint functionality that encompasses many more assets—up to potentially 70 NFTs burned in a single transaction. That’s up from just 3-4 NFTs at once using the Token Metadata standard.The Foundation said that collection-level changes will also be easier with Core, and that the standard will also enable improved compatibility between NFT standards on other chains via potential plug-ins from cross-chain projects like LayerZero or Wormhole.Metaplex is deploying the Core standard to devnet Monday along with releasing the open-source code, with plans to have the standard ready on Solana mainnet by NFT NYC in early April. Claynosaurz says it will use Core for its NFT NYC “Booster Packs,” as well as for its Dactyl Raffle, while NFT marketplace Tensor has already committed to supporting the standard.“We named the program Core because we see it sitting at the center of the next wave of innovation in digital assets, supporting thousands of artists, communities, Web3 games, real-world assets, and decentralized applications,” Hess added. “With Core activated on devnet, we’re excited to work with a battle-hardened builder community and the next generation of entrepreneurs that are proving out what’s only possible on Solana in real time."In addition to launching the new standard, the Metaplex Foundation has committed to putting 50% of the all-time fees from the Metaplex protocol into the Metaplex DAO treasury via the MPLX token. That means the community can vote on how the funds are ultimately used for further adoption.The MPLX token was launched on Solana in September 2022 and airdropped to creators who used the protocol in the past, but the token itself hasn’t had significant utility to date. The Metaplex Foundation will take 50% of all earlier protocol fees and use it to buy MPLX to give to the DAO treasury, with 50% of future fees used for the same purpose.The community of MPLX token holders can then collectively decide what to do with those funds, whether it’s burning them to cut the supply, developing staking rewards, or other potential moves ahead.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Critics claim ‘buggy’ Bitcoin Lightning Network is slowly dying


Bitcoin’s Lightning Network was supposed to be the key to scaling Bitcoin adoption globally. Its proponents touted cheaper and faster transactions plus an emergent social graph for a new Bitcoin economy.
Seemingly magical demonstrations by influencers like Jack Mallers heralded a fulfillment of Bitcoin’s promise of peer-to-peer electronic cash. With transaction fees so cheap and transactions so instantaneous, Bitcoiners started buying coffee and groceries over the Lightning Network.
The idea was simple: sign a simple smart contract and transact endlessly via ‘bar tab’-type paper contracts, rather than paying an on-chain transaction fee every time.
Unfortunately, Lightning usage started to stall in late 2023 and since then, several long-time Lightning believers have renounced their faith.
In short, critics believe that the Lightning Network is slowly dying.
Dwindling bitcoin capacity
The amount of bitcoin that a user of the Lightning Network can access by joining a publicly available channel began dipping below 5,000 in December 2023. After months of steady decline, Lightning currently has a capacity of less than 4,700 bitcoins.
The average Lightning payment channel has a capacity of 8,729,836 satoshis, worth about $5,542. This capacity is only a small fraction of bitcoin’s circulating supply of about 19.5 million.
Crucially, Lightning has also been riddled with bugs.
Expensive to receive money
Most importantly, Lightning is counterintuitive and surprisingly expensive. In order to join the network, new users must pay for a regular Bitcoin transaction, on-chain. They can then send and receive that amount of bitcoin — i.e. their initial deposit — for negligible fees, skipping on-chain transactions via Lightning’s payment channels.
However, whenever the user wants to receive more bitcoin than they originally deposited to join a Lightning network channel, they must pay for an additional on-chain transaction to splice in additional bitcoin capacity. 
Finally, to leave the network, they must again pay for an on-chain closing transaction.
Although these three (or more) on-chain transactions might eventually save a power user from innumerable on-chain transactions, for the average user, they are an annoyance and counterintuitive.
In particular, many new Lightning users complain about the topsy-turvy design of having to pay extra money to receive extra money. In normal commerce, recipients receive unlimited money freely; the sender pays extra to send large sums. Lightning flips that entirely, charging the recipient.

As a temporary solution, custodial Lightning companies have launched wallets that subsidize new users with extra, complimentary inbound capacity. This eliminates complaints and improves the user experience but these custodial solutions centralize Lightning, moving it far away from Bitcoin’s promise of true decentralization.
Indeed, on the first page of the Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi wrote, “What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.” In this context, the introduction of a trusted third party to make Lightning easy and cheap for the average recipient doesn’t seem very Bitcoin.
Channel freezes and other Lightning Network bugs
In October 2023, Lightning developers disclosed a vulnerability of Bitcoin Lightning Network users to so-called replacement cycling attacks. Soon, they disclosed another vulnerability to ‘jamming’ attacks. In November 2022, another unattributed Lightning routing bug came to light.
One bug in a popular Lightning implementation, LND, froze money inside Lightning for hours after a developer called Burak decided to broadcast a 998-signature Taproot transaction that broke the network.

Significant developer departures from Bitcoin Lightning
As early as 2019, even Lightning’s co-creator, Tadge Dryja, admitted that Lightning might be overhyped. “Everybody is saying, ‘Lightning Network is going to be the best thing ever.’ Wait, LN can’t actually do that,” he said.
Dryja’s co-founder, Joseph Poon, has also stopped contributing to Lightning development.
Lightning Network developer Antoine Riard also halted his work on Lightning soon after the replacement cycling vulnerability was disclosed. He said this vulnerability put it in a “very perilous position” that could only be fixed at the base layer. Riard left to focus on Bitcoin Core development.
Another Lightning Network developer, Rene Pickhardt, expressed concerns about the ability to remain private on Lightning. Chainalysis affirmed that fear, beginning to offer tracking services of Lightning transactions in December 2021.

One of the oldest Bitcoin developers, Matt Corallo, the tenth contributor to Bitcoin Core, called the Lightning Network “kinda a joke.” Synonym’s John Carvalho agreed with that assessment on a recent interview with Vlad Costea, also concluding that Lightning has failed to meet the community’s expectations.
Corallo laughed at unpayable Lightning invoices via BTCPayServer. He opined that the Lightning Network needed to be made accessible to the general population, not just hobbyists.

A growing list of Bitcoin Lightning complaints
Bitcoin developer Paul Sztorc thinks it’s unlikely that Lightning Network will succeed. Indeed, he predicted that it will “collapse Theranos-style,” a reference to a company that was once touted as a revolution in medical diagnostics but has since collapsed. He has created a list of dozens of complaints and third-party predictions of its demise.
In any case, Lightning’s capacity is already on the decline, numerous bugs have not inspired confidence, and many developers have stopped contributing altogether. Lightning Network continues to be an interesting use of valid Bitcoin smart contracts, but unless someone can figure out a solution to its many problems, it might remain a niche for hobbyists rather than the global revolution it was once believed to be.

Bitcoin reaches $69,000 as Bitcoin halving approaches

Illustration: Dado Ruvic (Reuters)After a week of price correction, Bitcoin’s value has rebounded and is now hovering above $69,000. The top cryptocurrency has surged over 30% in a month due to bullish sentiment among investors after record inflows in spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event.Is it too late to invest in Nvidia? | Smart InvestingTraditional finance embraces cryptoThe sudden jump in Bitcoin and the crypto market, in general, occurred due to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, followed by the U.K.’s permission to trade Bitcoin-linked securities in the stock market.Goldman Sachs recently mentioned that its clients are suddenly interested in crypto again due to the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs. The support of big financial institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity for Bitcoin ETFs, which are seeing record inflows, has propelled the crypto market to new heights.Moreover, financial research analyst firm  Bernstein has raised its price prediction for Bitcoin from $80,000 to $90,000, saying that after Bitcoin halving in mid-April, the price of the top cryptocurrency will go even higher.Bitcoin halving is on the wayBitcoin halving occurs every four years, cutting the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions in half. With the next halving just a week away, positive sentiment has spread across the crypto market.The halvings decrease the rate of new coin creation, reducing the available supply, which helps to curb inflation. On May 11, 2020, Bitcoin underwent its most recent halving, which reduced the block reward to 6.25 Bitcoin. This year, after halving the block reward will be reduced to 3.125 Bitcoin.

                        The Dogecoin price has barely moved in the past 24 hours, with its current level of $0.173 representing an 18% gain in a week.Much of this gain has followed the news that major crypto-exchange Coinbase will launch DOGE-based futures on April 1, an announcement that has seen the coin’s trading volume rise from under $2 billion to over $3 billion in a couple of days.DOGE is now also up by 100% in a month, with the famous meme coins also marking a 130% gain in a year.Yet the announcement of DOGE futures points to a near future that could see the token’s volumes and price rise significantly, as more traders enter its market.Dogecoin Price Prediction as Coinbase Prepares to Launch DOGE Futures – $1 Incoming?
DOGE’s chart is in an interesting position, insofar as its resistance (red) and support (green) levels are converging towards each other.This implies that the Dogecoin price will either break out towards higher levels or face a further dump, with its rising RSI (purple) suggesting that a breakout is a touch more likely.Source: TradingViewIt’s also encouraging that DOGE’s price has climbed over its 30-day average (yellow), something which is likely to pull up the latter and put further distance between it and the 200-day (blue).In other words, DOGE remains in the middle of an expansionary period, one which could see its price reach new yearly heights.It will be helped by the aforementioned news that Coinbase will be adding DOGE futures next week, something which could herald a big rise in the coin’s volumes.It continues to attract interest from large investors, as indicated by recent transfer data, and it’s possible that the ability to trade futures on Coinbase will only help it in this respect.DOGE is also likely to benefit from the market’s return to growth, with the total cap of all cryptocurrencies rising by 3% in the past 24 hours.As momentum returns to the market, and as we approach the next Bitcoin halving, positivity is likely to increase, with the Dogecoin price rising along with others.DOGE may also receive help from Elon Musk and X, which continues to prepare for the launch of digital payments on its social network.If X does bring DOGE payments to its platform, then the Dogecoin price will undoubtedly rocket.Under this scenario it could certainly reach $1, while Tesla enabling DOGE payments may also help.If not, it will rise more modestly, potentially touching $0.3 by the summer.New Meme Tokens May Rally Harder
DOGE continues to hold potential for future rallies, yet it’s arguable that newer meme coins may rise more aggressively this year.This is particularly the case for new meme tokens that are holding their respective presales and looking to list on exchanges soon.One such token is Dogecoin20 (DOGE20), an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $8 million in its presale.Not only is Dogecoin20 an Ethereum-based version of the original Dogecoin, but it also aims to provide stronger fundamentals and tokenomics than its namesake.For one, it will operate according to Dogecoin’s ‘Do Only Good Everyday’ ethos, with the token providing regular transfers and support to charitable causes and community projects.In contrast to Dogecoin (which remains a proof-of-work crypto), its use of Ethereum makes it a proof-of-stake token, meaning that it will use much, much less energy.Aside from being more environmentally friendly, its tokenomics will be stronger, with the coin having a hard cap of 140 billion DOGE20.This limited supply will combine with DOGE20’s staking system, which provides greater rewards to those who stake more for longer.By incentivizing long-term holding, more DOGE20 will exit circulation, potentially pushing up its price in parallel.This could make DOGE20 one of the most bullish new tokens of the year, with investors able to join its sale at the official Dogecoin20 website.They can buy the coin at $0.000209 per token, in exchange for ETH, USDT or fiat currency.And because DOGE20 has a capped supply (unlike Dogecoin), this price could rise massively once the token starts listing on exchanges.Buy Dogecoin20 Now

Michael Saylor Makes Big Bitcoin Statement as Market Uncertainty Looms

MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor has made a profound statement that resonates with the core of the digital asset community: "Bitcoin is the signal." This declaration comes during a period of market uncertainty, with Bitcoin entering uncharted territory after reaching all-time highs of $73,750 and investors wondering what follows.According to the most recent CoinShares report, digital asset investment products saw weekly outflows, the first since a record seven-week run of inflows totaling $12.3 billion. The recent price drop prompted investor hesitancy, resulting in record net outflows of $942 million. Bitcoin accounted for 96% of the flows, with $904 million in outflows.Bitcoin was up 2.45% in the last 24 hours to $67,177 but had fallen 1.77% in the previous seven days. BTC is now down from its all-time high of $73,750, reached on March 14. Saylor's comment, "Bitcoin is the signal," is a figurative argument that Bitcoin stands out as a clear signal in the middle of market noise — whether it is regulatory chatter, price volatility or overall uncertainty. It could also imply that Bitcoin remains a strong indicator of market direction.Saylor's MicroStrategy currently owns 214,246 Bitcoin, which it purchased for an average of $35,160 per coin. MicroStrategy first began purchasing Bitcoin in August 2020 and has since steadily increased its portfolio.Uncertain economic outlookOn the financial markets, investors are eagerly anticipating fresh economic data scheduled for release this week, poised to offer a glimpse into the state of the economy.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking at a press conference after the central bank's latest meeting, hinted at the possibility of reducing policy restraint later in the year, provided the economy progresses as anticipated. However, Powell also acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook and the ongoing challenge of achieving the 2% inflation target.Throughout the week, investors will closely monitor key economic indicators, including the Fed's inflation gauge, for valuable insights into the economic outlook.In contrast to the optimism surrounding potential rate cuts and the subsequent rise in stock markets, Bitcoin experienced a downturn in the past week.

Binance to End Support for Tron-based USDC Tokens by April 5 | Coinspeaker



The ongoing regulatory scrutiny of Tron (TRX) and Justin Sun by United States agencies has led to the end of an era of Circle’s USDC in TRC20 standard.

Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange by daily traded volume and registered users, has announced that it will cease the support for USDC, the flagship Stablecoin for Circle Internet Financial Ltd, by April 5. The decision to end the support for USDC deposits and withdrawals through the TRC20 standard follows the prior announcement by Circle that customers have until February 2025 to migrate their USDC coins to other supported chains.
“Deposits of USDC tokens via TRC20 will no longer be credited to users’ accounts after 2024-04-05 02:00 (UTC),” Binance noted.




Meanwhile, Binance noted that its customers can continue trading Circle’s USDC through the supported chains as they migrate their coins from TRC20 standards.
Major Blow to the Tron (TRX) Web 3.0 Ecosystem
The palpable growth of the web3 ecosystem has been bolstered by the existence of programmable highly liquid stablecoins led by Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC. According to market data provided through DefiLaama, the Tron network is the second largest Web 3.0 ecosystem after Ethereum with about $9.68 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) and more than $53 billion in stablecoins market cap.
With Circle touted as the most transparent and liquid stablecoin for the Web 3.0 ecosystem, Tron’s Web 3.0 ecosystem is expected to feel the blow as other layer-one blockchains continue to thrive.
Moreover, the ongoing competition in the layer one industry has resulted in the rise of Solana (SOL) among others as a major competitor to legacy chains like Ethereum and Tron. Nonetheless, the Tron network significantly benefits from Tether’s USDT support amid the ongoing adoption of real-world assets (RWA) tokenization.
Regulatory Hurdles
Following the historic settlement between the United States and Binance late last year, the US-based regulators have been probing Tron Foundation and its founder Justin Sun. As Coinspeaker previously reported, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been investigating Sun and his companies for selling unregistered securities assets via TRX and BitTorrent (BTT).
Consequently, the Tron ecosystem has been operating its services excluding the United States to avoid altercations from the regulatory agencies.
Market Check
The Tron network has thrived in the past without venturing into the United States, thus its native token TRX did not take a nose dive on the announcement. According to our latest market data, TRX’s price has dropped around 14 percent in the past four weeks amid the Bitcoin-led crypto correction.
Nonetheless, the Tron ecosystem led by Sun has huge growth prospects, backed by the positive diplomacy obtained while he served as Permanent Representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva.

The current price is locked at $0.055, while the price at the DEX listing is going to be $0.1. That makes a whopping 45.% discount, so now is the perfect time to buy BlastUP tokens at the best price.>> Snatch Up BlastUP Tokens Now for Maximum Returns! <<BlastUP token holders can enjoy exclusive perks like early access to token sales, special rewards in IDOs, and the opportunity to earn extra tokens through staking.

The BlastUP token, a cornerstone of the platform, unlocks access to tiered IDO launches, staking rewards, and exclusive loyalty benefits.>> Seize the Chance to Grow Faster and Earn More with BlastUP! <<Dogecoin Soars Over 100%: Momentum and RisksDogecoin‘s recent upward trend, with a staggering 102.36% rise in the last month and 182.84% over six months, is eye-catching. Currently trading at $0.172, above both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, it signals strong short-term momentum. Topping its previous best at $0.7605 would require significant interest and investment, but the energy behind the recent surges could drive it closer to such highs.However, with cryptocurrency markets known for volatility, Dogecoin holders must be ready for swings. The presence of both support levels at $0.085 and $0.052 introduces a safety net, yet distant from the current price, hinting at potential risk for a retreat. In the long run, continuous growth could be challenged by market corrections or shifts in investor sentiment, which could dampen the optimism.Impressive Growth for Pyth Network Amid VolatilityPyth Network has shown impressive growth with a one-month surge of 78.01% and an even more striking six-month jump of 147.75%. These numbers are significant. The current price, resting at $0.95, sits snugly below the nearest resistance level of $0.92 and some way beneath the second resistance of $1.18. Considering its all-time high of $1.16, the momentum could carry it to retest and potentially break past these resistances. However, market indicators like the MACD and the 10-day SMA recommend selling, which could imply a potential short-term pullback.In the long run, the substantial six-month growth paints a bullish picture for Pyth Network’s future. Yet, there are supports at $0.38 and $0.12, possibly cushioning any substantial decline. Both the RSI and Stochastic RSI expressing a neutral standpoint suggest a period of consolidation or indecision may be imminent. This uncertain market sentiment indicates that while opportunities for growth exist, especially if the trend continues upward, there are risks of downturns that investors should not overlook.Mantle’s Price Soars 115%, Eyes $1.08 ResistanceMantle has seen a significant climb over six months, with prices soaring over 115%. The current price is at $0.84, comfortably above the 100-day simple moving average of $0.74. This could suggest a strong foundational support, and if the trend continues, reaching past the nearest resistance of $1.08 may be on the horizon. However, if it fails to break through, the price might revisit the support at $0.63, which could signal a short-term pullback.Looking at the larger picture, a one-month increase of 6.88% indicates steady demand. This momentum could propel Mantle towards the second resistance level of $1.27. Long-term, the historical performance might attract more attention, potentially leading to further gains. On the flip side, any downturn in market sentiment could see prices dip towards the second support level at $0.37, highlighting the inherent risks in market volatility.ConclusionAs the crypto landscape burgeons with potential, BlastUP distinguishes itself with robust growth within the Blast ecosystem. While other promising tokens under $1 show notable strides and potential payouts, BlastUP’s compelling concept and seamless integration into the Blast framework set it apart. Its purpose to lower hurdles for blockchain startups and its enthusiastic adoption demonstrate not just its ample promise but also its tangible progress and exclusive benefits for token holders. The vitality of the Blast ecosystem underpins BlastUP’s journey, making it a standout choice for those eyeing the most fertile ground for investment in the bustling cryptoverse.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

The Crisis Between Binance and Nigeria Grows! Another Accusation Made Against Binance! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Recent developments in Nigeria showed that Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was accused of tax evasion by local authorities.
Nigeria Blames Binance, Detained Executives Accused of Tax Evasion
The situation escalated as the Nigerian government intensified its conflict with the exchange, leading to the detention of two Binance executives and sparking controversy after reports emerged that one of them had escaped custody.


According to Reuters, Binance Executive Board Member Nadeem Anjarwalla escaped from custody.
According to reports from local media outlets today, the Nigerian Federal Internal Revenue Service (FIRS) has filed a criminal complaint against Binance in the Federal High Court in Abuja.





The charges accuse him of multiple counts of tax evasion, including failing to pay Value Added Tax (VAT), Company Income Tax, failing to file tax returns, and allegedly helping customers evade taxes through his platform.

The announcement of these accusations follows weeks of increased scrutiny and criticism of Binance by the Nigerian government.


Among the allegations raised by authorities are that the platform facilitated the processing of billions of dollars of suspected criminal funds and manipulated the exchange rate of the local currency, the naira.
In the midst of this legal battle, an additional layer of controversy has emerged. Premium Times newspaper reported over the weekend that Nadeem Anjarwalla, one of two Binance executives detained by the government, escaped from custody.





This revelation raised concerns and questions about the circumstances of the escape and its impact on ongoing legal proceedings.

For the first time in seven weeks, the broader digital currency ecosystem has recorded its first weekly outflow, with more than $942 million taken off the market. According to a report by CoinShares, the massive outflow recorded by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) sparked the downtrend.The crypto inflow-outflow chart presents an intriguing narrative. The record $942 outflow comes immediately after a week that bagged the biggest inflow since the start of the year. In seven weeks, a total of $12.3 billion has been recorded in total flow into crypto investment products from institutional investors.For the past week, new Bitcoin ETF issuers raked in $1.1 billion, helping to offset the $2 billion outflows recorded by Grayscale. Consequently, Bitcoin suffered the biggest outflow, with a total of $904 million recorded. Bitcoin’s month-to-date (MTD) inflow comes in at $4.517 billion, while the year-to-date (YTD) figure is pegged at $11.964 billion.Even though the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not greenlighted a spot Ethereum ETF, ETH suffered a mild outflow for the past week, coming in at $34.2 million. While the YTD figure comes in at $87 million, the MTD is pegged at a $46.4 million loss.Rebalancing netflow and price outlookThe outflow for the past week underscores the tense setting of the crypto market and the need for a major correction on the market. The outflow was also accompanied by a slowdown in the price of Bitcoin, which dropped to a low of $60,940 from the all-time high (ATH) of $73,750.07 printed 11 days ago.At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is pegged at $67,126.98, up by 2.38% in 24 hours. With the early Monday uptick recorded by the ETF market, a revived accumulation trend might help revive the bullish sentiment that may help BTC end March on a more positive note.

Whales Preparing for the Bull Increased Their Purchases in This Altcoin, The Price Made ATH! - Bitcoin Sistemi


The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin failed to hold on to its ATH of over $73,000 and fell below $61,000 last week, with the impact of outflows in ETFs.
While BTC continues its volatile movements after this decline, horizontal movements continue in altcoins. At this point, some investors see these declines as a buying opportunity and make purchases.


According to Lookonchain's post, whales, taking advantage of the decline, accelerated their purchases of ONDO, the RWA token.
Accordingly, 3 wallets purchased ONDO worth approximately $8 million from Bybit and Gateio exchanges.






“Whales are accumulating RWA token ONDO!
Whale “0x56F9” pulled in 6.53 million ONDO ($5.88 million) from Bybit last month.
The new wallet “0x92dD” withdrew 1.98 million ONDO ($1.78 million) from Gateio in the past hour.
Wallet “0xE6bf” withdrew 937,600 ONDO ($845k) from Gateio 3 hours ago.”

After the whales' purchases, ONDO made ATH and reached up to $0.97. ONDO continues to trade at $0.89 at the time of writing.

Bitcoin (BTC) regains momentum just in time for the upcoming 0DOG exchange listing



                    

                    
At press time, Bitcoin trades at $67,260 marking a 3.57% rise over the past day.
Bitcoin transaction volumes remain subdued despite the resurging BTC value.
Bitcoin Dogs await token claiming and exchange listing with bated breath.

Bitcoin (BTC) has surged back into the spotlight, with its price hitting a high of $67,744 in the past 24 hours.
This surge in value comes just in time for the much-anticipated exchange listing of 0DOG, the native token of Bitcoin Dogs.
BTC price moves out of consolidation
The recent Bitcoin price surge comes after a period of consolidation and uncertainty in the cryptocurrency markets that followed Bitcoin’s ascent to its new ATH of $73,750.07 11 days ago.
Analysts attribute Bitcoin’s recent price surge to several key factors. One significant factor is the growing interest from institutional investors and Wall Street in spot Bitcoin ETFs listed on Nasdaq. This influx of institutional capital into the cryptocurrency markets has contributed to the upward momentum of Bitcoin’s price.
Furthermore, the concentration of trading volume within these ETFs has led to a surge in Bitcoin’s value.
However, despite the soaring price, on-chain transaction volumes in terms of US dollars remain subdued compared to the levels witnessed during the bull market of 2021. This discrepancy suggests a prevailing sentiment among investors to hold onto their Bitcoin, anticipating further price appreciation.
In addition, even with Bitcoin hitting a record high of $73,750, there is a noticeable decline in economic transactions on its blockchain.
Analysts from Blockware Solutions highlight a discrepancy between the soaring price and the muted on-chain dollar volume. Current data shows average transfer volumes to be under $200,000, a stark contrast to the 2021 bull market where figures exceeded $1 million.
However, Blockware Solutions analysts further speculate that a significant Bitcoin price movement will precipitate an increase in on-chain volume as seasoned Bitcoin holders may begin moving assets to exchanges for sale.
The data also shows a growing portion of Bitcoin that has remained inactive for 3 to 4 years, reflecting the confidence of long-term investors. Projections from experts suggest that Bitcoin’s price could ascend to six figures in the near term. For instance, Standard Chartered projects that it will breach $150,000 in 2024.
Bitcoin Dogs: investors await exchange listings
As Bitcoin jumps back into the limelight, Bitcoin Dogs, a Bitcoin-based dog-themed project, has garnered significant attention in the recent past with its unique platform where dog lovers and crypto enthusiasts come together to trade, collect, and engage in various activities within the Dogeverse.
Central to the Bitcoin Dogs ecosystem is its native token, 0DOG. This token serves as a utility and governance token within the platform, allowing users to participate in various activities such as trading, staking, and governance decisions.
Additionally, Bitcoin Dogs features Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing digital collectibles of virtual dogs, adding a layer of gamification and collectibility to the platform.
The recent conclusion of the 0DOG token presale marks a significant milestone for the Bitcoin Dogs project. The presale, which lasted for a record 30 days, witnessed overwhelming participation from the cryptocurrency community, resulting in a successful fundraising effort.
Following the presale, participants will soon be able to claim their 0DOG tokens and engage in trading activities on the platform.
The success of the presale underscores the growing interest and confidence in the Bitcoin Dogs project, highlighting its potential for future growth and adoption.
Investment outlook: Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Dogs
As Bitcoin continues to regain momentum and reach new highs, investors are faced with the question of whether now is a good time to invest in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Dogs.
Well, while past performance is not indicative of future results, the bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin’s price trajectory and the promising prospects of projects like Bitcoin Dogs may present attractive investment opportunities for those looking to diversify their portfolios in the cryptocurrency space.
However, as investors navigate these exciting developments, careful consideration of market trends and project fundamentals will be essential in making informed investment decisions in the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.

Hong Kong SFC Warns Public against HKCEXP for Suspected Crypto Fraud | Coinspeaker



The SFC disclosed the exchange provided a fake address for its location in Hong Kong on its website to gain investors’ trust.

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong has alerted the public about HKCEXP, an over-the-counter (OTC) digital assets trading platform for suspected crypto fraud. In a statement released on Monday, the financial regulator said it collaborated with Hong Kong police to restrict access to the platform. The move aims to prevent users from falling victim to a scam.
HKCEXP Flagged for Potential Crypto Fraud
The SFC flagged the company for alleged crypto fraud after users complained of experiencing difficulties withdrawing their funds and paying “exorbitant tax” to process transactions.




HKCEXP was established in 2018 and describes itself to users as a regulated crypto exchange. However, the Hong Kong financial watchdog said the firm has no regulatory license to operate in the country.
The SFC disclosed the exchange provided a fake address for its location in Hong Kong on its website to gain investors’ trust. The market watchdog believes the firm must have provided other false and misleading information about itself and its business operations to mislead investors.
The company operates under different entities, including HKCEXP-MAX and HKCEXP OTC Holdings Co.
The SFC has warned the public to stay off the company’s website and watch out for other bad actors that may leverage the company’s popularity to create similar enterprises. Furthermore, the regulator cautioned investors to be careful while making investment decisions, as online investment scams can occur in different forms.
“Online investment scams may involve any type of asset and are perpetrated through multiple channels, and victims can suffer substantial losses. Therefore, investors should stay vigilant and beware of fraud when making investment decisions,” said the SFC.
Not the First
Meanwhile, this is not the first time Hong Kong’s market watchdog has issued warnings against companies for suspected fraud and other illegal operations.
Earlier this month, the regulator warned the public about another crypto exchange, Bitforex, for alleged fraud involving digital assets.
After receiving multiple complaints from investors who were unhappy with their services, the SFC found that the exchange was not registered in Hong Kong. The platform restricted investors’ access to withdraw their funds.
Blockchain on-sleuth ZachXBT discovered the alleged fraud before SFC’s warning. The investigator found that Bitforex moved approximately $56.5 million from its hot wallet to an unknown address on February 23, 2024. Shortly after, users began experiencing difficulties taking out their platform assets.
In February, the SFC cautioned the public about MEXC, a digital asset trading platform. The financial regulator claimed the exchange operates in the jurisdiction without obtaining authorization from the appropriate authorities.

Luxor forecasts massive migration of Bitcoin rigs ahead of halving | Cryptopolitan

The Bitcoin halving event is sparking a major shift in the mining industry, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Luxor’s eye-opening analysis predicts a whopping 600,000 S19 bitcoin rigs packing their bags and heading for greener pastures. The mass exodus from the U.S. to energy-affordable locales like Africa and South America is not just a trend; it’s a full-blown migration. Why? Because after the halving, the economics of Bitcoin mining are getting a serious makeover. Those S19 rigs, once the crown jewels costing up to a cool $11,500 each, will soon be fetching just around $350 post-halving. Talk about a markdown. The Great Bitcoin Rig ShuffleAs we edge closer to the halving, a significant transformation is underway. About 6,000 of the older Bitcoin mining stalwarts in the U.S. are hitting pause and heading to a massive 35,000 square-foot Colorado Springs warehouse. There, they’ll get a makeover from SunnySide Digital before finding new homes overseas. This move isn’t just a refurbishing exercise; it’s a survival strategy in anticipation of the Bitcoin blockchain‘s major quadrennial update.This halving isn’t just another calendar event; it’s a seismic shift that cuts the miners’ main income by half. Miners are in a race against time and efficiency, with electricity bills being the boss level they need to beat. Companies like Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc. are on the frontline, navigating through the choppy waters of profit margins. The older, less efficient rigs might still have some fight left in them, but their battlefield is shifting away from the U.S.Taras Kulyk of SunnySide Digital sees this migration as a logical move. By rehoming these digital workhorses to regions where electricity is as cheap as chips, there’s a new lease of life for them. Countries like Ethiopia, Tanzania, Paraguay, and Uruguay are becoming the promised lands for these old timers. And with the halving fast approaching, this migration is more of a sprint than a marathon.A Global Game of Musical ChairsThe mining rig migration is not just about moving from point A to B. It’s a global game of musical chairs with high stakes. Ethan Vera of Luxor Technology paints a picture of 600,000 S19 series rigs, the cream of the current mining crop, leaving the U.S. dust for the more economically viable landscapes of Africa and South America. This isn’t just a shift; it’s a strategic relocation for survival.Bitcoin mining is a tough game, with rewards halved every four years to maintain the digital currency’s scarcity. The upcoming halving, slashing rewards to 3.125 Bitcoin from 6.25, makes the hunt for cost-effective mining even more crucial. With the price of Bitcoin swinging like a pendulum, the pressure is on to find new efficiencies or face extinction.The drop in rig prices post-halving is anticipated like a plot twist in a thriller novel. Last year, an S19 could set you back about $7,030. Fast forward, and we’re looking at a dramatic price plunge to around $356 after the halving. This price rollercoaster is a clear signal: the old guard needs to adapt or step aside.The migration isn’t just a hardware shuffle; it’s a quest for the holy grail of lower electricity costs. Nuo Xu’s journey from Texas to Ethiopia and Nigeria is more than a business trip; it’s a mission to find a new home for his 6,000 rigs where electricity is a bargain, and the mining game can still be profitable.Electricity prices are the heart of the matter. In Ethiopia, power is cheap, regulations are easing up, and the mining ecosystem is booming. SunnySide’s Kulyk is eyeing a deal that could see up to 40,000 rigs make their way to Ethiopia, signaling a major shift in the digital mining landscape.Not every rig makes the journey overseas. For some, especially those owned by publicly traded companies, the leap is too great, with shareholder concerns and logistical headaches keeping them stateside. Bit Digital Inc. is one such example, with older computers gathering dust in a Houston warehouse, waiting for Bitcoin’s price to soar and justify their resurrection.

The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community is on high alert following an urgent warning about a compromised social media account used to promote a fraudulent SHIB airdrop. The incident involves Whale Insider, a prominent X/Twitter account followed by many cryptocurrency enthusiasts, which was unexpectedly compromised.The attackers used the account's influence to spread misinformation about a fake Shiba Inu partnership and a nonexistent SHIB airdrop, potentially putting the SHIB community's assets at risk.This deceptive tactic aimed at luring unsuspecting users into clicking suspicious links, potentially putting their investments at risk.ShibArmy Scam Alerts or @susbarium, an X account tasked with the responsibility of uncovering scams and protecting the Shiba Inu community, flagged and alerted the community to the scam. The compromised account had been a source for updates and insights, making the deception particularly insidious. The fake airdrop announcement was designed to lure unsuspecting SHIB holders into a trap, where they might divulge sensitive information or send their tokens to a scammer's address.In this regard, "ShibArmy Scam Alerts" urges Shiba Inu holders not to click on any links posted by the compromised account.In another tweet, @susbarium calls the attention of the Shiba Inu community to fake ads that are presently circulating. Scammers use this method to direct unsuspecting users to sites that request that they connect their crypto wallets and redeem fake tokens with the intent of stealing funds. In this light, Shiba Inu holders are urged not to connect their crypto wallets to sites without first conducting due diligence.cardThe latest events are a clear reminder of the ongoing threat of scams in the cryptocurrency world. As the popularity of digital assets like SHIB grows, so does the target on the community's back. Scammers are continually finding new ways to exploit enthusiasm and trust within these groups.Important safeguards include never sharing private keys or personal information and verifying all sources before participating in any airdrops or promotions.

AI predicts XLM price for end of 2024


With the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency sector resuming their upward advance, Stellar (XLM) has been no exception, with its Lumens recording gains on all of the observed charts, and artificial intelligence (AI) see more bullishness for this altcoin by the end of this year.
As it happens, Stellar has intensified its gains in recent weeks, particularly as the network has renewed its bid to overtake Ethereum (ETH) by launching a smart contracts platform for decentralized apps (dApps) developers, and advanced AI price projecting algorithms predict more improvement by the end of 2024.
Stellar Lumens price prediction 2024
Indeed, according to one of these AI algorithms, which relies on the historical XLM price movements and the Bitcoin (BTC) halving cycles, the token could end the year at the price of $0.410633, which would represent an increase of a strong 204.85% compared to its current values.

At the same time, machine learning price projecting platform CoinPriceForecast has set the price of Stellar at $0.15 (+11.36%) by the end of 2024, with the Stellar Lumens price prediction 2025 targeting $0.16 by mid-year and $0.17 by the year’s end, as per the latest forecasts.
Elsewhere, one of the more recent ChatGPT models by OpenAI, called GPT-4, has provided the possible Stellar price prediction 2024 values in the spectrum between $0.121 and $0.44, considering that XLM “has the potential for an upward price trajectory by the end of 2024.”
Meanwhile, ChatGPT’s major competitor and the latest Anthropic AI model, Claude 3 Opus, has offered its own conservative estimate in the area of $0.50 – $0.75, as well as the more optimistic target in the $1.00 – $1.50 zone, highlighting that:

“Stellar Lumens (XLM) has shown promising growth potential, with experts and analysts predicting a positive future for the cryptocurrency.”

Stellar Lumens price analysis
At press time, the price of Stellar Lumens stood at $0.1347, which means that XLM has advanced 0.81% on its daily chart, increasing 2.78% across the last week, adding up to its monthly gain of 15.03%, as per the latest data obtained by Finbold on March 25.

Incidentally, the recent price advances for XLM accompany its Stellar Development Foundation’s announcement of investing $100 million into the launch of its Soroban platform for dApp developers to increase its competitive edge against Ethereum.
Overall, Stellar Lumens price might, indeed, reach one of the AI platforms’ predictions offered above. However, the situation in this sector can change on a whim, so staying on top of any XLM news and doing one’s own research is important before investing in it.

Binance’s Russian successor CommEx to shut down in April

CommEx, the successor of Binance crypto exchange in Russia, has officially announced it is shutting down operations and has halted deposits.After acquiring Binance’s Russian business in an undisclosed deal in September 2023, CommEx is winding down its platform.CommEx posted an announcement on its official Telegram group on March 25, immediately halting deposits and closing down new registrations.“We have to announce the gradual suspension of operations on the CommEX platform,” the firm said, recommending users to immediately withdraw their assets to third-party wallets.According to the suspension roadmap, CommEx will stop servicing futures trading on March 28 and will also start suspending peer-to-peer exchange from April 2. On April 23, CommEx plans to completely shut down the spot trading platform and suspend its website by May 10.“User accounts that retain assets after May 10, 2024 will be subject to an asset management fee of 1% of assets,” the announcement notes.As previously reported, Binance hinted at exiting Russia in early September 2023 as top local executives including vice president of Eastern Europe Gleb Kostarev stepped down.A few weeks later, Binance claimed it sold its entire Russian business to the newly created exchange CommEx, but it declined to disclose any details about CommEx founders or executives. Subsequently, CommEx emphasized that it operated independently of Binance, but admitted that some of its core members were former Binance staf.The mysterious deal quickly sparked chatter among local crypto enthusiasts, who saw lots of similarities between Binance and CommEx websites, calling the new exchange a “Russian version” of Binance.US. At the time of the sale, Russia was the top market in terms of user visits on Binance.com, accounting for 6.9% of total visits.Related: Facing potential prison time, former Binance CEO hints at new projectThe Binance-CommEx deal came amid former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and Binance trying to assure a court in the United States to dismiss a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it filed in June 2023. The SEC sued Binance on allegations that the exchange offered the sale of unregistered securities and operated illegally in the United States.Zhao subsequently resigned Binance and pleaded guilty in November 2023. He now remains in the U.S. on bail with a $175 million bond after a judge rejected his petition to visit family in the United Arab Emirates. Originally scheduled for February 2024, Zhao’s sentence was postponed to late April.CommEx’s closure also comes amid more countries scrutinizing Binance globally. On March 25, the Philippines blocked local user access to Binance, citing concerns over the firm’s unlicensed operations in the country.

In a recent development within the crypto market, Solana (SOL) has shown remarkable performance by flipping a major resistance level into support, according to prominent crypto analyst Jelle. The digital asset, which has been in the limelight for its fast transaction speeds and low fees, is now heading toward what could be a record-breaking summer.According to Jelle's latest analysis, accompanied by a detailed chart, Solana has successfully turned its last significant resistance level before reaching new all-time highs into a support level. This crucial pivot is a key indicator of bullish sentiment surrounding the asset, with Jelle stating that this momentum is going to last longer and SOL is going above the $250 level by summer. Solana eyeing new all-time highThe chart shared by Jelle illustrates a robust upward trajectory for Solana, showcasing a significant rebound and sustained upward momentum. After a period of consolidation and bearish trends, the recent breakout signifies a potential shift in investor sentiment and market dynamics. The all-time high marker set at approximately $259.90 is now within reach, with the asset currently trading around the $190.24 mark.Over the last 24 hours, SOL has seen a substantial increase of 9.22%, and an impressive surge of 85.53% over the past month, indicating a robust recovery and growing investor confidence. The trading volume of Solana also mirrors this positive trend, with a 48.23% increase in the last 24 hours, currently standing at $3,389,882,302.Market analysts and investors are closely monitoring Solana's performance, as the crypto has demonstrated resilience and innovation in its ecosystem's development. The flip from resistance to support not only marks a technical achievement but also reinforces Solana's position as a strong contender in the crypto space.As the crypto market continues to react to this significant movement, all eyes will be on Solana as it approaches its previous all-time highs. With the backing of solid fundamentals and increasing adoption, the journey toward Jelle's $250 target by summer appears to be a plausible scenario for this burgeoning digital asset.

It’s standing above both the nearest support level at $33.98 and the second support level at $26.97, suggesting a solid foundation. However, with the current price at $54.02, already above the nearest resistance of $66.32, investors could see this as a moment to collect profits, which might slow down the momentum in the near term. Still, holding above the 10-day average of $55.68 could maintain the positive outlook as we look ahead.Long-term prospects look promising with the price movement considerably above the average of the past 100 days, standing at $40.59. This reflects a strong trend over the medium term as it’s well above this marker. Yet, it’s important to remember that it hasn’t reached its all-time high of $151.22, showing there is room for growth but also space for fluctuations. The price might stabilize around current levels before moving, and the second resistance at $51.66 could be tested. Should investor sentiment remain optimistic and the broader market condition favorable, we might witness sustainable growth but with usual market uncertainties along the way.Mantle’s Notable Growth and Price ForecastMantle has seen a notable increase of 12.48% in the last month and an impressive 106.21% in the last six months. With prices now at $0.816, hovering close to the 10-day SMA of $0.847, there’s potential for growth toward the $1.08 resistance level. If momentum continues, the longer-term prospect could see a push towards the $1.27 marker. Yet, market fluctuations could challenge this ascent with support levels at $0.634 and $0.374 providing fallbacks should the trend reverse. Traders might eye these levels for entry or exit, considering the 100-day SMA of $0.732 as a point of equilibrium.In the short term, Mantle’s price could fluctuate, particularly if it struggles to maintain its current level and falls below the 10-day SMA of $0.847. Continuing to stay under this could lead to tests of the nearest support at $0.634, and potentially, the second support at $0.374 in more substantial sell-offs. However, surpassing the nearest resistance at $1.08 may indicate stronger buyer confidence and open the way for testing the second resistance level at $1.27. Current price trends and indicators should be closely watched to navigate the volatility and seize potential opportunities either for gains or to minimize losses.Polygon’s Price Trends and Key Support LevelsIn the past month, Polygon’s price rose by 4.63%, suggesting a positive short-term trend. It’s currently below the simple moving average for the last 10 days, which might indicate a potential rebound or a further drop. If buyers step in, the price could move towards the nearest resistance at $1.13. However, if it fails to pick up, there’s a risk of dropping to the nearest support level at $0.815 or even to the second support level at $0.630. Investors should watch these levels closely.Over the past six months, Polygon has jumped by 93.96%, a strong sign of growth. This performance, paired with the all-time high of $3.003, shows its potential to climb in the long run. The price sitting below the 100-day simple moving average at $0.924 could be seen as a buying opportunity, as long-term investors might expect further gains. Nevertheless, any negative developments could test the support levels, and long-term holders should be prepared for fluctuations.Cardano’s Short-Term Rise Faces Resistance at $0.75In the last month, Cardano has climbed by about 5.52%, showing a positive trend in the short term. However, with the nearest resistance level at $0.75, it might encounter some pressure to rise further. The current price of $0.63 sits close to the 10-day simple moving average of $0.66, suggesting a potential move either way. A break above the nearest resistance could open the way toward the second resistance at $0.85. Given the recent six months’ sharp increase of 159.67%, the momentum might carry on, offering a chance for growth. Yet, the analysts’ mixed signals with a neutral RSI and a sell signal from the MACD and 10-day SMA show there could be some hesitation in the market.Looking at the longer-term picture, the all-time high of $3.160 reminds us of Cardano’s potential. However, current levels are far from this peak, and the long-term opportunity for a return to these highs would likely come from sustained developments and adoption of Cardano’s underlying technology. The 100-day SMA sits at $0.59, close to the current price, and indicates a buy signal, which might point to underlying strength in Cardano’s position. On the downside, should the price fall, the nearest support level is at $0.52, with a further safety net at $0.38. While these levels could represent areas of buying interest, they also signal where the price could stabilize if a downward trend takes hold. Investors would benefit from monitoring these levels for signs of either consolidation or a change in market sentiment.ConclusionIn conclusion, while a variety of altcoins such as Avalanche, Mantle, Polygon, and Cardano show promise with their respective price movements and outlooks, BlastUP stands out with the most substantial potential. Nestled within the robust Blast ecosystem, BlastUP not only boasts a strong concept but also fosters an innovative environment with a clear focus on community-driven growth. Investors considering the increasingly vibrant altcoin space would do well to watch BlastUP’s presale carefully, as it represents a harmonious blend of concept, ecosystem synergy, and foresight, potentially setting the stage for remarkable growth in the crypto horizon.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Weekly Crypto Preview: Top Events And Coins To Watch


								The crypto space is bracing for another eventful week, marked by several key developments and coins that are poised to influence market dynamics. So, here’s what investors and enthusiasts should be on the lookout for.
Bitcoin: A Watchful Eye On Spot ETF Outflows
Bitcoin remains at the forefront of investor attention, with the spotlight intensifying on the movements within spot Bitcoin ETFs. After experiencing an unprecedented streak of five consecutive days of net negative flows—a first since their inception on January 11—the market is keenly awaiting a potential turnaround.
Historically, ETFs have been significant for BTC, with a daily net inflow of $225 million on average – a target bulls will want to see. Financial Times recently wrote a hit piece, “Have the inflows into Bitcoin funds dried up?” The market needs to prove otherwise.
Meanwhile, renowned ETF expert Nate Geraci commented on the article, “Spot bitcoin ETFs have taken in a net $11bil & have $50bil AUM in 2+ months & the media is already trying to call it over… No idea what happens w/ flows moving forward, but someone pls tell them numerous RIAs & brokerage platforms haven’t even approved these things for use yet.”


US Inflation Data: The PCE Index
The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, set for release this Friday, could have a significant impact on the market. The PCE Index, particularly its core component that excludes food and energy, is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure. It offers a broad view of the inflationary pressures within the economy, influencing monetary policy decisions.

The upcoming release, expected to show year-over-year core PCE at 2.8%(last 2.8%) and month-over-month at 0.3% (last 0.4%), holds weight in the Fed’s interest rate trajectory. Given the Fed’s pause on rate cuts, the market is keenly observing this data for signals on future monetary policy, especially with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s insights anticipated at the end of the week (Friday).
This inflation data not only affects traditional finance but could also sway crypto markets, as Bitcoin and other digital assets have increasingly reacted to macroeconomic indicators in recent weeks.
Dogecoin: Futures Trading And ‘Doge Day’
Dogecoin is taking a significant leap forward with Coinbase International’s announcement of launching DOGE futures trading starting April 1. Coinbase officially announced on Thursday last week, “Coinbase Derivatives will launch the first leveraged and CFTC-regulated futures contracts for Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, and Litecoin in April!”
Futures trading for cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin allows investors to speculate on the future price of DOGE without holding the actual cryptocurrency. This can increase liquidity and volatility but also introduce a mechanism for price discovery and hedging against price movements. Coinbase Derivatives’ decision to offer these contracts could attract a new class of investors and traders to Dogecoin, potentially increasing its volatility.
Aptos: Anticipation Of Major Announcements
The Aptos network is on the cusp of potentially game-changing announcements, with speculation about partnerships with major asset managers like BlackRock or Franklin Templeton. The forthcoming ‘Aptos DeFi DAYS’ event in Hong Kong from April 2 to 5 could serve as the stage for these revelations, with significant implications for the network’s valuation and strategic positioning in the DeFi space.
“Aptos is poised for a significant RWA announcement in April. Potential partnership rumors with a major asset manager. (BlackRock/Franklin Templeton) I anticipate that details will be revealed at the ‘Aptos DeFi DAYS’ event on April 2”,” research firm Layergg remarked via X.
Fantom: The Sonic Mainnet Launch
The Fantom Foundation is on the verge of launching the Sonic mainnet, a major technological advancement that promises to significantly enhance the blockchain’s performance and scalability. This upgrade is not just an incremental update but a comprehensive overhaul of Fantom’s infrastructure, aiming to address some of the most pressing challenges in the blockchain and decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem.

At the heart of the Sonic upgrade is the Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM), a newly developed engine designed to dramatically increase transaction speed and efficiency. This is complemented by the Carmen Database, a breakthrough in data storage that promises to reduce storage requirements by up to 90%. Moreover, the upgrade includes an optimized version of the Lachesis Consensus mechanism, further enhancing the blockchain’s performance.
These innovations collectively aim to propel Fantom’s transaction capacity to over 2,000 transactions per second, marking a significant leap towards solving scalability issues that have long plagued blockchain platforms. Scheduled for launch in spring 2024, the Sonic Mainnet could further bolster the Fantom (FTM) price prior to the official release.
Ondo Finance: Riding The Crypto Wave Of RWA
Ondo Finance is the best-performing crypto asset in the top 100 by market cap in the last seven days, with a staggering 93.5% increase in price, following BlackRock’s announcement of a $100M tokenized asset to fund. As RWA becomes a focal point in the crypto narrative, Ondo Finance’s association with BlackRock places it at the heart of this burgeoning trend, highlighting the growing intersection between traditional finance and blockchain technology.
“Ondo Finance is the RWA project most associated with BlackRock at this point and Real World Assets (RWA) could be the next major trend in crypto. They are also mentioned as a key project in Bitwise’s ‘Crypto Use Case 2024’ report,” research firm Layergg stated via X.
At press time, BTC traded at $66,967.

XRP Ledger’s Shiny New AMM Runs Into Problems - Here’s What We Know | Bitcoinist.com


								Following the official launch of XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) Automated Market Maker (AMM), XLS-30, on March 22, developers unearthed various discrepancies linked to a system bug. As a result, an XRPL developer has called for a fix, highlighting the need for enhanced testing procedures and the incorporation of a Canary Network to bolster the AMM’s stability. 
XRPL’s New AMM Encounters Unexpected Bug
On March 24, the RippleX development team unveiled a technical glitch in its newly launched AMM. The revelation comes as a surprise to the general XRPL community, as they had been eagerly waiting for the protocol to roll out. 

According to the official statement released by the RippleX team, the technical glitch surfaced as a result of multiple discrepancies identified in several AMM pools. Upon investigation, the team revealed that the inconsistencies had “affected how the DEX payment engine routes liquidity through the AMM pools and order books.”
Addressing the issue, the development team has assured users that the engineering team were working diligently to resolve the bug issue and restore normal operation in the AMM. Additionally, they have advised users to remain cautious and avoid depositing new funds into the AMM pools until the dilemma has been rectified.
Despite the temporary setback, optimism remains in the XRPL community, with many expressing confidence in the development team’s ability to swiftly address the issue. The RippleX team has also stated that it has begun reviewing several proposed fixes for the AMM glitch, highlighting that the proposals will have to go through an amendment voting process before any solution is implemented.  
XRPL Dev Calls For Canary Network
In response to the technical challenges faced by XRPL’s new AMM, WietseWind, one of the developers of the XRP Ledger has proposed a long-term solution that could potentially ensure a more stable protocol. According to the developer, the discovery of a bug in the newly launched AMM is evidence of the fragility of the protocol, emphasizing a lack of proper testing before launch.

WietseWind has stated the need for the development of a Canary Network to enhance and improve the AMM. He revealed that the Canary Network will have to be separate from the AMM, while also offering a native asset of some value so individuals can use it for real-life scenarios.
The developer has disclosed that the Canary Network would enable better testing with real value on a network that is not the mainnet. Additionally, it would be an inclusive network for the developers, projects, and everyone within the XRPL community.

Bitcoin ETF snapshot: Net outflow run hits five days for the first time - Blockworks


The 10 US spot bitcoin ETFs collectively saw net outflows each day last week — an unprecedented streak for the so far successful segment. 
The funds saw $888 million of investor money leave over the five-day span, according to BitMEX Research data. The largest outflow chunks came on March 19 and March 20, at $326 million and $262 million, respectively. 
Those net outflows slowed later in the week, with $94 million coming on Thursday and $52 million flowing out on Friday. 
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) had its all-time low flow total for a single day on Friday, tallying just $19 million, the BitMEX Research data shows. 
Still, IBIT — along with the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF — have brought in net inflows during each of their first 50 days trading. Such a feat has never been accomplished by new ETFs, analysts note.

It was the first time the sector saw five straight days of net outflows. The ETFs had notched outflows on four straight days from Jan. 22 to Jan. 25.
The latest outflow streak came after a record week for the funds, during which they saw $2.5 billion of net inflows.  
But bitcoin’s price dropped from nearly $68,000 on March 18 to below $61,000 on — a slip of more than 10%. It fluctuated up and down later in the week, but remained well off its all-time high of more than $73,000 set on March 14.
BTC’s price stood at $67,000 at about 7 a.m. ET Monday.  
“We believe the recent price correction led to hesitancy from investors, leading to much lower inflows into new ETF issuers in the US,” CoinShares head of research James Butterfill wrote in a Monday report.
The new ETF bitcoin fund issuers exclude Grayscale Investments, which converted its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF on Jan. 11. GBTC’s nine competitors have often been able to more than offset the higher-priced Grayscale fund’s persistent outflows, but not last week. 
GBTC outflows amounted to about $2 billion, while the other nine funds brought in about $1.1 billion.
Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in a Monday X post that outflows may have been driven in part by bankrupt lender Genesis offloading its shares of GBTC. 
“Expecting that to slow over the next week,” he added.

Binance Academy and BNB Chain introduce innovative developer training program


Binance Academy, the arm of Binance dedicated to cryptocurrency education, has teamed up with BNB Chain, the largest layer-1 blockchain platform, to introduce an innovative online course titled BNB Chain Developer Specialization, according to the information shared with Finbold on March 25. 
The aim of the initiative is to provide new Web3 software with the skills necessary to foster growth in the realms of Web3, cryptocurrency, and technology.
The program is a result of the growing demand for proficient Web3 developers and a desire to cultivate a larger pool of talent capable of driving innovation within the industry. 


No prior knowledge of any of the blockchain fundamentals is necessary, and the course is entirely free of charge.
The organization of the program
Twenty courses, all delivered in English, feature a curated selection of two to six videos delving into a diverse array of topics ranging from foundational blockchain concepts to more advanced topics such as smart contracts, solidity, Web3, decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), Greenfield architecture, and more.
Learning materials are curated to engage participants and pitching of ideas, incorporating a blend of video lectures, readings, practice assessments, and graded evaluations.
Web3 democratization
The overarching objective is to democratize Web3 adoption by educating participants on the intricacies of developing advanced Web3 apps on the blockchain. 
BNB Chain sees the initiative as part of its portfolio of builder support programs, with the dual purpose of empowering individuals to explore Web3 development and work on improving existing skills.
Having successfully completed the course, participants will be awarded a digital certificate, testifying to their newfound expertise and potentially opening doors to more opportunities within the industry.
Yi He, Co-Founder of Binance, emphasized the pivotal role of education in propelling the growth and adoption of blockchain and Web3 technologies, stating: 

“Blockchain and Web3 are setting a precedent in innovations across industries around the world. Education is critical to further development and adoption, and it provides new opportunities for individuals as these technologies shape our future and the global economy. We prioritize making education accessible, which is a core part of our user-focused principles and mission to increase financial accessibility and sustainable innovation as an industry leader supporting the growth of the larger ecosystem. With this specialized blockchain developer program, we hope to encourage and support more people to be part of building the future of these new technologies set to change our society and revolutionize industries.”
– Yi He, Co-Founder of Binance

BNB Chain’s rise to prominence
BNB Chain has emerged as a formidable blockchain entity, boasting unparalleled popularity and efficacy. 
With opBNB ranking as the foremost blockchain platform by daily active users (71 million transactions daily at an average cost of $0.001), and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) reigning as the premier L1 blockchain by the same metrics (a total locked value surpassing $4 billion), the platform has solidified its status as a community-driven blockchain ecosystem of paramount importance.
The collaboration with BNB Chain thus marks a significant addition to Binance Academy’s portfolio of global educational initiatives such as Learn & Earn campaigns and the University Outreach Program. 
At the same time, it complements BNB Chain’s efforts to support builders through programs such as the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) program and grants like the TVL and DAU Incentive programs. 
Together, the initiatives welcome millions into the digital economy and foster innovation at every turn.

Detained Binance Executive Escapes Custody in Nigeria: Report - Decrypt

One of two Binance executives detained in Nigeria has escaped custody, according to local media reports.Nigerian publication Premium Times reported that Binance's regional manager for Africa Nadeem Anjarwalla had fled the guest house in Abuja where he and the exchange's Head of Financial Crime Compliance Tigran Gambaryan were being detained. Anjarwalla reportedly escaped after guards took him to a nearby mosque for Ramadan prayers.Anjarwalla, who holds dual British and Kenyan citizenship, is believed to have used his Kenyan passport to board a flight on a "Middle East airliner," according to an immigration official cited by Premium Times; his final destination is unknown.Anjarwalla's British passport, which he used to enter Nigeria, was surrendered to authorities when he was detained. He is believed to have used his privileged access to telephones at the "comfortable guest house" where he was detained to plan his escape; his fellow Binance executive Gambaryan remains in detention.The pair were initially detained in Nigeria in February, although criminal charges had not yet been brought against them. Meanwhile the country's authorities were investigatng cryptocurrency exchanges. Under the terms of a court order, Nigeria’s anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, was permitted to detain Anjarwalla and Gambaryan for 14 days, ending in early March.

This Crypto Exchange in Russian Is Closing Down


CommEx, the crypto exchange heralded as the Russian alternative to Binance, announced it is shutting down. 
This development comes after CommEx took over Binance’s operations in Russia in a deal that was shrouded in secrecy. The announcement, made through its official Telegram channel, outlined a phased shutdown process beginning with the cessation of new user registrations effective immediately.
Crypto Exchange CommEX Closes Doors
CommEx’s decision to halt operations has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community in Russia. The phased closure will see the suspension of asset transfers from Binance, alongside a stop on all fiat and cryptocurrency deposits starting today. 
This move precedes the termination of futures trading set for later this week and the suspension of new peer-to-peer listings by April 2. The closure timeline extends to April 23, when the spot market will cease operations, culminating in the crypto exchange’s website becoming inaccessible by May 10.

“We are forced to announce a gradual suspension of operations on the CommEX platform starting March 25, 2024. We recommend promptly closing positions and withdrawing assets to external wallets,” CommEx wrote.


In light of these developments, CommEx has advised its users to expediently close their positions and withdraw their cryptocurrencies to avoid a management fee of 1% on remaining balances post-May 10. This fee imposition indicates a firm end to the platform’s activities, pushing users to secure their investments without delay.

The closure of CommEx comes after Binance’s strategic retreat from the Russian market amidst increasing regulatory scrutiny. Binance’s exit, through selling its Russian business to CommEx just before the latter’s launch, was a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market in Russia. 

Now, as CommEx ceases operations, the market faces new challenges and uncertainties. This situation reflects the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, not just in Russia but globally, with regulatory pressures continuing to shape the operations of crypto exchanges.

12,000 Shiba Inu Whale-Tier Transactions out of Nowhere: What's Happening?

Amid a Shiba Inu rally, we have seen ups and downs for a number of whale-tier transactions. There is a good reason for that.Two theories stand out: first, profit-taking during SHIB's price rise is a likely cause. Investors seeing the price spike may decide to cash in on their gains, leading to a large number of transactions. Second, during a market correction, transactional activity often ramps up as traders engage in profit-taking, margin trading and leveraging, trying to capitalize on the volatile price movements.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewSHIB is currently trading at a pivotal price of $0.00002758. This is a crucial moment, as it hovers around a key support level at $0.00001954, where SHIB has previously managed to hold steady. If this level can be maintained, it could be a springboard for future growth.Looking up, we find a resistance level at $0.00003500. For SHIB to enter a solid growth phase, it needs to break past this barrier. If successful, it could signify the beginning of an extended upward trend, possibly reaching for newer heights.If the support holds firm and market conditions stay favorable, we might witness SHIB climbing toward that resistance level. However, the volatility of the market means that these movements could change rapidly, and the community should watch these levels closely.While the massive number of transactions may point to a variety of strategic moves by big holders, SHIB's future on the market will largely depend on its ability to sustain key support levels and break through resistance barriers. Additionally, keep in mind that the correction on the crypto market has just concluded, and it is too early to form any assumptions.

Polygon Resolves Outage in zkEVM Beta, Eyes AI-based NFT Innovations | Coinspeaker



Soon after the outage, the Emergency Council for Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta swiftly intervened thereby issuing a fix in no time. 

The Polygon zkEVM project that’s currently in the beta stage of development witnessed a major outage over the last weekend facing a 10-hour long downtime. This happened due to a major sequencer issue resulting from the reorganization within the Layer-1 network.
The good thing about this was that the downtime was limited to Polygon zkEVM, and didn’t spread further to Polygon PoS or CDK. However, the Emergency Council for Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta quickly swung into action while implementing the fix and restoring normal network operations in a few hours.




The Polygon team has assured to release a comprehensive post-mortem analysis on the @0xPolygonFdn forum early next week. This way it seeks to to provide transparency and a deeper understanding of what actually led to the outage within the Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta.


Polygon developer Jarrod Watts has provided a detailed analysis of the recent incident involving Polygon zkEVM. The developer also underlines its significance in discussions surrounding Layer 2 (L2) upgradeability. The sequence of events unfolded with a block production halt in zkEVM. This forced the Security Council to initiate the emergency state to hasten upgrades. Later, the Security Council disabled the emergency state following an upgrade to rectify the issue. This way they were able to quickly restore regular chain operations.
Furthermore, Watts also stressed the necessity of Layer 2 upgradeability. He emphasized its role in facilitating future enhancements on L1, bug fixes, and vulnerability patches.
However, Watts acknowledged concerns regarding the potential for malicious upgrades in the current L2 network landscape. The developer emphasized the credibility of discussions regarding the relative centralization of Layer 2 solutions in comparison to other specific Layer 1 networks.


Polygon Eyes Move into AI-based NFT Innovations
As per the latest development, Polygon is moving towards a more stable and sustainable future, while emphasizing real-world applications and services. The Polygon team is also mulling over the integration of generative AI for NFT creation as part of its key development agenda.
Polygon Labs has collaborated with ChainGPT with the goal of simplifying and democratizing AI-powered NFT creation. It will do this by leveraging Polygon’s scalable network and ChainGPT’s advanced AI infrastructure. This also underscores the potential of generative AI to revolutionize the NFT space. So far after this collaboration, the Polygon blockchain has minted over 7,000 NFTs.
As the industry looks towards its next bull run, players like Polygon and others are focusing on innovation, real-world utility, and the integration of advanced technologies like AI for NFT creation.

This is Why Russia Finance Minister Rejects Crypto Prohibition


Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov voiced a strong stance against the outright prohibition of crypto. 
Highlighting the ongoing dialogue between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Russia, Siluanov revealed plans to delve into the practicalities of employing cryptocurrencies for domestic and international settlements.
Russia Finance Minister: Why Crypto Ban is a Bad Idea
Siluanov’s remarks reflect a pragmatic approach toward the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing the necessity of regulation over restriction. 

“I am sure that the Central Bank and we will come to an agreement. This issue has been discussed for several years. We cannot prohibit the circulation of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, we need to regulate this channel. I am sure that we will find a solution,” Siluanov stated.

The discourse around cryptocurrency mining and its potential application in settling transactions has gained traction. Both governmental bodies expressed a preliminary inclination toward leveraging cryptocurrencies for external payments. This nuanced position reflects a broader consideration of the role of cryptocurrencies within Russia’s financial system, balancing between innovation and fiscal oversight.

Indeed, the dialogue is expected to shed light on permissible activities within the cryptocurrency domain. Especially, on international financial interactions.

“We need to talk about what can and cannot be done with cryptocurrency. We have now agreed with the Central Bank to discuss the issue of mining – whether the results of this process can be used for settlements within the country and in international settlements,” Siluanov added.

The backdrop to these discussions includes supportive remarks from Elvira Nabiullina, Head of the Bank of Russia. She previously endorsed the experimental use of cryptocurrency and mining in cross-border settlements. Siluanov’s affirmation of regulatory intentions further cements the government’s commitment to fostering a controlled yet vibrant cryptocurrency sector.

The economic implications of such regulatory advancements are substantial. With miners poised to generate liquidity for foreign trade settlements upwards of $2.59 billion, there is a vast potential for enhanced tax revenues from industrial mining. Indeed, Sergei Bezdelov, Director of the Industrial Mining Association, highlighted the fiscal benefits of a regulated crypto framework.

Bitcoin (BTC) Bulls Eyeing $70,000 Again, Ethereum and Other Altcoins Set to Follow Suit, Predicts Analyst | Coinspeaker



According to Michaël van de Poppe, most of altcoins have reached the bottom level and are now stabilizing.

The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a notable decline after reaching a new all-time high in mid-March. The price then retraced to $60,000 within a week before showing signs of recovery. This period of decline was seen as a time when many traders started taking profits after the excitement of the new all-time high.
Various on-chain analyses also show a large number of whale wallet withdrawals following this period, which forced the price to decline. At the time of writing, the price has been recovering and has risen to $66,800. As a result, various analysts are conducting research to determine where the price might be headed next and the factors that could trigger it.




One of the analysts is the popular Michaël van de Poppe, CEO and founder of MN Trading, who is followed by more than 700 thousand people on X. In a recent post, the analyst predicted that Bitcoin price will reach $70,000 again this week based on factors he has revealed in his analysis.


Why Bitcoin (BTC) Could Reach $70,000 This Week
Michaël’s prediction was based on the candlestick structure that closed the previous week in the crypto market. According to him, the weekly price action suggests that the price has bottomed out for most altcoins. He also observed that Bitcoin has reached a critical support level, and the price is expected to reach $70,000 by the end of this week.
A more critical look at the Bitcoin chart shows that the price is already below a critical resistance level between $67,800 and $68,600. The bulls will have to break above this level for a chance to reach $70,000. It is worth noting that the price has been trading below this price zone since March 16.
In a different analysis, another prominent crypto enthusiast on X, Ali, also provided insight into what might happen to BTC if it breaks past $66,990. In his post, he suggested that the price of the coin could spike up to $72,880. This further showcases the optimism of crypto analysts towards the bullish trend of Bitcoin in the coming weeks. A close above the resistance levels mentioned should give bulls much more confidence and make the price spike to $70,000.


Altcoins Expected to See Higher Highs
Van de Poppe, in the same post, shifted attention to the altcoin market, stating that most of these coins have reached the bottom level and are now stabilizing. Ethereum, for example, saw its price skyrocket to over $4,100 in mid-March before dropping down to $3,067, where it bottomed. Since then, it has been trading sideways between $3,200 and $3,500, indicating that bulls are accumulating before a major price increase. A similar pattern has been noticed with the price of Cardano, Polkadot, and many other altcoins.
Crypto traders and investors can start watching out for the breakout in Bitcoin and some other altcoins or metrics that represent a good entry opportunity as the market anticipates another bullish rally.

Why Block Has a Cap on Employee Headcount and Why It Does Not Support Ethereum | Cryptoglobe


                                
Earlier today, in a comprehensive discussion with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, Block Inc.’s CFO and COO Amrita Ahuja shared in-depth insights into the company’s strategic direction, innovative product offerings, and future growth prospects. 



Block, Inc. (formerly known as Square, Inc.) is a technology company co-founded by Jack Dorsey, who is also a co-founder of Twitter. Block focuses on financial services and mobile payments, offering a range of products that include payment processing for businesses, point-of-sale systems, and peer-to-peer money transfer via its Cash App. The company rebranded from Square to Block in December 2021 to reflect its broader commitment to blockchain technology and to accommodate its expanding portfolio, which includes Tidal, a music streaming service, and TBD54566975, a platform focused on developing an open developer platform with the goal of making it easier to access Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies.



The CFO (Chief Financial Officer) of Block, Inc. is Amrita Ahuja. She also holds the position of Chief Operating Officer (COO) at the company. Before joining Block, Ahuja served as the CFO of Blizzard Entertainment, a division of Activision Blizzard, and has held various leadership positions at Fox Networks Group, the Walt Disney Company, and Morgan Stanley.



Jim Cramer is a well-known television personality, former hedge fund manager, and best-selling author. He is most famous for being the host of “Mad Money” on CNBC, a television show where he offers investment advice and stock market analysis.



Ahuja talked about the instrumental role of Cash App in the company’s strategy and its burgeoning impact on younger demographics.



With 56 million monthly active users, Cash App’s engagement metrics are noteworthy, with a significant portion of users interacting with the app on a weekly and daily basis. Ahuja highlighted the app’s appeal to Gen Z and younger users, driven by features like the customizable, free Visa debit card. A pivotal focus for Block is family account feature of the Cash App, which is designed to serve a demographic that’s typically underserved by traditional financial institutions. Ahuja says that as these young users grow into the mainstay of the economy, Block’s potential to expand its user base and increase inflows is substantial.



Ahuja discussed Block’s strategic approach to growth, emphasizing the role of constraints in fostering creativity and prioritization. With a lean team, the company aims to focus on high-impact initiatives that directly benefit customers while simultaneously driving margin expansion. Block’s commitment to achieving the rule of 40 by 2026—a balance of growth and profitability—was underlined as a testament to its strategic discipline.



Addressing the democratization of investment, Ahuja spoke about Cash App’s fractional share offerings, allowing users to invest as little as a dollar in major stocks. This feature is part of Block’s mission to make financial services more accessible and inclusive. On the topic of cryptocurrency, the focus remains squarely on Bitcoin, leveraging the lightning network and other initiatives to enhance its utility as both a currency and a store of value.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

On the subject of Bitcoin, Cramer said:



“We are big fans of Bitcoin. We are not against it; we think it’s a great store of value.“



On 31 January 2022, Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) and Afterpay Limited announced the completion of their arrangement, with Block acquiring all issued shares of Afterpay. This move was designed to enhance Block’s ability to offer more accessible financial products and services, broadening consumer access and supporting sellers of various sizes in generating additional revenue. The acquisition aligns with Block’s strategic goals for its Square and Cash App platforms, aiming to introduce ‘buy now, pay later’ (BNPL) options at checkout, integrate Afterpay installment payment management within Cash App, and allow Cash App users to find sellers and BNPL promotions in the app.



The integration of Afterpay into Block’s ecosystem represents a significant stride toward intertwining commerce with financial services. Ahuja touched on the synergies between Afterpay, Square, and Cash App, illustrating Block’s unique position to revolutionize how consumers and merchants interact in the digital economy.



Perhaps the two most interesting parts of this conversation were when Ahuja talked about Square’s cap on employee headcount and when she was asked about potential future support for other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum.



She mentioned that Block has a cap of approximately 12,000 employees, a decision driven by the leadership’s commitment to fostering creativity and prioritizing key initiatives. This approach, she explained, is about using constraints to drive creativity and strategic focus, ensuring that the company remains agile and responsive to its customers’ needs while also focusing on the bottom line for significant margin expansion opportunities.



This cap was described as a way to maintain a disciplined focus on what matters most, which in turn helps the company in prioritizing work and thinking strategically about the most beneficial projects for its customers. The decision to implement this cap was jointly made across Block’s leadership but was notably influenced by Jack Dorsey’s vision for the company, reflecting a broader organizational ethos of making the most out of limited resources to spur innovation and efficiency.



With regard to future support for other cryptocurrencies, Cramer inquired whether individuals could open an account to buy Ethereum through Block’s platform. Ahuja’s response was clear and focused: Block only deals with Bitcoin. She explained that the company believes Bitcoin has the longest life, best brand, and an open developer ecosystem, which presents a significant opportunity. Despite Cramer’s probing on the potential expansion to include other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ahuja reiterated Block’s commitment to Bitcoin, emphasizing trust and focus as critical components of their strategy. This stance reflects Block’s strategic decision to concentrate on Bitcoin, leveraging its position in the cryptocurrency space while maintaining a straightforward approach to digital asset offerings.

Ripple CTO Clarifies Recent XRPL AMM Issue


Ripple chief technology officer David Schwartz has published a tweet in which he rushed to address recently rolled out AMMs on XRP Ledger. He did it as a clarification of what has happened, going into details on how Ripple’s AMMs on XRPL work.The Automated Market Maker feature (AMM) was launched on the XRP Ledger on Friday, and the Ripple CTO published a celebratory tweet about that over the weekend. However, shortly after that, a major bug emerged on AMM, causing its temporary suspension. The RippleX developer team has already identified this discrepancy in several AMM liquidity pools, and they are working to fix it.Ripple CTO's comment on AMM glitchDavid Schwartz tweeted that the above-mentioned issue was not caused by the single-sided deposit feature embedded into AMMs. Here he repeated his warning from Saturday about this type of deposit – they “allow for a more streamlined user experience, but can lead to price impacts when pools have less liquidity.” Previously, he warned that these “price impacts” basically mean a loss for traders during the deposit process – the system reports it as “slippage.” However, the CTO warned, it should happen very seldom since, if the AMM stays out of balance, it most likely means that other traders are missing an opportunity to make a profit on it as well.The advice offered by David Schwartz for trading via these new AMMs in the future is this: “It’s best for users to review the price impact in their tooling before submitting a transaction and front-end apps should display this information to users.” RippleX dev calls for Canary Network creationRippleX developer (creator of the Xumm Wallet) Wietse Wind published a tweet in which he stated that the issue with the AMM bug on XRP Ledger requires the creation of a Canary Network on Ripple’s layer-1 blockchain.The Canary Network, per Wind, would serve as a test-bed for various major upgrades, tools and products before they go live on the mainnet.Wietse insisted that if such a testing ground had existed and the AMM feature had been tested on it, the recent major issue would have never taken place on XRPL.

Bitcoin Diamond Hands Broken: HODLers Sell 669,000 BTC


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin long-term holders, or so-called “diamond hands,” have transferred a total of 669,000 BTC over the past month.
Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Sold Big In Past 30 Days
As explained by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the Bitcoin network has observed multiple transactions involving a large amount of dormant coins.
Transfers involving old coins are attributed to the “long-term holder” (LTH) cohort. The LTHs refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago.

Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell or transfer the tokens at any point. As such, the LTHs are considered the more resolute part of the market.
These HODLers don’t easily sell due to this strong conviction and swiftly ride past both periods of downtrends and uptrends. The short-term holders (STHs), who make up for the rest of the sector, are the ones who make panic moves during such periods.
As the LTHs don’t often sell, the times that they do participate in distribution can be all the more note-worthy. One way to track whether these holders are selling or not is through their 30-day “net position change,” which is a metric that keeps track of the net amount exiting or entering the cohort.
Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that reveals the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the history of the cryptocurrency:

The value of the metric appears to have been highly negative in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant
As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day net position change of the Bitcoin LTHs has assumed a deep red value recently. In the past month, these HODLers have removed 669,000 BTC from their wallets.
Something to keep in mind is that when it comes to accumulation, the net position change has a delay attached to it. This is because the LTH supply only increases 155 days after the purchase has been made, since the newly bought coins have to first mature enough to be a part of this age group.
In the case of distribution, though, the same is obviously not true, since any coins that get transferred on the blockchain have their age reset back to zero instantly.
The recent negative net position spike for the LTHs is quite big. To put things into perspective, the BTC amount that these diamond hands have transacted with this spike is equal to around $44.7 billion in the US Dollar, a staggering value.
It would seem that the latest events of the cryptocurrency, which have included a brand new all-time high (ATH) and a crash, have forced even these diamond hands to break their streak.
From the chart, it’s visible that the LTHs have sold big when new Bitcoin ATHs have been set in the past bull rallies as well. Interestingly, though, the peak of these spikes has only coincided with a price top partway through each run, and not the actual cycle peak.

In BTC-scale, the negative 30-day net position spike from the LTHs has been smaller this time than both that observed during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. This is only the case so far, however, as it’s unclear whether the peak LTH net distribution has ended or not.
BTC Price
Bitcoin has been making another attempt at recovery during the past few days as its price has now surged back towards the $67,000 level.

Earnings Preview: Buzzfeed Aims for Turnaround with Projected Q4 EPS - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Buzzfeed (NASDAQ: BZFD), the prominent digital media company known for its viral content and journalism, will likely release its fourth-quarter financial results on March 25, 2024, following the close of the market. 



Wall Street Expects Buzzfeed’s Q4 EPS to be $0.06



Wall Street analysts have closely monitored Buzzfeed’s progress and set expectations for the upcoming earnings report. The consensus among analysts suggests that the company will report earnings per share (EPS) of $0.06, a notable improvement from the loss of $0.75 per share experienced in the same quarter of the previous year. This positive shift in earnings has garnered attention from investors keen to see if Buzzfeed can sustain this upward trajectory.



However, analysts have also projected that Buzzfeed’s revenue will decline 22.29% compared to the prior year quarter, with an expected revenue of $104.6 million.



This decrease in revenue reflects the ongoing adjustments and strategic shifts within the company as it navigates the challenges posed by the dynamic digital media industry.





Impact of Complex Sale



During the third quarter of 2023, Buzzfeed reported an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.09, which fell slightly below the forecasted -$0.08 but demonstrated a year-over-year improvement from the -$0.19 reported in the same quarter of the previous year. This improvement in profitability has been a focal point for the company as it navigates the challenges of the digital media landscape.



Buzzfeed’s historical revenue trends have been variable in recent quarters, reflecting its efforts to stabilize and improve its financial outcomes amid changing market conditions. As the fourth-quarter earnings report approaches, investors and analysts will closely monitor key highlights and strategic moves that could shape the company’s future.



One significant development is Buzzfeed’s announcement of selling Complex to NTWRK for $108.6 million in an all-cash deal. This strategic move aims to enhance profitability and allow the company to focus more on its core brands, including Buzzfeed, HuffPost, First We Feast (featuring the popular show “Hot Ones”), and Tasty. Additionally, Buzzfeed plans to implement a 16% reduction in its workforce, expected to result in approximately $23 million in annualized compensation cost savings. This restructuring is designed to streamline operations, reduce centralized costs, and make the company more agile and profitable.



Buzzfeed intends to utilize the proceeds from the sale of Complex to redeem a portion of its convertible notes due in 2026, eliminate its revolving credit facility, finance the strategic restructuring, and optimize working capital.



CEO Jonah Peretti has emphasized the company’s focus on iconic brands and the acceleration of innovation powered by AI and interactive content formats as key strategic moves for Buzzfeed’s next growth stage.







Do you see Buzzfeed meeting earnings expectations and maintaining its upward profit trajectory? Let us know in the comments below.

Solana Meme Coin Mania Continues, Coinbase's BASE L2 May Be the Next Big Opportunity For Memecoin Investors - Benzinga

With crypto booming in 2024, it is not surprising that meme coins have been a huge part of the craze. Older meme coins, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have performed well and led the way, while a host of new meme coins have risen the ranks and are continuing to perform well. A solid portion of the newest meme coins are coming from the Solana chain. These tokens, such as dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK) and Book of Meme (BOME) were created recently and have seen huge gains. For example, BOME went from a market cap of $4 million to nearly $1.5 billion within 72 hours of launch. Don't Miss:These tokens have also been a huge catalyst for Solana (SOL). The project has seen a strong resurgence since late 2022, following the collapse of FTX Trading Ltd. A sizable amount of this revival could be attributed to memes and the volume that they have brought to the token and chain. These new meme coins have made multimillionaires overnight, causing many to start searching for the next meme coin that could potentially hit it big. Fortunately, Coinbase's Layer-2 solution, called Base, could provide the groundwork for another meme coin wave.Base launched in summer 2023 and is a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. This means that it provides a scalable and easy-to-use development environment for the Ethereum chain. For meme coins, this allows users to create new tokens easily and gives them access to a wide variety of buyers and volume through Coinbase's platform. Though Base is still picking up steam, it has already become a feeding frenzy for meme coins. Fifteen out of the top 20 tokens that use the Base platform are meme coins, according to blockchain aggregation tool Dexscreener. Trending: Bitcoin to $100,000? Here’s what gold bug Peter Schiff said could happen on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast.Some of these tokens are also performing extremely well. For example, Roost on Base (ROOST) began trading on the morning of March 22 for $0.00034. By noon, the price was well above $0.07, creating gains of over 20,000%. To put this into perspective, an investment of $1,000 when the token began trading would have been worth over $200,000. ROOST is not an isolated incident. Other tokens, such as Based Chad (BASED), Pepebutblue (PBB), BoolRan (BOOL) and more than 20 other tokens are up more than 500% in the last 24 hours. Base has provided users with an open-source development solution, allowing virtually anyone to release their own meme coin and have access to the more than $500 million in volume that the Layer 2 supports. The already-established prevalence of meme coins has inevitably brought meme coin degeneracy to peak heights. Read Next:

                        Sultan Gustaf Al Ghozali, the Indonesian college student who became an internet sensation in 2022 for selling millions of dollars worth of NFTs featuring his daily selfies, is back in the spotlight with a meme coin presale.Ghozali announced the second edition of “Ghozali Everyday” on March 224th. This project uniquely blends meme coins with NFTs on the Base blockchain. The project’s presale surpassed its initial target of 400 Ether (ETH), reaching 527 ETH.Ghozali Returns to X with Meme Coin and NFT Hybrid Project: Announces Second Iteration of ‘Ghozali Everyday’In January 2022, Sultan Gustaf Al Ghozali, a 22-year-old computer science student from Semarang, Indonesia, made waves in the crypto world by minting nonfungible tokens (NFTs) featuring daily selfies he took over five years. He captured nearly 1,000 self-portraits that chronicled his journey from 18 to 22.These selfies, taken as a personal reflection on his academic journey, depicted him sitting or standing in front of his computer in various poses. This collection, named “Ghozali Everyday,” quickly gained traction within the crypto community, earning Ghozali, a student at the time, more than $1 million.Reflecting on his success, Ghozali expressed gratitude for the support and opportunity to turn a personal project into a profitable venture. He announced on X that with his graduation, he would no longer continue the daily selfie tradition, marking the end of an era that unexpectedly brought him financial success and recognition in the NFT space.On March 22, after being absent from X for several months, Ghozali returned amidst the rising interest in meme coins. He made a significant announcement about the second iteration of his project, “Ghozali Everyday,” which now combined meme coins and NFTs in an ERC-404 format on the Base blockchain. To kick things off, he initiated an airdrop for the holders of the first Ghozali Everyday NFTs.Following this, on March 24, Ghozali unveiled the launch of the second part of “Ghozali Everyday.” He disclosed the presale address with an intended cap set at 400 ETH. However, the presale quickly exceeded this limit, reaching 527 ETH, equivalent to around $1.8 million at the time of writing.Despite the overwhelming response, Ghozali took to X to announce that he would refund those who sent more than 2 ETH after the cap was reached. He also clarified that the cap would not increase, ensuring fairness and transparency in the project’s execution.Solana’s Meme Coin Craze: Traders Flock Amid Bitcoin’s Bullish Surge
Amidst the recent bullish run of Bitcoin (BTC) prices, there has been a resurgence of interest in meme coins, mainly driven by traders on the Solana blockchain. Notably, data indicates that presale projects on Solana raised an astounding $100 million within just three days, from March 15 to 18.This surge in funding reflects a trend where meme coin founders are leveraging token presales to raise significant amounts for unreleased coins. The presale mechanism typically involves investors sending cryptocurrency to a specified wallet address in exchange for the distribution of tokens once the coin is officially launched. Nevertheless, there’s no guarantee of receiving tokens in return, making presales susceptible to fraud and scams.The recent frenzy surrounding meme coin presales peaked with the launch of Book of Meme on March 14. Created by the pseudonymous artist Darkfarms1, the coin initially held a valuation of approximately $4 million but skyrocketed by an astonishing 36,000% within just 56 hours, reaching a peak market capitalization of $1.45 billion.While the profitability of meme coins has captivated the crypto space, concerns about the presale model and its associated risks surfaced.

Why Did Vitalik Buterin Leave X? Asks Elon Musk


							

Elon Musk has asked why Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin left X.



Buterin’s X account remains active but has dropped in active engagements.



A crypto user thinks Buterin needs to engage more on X for Ethereum’s benefit.




Elon Musk, the owner of X, has asked why Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin left the social media network. Musk’s question was in response to a user who suggested Buterin needs to get back on the platform with engagements promoting Ethereum.







Buterin’s account on the social media platform remains active as of the time of writing, with over 5.2 million followers. However, data highlighted that Ethereum’s co-founder posts more frequently on the decentralized social network Farcaster.



Considering Buterin’s X account status, the original post from the user suggested the Ethereum co-founder needs to become more active on X. He believes abandoning X for Farcaster would not benefit Buterin and Ethereum. According to the user, “Farcaster isn’t going to win the culture war.”



The X tweet said: “If he (Buterin) wants Ethereum to shine, he should engage more on this platform (X), not sequester himself with his chosen peers on an island.” The crypto user believes Buterin will have far more impact if he engages with the more populated X community.



In January, Buterin acknowledged he chose Farcaster over X due to the habit of most X users.  Tyler John, a technology policy grantmaker at Longview had observed how followers regularly rain down on the Ethereum founder’s posts. 



According to John, a deluge of sycophants, crypto bots, and followers on X rain down on Buterin’s posts with tickers, memes, and expressions of praise. Such behavior relegates the actual posts to the background. Hence, the Ethereum founder adopted appending every reply with “srry 4 ratio-ing.” Buterin responded to John’s post, acknowledging the situation as part of the reasons he turned to Farcaster for most of his posts.

Philippines to block Binance exchange

The financial regulator of the Philippines will block local user access to Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, citing concerns over the firm’s unlicensed operations in the country.The country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it received the assistance of the National Telecommunication Commission (NTC) to block access to Binance’s website and online trading platform, according to a March 25 document by the SEC.“The SEC has identified the aforementioned platform and concluded that the public’s continued access to these websites/apps poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing Filipinos,” SEC Chairperson Emilio B. Aquino said in the letter-request addressed to the NTC.The Philippines’ financial watchdog alleges that Binance offers investment products such as leveraged trading services and crypto savings accounts without the required licenses, which violates the Securities Regulation Code.The ban will take effect within three months to offer investors time to exit their position held through Binance, according to the SEC. The agency also asked Google and Meta to block Binance-related advertising from showing up on their platforms for Filipino users.The ban in the Philippines is the most recent regulatory blow to Binance, which has been facing increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide. In December 2023, a U.S. court ordered Binance to pay $2.7 billion and its former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, to pay $150 million to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The settlement marked the conclusion of a long-running case against Binance, which was sued by the CFTC in March 2023 for evading federal law and operating an illegal derivatives exchange. On Nov. 21, CZ agreed to step down from his role at the helm of Binance as part of a wider settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, the Treasury Department and the CFTC. On the same day, Zhao pleaded guilty to several civil charges and one criminal charge relating to Anti-Money Laundering laws. Zhao is still awaiting sentencing related to money laundering charges. His sentencing was delayed until April 30. He is currently free on a $175 million release bond.Related: DED memecoin causes community outrage after airdrop allocation reduced

Glassnode warns traders to brace for extreme volatility during halving | Cryptopolitan

Glassnode dropped a bombshell on traders everywhere: get ready for a wild ride as we edge closer to the Bitcoin halving. But before you bet the farm on past patterns, Glassnode’s latest insights suggest this time could be different, thanks to the heavyweight champ of the financial instruments arena: Bitcoin ETFs. With the halving event on the horizon, traders are sharpening their pencils, trying to sketch out how this pivotal moment might reshape the market landscape. Unlike past cycles, where the halving acted like a green flag for bull runs, this cycle’s run-up has been anything but textbook. Bitcoin didn’t just climb the charts; it shattered ceilings, hitting an all-time high ahead of the halving. This plot twist has traders scratching their heads: is the halving going to fuel another surge, or have we entered a new era where different forces are at the wheel?Halving vs. ETF Supply SinkAs we dive into the depths of the halving phenomenon, it’s clear that the game has changed. Traditionally, halving events cut the miners’ bounty in half, throttling the supply of new bitcoins and theoretically juicing up their value as scarcity kicks in. But this narrative might need a rewrite. The crypto market isn’t just playing by the old supply-and-demand rulebook anymore. Enter Bitcoin ETFs, the new kids on the block, gulping down bitcoins at a pace that makes the miners’ contributions look like a drop in the bucket.Here’s the skinny: right now, miners toss around 900 BTC into the market daily. Post-halving, that number will slim down to 450 BTC. Old-school logic would say this scarcity should send prices to the moon. However, ETFs are on a shopping spree, yanking more BTCs out of circulation daily than miners are adding. This twist means the supply squeeze we’ve been banking on might already be happening, thanks to these ETF gluttons.Yet, it’s not all about how much Bitcoin ETFs are stockpiling. Their moves can sway the market in both directions. If these funds start offloading BTC, it could unleash a tidal wave, making it crucial for traders to keep an eagle eye on ETF activity as the halving approaches.Influence of Long-Term Holder SupplyAmidst the hullabaloo, we can’t overlook the old guard of Bitcoin: the long-term holders (LTHs). These folks, who clutch their Bitcoin like a treasure chest, play a major role in the market’s supply dynamics. Unlike their trigger-happy counterparts, the short-term holders, LTHs tend to hold steady through the market’s mood swings, making their stash a critical piece of the supply puzzle.Glassnode sheds light on this with their Long-Term Holder Market Inflation Rate, a fancy way of saying they’re tracking how much Bitcoin these stalwarts are either hoarding or hurling into the market. This metric is a treasure map for traders, pointing to when the market might hit a supply-demand equilibrium or even a price peak.Now, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: the psychological mambo around halving events. In the past, halvings have been hyped up to the point where the actual event acts like a balloon losing air — a phenomenon known as a “sell-the-news” event. Take 2016, for example, when Bitcoin took a nosedive around the halving, showcasing the market’s knack for overreacting.

In one of her recent tweets, Lucie, the Shiba Inu team’s marketing lead warned that due to multiple tests and updates that are being implemented on Shibarium now, there may be low activity on this Layer-2 solution and various holdups observed.SHIB burn rate stays in redShibburn tracking service has shared that within the last 24 hours, the overall burn rate of Shiba Inu meme coins has been severely negative, showing almost minus 30%. Still, quite a large amount of meme coins was moved out of circulation this time – 21,401,675 SHIB. This burn was achieved with the help of nine burn transactions, the largest of which carried 18,358,729 SHIB. On March 21 a significant increase in burns was spotted as this metric soared by over 260%.Over the past three days, the second largest meme cryptocurrency SHIB has been trading sideways, moving in a range between the low line of $0.00002758 and the high line of $0.00002842. Overall, the decline since Saturday constitutes almost 3%. At the time of this writing, the popular meme coin is changing hands at $0.00002759 on the Binance exchange.

Dead or Alive: Number of Cryptocurrencies Globally from 2013 to January 2024

 
How is cryptocurrency created?
It is worth noting that creating a cryptocurrency is a relatively easy process, and anybody can do it.
Whether that project achieves any significance – or survives at all – is a different story. Most do not.
There are several different options for making a cryptocurrency. Creating a blockchain and a native token or modifying the existing blockchain are the more difficult options and require more technical knowledge and training.
Meanwhile, making a coin on an existing chain, or paying a developer to make it, is a lot easier.
Many will opt to create a cryptocurrency on an existing chain, and there are even online tools that allow the creation of tokens and blockchains without programming knowledge.
The more one wishes to customize the coin, the more knowledge is needed.
Once the crypto is created, the coins are minted for issuance.
This is the simplest, most basic explanation. Serious projects will invest a lot of time and money into their crypto, they will have a highly skilled team of developers constantly working on it, and the project will be thoroughly audited.

Meanwhile, there are other estimates out there per which there may be some 20,000 cryptocurrencies in existence. “Most of these are either inactive or discontinued,” said Statista.
These coins are typically referred to as ‘dead.’ They cease to exist due to a number of reasons, including halted development, lack of users or traders, fraud exposure, and more.
Per 99bitcoins, as of February 2023, there are at least 1,774 dead coins. And these are the reported projects.
A 2024 report conducted by AlphaQuest and Storible, which analyzed 12,343 cryptos, found that nearly two-thirds of cryptocurrencies created over the past several years “have met their demise.”
2013-2020: From 66 Coins to 4,000

The crypto industry has seen significant growth in the seven years up to early 2021, as per Statista data. 
While it may be difficult to fathom today, there was no top 100 coins per market capitalization to talk about in 2013. At the time, there were only 66 available cryptos.
However, within a single year, the 66 jumped 666.6 % to 506 in 2014.
Over the following two years, the market saw a more modest increase: there were 562 coins recorded in 2015 and 644 in 2016.
This is where we notice another sharp increase in the number of cryptocurrencies, surpassing the 1,000 mark. In 2017, it increased 107% compared to 2016, hitting 1,335 coins.
Two years later, in 2019, the 2,000 mark was surpassed, with the number of coins reaching 2,817. 
Between November 2019 and February 2021, another 1,694 coins were added to the available lot – nearly doubling the amount and totaling 4,501.

This 2020-2021 period and the bull run that marked it were very significant for the industry. 
CoinGecko found that most dead cryptocurrencies came from projects launched during this bull run.
The data aggregator stated in a January 2024 report that, 
“7,530 cryptocurrencies from that period have died, accounting for 53.6% of all dead cryptocurrencies on CoinGecko. Over 11,000 cryptocurrencies were listed on CoinGecko during the previous bull run, with ~70% having shut down since.”
However, when the researchers looked at the results of the 2017-2018 bull run, they discovered that 1,450 projects shut down. “This is on the back of over 3,000 cryptocurrencies listed, resulting in a similar fail rate of ~70%.”
As for the reasons behind the high rates of dead coins, CoinGeko identified the ease of deploying tokens and the rise in popularity of meme coins as contributing factors.
Many meme coin projects launched but without a product to offer and were soon abandoned entirely.
2021-2022: Hitting the All-Time-High

2021 saw major increases in the number of available cryptocurrencies.
While there were 4,501 coins in February, by July that same year, the number was up to 6,044.
Soon after, we notice the first drop in this ten-year time frame. In August 2021, the number fell to 5,840. 
That said, just two months after that, it surpassed the July level, climbing to 6,826, and ended the year with 7,557.
This ‘rally’ resulted in a new all-time high (ATH) at the beginning of 2022. 
Between November 2021 and January 2022, the number was up 31.4% to 9,929.
Then in February 2022, it hit its final ATH to date: 10,397 different coins existing in the nascent ecosystem.
Therefore, between February 2021 and February 2022, the number of coins increased by 131%. 
Following the ATH, the space recorded a 10.5% fall in November 2022 to 9,310. 

According to CoinGecko, nearly 6,000 cryptocurrencies from 2021 failed. The report stated that,
“Cryptocurrencies created in 2021 have suffered the worst, with 5,724 having died as of January 2024. Over 70% of cryptocurrencies listed on CoinGecko in 2021 have died, making it the worst year for project launches.” 
2022 follows it as another bad year: 3,520 listed coins died (~60%) by January 2024.
Moreover, the AlphaQuest and Storible report also found that most cryptocurrencies born during the 2020-2021 bull run failed, saying:
“In particular, out of the 4,834 crypto projects introduced during the bullish trend, 72% failed to survive.”
2023-2024: 13% Drop from ATH

A notable development in 2023 is that the year saw two more drops in the number of cryptocurrencies. This is as many drops as recorded over the previous nine years combined.
All in all, the numbers haven’t moved much since the November 2022 level of 9,310.
February 2023 saw a decrease to 8,685, followed by a slight increase to 9,321, then dropping again to 8,866 by the end of the year. 
January 2024 began with 9,024 cryptocurrencies. Compared to February 2023, this is a 3.9% increase.
However, compared to the February 2022 ATH, January 2024 saw a 13.2% fall in the number of cryptocurrencies available.

That said, between 2013 and 2024, the crypto space witnessed a 13,572.7% rise in the number of cryptocurrencies. 
CoinGecko found that 289 cryptocurrencies listed on the platform in 2023 subsequently died, stating:
“This represents a failure rate of <10%, with over 4,000 cryptocurrencies listed, a sharp decline from previous years.”
The AlphaQuest and Storible report stated that, among 12,343 crypto projects investigated, 8,854 have become defunct in the past year.
Leading up to 2023, it said, there has been a decrease in the cryptocurrency market, leading to the death of 65% of projects.
Per this report, “2023 is the toughest year in the 2020-2023 cycle, with nearly 60% of dead coins disappearing during that period.”
That said, 2023 was indeed a difficult year for crypto projects, bearing the brunt of the 2022 crypto industry crisis. 
The entire space suffered due to the bear market fallout and the domino effect that began in 2022 with the collapse of the Terra/Luna ecosystem, followed by the infamous fall of the FTX exchange and its sister company Alameda Research. 
These events were so monumental that their effects are still felt, and the companies’ executives are facing prison time.
Then, after months of struggling, crypto lending and trading firm Genesis, a unit of the Digital Currency Group (DCG), filed for bankruptcy following a significant loan loss to the now also defunct Three Arrows Capital.
The aftershocks impacted numerous projects and coins. Companies like Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, RECUR, LBRY, Nifty’s, Bittrex Global, and Wyre all announced they’d wind down their operations in 2022 and 2023, citing hostile market conditions and/or debts.
Therefore, according to CoinMarketCap, these project’s coins are just some of those that died over 2023.
Losses from these various collapses numbered in the billions. FTX alone had an $8 billion hole in its accounts.
The collapses also showcased how interconnected the crypto ecosystem was at the time. 
Poor management, mismanagement of funds, lack of liquidity, and cyberattacks contributed to the fallout, fueling the bear market, which in turn increased the pressure on the market participants until many buckled under it and went bankrupt.
2025: Could This Be The Year of the Most Crypto Projects Launched?

After the Terra crash, 35% of crypto projects were deemed defunct, the AlphaQuest and Storible report said. And after the FTX fall, 32% of crypto projects closed shop. 
Half of the cryptocurrencies backed by Three Arrows Capital subsequently failed.
“Other top-tier VCs with over half of their projects in their portfolio having died include Paradigm, DWF Labs, Polychain Capital, a16z, Animoca Brands, Binance Labs, and Multicoin Capital,” it said.
No ecosystem was safe. Cardano witnessed 74% of the projects in its ecosystem go defunct. For Terra, it was 74% of the projects. Furthermore, Celo, Harmony, Near, Zilliqa, Moonriver, and others all experienced “notable losses.”
Meanwhile, the report found that a whopping 93% of the dead projects suffered from low liquidity or trading volume. 
58% of them had Twitter accounts or websites that were either inactive or deleted, and 48% were removed from major tracking platforms such as CoinMarketCap.
Moreover, the average lifespan of a crypto project is three years, “which means an average project can barely survive through a market cycle of 4 years,” the report said.
Commenting on the decrease in the number of cryptocurrencies, Ramy Bekhiet, Senior Advisor and Commercial Partnerships Coordinator at PDX, told Cryptonews that projects are realizing that they need to offer real-world utility.
“Also, with regulations looming around, projects are becoming more careful in how they operate and launch new coins/tokens,” he said.
Aaron Rafferty, co-founder and CEO of technology incubation hub Standard, said that,
“The drop is clearly the tail end of the last bull market and aftermath of overspeculation, hype cycles that failed, and fraudsters that ran pump-and-dump schemes. Many of these individuals are still in the market under alternative personas, and the creation of new tokens and projects is far from over.” 
In fact, with Large Language Models, the gap to launch a crypto project is lower than ever, said Rafferty, and requires zero coding experience. 
Platforms like Solana are attracting hundreds of millions of consumer investor dollars, speculating on the next pump-and-dump scheme. This week alone, we saw $149.2 million in funding go directly to 33 project presales where personalities on Twitter effectively shared a wallet address to which people sent their SOL tokens. 
The Base chain will have a similar moment as it is even easier and cheaper to launch a project there, with fees costing less than $1 for the entire process, Rafferty argued, adding:
“Couple these two factors together along with the ETF [exchange-traded fund] approvals and lack of regulatory clarity from the SEC [US Securities and Exchange Commission], and 2025 will be the year of the most crypto projects launched that we have ever seen. The gap now seems to be the size of one’s audience and ability to draw a crowd.”
Peter Eberle, President and Chief Investment Officer of Castle Funds, commented that the reason we are excited about some cryptocurrencies is the underlying technology that some of these have developed. 
This includes Bitcoin as a means of transferring large amounts of money across borders without middlemen and on a public distributed ledger. Also, there’s Ethereum and its smart contracts that can be executed based on predetermined rules. 
However, said Eberle,
“Unfortunately, many others provide nothing of value. Meme coins are cheap to issue and extract money from people chasing quick riches, enriching the issuers. New coins will continue to be released, and others will collapse. Investors must do their own research and due diligence. Don’t be someone else’s exit liquidity.”
Meanwhile, the AlphaQuest and Storible report noted that, despite the downfall of numerous coins, many new projects and narratives emerge each month. 
It stated that “the cryptocurrency field still holds promise for the future” and “the enduring relevance of cryptocurrencies cannot be underestimated.”
Conclusion

Between 2013 and 2024, there was a 13,572.7% rise in the number of cryptocurrencies, from 66 to 9,024, according to Statista.
Compared to the February 2022 ATH of 10,397, there was a 13% drop by January 2024 in the number of cryptocurrencies available.
Year-on-year, from February 2023 until January 2024, the space saw a 3.9% increase in the number of available coins worldwide.
There were four recorded drops over the past decade: August 2021, November 2022, February 2023, and December 2023.

Why do cryptocurrencies fail?
Some of the key reasons why the cryptocurrencies fail and end up dying include:

 crypto volatility
unpredictability
lack of investment and trading volume
abandonment by developers
lack of regulations
over-speculation
hype cycle fails
hacks
fraud (such as rug pulls).


Most projects created during the 2020-2021 bull run have died by now. Most new coins don’t even last one four-year cycle. 
Per various reports, 2021 and 2023 were particularly bad years for crypto projects. Bear markets, as well as a string of bankruptcies that began in 2022, led to the fall of numerous projects.
All that said, more cryptocurrencies are being created every day. Following the improvements in the crypto space and approval of ETFs, 2025 may see the most cryptocurrencies created yet.

ONDO explodes 95% with whales' help: Time to buy? - AMBCrypto



Total ONDO holders jump by 30% over the week.
Despite ONDO’s gains, Ondo Finance’s TVL stayed stagnant.

Real-world asset (RWA) token Ondo Finance [ONDO] continued its upward march, surging by more than 28% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.
As of this writing, the cryptocurrency was exchanging hands at a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.96, following a successful week during which it gained over 95% in value.
Whales pile up ONDO
The buying pressure was exerted by whale investors, who seem to have taken a liking for the token.
According to on-chain tracking platform Lookonchain, three whale wallets withdrew a total of 9.44 million ONDOs, worth nearly $9 million as per prevailing market price, from different exchanges lately.
The action represented an accumulation strategy, motivated by expectation of higher returns in the future.
Crypto whales are known for their investment acumen. Market observers and participants watch their actions closely to check which assets are on their radar.
Hence, whales’ aggressive accumulation could cause retail investors to follow suit, further inflating the coin’s value.
This is what was actually unfolding. Since the 19th of March, the total number of holders soared by 30% to over 10k as of this writing, as per AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data.

ONDO benefits from tokenization hype
The soaring interest in the coin comes after global investment firm BlackRock announced last week the creation of a tokenized fund on Ethereum [ETH].
The fund would reportedly provide investors the opportunity to earn U.S. Dollar yields using a blockchain platform.
BlackRock’s endeavor was the latest in what has been a sustained push to grab a slice of the growing industry.
This involves representing real-world assets like securities, currencies, real estate, and more on a blockchain.

How much are 1,10,100 ONDOs worth today?

ONDO was the native token of Ondo finance — a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that tokenizes U.S. treasuries. It boasted of a total value locked (TVL) of $203 million at press time, according to DeFiLlama.
Interestingly, despite the hype around tokenization and increase in value of its token, Ondo Finance’s TVL stayed stagnant over the week.

Coinbase stock rises as Bitcoin goes back above $70k mark



                    

                    
Coinbase stock surges 9% to $280.79.
Bitcoin has soared by 8.60% in 24 hours to trade at $70,555.18 at press time.
Decreasing Bitcoin supply and bullish projections, like $150k by 2024, fuel investor optimism.

Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) experienced a significant surge in its stock price, climbing by over 9% to reach $280.79 per share. This rally in Coinbase shares correlates with Bitcoin’s resurgence, which briefly surpassed the $70,000 mark, after a substantial gain of 8.60% over the past 24 hours.
The uptick in Coinbase’s stock price demonstrates investors’ confidence in the cryptocurrency exchange platform, particularly as Bitcoin, the leading digital asset, continues to exhibit resilience and upward momentum.
The positive sentiment also reflects broader optimism in the cryptocurrency sector and its potential for further growth and adoption.
Bitcoin price soars above $70k again 
March has been such a great month for Bitcoin and the entire crypto market in general. Bitcoin (BTC) price soared past $73k at the beginning of March before retracting as investors started taking their profits.
The bounce back above $70,000 reaffirms its position as the dominant player in the digital asset market. With a market capitalization of $1.39 trillion, Bitcoin maintains its status as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, capturing over 8.70% of the total market cap.
The surge in Bitcoin’s price was accompanied by robust trading volume, with $40.43 billion traded within 24 hours, solidifying Bitcoin’s position as one of the most actively traded cryptocurrencies.
The decreasing Bitcoin supply could also be a factor as crypto exchanges registered record low BTC holdings as Bitcoin ETFs took in millions of bitcoins. With the decreased supply and increasing demand among investors, the majority believe BTC could go higher for the remainder of the year.
Standard Chartered Bank gave an insane project of $150k by the end of 2024. While that is yet to be confirmed, the crypto industry seems to have come back to life as Bitcoin roars back to life as witnessed with the Coinbase stock surge.

Price analysis 3/25: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, DOGE, ADA, AVAX

Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week positively and is trying to maintain above the $70,000 level. Analysts are hopeful of a reversal this week following five successive days of negative inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last week.Goldman Sachs said its clients are showing a strong appetite for the firm’s future and options offerings.

BREAKING: SEC to Seek $2 Billion Fine from Ripple (XRP) - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to a last-minute development, the details of which are not yet clear, the SEC will demand a fine of $ 2 billion from Ripple (XRP) developer Ripple Labs.
Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty announced the development as follows:


“As you will see when the SEC's summary is made public tomorrow, they are asking the judge for $2 billion in fines and sanctions.
Our answer will be available next month, but as we have all seen time and time again, this is a regulator that operates on statements that are false, ill-defined and designed to mislead. They stayed true to their form here too.





Rather than faithfully enforcing the law, the SEC continues to seek to punish and intimidate Ripple and the industry in general. We believe that the court will approach the solution phase fairly.”
However, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the following about the development:


“The SEC, led by Gensler, has repeatedly acted outside the law, admonished by judges for “gross abuse of the authority entrusted to it by Congress” (DEBT Box case) and for acting “without faithful adherence to the law” (Ripple case). Let's also not forget Gensler's indifference to the FTX scam.
The SEC plans to ask the judge for $2 billion in a case that contains no allegations (let alone findings) of fraud or recklessness. There is absolutely no precedent for this. “We will continue to disclose what the SEC is when we respond to this.”





Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen said the following about the development:
“The balance of the SEC, managed by Gensler, has been disrupted. The fact that the SEC alone considers itself above the law and drags the USA further behind other G20 countries will not and should not go unnoticed in an election year.”

Binance ‘made aware’ of executive who fled Nigeria - Blockworks


An executive detained by Nigeria for weeks escaped custody on Friday. 
Nadeem Anjarwalla, the regional manager for Africa, was detained in late February alongside Binance’s head of financial crime compliance, Tigran Gambrayan. 
Neither executive has been charged with a crime. A Nigerian court last week decided to postpone a decision on a detention extension until April 5, according to a representative for the executives. 
Binance, in a statement to Blockworks, confirmed that it had been “made aware” that Anjarwalla was no longer in Nigerian custody. 
“Our primary focus remains on the safety of our employees and we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to quickly resolve this issue,” a Binance spokesperson said.
Binance told Blockworks in mid-March that it was hoping for a “swift resolution” to the detention of Anjarwalla and Gambrayan.

Bloomberg reported Monday morning that Nigeria also filed tax evasion charges against Binance. According to a statement seen by the publication, Binance was accused of “nonpayment of value-added tax and company income tax, failure to file tax returns and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes” through the platform.
Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service didn’t immediately return a request for comment to confirm the charges. Binance didn’t return a request for comment on the charges.
Nigeria targeted Binance in late February, alleging that $26 billion had been passed through Binance Nigeria, according to the country’s central bank governor. Binance then ended support for the Naira in early March.
Officials in the country previously said that they were weighing fines against the crypto exchange. One official, in an interview with BBC’s pidgin language service, even said that the government was looking at a $10 billion fine. However, Binance told local media that it was not in talks with the government over a fine of that sum.

The first cryptocurrency ETNs are expected to begin trading on May 28, 2024, subject to approval by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The LSE chose this date to ensure that the maximum number of issuers could be available on the market on the first day of trading.

LUNA's 13% surge - The odds of LUNC's price following suit are... - AMBCrypto



Market sentiment around LUNA remained bearish. 
However, LUNC’s price action turned bullish. 

Terra [LUNA] recently made a comeback as its popularity registered a sharp rise in the last few hours. Thanks to that, the token started trending on X (formerly Twitter). 
The reason behind this sudden buzz might be because of its bullish price action. 
LUNA is pumping!
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that Terra’s value surged by over 13% in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, the token was trading at $1.28 with a market capitalization of over $889 million, making it the 110th largest crypto. 
Because of the rise in price, LUNA also became a topic of discussion in the crypto space, allowing it to trend on X. This had a positive impact on its social metrics as its social volume rose. 
However, it was surprising to see that despite the rise in its price, LUNA’s Weighted Sentiment dropped, meaning that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market. 
Source: Santiment
Will LUNA’s bull rally last?
AMBCrypto then planned to take a look at LUNA’s on-chain data to better understand whether the bull rally would continue. 
As per our analysis of Santiment’s data, LUNA’s development activity was up last week, meaning developers were putting more effort into improving the blockchain.
 Its demand in the derivatives market was high, as evident from its green Funding Rate. Its Open Interest rose along with its price, which indicated that the chances of the price trend continuing were high. 
Source: Santiment
Our analysis of Terra’s daily chart pointed out that the MACD displayed a clear bullish advantage in the market, increasing the possibility of LUNA’s bull rally lasting longer. 
However, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a downtick, which might turn out to be troublesome for the token’s upward trajectory. 
Source: TradingView
How is LUNC doing?
While Terra’s value surged, its sister token, Terra Classic [LUNC], followed a similar trend. According to CoinMarketCap, LUNC was up by over 8% in the last 24 hours.

Read Terra Classic’s [LUNC] Price Prediction 2024-25

At press time, it was trading at $0.0001654 with a market cap of over $964 million. Also, the token’s MACD displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover. 
On top of that, unlike LUNA, LUNC’s RSI registered a sharp uptick. This suggested that investors might witness LUNC’s price rise further in the coming days.

Internet Computer (ICP) Price Targets $18 After 23-Month High


The Internet Computer (ICP) price had a successful run over the past week, breaking through a crucial barrier.
But will this growth continue down the line if investors’ bullishness is lost?
Internet Computer Reaches New Milestone
The Internet Computer price rallied over the last few days as the network inched close to a new achievement. This milestone was reached during the intra-day trading hours on Monday as Internet Computer validated 3 billion blocks.

This achievement came nearly three years since the launch of the protocol in May 2021, processing over 44.87 blocks per second as of date.

Read More: Internet Computer (ICP) Price Prediction 2023/2025/2030
In addition to this achievement, the altcoin is seeing considerable support from its investors who, despite the rally, are still optimistic about further increases in price. This is evinced by the weighted sentiment of ICP holders, who are exhibiting bullishness at the time of writing.

Therefore, ICP price will likely see further growth, potentially even crossing the $18 mark.

ICP Price Prediction: What Comes After the 54% Rally?
The Internet Computer price rose by 54.45% in the last few days, touching $17 and shooting up from $10.91. The altcoin lived up to the prediction made by BeInCrypto, where a rally to $15 was expected before the end of the month.
Going forward, despite the massive rally, ICP will potentially stretch its uptrend a little further to tag the resistance at $18. Crossing this barrier will push the altcoin to note a 30-month high.

However, the ICP price will face resistance in closing above the $17 resistance bar. The cryptocurrency has failed to do so in the past once, and another instance will likely result in some corrections.

ICP might thus witness a drawdown to $15.34 while the market cools down, potentially invalidating the bullish thesis.

Veto from This Country to Bitcoin Exchange Binance! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, continues to face problems in various countries.
At this point, Binance recently faced some problems in the Philippines.


According to local news agency Nikkei Asia, the Philippine SEC said Binance is a threat to the security of the Philippines.
Stating that it will continue to block Binance, the Philippine SEC said that it will continue to block citizens' access to Binance's main website and related platforms.





The official statement made the following statements:
“The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to block cryptocurrency giant Binance's online presence in the Philippines.


At this point, at its meeting on March 12, the SEC made a formal request to the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to help block the website and other web pages used by Binance, which was found to offer an investment and trading platform.
Binance is actively running promotional campaigns on social media to attract Filipinos to participate in investment and trading activities using their platform. An app version can also be downloaded from Google Playstore and Apple App Store.





However, Binance has not received a license from the SEC to solicit investments from the public or to establish or operate an exchange for the trading of securities, as required by Republic Act No. 8799 or the Securities Regulation Act (SRC).”
The Philippine SEC, which has been making negative moves against Binance for a while, had previously stated that Binance did not have the right to sell or provide securities to the public and advised Filipino investors to close their positions and withdraw their investments.

Do Kwon Released from Jail: Is He in the Clear After All? - DailyCoin


        
Do Kwon has completed his prison sentence in Montenegro.



Extradition attempts for the former Terraform Labs CEO are still ongoing.



Do Kwon has continued to evade authorities with sneaky tactics
Do Kwon, the co-founder and former CEO of the now-defunct Terraform Labs has been at the center of regulatory crosshairs over the past years, marked by the pursuit of the 2022 Terra collapse, which caused the industry a staggering $80 billion. In February 2023, Do Kwon was convicted in Montenegro, on charges of travel document forgery after spending nearly six months on the run from authorities. Subsequently, both the United States and South Korea initiated extradition proceedings for the crypto fugitive, all of which proved challenging, thanks to Kwon’s sneaky maneuvers.Now, recent news of Kwon’s release have emerged, begging the question of what the discouraged crypto mogul’s freedom means.What Does Do Kwon’s Release Mean?According to a recent Bloomberg report, Do Kwon was released from the Montenegro prison on March 23, following the completion of his sentence for the term of his document forgery charges.However, despite regaining his freedom, Kwon remains confiscated within Montenegro. According to the prison director Darko Vukcevic, Do Kwon’s travel documents have been confiscated and is currently held in confinement pending his extradition.“We released Do Kwon from prison as his regular prison term for traveling with fake papers ended. Since he is a foreign citizen and his documents were withheld, he was taken for an interview to police directorate for foreigners, and they will deal with him further,” he stated.The Montenegrin Supreme Court is currently deliberating Kwon’s extradition to either South Korea of procedural grounds, following the repeated overturn of previous approvals.Do Kwon: The Infamous Hide and Seek ChampionPrior to Do Kwon’s release, the tussle to extradite him between the United States and South Korea intensified, with each side contesting to secure the disgraced former CEO for the charging of laundry charges against him. However, Kwon, relentless in his efforts to evade authorities, continuously countered the legal efforts with a string of evasive tactics. Following the approval of his handover to the United States in November 2023, Do Kwon filed an appeal, scoring victory with the Podgorica  Appellate Court to overturn the approval.Despite the failed attempt, efforts to extradite Kwon did not cease. Once again in December 2023, the United States secured another greenlight to take the former Terraform Lbas CEO. However, the government’s win was short-lived, as Do Kwon and his lawyers filed a second appeal, which again revoked the High Court’s decision.Do Kwon’s most recent win was on March 5, when he argued against the flaws in the approval of his extradition to the United States by the Montenegro High Court. The victory has further prolonged the long-standing tussle that was thought to have reached conclusion, leaving the final destination of Kwon uncertain.On the Flipside
The SEC’s trial against Do Kwon will commence on March 29, 2024.



A local South Korea-based Terra community is advocating against the potential extradition of Do Kwon to South Korea, asserting that justice for the 2022 Terra collapse will be better served in the United States.



The Singaporean government was also in pursuit of Do Kwon, however, the government’s efforts have since subsided as the US and South Korea compete.
Why This MattersWhile Do Kwon’s release from the Montenegro prison marks an end to his legal troubles in the country, it does signal the end to the disgraced founder’s broader regulatory woes and despite. Despite his partial freedom, the laundry of charges he faces in both the United States and South Korea persist, rendering his future uncertain.Is Do Kwon fated to return to the United States or his homeland?

                        The price of Internet Computer (ICP) has shot up 20% in the last 24 hours as the token underpinning the blockchain-based computing ecosystem far outpaces market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum today.Crypto prices are broadly rallying across the spectrum right now. Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) grew 2.6% in the last 24 hours to trade at $66,842, while its nearest contender Ethereum (ETH)  grew 1.8% to trade at $3,441 as of this writing, according to CoinGecko data. Today, ICP is the clear leader of the top 25 biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, though. No other leading cryptocurrency came close in terms of gains, except NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and Toncoin (TON), which both grew by a little over 10% overnight.The value added by ICP’s rally led to the token flipping NEAR for 21st place in the early hours of the morning GMT.The only other cryptocurrency project enjoying a marked surge in the top 100 right now is Solana-based meme coin DogWifHat (WIF) which ballooned a blistering 21.7% to trade at $2.74.ICP is a blockchain protocol that offers an alternative  The Internet Computer attempts to offer a decentralized alternative to the centralized cloud-based data centres powering popular web applications currently. Its easy interface means anyone can create and deploy a dApp on ICP’s public blockchain. ICP’s trading chart reflects a bumpier February than many other cryptocurrencies. In March, ICP joined the market-wide rally, but it began to depreciate a fortnight into March and posted heavy losses by Wednesday as it bottomed out at $11. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 73, ICP is currently overbought, so an imminent correction is likely to occur.Source: TradingViewIs Green Bitcoin The Hottest Altcoin After ICP
The Internet Computer Protocol is about more than a token, it’s an ecosystem that taps blockchain to unlock a fountain of new Web 3 innovations.As such, the ICP token checks all the right boxes for a potentially very smart crypto investment for any blockchain acolyte. It is easier to argue the case for ICP still being here in a decade than it is for raw meme coins like DOGE, PEPE and WIF.Green Bitcoin (GBTC) is another alt coin project that is raking in the money from excited early speculators. It has just raised $8.8 million in just over two weeks of its presale.GBTC has a hardcap of 21 million, a clear nod to its inspiration, Bitcoin. Limiting the number of tokens in circulation creates value through scarcity.However, GBTC’s use of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain over Bitcoin’s less energy-efficient proof-of-work mechanism makes it cleaner and greener than its inspiration.Green Bitcoin touts itself as a “gamified green staking” project. Essentially, token holders participate through the staking platform, where they earn GBTC rewards by predicting Bitcoin price trends.Holders can stake tokens for up to six months to earn even bigger rewards. Staking is a fundamental part of Green Bitcoin’s tokenomics. By reducing GBTC’s circulating supply, staking helps drive the price over the long term.Anyone can get involved by visiting the official Green Bitcoin website and connecting a crypto wallet.1 GBTC presently costs $1.1062, with the price due to rise in a little over six days.There are still a few weeks left of the presale, and the token could rally sharply by the time it’s listed on major exchanges.Get in early and Buy Green Bitcoin Now

Elon Musk Asks Why Vitalik Buterin Left Twitter: Here's the Ethereum Creator's Answer - Decrypt

In the hectic period since Elon Musk’s 2022 takeover of Twitter, the tech billionaire has rarely paid much heed to the exodus of prominent users and advertisers from the site in protest of new policies. On Monday, however, Musk appeared genuinely curious about the dwindling presence on the platform of one of crypto’s most influential thought leaders: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. “Why did he leave?” Musk asked on Twitter, in response to a post bemoaning Buterin’s increasingly sporadic use of the social media site. The comment garnered several replies from crypto users guessing that the move was due to increased bot activity, or the platform’s lack of on-chain functionality. But look no further than comments Buterin made just days ago at ETH Taipei on the subject to get your answer: the crypto developer finds the people on Twitter (Musk included?) flat-out irritating. “Twitter is the place where all the people are, but it's also the place where all the really annoying people are,” Buterin said when asked about his decreasing reliance on the social network.As an alternative to Twitter, Buterin has recently spent much more time posting on Farcaster, a decentralized social media protocol that boomed in popularity earlier this year. Back on Twitter, crypto users complained that by choosing Farcaster over Twitter, Buterin was “sequester[ing] himself with his chosen peers on an island,” as opposed to meeting the masses where they are. In Taipei, however, Buterin pushed back against such arguments. “The kind of engagement that I get on there is actually higher quality,” the Ethereum co-founder said of Farcaster.Buterin also dismissed claims that by using Farcaster, he has insulated himself in a bubble with only other crypto die-hards. “It's managed to be used by non crypto people, I think in ways that a lot of other previous applications have not,” he said. “I think that's an important success to build on, and for other [decentralized] applications to try to replicate.”Founded in 2020, Farcaster remained relatively obscure until late January, when the protocol debuted a new feature called Frames that allows users to perform on-chain and off-chain functions within Farcaster apps—including minting NFTs, playing games, and making purchases—without exiting to a third party.Since that Frames-induced surge, usage on Farcaster has remained fairly consistent—slightly above 1.5 million posts on the protocol per week, according to data from Dune.But decentralized media still has a long way to go: Those numbers certainly pale in comparison to Twitter, which sees hundreds of millions of posts a day, per Elon Musk.When addressing a room full of reporters in Taipei late last week, Vitalik Buterin asked the group if anyone planned to post any stories that came from the session on Farcaster before tweeting them. “You should,” Buterin said. “Come on, we're the decentralized space, we need to use our own stuff!”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Austin remains the most important crypto hub in the world | Cryptopolitan

Tucked away in the heart of Texas, Austin has established itself as the undisputed champion of the cryptocurrency universe. Far from being a one-trick pony, this vibrant city seamlessly merges the old with the new, the traditional with the avant-garde, and in doing so, cements its position as a beacon for the future of digital currencies. Here, amidst the hustle and bustle of Congress Avenue and the electric atmosphere of Sixth Street, lies the Bitcoin Commons. This isn’t just any space; it’s a sanctuary, a melting pot of ideas, and a testament to Austin’s crypto dominance. Underground Vibes and Open Bars: The Lifeblood of Austin’s Crypto SceneAt the very core of Austin’s crypto revolution is the Bitcoin Commons. By day, it’s a bustling co-working space buzzing with the sound of corporate bitcoin enthusiasts tapping away at their keyboards. But as the sun sets, it transforms. It becomes a haven for the rebels of the industry, hosting underground meet-ups that draw in everyone from venture capitalists with their eyes on the prize to the armed preppers who’ve opted out of the grid.This duality is Austin’s strength. It’s where developers come to push the envelope, supported by the likes of Parker Lewis, a leading figure in Texas’ bitcoin community and an advocate for advancing the bitcoin network. His mission, along with others in the Commons, is to push bitcoin through education, development, and sheer force of will.Among the believers is Francisco Chavarria, who journeyed from Mexico City to Austin, drawn by the city’s reputation as a hub for innovation and community. His story isn’t unique; it’s reflective of a larger trend. People come to Austin not just to win but to be part of a collective triumph in the world of bitcoin.Austin’s allure isn’t accidental. It’s a byproduct of a perfect storm: a welcoming policy environment, abundant renewable energy, and a constellation of brilliant minds dedicated to mining and developing within the crypto sphere. Even when the market looks bleak, the spirit in Austin remains unbreakable, buoyed by recent price surges that have sent waves of optimism through the community.From Tech Hub to Bitcoin Bastion: Austin’s EvolutionThe transition of Austin into a tech and crypto powerhouse isn’t a recent development. It’s the culmination of years of growth, accelerated by a global pandemic that reshaped the landscape of work and innovation. The city’s libertarian leanings and open-market policies have made it a haven for those who see bitcoin as more than just a currency—it’s a lifestyle choice.This eclectic mix of individuals, ranging from the tech-savvy to the freedom-loving patriots, forms the backbone of Austin’s crypto scene. They gather under the banner of bitcoin, in places like the Bitcoin Commons, to share ideas, challenges, and solutions.Venture capital, too, has taken notice. With new developments and the advent of technologies like smart contracts, Austin is on the forefront of a renaissance in bitcoin’s utility and application. Companies and developers are flocking to the city, drawn by the promise of support, innovation, and community.Yet, as much as Austin celebrates its successes, it’s also a place of hard truths and resilience. The upcoming bitcoin halving presents a challenge, but it’s one that the community is prepared to face head-on. Miners and investors alike are adapting, driven by a belief in the enduring value of bitcoin and its potential to redefine the very nature of currency and trade.

Statement from Terra CEO on SEC-Terra (LUNA) Hearing: "The Last Defense That Will Determine Our Fate" - Bitcoin Sistemi


In one of the most important developments of the day, Terraform Labs, the developer company behind Terra (LUNA), began its hearing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The case involving Terraform Labs and its founder Do Kwon is attracting a lot of attention from the cryptocurrency community.
Chris Amani, the newly appointed CEO of Terraform Labs, broke his silence on the ongoing hearing:



“SEC litigation has begun. “I have been quiet for the last month as I have been focusing on preparations, and you will not hear from me during the hearing.”

Amani did not mince words about the gravity of the situation:

“I won't beat around the bush, the next few weeks will determine the future of TFL.”

The lawsuit follows multiple allegations against Terraform Labs. But Amani sees this as an opportunity for the company to present its side of the story. “We hope you follow the case closely, see all the facts, and make up your own mind,” he said.






Despite the ongoing legal battle, Amani thanked the Terra community for their unwavering support. “Thank you to the Terra community for supporting us throughout this process. Thank you to the teams that continue to develop Terra and all the incredible partners we continue to work with,” he said.
However, the SEC argues that Terraform Labs and its founder Do Kwon lied to and misled investors.

Jeremy Clarkson Flames "Ghastly" Crypto Scams: Popcorn Time? - DailyCoin


        
Crypto scammers post fake investment ads featuring the Grand Tour trio.



Jeremy Clarkson calls crypto “ghastly” in response.



Online debate on crypto legitimacy ensues.
Crypto scammers try every trick in the book to separate unwitting folk from their hard-earned money, with nothing off limits for these con artists. The latest scheme afflicting the industry involves slapping images of the Grand Tour presenters Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond on fake crypto investment opportunities. The Grand Tour presenters, never ones to mince words, took to X to distance themselves from the scam ads while condemning the underhanded tactics being employed. Funnily enough, Clarkson admitted to being baffled by digital assets but, despite the knowledge gap, assumed enough to call them “ghastly” to spark debate on the legitimacy of cryptocurrency among his followers.Jeremy Clarkson Is Not a Crypto FanJeremy Clarkson wasted no time in shaking off rumors linking him and May to cryptocurrency projects. The veteran automotive journalist quipped, “I don’t even know what crypto currency is,” followed by, “It sounds ghastly,” dealing a blow to those convinced about the game-changing benefits of digital assets.May also moved to distance himself from ads, saying he knows his mug has been plastered across crypto scam posts, but “it’s all balls.” In the dry-witted tone we’ve come to associate with May, he offered his own distinctly unfinancial advice to “go to the pub” rather than send money to scammers.Realizing that scammers had also used Hammond’s image to promote their shady scheme, May turned up the heat on the crypto con artists, saying, “There’s grifting and then there’s stretching credibility to the point where it snaps.” As expected, Clarkson and May’s tweets laid bare the divergence in public opinion on cryptocurrency, with each extreme convinced they have it figured out.Public Opinion on Crypto Passionately DividedClarkson and May’s dismissive takes opened the floodgates for both extremes of the crypto debate to wade in on matters. The anti-crypto crowd jumped at the chance to liken digital currencies to pyramid schemes. “It’s like a pyramid scheme, but even more triangular this time,” one reply added. Another bluntly warned, “It is. Mostly scams. Stay clear.”However, the blockchain bros were not going to take this lying down. “Wait till you figure out how centralized government currency works,” a crypto proponent fired back at Clarkson’s “ghastly” remark. Another was puzzled by May’s dismissal, pointing out that his scientific mindset would likely lead him to explore crypto and recognize its potential as the way forward.But May refused to be baited into an ideological clash on the merits of cryptocurrency, simply clarifying, “I’m merely pointing out that these posts are bogus.”On the Flipside
The Grand Tour’s fifth series, released this year, will be the last as Clarkson stated they are too old to continue and feel they have done everything possible with a car.



Fake British celebrity crypto scam ads are a long-running problem, with Bear Grylls, Ian Wright, and Gino D’Acampo victims of the practice.



Another celebrity victim, Martin Lewis, took legal action against Meta for promoting scam ads and won a £3 million settlement in 2019, which was donated to anti-scam projects.
Why This MattersThe attempt to leverage Clarkson, May, and Hammond’s popularity for underhanded cryptocurrency profit highlights the Wild West landscape still dominating much of the crypto sphere. Preventing high-profile figures from becoming unwitting shills for fraud is paramount to ensuring the long-term credibility of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, fierce debates on crypto’s legitimacy show how far the industry is from mass adoption.Learn more about scammers’ social media exploits to steal user funds here:How Scammers Exploited Google and Twitter Ads to Siphon $58MSolana gets flooded by racist memecoins sparking debate on freedom of expression.

As March nears its end, XRP investors are observing with optimism as the cryptocurrency maintains a value of $0.64, marking a nearly 10% increase for the month. With this achievement, attention naturally turns to April, prompting speculation regarding the trajectory of this popular digital asset.Analysis of historical data suggests a potential 30% surge for XRP in April. According to insights derived from CryptoRank, April historically demonstrates a favorable performance for XRP, with an average monthly return of 31%. However, for those inclined toward a more conservative estimate, the median monthly return stands at a noteworthy 2.05% increase.XRP to USD by CoinMarketCapA retrospective examination of XRP's price history reveals a mixed but predominantly positive outlook. While the last two Aprils witnessed declines in XRP's value, the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 showcased significant gains. Notably, 2021 recorded a notable 174.1% increase in the XRP price during April.XRP Monthly Returns by CryptoRankIn light of this historical context, XRP finds itself poised for two potential scenarios in the coming month. It could potentially soar to approximately $0.85 per token, or it might experience a more modest uptick to around $0.65 per XRP, indicating stability.While the figures paint a picture of a possible surge to levels not witnessed in two years, it is imperative to bear in mind the inherent unpredictability of the crypto market, where nothing is ever guaranteed.

Kevin Hart's Bored Ape NFT Sells at an 81% Discount ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
American comedian and actor Kevin Hart’s Bored Ape NFT from the coveted Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection has sold for a staggering 81% discount.



The NFT, which once fetched a hefty price tag of 79.5 ETH or $200,000 in January 2022, was sold for a mere 13.65 ETH or $47,000 on Monday as per data from NFT marketplace Blur.



The news of the sale has sent shockwaves through the NFT community, raising questions about the current state of the market and the value of NFTs. According to on-chain data, the comedian purchased the NFT using the MoonPay service, which partners with celebrities and helps them purchase NFTs. Other celebrities who have held BAYC include billionaire businessman Mark Cuban, singer Justin Bieber, Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton and TV presenter Jimmy Fallon.



Notably, despite the recent sale of Hart’s NFT, the BAYC collection remains at the top of the charts in terms of trading volume over the past 30 days, with $123.91 million, according to data from DappRadar. However, the minimum price for the token has fallen by 18% to $46,600.







This is not the first time a BAYC NFT has sold for a significant discount. In February 2024, the rare non-fungible token BAYC #1726 was sold for 275 ETH or about $688,000. It belonged to an NFT whale under the pseudonym “Franklinisbored”, who was one of the main holders of the collection.

&nbsp



Similarly, in August 2023, NFT BAYC #8585 was purchased for a record low of 153 ETH or about $254,000. The asset lost 80% in price in 11 months.



The recent sale of Kevin Hart’s NFT, along with the falling prices of other BAYC tokens, raises questions about the long-term viability of the NFT market. While the market remains popular, with many investors and celebrities jumping on the bandwagon, the recent sales suggest that the market may be experiencing a correction.



That said, despite BAYC’s popularity, the project has been faced with various controversies in the past, including a December 2022 lawsuit which has raised concerns about the transparency and ethics of celebrity endorsements in the NFT market.



Notably, the lawsuit alleged that all celebrity endorsements of BAYC NFTs were misleading and that the celebrities involved failed to disclose their financial interests in promoting these NFTs. The plaintiffs argue that the celebrities were paid to promote BAYC NFTs during the peak of the NFT craze, which helped drive up the prices of these NFTs to extraordinary highs while misleading investors into buying into the collection.

Cocoa is the new bitcoin


Cocoa, the raw ingredient used to make chocolate, has been on an incredible price run, doubling in value since the start of 2024 and up over 250% since late last year. So far, the commodity is garnering better returns than bitcoin — and most stocks and bonds, for that matter.
The bitter seed has seen a massive surge in price after crops were damaged in West Africa and it found its supply chain strained. Meanwhile, chocolate bar manufacturers have been earning fantastic profits while simultaneously selling fewer products, suggesting that companies are helping to keep inflation high, and passing along what is otherwise known as price gouging to retail customers.
Cocoa has doubled in value since the start of 2024 and is up over 250% since late last year.

Of course, a commodity shooting up in value tends to get compared to bitcoin simply due to price action. In 2021, the price of lumber went through the roof, mainly due to a combination of new construction projects during and post-COVID-19 and a supply chain strain.
The price action caused the criminal CEO Sam Bankman-Fried to list a tokenized lumber futures market on the now-defunct FTX.
After the wild run in 2021, lumber prices have come back to Earth, down over 60% since all-time highs.
However, other commodities have been on price tears recently, with gold finally cracking and maintaining all-time highs that have hardly been touched since 2011. Uranium also hit highs not seen since 2007, and orange juice has seen prices go up only since 2021.

Can Intel and AMD Compete with Nvidia? - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Within a single year, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) gained a 260% valuation boost, increasing its market cap by $1.6 trillion. That is more than double the combined market cap of Nvidia’s three closest competitors: AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm.



By outgrowing its video gaming roots into a data center supplier, Nvidia deftly scooped the hype spilling from the AI bandwagon train. Investors were further fortified in their confidence in February when Nvidia reported 765% year-over-year growth in earnings to a $22.1 billion revenue.



However, the infrastructure for wide AI applications is just in the starting phase. On the long road, could Nvidia pop off amid stiff competition? Case in point, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) was once regarded as the most valuable stock in the world, only for its bubble to burst after its $555.4 billion market cap peak.



These AI chip stocks have what it takes to tackle Nvidia’s current dominance.



Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)



Sharing CPU duopoly with AMD for the PC market, Intel is down 12% year-to-date. During 2023, Intel laid off 311 workers, with an additional 140 layoffs this year. Once the industry standards were set, Intel was perceived as having passed its glory.



However, an established company like Intel has deep human capital and funds to turn its fortunes around. Intel still holds market share dominance in the integrated PC graphics market, at 68%, compared to AMD at 13% and Nvidia at 19%. Likewise, Intel CPUs make up 75% of the laptop market share.



Moreover, Intel started to disrupt the AMD/Nvidia duopoly within the discrete GPU market segment in 2022. Settling for the mid-range segment, Intel’s ARC A750 and Arc A770 GPUs gained a 1% market share by Q4 2023.

According to the latest report from Jon Peddie Research (JPR), add-in board (AIB) market shipments for discrete GPUs have increased by 32% Year over Year. From 2023 to 2028, Research and Markets forecasts a CAGR of 29.72% for the AIB market. To become more agile, Intel reorganized its divisions into Client Computing Group (CCG) and Data Center and AI (DCAI) as the main breadwinners.



According to the latest earnings report, they both generated less revenue on an annual basis at $29.3 billion (CCG, down 8%) and $15.5 billion (DCAI, down 20%). Yet, the company continues deploying cutting-edge chips, such as the 5th Gen Intel Xeon, optimized for AI workloads. In January, Intel revealed its intention to tackle the auto AI chip market by acquiring French startup Silicon Mobility.



To stand out from Qualcomm and Nvidia, Intel will align its supply of auto chips from low-tier to premium vehicles as a way to better scale. In collaboration with Qualcomm and Google to tackle Nvidia’s dominance within the UXL Foundation, Intel is deploying its open-source software tools, such as OneAPI.



Due to these AI expansions and market entrenchment in key segments, Intel will likely see a turnover in 2025. In the meantime, 36 analysts aggregated by Nasdaq view the average INTC price target at $47.05 vs the current $41.90, with the high estimate going up to $68 twelve months ahead.





Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)



A constant companion of Nvidia and Intel in the segments above, AMD has made the heaviest inroads to tackle Nvidia. AMD introduced Instinct MI300X AI chips outside competitive discrete GPUs, offering a superior price-performance ratio to Nvidia’s H100s.



Image credit: AMD


TensorWave, a cloud provider for training AI models, fully onboarded AMD’s offering, which suggests that other AI startups and companies are making similar price-performance calculations. If this trend continues, it could spell a repeat of the AMD-Nvidia discrete GPU wars. 



According to JPR, Nvidia still dominates this segment at 80% market share, but AMD’s GPU shipments increased by 117% during 2023. This increased AMD’s market share from 12% in Q4 2022 to 19% in Q4 2023. Being a smaller, more agile company than Intel, these results translated to the company’s positive growth figures.



In the Q4 2023 report, Intel reported a 3,076% YoY increase in net income to $667 million. Even more tellingly, AMD increased its operating margin from negative 3% to positive 6% over the same period. Owing to its highly competitive CPU pricing, AMD also reached a new milestone in February by increasing its PC market share to 20.2% vs Intel’s 79.8%.



Based on 36 analyst inputs aggregated by Nasdaq, the average AMD price target twelve months ahead is $201.26 vs the current $180, while the high estimate is $270 per share. Overall, this evens out INTC vs AMD’s potential average gains at 12%.

Meme coins are new go-to-market strategies in crypto, says Variant Fund co-founder - Crypto Briefing




Crypto projects are increasingly using popular meme coins and their vibrant communities to jumpstart adoption and growth for new products and protocols, according to a Mar. 25 article by Variant Fund’s co-founder and general partner Li Jin. While often dismissed as speculative assets, meme coins and their loyal communities are increasingly becoming part of crypto projects’ go-to-market strategies.By launching an app or infrastructure that natively integrates with a trending memecoin, the project can activate the memecoin’s large holder base to drive usage and overcome the “cold start” problem many new products face, she explains.“One emerging go-to-market strategy is to draft off a meme coin that is gaining adoption and momentum,” said Li Jin in the article. “While traditional GTM consisted of first building a product, then building a community around it through marketing and memes, this new playbook involves identifying a vibrant community of users around a meme coin, then building a product that incorporates that token.”For example, BONKbot, a Telegram trading bot on Solana, originated from the $BONK token, a Solana meme coin that was airdropped in late 2022. An independent team then launched the trading bot, which uses part of fees to buy and burn BONK tokens, aligning itself with token holders.This strategy also works for infrastructure projects. Shibarium, an Ethereum Layer 2 led by memecoin Shiba Inu, will use transaction fees to burn SHIB tokens. By incorporating the token into the layer 2, Shibarium can leverage SHIB’s vast holder base to drive usage of the new scaling solution.Another example is Berachain, an EVM-compatible blockchain with a bear theme that launched its testnet in January 2023. Berachain originated from Bong Bears, an NFT project, and has converted that community into an engaged developer and user base for its blockchain.For crypto teams exploring this strategy, considerations include assessing memecoin distribution, complementarity of users, and saturation of existing integrations. Memecoins also benefit from increased utility and can incentivize partnerships.

Binance's Smart Retrieval System Lowers Fees to 5 USDT - Coin Edition


							


Binance slashes the token recovery fee from $500 to just 5 USDT.



Smart Retrieval now supports chains like ETH and MATIC, reducing user error costs.



Binance streamlines fund recovery with a 14-day maximum wait and simple clicks.






Binance has reportedly updated its customer support offerings, integrating a wide selection of “smart retrieval” cryptocurrencies into its service. This update is said to facilitate the recovery of tokens deposited in error by users at a greatly reduced fee. 







The cost for retrieval, which previously could amount to as much as $500, has now been standardized to 5 USDT, marking a notable shift in the exchange’s approach to user support. The exchange’s “smart retrieval” function reportedly aims to address accidental deposits of unsupported tokens over a variety of blockchain networks, including but not limited to MATIC, TRX, BSC, FTM, ETH, and HT. 



It has further come to light that, alongside the lowered retrieval fees, Binance has expanded support to include a range of on-chain currencies like BASE, NEAR, and ZKSYNCERA. This expansion is allegedly in response to user feedback and illustrates Binance’s attention to evolving its services to meet user demand.



Moreover, the introduction of an easy retrieval process has also been mentioned, where users who inadvertently deposit unsupported tokens can now reportedly trigger an automatic refund mechanism. This process has been simplified through a ‘retrieve now’ button that appears in the user’s transaction history, purportedly streamlining the return of funds to just a simple click.

The recovery time has also been improved, with Binance aiming to return funds within a maximum of 14 working days. The strategy employed by Binance to handle deposit inaccuracies involves a structured system where the resolution timeframe and associated fees are said to be dependent on the error type. This approach allows for a more customized solution for users’ varying issues.

Solana, Avalanche Post Big Gains as Crypto Market Rebounds - Decrypt

The cryptocurrency market shows signs of recovery, with Bitcoin on track to return to the $70,000 milestone. Among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) have the best price performance, notching the most gains in the last 24 hours.Solana (SOL) is currently the best-performing token among the top 10, with a +9% recovery in the last day. According to Coinmarketcap data, the price of Solana surged from $176 to $192, continuing its rebound from the weekend. The coin's outlook remains bullish, with consistent performance above its EMA10 (10-day exponential moving average) through 2024 to date, indicating that investors who bought and held the coin for a little over a week have generally seen gains.Image: TradingviewHowever, Solana may be approaching a decisive zone, with the potential for a correction—or a trend reversal in a worst-case scenario. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator (a metric that measures in which part of the market cycle an asset is) suggests a possible switch to a bearish posture, while the ADX (average directional index) indicates that the bullish trend is slowing down. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) has dropped from 86 to 63, signaling a more balanced market mood, albeit still bullish. Traders considering holding the coin for longer timeframes should be cautious, as a correction may be on the horizon.Avalanche (AVAX) is also experiencing strong price performance, with the native cryptocurrency of the Avalanche ecosystem surging from $53.60 to $58.30 in the last 24 hours—an +8.87% spike. Although the price of Avalanche is still down 10% in the last seven days, its bullish trend continues, with the gap between the EMA10 and EMA55 widening over time.Image: TradingviewThe Avalanche Foundation's efforts to stimulate its memecoin ecosystem with a liquidity injection program may be contributing to the coin's positive performance. However, like Solana, Avalanche is experiencing some market uncertainty in the short term.The Squeeze Momentum Indicator also points to a possible bearish correction here, and the RSI is only slightly bullish at 62, with the ADX at a mere 23 —probably in the lower threshold of what can be considered a strong trend. This volatility may present opportunities for scalpers and day traders, but swing traders should exercise caution.Beyond the cryptocurrency market, global stock markets experienced a minor bearish correction at the start of the week. The S&P 500 is down -0.12%, the Nasdaq -0.14%, and the UK's FTSE100 -0.05%. The Shanghai Composite is down -0.9%, while European markets are performing slightly better, with Spain's IBEX up 0.7%, France's CAC40 up 0.14%, and Germany's DAX up 0.28%.Overall, markets appear stable on Monday, with no significant movements in either direction.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Navigating post-halving landscape: What to expect for Bitcoin price and network security

The rewards for mining Bitcoin are about to be chopped in half for miners in a scheduled event called “the halving.” This anti-inflationary measure is predicted to occur on or about April 17, 2024. Though it won’t be the first such halving event, the crypto world is poised to enter the unknown, as recent all-time highs in price and a somewhat crowded mining landscape bring mystery and suspense to what could become one of the most important days in cryptocurrency history.The months leading up to the halving have seen the approval of the first-ever spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States as well as a new all-time-high Bitcoin (BTC) price of $73,679 set on March 13, 2024. Whether the price will deflate, rocket or maintain after the April halving event is anyone’s guess — there are no guarantees. But if the past is any indicator of the future, previous halving events can be studied to get an idea of how this year’s could play out.Historical halving pricesBitcoin block number one was mined with a reward of 50 BTC on Jan. 3, 2009. The first halving event occurred on Nov. 28, 2012, and reduced that reward to 25 BTC per block. At the time, BTC was sitting at $12.20. Quick fact: If one had spent $100 on BTC the day of the first halving, they'd have snagged 8.9 BTC. Then, if they had managed to hold their coins until March 13, 2024, when BTC reached its most recent all-time high, the $100 investment would have been worth $655,743.After the first halving, the price of BTC shot up from $12.20 to around $1,000 by the end of 2023. The second halving event happened on July 9, 2016. This brought the reward for mining a single block to 12.5 BTC. At the time, Bitcoin was valued at around $640. By July 2017, it had risen to $2,550.May 11, 2020, brought the third and most recent halving event. Bitcoin mining rewards were reduced to 6.25 BTC per block and traded for about $8,750 at the time. Within a year, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of approximately $62,000. The 2024 halvingWith this year’s halving set to happen in mid-April, both the price of BTC and speculation surrounding the event have reached all-time highs. Analysts are predicting everything from around $75,000 just after the halving occurs to $250,000 or more within about a year of the halving. As history has shown, the price of BTC has typically skyrocketed over the next year after halving events, but some drawbacks and recessions have occurred in the months between the date of the halving and upward momentum. It’s important to note that predictions concerning market movements are just that — predictions. Nobody knows for sure whether Bitcoin will fall, moon or stabilize after the halving. However, history has seemingly favored the bold, with all-time highs tending to follow halving events. Bitcoin network securityAside from concerns over price, there are unanswered questions surrounding network security in the post-halving world. At the far end of the spectrum, there are potential security risks involved in the halving due to the potential for smaller miners to be forced out of the scene. With rewards slated to be reduced by 50%, those miners operating at the edge of profitability/loss could find themselves staked out of the rewards spectrum and seeking a sell-off or unaided exit. It’s possible a transient flux of mining availability could cause ripples throughout the Bitcoin network that reduce hash rates and lower overall security. However, on the other end of the spectrum, previous halving events have had almost no discernible effect on overall network security, and many analysts are predicting smooth sailing for the network itself.

Did Solana Flip Ethereum? What the Numbers Really Show - DailyCoin


        
Coingecko report shows Solana dominating investor interest in 2024.



Ethereum and BNB trail behind, while Base and Arbitrum emerge as leading layer-2. 



However, a closer look at the numbers paints a different picture. 
Solana, known for its high-performance network, has been on a roll in 2024, with a surge in value and network transaction volume. Moreover, recent reports suggest interest in the network is skyrocketing, capturing nearly half of the global crypto investor interest in 2024. This surge places Solana at the forefront of blockchain ecosystems, surpassing long-standing leaders like Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain. However, is Solana really about to outpace these networks? A closer look at the figures paints a different picture, largely driven by retail enthusiasm.What Solana’s Lead in Investor Interest Actually MeansOn March 25, CoinGecko released a study suggesting a significant leap in interest for Solana’s blockchain ecosystem. The study, focusing on non-botted global web traffic from January 1 to March 18, reveals that nearly 50% of crypto investor interest pivoted toward Solana. According to the study, Solana commands 49.3% of global crypto investor interest. Once the undisputed leader, Ethereum now holds 12.7% of investor interest, placing it in second position. At the same time, BNB holds 5.38% of investor interest. These numbers led to reports of Solana flipping Ethereum. However, this sentiment is largely exaggerated due to the nature of the metrics used in Coingecko’s study. The focus on web traffic predominantly captures retail investor interest. Retail investors are likelier to research and explore blockchain ecosystems through web platforms. Institutional investors, on the other hand, rely on a variety of data and analysis tools that may not directly contribute to web traffic metrics. But even when they did, web traffic does not account for the outsized influence of both institutions and crypto whales on the crypto market. Therefore, the surge in interest in Solana can be interpreted as a significant increase in retail enthusiasm for the platform. Why Retail Investor Interest in Solana SurgedThe remarkable surge in retail investor interest in Solana throughout 2024 was largely driven by the surge of Solana memecoins. Memecoins like BONK, Book of Meme (BOME), and Dogwifhat (WIF) have seen explosive growth.For instance, BONK surged 4051.23% since its launch last year, while dogwifhat surged 1653.44% in that period. BOME, on the other hand, only launched in March 2024 and is already up 1402.63%. The rise of memecoins on Solana has undoubtedly contributed to the blockchain’s visibility and appeal among retail investors, marking an interesting development in cryptocurrency. On the Flipside
The memecoin surge in Solana is not without its critics. Even Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko urged traders not to dump significant amounts of capital in memecoin presales. 



Solana memecoins have recently gotten negative attention due to a large number of memecoins with overtly racist themes. 
Why This MattersThe surge in retail interest in Solana captures the trend of memecoin trading, in which Solaan is growing. Read more about the surge of Solana memecoins: Solana’s Stellar Rise in 2024: What’s Behind the Success? Read more about the privacy concerns with Worldcoin: Worldcoin’s Big Privacy Update: Does it Keep Users Safe?

Bitcoin Whales Remove A Staggering $2.3 Billion From Exchanges, Is It Time To Buy?


                            Bitcoin whales have been very active in the past few days as the crypto continues to trade below $68,000. Notably, on-chain data has shown a trend of accumulation among Bitcoin whales, with large bouts of the cryptocurrency leaving crypto exchanges into private wallets.  These massive transfers appear to have piqued the interest of a few investors who are keeping a watchful eye, as this accumulation pattern points to a price increase up ahead. 
According to various posts by whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts, Bitcoin whales have recently transferred $2.3 billion worth of BTC in a span of 24 hours, indicating their bullish sentiment. Similarly, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently revealed that over 25,000 BTC worth approximately $1.60 billion had been transferred into accumulation addresses.
Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Signal Price Surge Ahead
Bitcoin has largely traded below $69,000 since March 15, struggling to regain the momentum that saw it shooting past $70,000 earlier in the month. Interestingly, Bitcoin fell to as low as $61,766 last week, representing a 16% decline from its all-time high. 

Meanwhile, Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw consistent outflows throughout the week which was spearheaded by Grayscale’s GBTC and weak inflows into BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. This decline became much of a concern for investors as it signaled the bullish sentiment surrounding BTC might finally be coming to an end.
However, on-chain data is now telling a different tale of a strong bullish sentiment from Bitcoin whales. Data from Whale Alerts show large amounts of BTC leaving crypto exchanges, one of which was a transfer of 8,136 BTC worth $517 million from Coinbase into a new private wallet. Shortly after, 8,172 BTC worth $519 million were transferred from Coinbase into another new private wallet. Interestingly, the different alerts from the whale tracker added up to $2.3 billion worth of BTC to and from crypto exchanges on March 22. 
Analyst Ali Martinez noted that these transfers added up to $1.6 billion being added into accumulation addresses, the largest inflow so far this year. 

According to CryptoQuant data, this accumulation trend has seen the Bitcoin reserves on exchanges on a downtrend since March 21. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin exchange reserve is at 1.98 million BTC. 

Basically, whale accumulation tends to swing the balance into bullish among other traders. Fundamentals surrounding Bitcoin like the upcoming halving point to price growth in the near future, making it an ideal time for investors to position themselves in the market. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,478. A key price level to watch is $69,000. If Bitcoin breaks above this resistance level, it could continue surging higher with the accumulation trend.

Here’s Why The Dogecoin Price Surged Over The Weekend | Bitcoinist.com


								Popular doggy-themed cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, has recently experienced an exponential surge in its price value. Despite its previously sluggish price momentum, Dogecoin witnessed a massive $800 million increase in open interest over the weekend. Interestingly, a recent development indicates that Elon Musk’s X Payment LLC has greatly contributed to this price pump. 
Why Dogecoin Price Rose 35%
Over the past 72 hours, the price of Dogecoin witnessed a 35% increase in its value, recording an impressive weekly high of $0.17 on Saturday.  According to data from Santiment, a crypto analytics platform, the cryptocurrency has also witnessed a significant rise in open interest, skyrocketing by a remarkable $800 million in value. 

This massive price surge has been attributed to a recent development in Elon Musk’s payment subsidiary, X Payments LLC. According to reports, X Payments has successfully expanded its operational capabilities to three new states. The platform has secured money transmitter licenses in Mexico, Oregon and Illinois.
Following the disclosure of this news, the sentiment surrounding Dogecoin had transformed, as speculations about the meme coin potentially becoming a preferred payment method for the X Payments began to spread like wildfire. At the time of writing the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.172, reflecting a 14.27% price increase over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. 
Interestingly, Dogecoin has already been integrated as a payment method within Musk’s Tesla merchandise store. In 2023, the SpaceX CEO also teased about the possibility of DOGE payments on X (formerly Twitter), pushing the broader crypto community on edge as they anticipated the potential inclusion of DOGE in the payments ecosystem. 
Presently, as X Payments expands its services and possibly prepares for a launch, speculations are growing stronger, driving up Dogecoin’s price amidst the rising interest in the cryptocurrency’s potential integration with X Payments.
DOGE Whales On The Move
A recent report has revealed that an anonymous Whale made a substantial purchase of 25 million DOGE tokens, valued at $3.75 million, within the last 72 hours. The timing of this acquisition is particularly noteworthy as it aligns with the recent rise in Dogecoin’s price and open interest over the weekend. 

The Whale’s purchase also coincides with X Payments expansion efforts into new regions, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment as investors are now showing an elevated interest in DOGE. If Dogecoin becomes integrated as a payment currency within X Payments, the cryptocurrency could witness a significant boost in adoption, potentially attracting more whales and new investors and triggering a substantial price surge.

Terra Luna Classic Defies TOP 100 Fallout with 35% Surge - DailyCoin


        
Terra Classic (LUNC) nears a $1 billion market cap upon Do Kwon’s release.



Hard Fork on Terra Classic’s chain today is set to activate a key proposal.



Details emerge on code enhancements as LUNC trades skyrocket 263%.
Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) showcased a series of bullish impulses during the weekend despite trading below the $0.0002 price range. Surging by 21% on Saturday, LUNC is rapidly approaching a $1 billion market capitalization after a 10-day hiatus. LUNC claimed a 3-month high in market cap of $1.32 billion on March 5, 2024.However, the latest upswing can be ascribed to Montenegro’s Supreme Court decision to release Terra chain’s co-founder Do Kwon from prison after serving a four-month sentence for forging multiple documents, including a fake Costa Rican passport. As Do Kwon awaits developments in the hearing of TerraForm Labs versus the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today, March 25 is as important for Terra Classic’s community.According to several LUNC chain validators, a critical upgrade to the Layer-1 blockchain will occur today at approximately 15:51:14 (GMT+1). According to widely accepted proposal #12090, the hard fork on the network introduces new functionality like an E2E, Interchain Testing Suity, and IBC Hooks by Genuine Labs. This is expected to widen the scalability of decentralized applications, most notably EnterpriseDAO.Terra Classic Gets Confluent Support BoostCryptocurrency traders on X are analyzing Terra Classic’s 35% monthly upswing, attributing the bullish momentum to developments on the chain and Do Kwon’s postponed extradition. On the technical side, LUNC has broken through confluent support to reach daily heights of $0.0001712, according to CoinGecko.Moreover, Terra Classic’s market data showcases a tremendous upward trend in LUNC trading. The combined liquidity book has increased by 263.62% over the past 24 hours, as both pending buys and sells are split at 6 million each, hinting that bulls are not holding a strong advantage just yet.On the Derivative side, the 1000LUNC smart contract witnessed a 38% daily spike to $199.06M. Leveraged smart contracts are measured by Open Interest (OI), which recorded a 5.20% growth over the latest 24-hour timeframe. According to CoinGlass on-chain stats, Binance users are bullish on Terra Luna Classic, as the long positions outweigh the shorts by 3.58 to 1.On the Flipside
TerraForm Labs declared bankruptcy in January 2024. However, the legal scrutiny surrounding crypto entrepreneur Do Kwon’s activities still tends to influence the prices of all three associated tokens: LUNC, LUNA & USTC.

London Stock Exchange eyes crypto ETN listings in late May - Blockworks


The London Stock Exchange is looking to list crypto exchange traded notes (ETNs) by the end of May following a shift in stance by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Earlier this month, the exchange had signaled its intent to start accepting proposals for physically backed bitcoin- and ether-related ETNs — debt securities that would trade on the exchange during London trading hours.
Read more: London Stock Exchange to accept physically-backed crypto ETN proposals
The London Stock Exchange on Monday gave more clarity on next steps for those looking to issue such products.
Applications for bitcoin and ether ETNs can be made starting on April 8, the exchange said in a Monday notice. Issuers will have until April 15 to submit such proposals if they want to have the securities listed on May 28, it added.
The exchange chose May 28 for listing crypto ETNs “to enable the maximum number of issuers to be present in the market on the first day of trading.”
Issuers will need some time to prepare a “base prospectus” that will need FCA approval.
Read more: The UK is at a turning point in crypto regulation, policymakers say 
The London Stock Exchange has said it would only consider physically backed bitcoin and ether ETNs with its assets “wholly or principally held in cold storage.” If no such storage exists, the issuer will have to gain third-party audit reports and secure regulated custodians.
Movement on the crypto ETN front in the UK marks a milestone of sorts given the previous stringent stance by the region’s regulator.
The FCA had banned the sale, marketing and distribution of crypto ETNs to retail consumers in January 2021. It said in a March 11 statement that it would not object to exchanges listing such ETNs — as long as such products were available only to professional investors. 
Read more: After US bitcoin ETFs, the UK fights for retail to have the same freedom
While the crypto ETN ban remains in place for retail customers, Bittrex Global CEO Oliver Linch called the FCA’s move a “pretty big reversal” for the regulator.
“Given London’s status as a global financial hub, it was always inevitable that the FCA would have to respond at some point to the investors’ demands to access crypto investment products,” Linch told Blockworks. “Crypto products such as [crypto] ETNs are now a vibrant asset class in portfolio management across the EU and US. The UK had to catch up and respond given the depth and breadth of the investment landscape here.”

Analyst Presents Top 10 Cryptos To Turn $5,000 Into $500,000


                            In a thread on X (formerly Twitter), the popular crypto analyst known as cyclop (@nobrainflip) delivered a bold forecast to his substantial following of 394,000. He proclaimed, “We are close to the biggest altseason in history. Everyone will make x50-x100 on their entire portfolio. $5k portfolio will be around $250k-$500k in 2025. All you need is to buy the right lowcaps.”
This assertion hinges on a strategic selection of low market capitalization cryptocurrencies, which, according to Cyclop, are poised for an exponential surge in value. Cyclop elucidates his strategy by detailing the liquidity flow typically observed during a bull market phase, a sequential process starting with Bitcoin (BTC) and cascading down to meme coins.
He explains, “Here is a typical bull run liquidity flow: 1: BTC pump 2: ETH pump 3: High cap alts pump 4: Low caps pump 5: Memecoin pump.” Importantly, he highlights that high cap memecoins have already experienced their growth phase, suggesting that “lowcap/lowcap memecoins – next” are primed for significant value appreciation.

Within this framework, Cyclop underscores the potential for staggering returns without the necessity for professional day trading expertise. “It’s cause each coin has its maximum, and if its MC is already high, it’s not so far away. But when the market cap is almost at zero, the potential is enormous,” he advises, promoting a hands-off investment strategy focused on the ‘right’ coins.
Crypto Watchlist: Top-10 Lowcap Coins
Cyclop’s watchlist is a selection of ten recently launched projects with low market caps and, in his view, substantial growth potential:
#1 Wolf Wif (BALLZ): A meme coin that took the Solana blockchain by storm, achieving a $75 million market cap within a day of its launch. Despite a subsequent correction, Cyclop views this as an optimal entry point, confidently stating, “I’m holding my BALLZ tight.”
#2 Entangle (NGL): Positioned as a potential leading messaging infrastructure for the Web3 space, Entangle aims to enhance liquidity within the ecosystem. It offers secure, flexible, and interoperable solutions for blockchain data communication, positioning itself as a critical infrastructure for dApps and builders.
#3 StarHeroes (STAR): This esports-centric, multiplayer third-person space shooter game is making waves with its dynamic and competitive gameplay. Cyclop sees this as a revolutionary blend of gaming and blockchain technology, offering intense gaming emotions and a new avenue for esports within the crypto realm.
#4 Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA): A blockchain strategy game that allows players to build bases, engage in battles for cryptocurrency rewards, and form partnerships with landowners. Cyclop highlights its potential in the play-to-earn space, marking it as a standout project.
#5 VoluMint (VMINT): This project introduces a decentralized, AI-driven market-making service, aiming to redefine market-making in the era of blockchain. Cyclop is bullish on its ability to unlock the potential of crypto projects, emphasizing its innovative approach.
#6 SatoshiVM (SAVM): As a decentralized Bitcoin ZK Rollup Layer 2 solution, SatoshiVM bridges the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s EVM, using BTC as gas. This project aims to combine the value and security of Bitcoin with the programmability of Ethereum, creating a powerful ecosystem for decentralized applications. Cyclop notes, “SAVM’s unique positioning as a bridge between BTC and EVM ecosystems presents a groundbreaking opportunity for growth.”

#7 Graphlinq Chain (GLQ): Offering a no-code interface for automating blockchain tasks, Graphlinq Chain simplifies the creation and deployment of blockchain automations. Its suite of tools, including an IDE, App, Engine, and Marketplace, is designed to make blockchain automation accessible to a wider audience. “GraphLinq Protocol demystifies blockchain automation, paving the way for innovative applications and efficiencies,” Cyclop remarks.
#8 zKML (ZKML): This project addresses the pressing need for privacy in digital transactions and communications. By combining zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and multi-party computation (MPC), zKML offers a secure and private framework for blockchain interactions. “ZKML’s focus on privacy-enhancing technologies is timely and critical, offering a secure haven for digital transactions,” observes Cyclop.
#9 Monai (MONAI): Monai stands out for its development of uncensored generative AI tools, integrated with its blockchain, Monad. It features an advanced, unrestricted Large Language Model as its flagship product, aiming to revolutionize the way we interact with AI. “Monai’s pioneering approach to generative AI within the blockchain space is a game-changer, offering unparalleled possibilities,” Cyclop asserts.
#10 EMC Protocol (EMC): Dedicated to AI applications, EMC Protocol is a blockchain network that includes a computing power consensus mechanism. It aims to facilitate the execution of AI tasks within a decentralized framework, including validator, smart router, and computing power nodes. “EMC’s innovative approach to integrating AI and blockchain could redefine the landscape of decentralized applications,” Cyclop concludes.
At press time, cyclop’s top pick – BALLZ – traded at $0.04231, down almost 50% from its alltime-high.

Bitcoin ETFs, Crypto Funds Lost Nearly $1 Billion Last Week Due to Investor 'Hesitancy' - Decrypt

After a powerhouse run of several weeks of gains, investors last week pulled out close to $1 billion from crypto investment products.A new report from digital asset fund manager CoinShares on Monday dropped figures showing that $942 million exited funds, such as those giving investors exposure to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. “Hesitancy amongst investors led to record net outflows of $942 million,” the report read, adding that Bitcoin’s price dip last week led to the outflows. Bitcoin last week experienced a crash after the week before touching a new all-time high. It has since been struggling to break above its November 2021 top of $69,000 per coin, though it finally cracked through early Monday.Most of the focus was on Bitcoin, with huge amounts of money exiting Grayscale’s newly converted exchange-traded fund (ETF), GBTC. Investors have been fast redeeming shares from the ETF since it evolved from an essentially closed-end fund in January. But despite the Grayscale outflows, cash still hit other Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, the report said. Elsewhere, crypto funds in Europe giving investors exposure to altcoins also experienced significant outflows.Previous to last week’s outflows, investors had pumped cash into crypto investment products for seven weeks in a row. The newly approved spot Bitcoin ETFs—given the green light by the Securities and Exchange Commission in January—have been particularly popular. Bitcoin’s price currently stands at $70,644, according to CoinGecko, up 7.5% in the past 24 hours but still below the new all-time high of $73,737 it touched earlier this month.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Detained Binance Executive "Jailbreaks" Nigerian Custody - DailyCoin


        
The Binance Nigeria regulatory tussle has continued to escalate.



One of the detained Binance executives has escaped custody.



The escape has triggered official charges against the exchange.
Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has recently come under the ire of the Nigerian government following a year-long regulatory tussle with global financial authorities. Earlier this month, the government forced the exchange to suspend all naira-related services following a lengthy conflict on the manipulation of the country’s local currency.Despite Binance’s efforts to negotiate a resolution, local authorities intensified the crackdown on the exchange, resulting in the detention of two of the exchange’s executives. After nearly four weeks in captivity, one of the Binance executives has broken free.Binance Nigeria Saga Escalates into Jail BreakAccording to local media on Monday, March 25, Binance Africa regional manager Nadeem Anjarwalla escaped from the FCT-based Nigerian custody where he and his colleague Tigray Gambaryan were being held. The escape reportedly occurred on Friday, March 22, 2024, when guards on duty escorted Anjarwalla to a praying house for Ramadan prayers. The 38-year-old Binance executive, a British Kenyan, allegedly fled to a Nigerian airport and exited the country via a Middle East airline.Anjarwalla’s means of escape have remained unclear, particularly considering local authorities’ reported confiscation of his British passport and other travel documents. According to Premium Times Nigeria, an Immigration official asserted that Anjarwalla fled Nigeria using his Kenyan passport. The official added that an investigation is underway to unravel how he obtained the passport, given that the document was not in his possession when he was taken into custody.The escape and broader intensifying saga have triggered a slew of charges against the exchange, as the government officially named both executives and the organizations as perpetrators of tax evasion.The second Binance executive, Tigray Gambaryan, remains in custody. Binance has previously asserted ongoing efforts to facilitate the executives’ return home. To further understand the tussle between Binance and the Nigerian government, read here:Binance Nigeria User Data Hunt Escalates with Court Order Read more about Do Kwon and his fate:Do Kwon Released from Jail: Is He in the Clear After All?

ZachXBT's Update on Probe Uncovers More Scams Targeting Solana Investors


							

Investigator ZachXBT gives updates on presale scams targeting Solana investors.



Scammers Drain 655,000 SOL Tokens & collectively over $122.5 million from investors.



One victim loses $1.2 million after connecting their wallet to a fake presale website.




In a recent X post, blockchain sleuth ZachXBT exposed tactics used by scammers targeting Solana investors. One such scammer who goes by the username of “Sartoshi0x’s” account secretly pocketed a 62% of the SOL raised from a presale, totaling 7,000 SOL, and failed to fully distribute the promised tokens to investors. 



A user who goes by the name of ‘Jared_eth’ on X turned out to be a fake impersonating a well-known crypto figure, Jared MEV. This incident echoes a similar scam in June 2023, where another fake Jared account swindled investors out of $440,000. 



Another scammer who goes by the username of ‘bluekirbyftm’ following the presale, “rugged” the project. They swept away the funds raised and even published a nonsensical article defending their actions.



On 19th March, ZachXBT’s investigation revealed a reality underlying the recent surge in Solana-based meme coins. Eager investors, drawn by the temptation of high returns, participated in presales, only to fall victim to a web of fraudulent schemes. 



Uncovering at least 27 such scams, ZachXBT’s highly detailed inquiry exposed a network of deceit that drained over 655,000 SOL tokens, valued at a staggering $122.5 million.



The methods employed by these scammers varied, yet shared a common goal of exploitation. Additionally, tactics such as “wallet drain” functions were used to steal funds directly from investors’ wallets leaving many devastated. In one particularly concerning case, a single investor suffered a staggering loss of $1.2 million after connecting their wallet to a fake presale website.



Among the identified scammers, Vombatus who goes by the user name of ‘Vombatus_eth ‘ on X, emerged as a repeat offender with a  pattern of fraudulent activity by “rug pulling” another token after a presale that raised a significant sum of 13,000 SOL. As authorities and investors grapple with the aftermath of these scams, ZachXBT’s revelations serve as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in the volatile world of cryptocurrency investment.

Binance executive escapes Nigeria using fake passport

It has all the makings of a crypto-criminal thriller: a global digital currency exchange, an (alleged) tax money heist, captured executives, and Nigerian feds hot on the pursuit. But today, the real-life case of Binance and the nation of Nigeria added a new twist to the alleged caper: a high-stakes escape plot.Is it too late to invest in Nvidia? | Smart InvestingOne of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities this month has reportedly escaped detention using — what else? — fake travel documents. The Binance exec’s flight comes just as the the West African nation accelerates its legal chase; on the same day his alleged escape was reported, the Nigerian government launched new criminal charges against the crypto exchange for tax evasion.Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British-Kenyan national and Binance’s regional manager for Africa, and Tigran Gambaryan, head of financial-crime compliance at Binance who previously worked at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), have been forcefully held in Nigerian custody for weeks. Now, just Gambaryan reportedly remains: Anjarwalla allegedly escaped the detention after he was taken to a mosque on Friday.According to media reports, Anjarwalla took a Middle Eastern airline from the capital city of Abuja using fake passports and documents. It’s not clear how he did that, considering the Nigerian government was holding his British passport. Nigerian authorities say Anjarwalla escaped custody using a ‘‘smuggled passport.’’ But his family contests that, saying he left the country “by lawful means,” according to media reports.Binance, Nigeria, and the crypto clashThe tussle between Nigeria and Binance began in February when the country alleged the crypto exchange of destabilizing the national currency, the naira. Binance’s two officials visited the capital city, hoping that they could resolve the issue. Instead, both were taken to Nigeria’s National Security Agency’s guesthouse, where they were held in detention against their wishes.The West African country, known for being a global crypto hub, has been suffering an economic crisis for some time. Today, it filed a criminal tax evasion charge against the crypto exchange, accusing it of violating tax laws and laundering money.

Mark Zuckerberg embraces the Fediverse as Elon Musk’s social media empire shows decline

Meta’s Instagram and Threads have joined a group of social media platforms called the Fediverse. Essentially a federation of independent platforms, the Fediverse allows users on different servers to communicate with one another. While pundits and analysts are still debating the reasons behind the move, Meta says it was in line with its commitment to decentralization and privacy. A claim that can be somewhat substantiated by the current business climate.The $200 billion elephant in the roomThreads is Meta’s answer to microblogging, a short-form media-sharing paradigm where users post and interact with easily digestible snippets of content. X is the undoubted leader in the space, with approximately 335 million monthly users in 2024. However, that number doesn’t tell the whole story. When Elon Musk purchased X for $44 billion in October 2022, the social media site had approximately 368 million monthly users. That indicates a decline of 33 million users, or about 10% of the total user count. Much of this has been attributed to churn over the perceived polarization of X via Musk’s increased presence. Millions of people celebrated the purchase as, in their view, a win for so-called “internet free speech,” while others fled X over what they considered a right wing takeover of the world’s most popular microblogging platform. Fediverse and the futureMany of those who fled the site propped up decentralized offerings in the Fediverse — such as Mastodon, Pleroma and Misskey — as destinations for those fleeing Twitter and its new management. As it stands, X remains the most popular microblogging site by a far stretch, but it also exists in a state of evident decline. Both revenues and user counts are down year over year since Musk’s takeover. Although user count did see a brief bump in 2023, the subsequent decline has wiped out those gains. Threads, on the other hand, seemingly has nowhere to go but up. It currently has about 130 million active monthly users. Meta’s latest announcement that Threads and Instagram would both be joining the Fediverse could be seen as a move to counter Musk and X’s continuing trend towards centralization.Musk, the world’s richest (or second richest, depending on any given day’s market movement) person, has often stated that his intent with X was to build an “everything app” where users would communicate, monetize media, conduct financial transactions, and host their personal and professional brands. The Fediverse, on the other hand, is a suite of decentralized protocols allowing native third-party integration and, as Meta pointed out in its recent blog post, giving users control over their data:“One way to think about the fediverse is to compare it to email. You can send an email from a Gmail account to a Yahoo account, for example, because those services support the same protocols. Similarly, in the fediverse you can connect with people who use different social networking services that are built on the same protocol, removing the silos that confine people and their followers to any single platform. But unlike email, your fediverse conversations and profile are public and can be shared across servers.”As users continue to trickle away from Musk’s centralized Big Tech offering, the X “everything app,” decentralized offerings such as Mastodon offer a different lease on the idea of microblogging. And, arguably, the addition of Threads and Instagram brings with it a potential level of user activity previously unseen in the Fediverse.

Hong Kong Woman Scammed out of Nearly $1 Million After Sending Money To Fake Crypto Trading Platform: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A Hong Kong woman has reportedly been scammed to the tune of nearly $1 million after being enticed to send money to a fake crypto trading platform.
According to a new report from the South China Morning Post (SCMP), a 46-year-old woman from Hong Kong was tricked into sending just over $900,000 to 15 different foreign bank accounts between 2022 and 2023.










She was conned into sending the funds with promises that the money would be used to invest in digital assets. According to the report, she didn’t call authorities until last Tuesday, many months after she made her first deposit.
An anonymous source familiar with the matter told SCMP that the woman became suspicious when she could not contact the two individuals who lured her into depositing funds.
“She became suspicious only when she could not contact two online scammers and withdraw money from the trading platform. She found out it was a scam when she discussed it with her family.”
The source says the woman was contacted in 2022 through Instagram by a scammer who tricked her into investing in crypto through a non-existent trading platform. A second scammer then posed as an employee of the fictitious crypto trading service and instructed her to pour funds into specific accounts for about eight months.
 “Another suspect impersonated a customer service representative from the trading platform and instructed the victim to transfer more than HK $7.12 million ($908,000) into designated bank accounts between August 19, 2022, and March 4, 2023.”
The source also says the Hong Kong resident never saw profits from her investments.
Though no arrests have been made so far, the authorities say they are treating this incident as “obtaining property by deception,” a crime that can be punished by up to 10 years in prison, according to the report.

NFTs Get Divided: New Standard Promises Fractional Ownership - Benzinga

With the launch of the experimental hybrid token Pandora on Feb. 2, a new and unaudited mixed ERC20/ERC721 implementation has taken the non-fungible token (NFT) world by storm.Called the ERC-404 standard, this unofficial Ethereum standard mixes two well-established Ethereum standards to introduce fractional ownership to NFTs and potentially solve the liquidity problem facing NFTs today. In essence, Pandora's ERC-404 combines the fungibility of the ERC-20 standard that governs token issuance on the Ethereum blockchain, with the uniqueness afforded by the ERC-721 standard to provide a new standard for creating semi-fungible tokens that support NFT fractionalization. As a result, this ERC-404 standard could potentially spur the financialization of NFTs in the future, especially if existing ERC-721 NFT collections can be wrapped into ERC-404 interchangeable wrapped tokens.The Promise Of Semi-Fungibility: The Pandora project that has led to the creation of a new class of ERC-404 tokens in turn uses two assets: the ERC-20 token (PANDORA) and an ERC-721 token representing unique NFTs in the Replicants collection. For every PANDORA ERC-404 token purchased, buyers automatically receives a Replicants NFT in their wallet, with each NFT also having a rarity depicted by the color of the NFT box (red being most rare and green being most common). When the PANDORA token is sold, the mint-and-burn feature ensures that the associated NFT is burned, with buyers also having the option to store rare NFTs that they do not wish to burn when transferring PANDORA. On the other hand, when selling or transferring an NFT, only the fungible part of the PANDORA token is moved to the buyer's wallet along with the Replicants NFT, keeping the PANDORA token unaffected. The mint-and-burn feature allows for fractional purchases of the PANDORA token, automatically minting an NFT to the buyer's wallet if he/she owns enough fractions of the token to form a whole NFT. Thus, Pandora's ERC-404 standard can expand the use of tokens on the Ethereum platform to facilitate the exchange of non-fungible tokens and provide developers with a revolutionary new way of integrating NFTs into token projects.With Bitcoin ETF inflows breaking records, Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference, scheduled for Nov. 19, will bring industry leaders and investors together to discuss the future of digital asset investments.Also Read: Bitcoin Faces Potential Downturn As Profits Are Taken, Glassnode Data ShowsA Look At The Competition And The Future: Ever since the launch of the Pandora project, several competitors like the Divisible NFT standard (DN-404) and Injective Protocol's CW-404 standard have emerged to cash in on the hype surrounding ERC-404. In the same vein, Solana's SOL/USD SPL-20 tokens mimic ERC-404 tokens in terms of functionality to redefine the NFT experience on the Solana blockchain. Creators and developers are understandably excited by the potential for further innovation with the ERC-404 standard, opening up opportunities for integrating NFTs with the DeFi ecosystem as well as tokenizing in-game assets through native fractionalization to introduce new monetization models within the Metaverse. Still, as with every new innovation, there are certain risks surrounding the ERC-404 standard that need to be understood before investing in associated tokens. Foremost of them all is the fact that this new standard hasn't been recognized by the Ethereum ETH/USD Foundation and is yet to be taken up for vetting through an Ethereum Improvement Proposal, underscoring the potential of exploitation by bad actors. Secondly, the standard is at an experimental stage with a new v2.0-beta version still being tested by Pandora to eliminate bugs, introduce numerous logical optimizations and reduce gas costs. That said, recognizing ERC-404's immense potential in unlocking NFT liquidity and other collaborative applications within the Web3.0 ecosystem, investors should watch out for developments that could establish this experimental token standard as the blueprint for creating digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain.

This Stock Exchange Will List Bitcoin, Ethereum ETNs


The London Stock Exchange (LSE) has confirmed its plans to open its doors to trading cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs), specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum. 
This strategic move marks a pivotal moment in financial innovation, blending the traditional robustness of the stock market with the cryptocurrency market.
Crypto ETNs Arrive at the London Stock Exchange
The launch is conditional upon the approval of base prospectuses by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This is a necessary step in listing these financial instruments on the Main Market and the FCA’s Official List. The decision to set the trading commencement for late May 28, 2024, is deliberate. It aims to include the maximum number of issuers right from the get-go. 
This timing consideration also allows issuers ample time to meet the comprehensive requirements detailed in the Crypto ETN factsheet. It also allows them to prepare the essential documentation for establishing a Crypto ETN program, including a letter outlining compliance. 
Moreover, issuers interested in being part of this launch are required to submit specific details by April 15, 2024. 


“In choosing this date we have taken into consideration that we need to ensure that issuers meet the requirements for consideration detailed in the Crypto ETN factsheet,” the London Stock Exchange wrote. 

This meticulous preparation reflects the LSE’s commitment to ensuring that all listed Crypto ETNs meet the highest standards of transparency and regulatory compliance. However, issuers who fail to comply by May 22, 2024, will be ineligible for the initial day of trading.

This initiative is a significant leap toward integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial markets. It also reflects the London Stock Exchange’s authoritative stance in crypto, fostering innovation while ensuring investor protection and market integrity.

Binance Finally Leaves Russia? CommEX Ceases All Operations - DailyCoin


        
CommEX to halt new user registrations and asset transfers from Binance.



Changes will affect the CommEX P2P marketplace. 



The decision comes amid increasing sanctions on Russia. 
In a significant development within the cryptocurrency sector, CommEX, the entity that took over Binance’s operations in Russia, has announced its decision to cease all operations by May 10, 2024. This decision comes after Binance divested its Russian business to CommEX in September of the previous year amid significant regulatory pressures. Despite divesting from Russia, critics still pointed to potential links between Binance and CommEX.  CommEX Shuts Down After Binance DealCommEX, the platform that acquired Binance’s operations in Russia, has announced it will cease all operations by May 10, 2024. This decision follows the platform’s phased suspension of services, beginning with the cessation of new user registrations and asset transfers from Binance on March 25, 2024. Additionally, CommEX has stopped accepting fiat and cryptocurrency deposits.The company advises users to promptly close positions and withdraw assets to minimize disruptions and secure their holdings. This closure comes less than a year after Binance sold its Russian business to CommEX amid growing compliance concerns, marking a significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape within Russia​​​​​​.CommEX Ties to Binance and Regulatory IssuesThe transition of Binance’s Russian operations to CommEX was part of Binance’s broader compliance strategy. This strategy aims to realign its global operations amidst increasing geopolitical tensions and regulatory scrutiny. The exit came after Binance became a target of investigations by the US Justice Department into potential violations of war-related sanctions on Moscow. The transition of Binance’s operations in Russia to CommEX has sparked interest and speculation within the cryptocurrency community about the ties between the two exchanges. For instance, some users pointed out that parts of the CommEX site appeared almost identical to Binance’s, with only minor adjustments like logo and color scheme changes. This has led to speculation among the crypto community, with some suggesting that the similarity in website design indicates a deeper linkage between CommEX and Binance, possibly even involving shared operational or technological resources. Further fueling these speculations, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) acknowledged that some former Binance team members may have joined CommEX or have already joined. However, CZ stressed that the Binance has no direct ties to CommEX. He also claimed that there would be no ongoing revenue split from the sale, nor will it retain any buyback options. On the Flipside
The details of the Binance-CommEX deal were not disclosed to the public. 



Earlier, Binance came under fire for its Russian operations. Notably, the exchange facilitated P2P transfers without KYC requirements. 
Why This MattersThe evolving regulatory landscape globally presents significant challenges for cryptocurrency exchanges. The Binance-CommEX scenario illustrates the complexities of operating across different jurisdictions, especially when sanctions are involved. Read more about Binance-CommEX ties: Did Binance Really Leave Russia?

GameStop Stock Gains Ahead of Landmark Q4 Earnings Release - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



GameStop (NYSE: GME), the well-known video game retailer, is set to release its fourth-quarter earnings report after the market closes on March 26, 2023. The report is highly anticipated by investors and analysts alike, as it could serve as a significant catalyst for the company’s stock price. 



Analysts Expect $0.29 EPS, $2.05 Billion in Q4 Revenue for GameStop



Wall Street analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) of 29 cents and revenue of $2.05 billion for the holiday quarter of 2023.



The expected results for Q4 2023 show an improvement compared to the previous year’s performance. In Q4 2022, GameStop reported an EPS of 16 cents and revenue of $2.23 billion.



Investors and GameStop enthusiasts are closely monitoring the upcoming earnings release, hoping for strong results that could indicate positive momentum for the company.



The report’s significance lies in its potential to influence the stock’s direction, either positively or negatively, based on the company’s performance during the crucial holiday quarter.





GameStop Stock Gains Before Earnings Release



Leading up to the earnings release, GameStop’s stock price has experienced a notable uptick. At the time of writing, it was up 12.67%, trading at $14.76 per share, marking its potential for the largest daily percentage increase in four months.



However, the company’s stock faced challenges earlier in the year, with an 11.46% decline in 2024 compared to the S&P 500 index’s gain of 9.6%.



Despite the recent stock price movements, GameStop’s market capitalization and stock price remain significantly lower than their peaks during the meme stock craze of 2021.



The company has undergone major leadership changes to revitalize its business, with Ryan Cohen being named CEO in late September of the previous year. 







Do you think GameStop will be able to meet the expectations set for Q4? Let us know in the comments below.

London Resident Holding $2,500,000,000 in Bitcoin Convicted on Money Laundering Charges: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A woman who converted Bitcoin (BTC) into luxury houses and jewelry has reportedly been found guilty of engaging in a money laundering arrangement.
BBC reports that Jian Wen, a Chinese national and a resident of Hendon, North London, was convicted at the Southwark Crown Court on Monday.










In 2017, the 42-year-old woman posed as an employee of a jewelry business and tried to buy expensive houses in London but had trouble passing money laundering checks, so she decided to buy jewelry in Zurich and luxury properties in Dubai in 2019.
The Metropolitan Police Service (Met), which conducted a large-scale investigation of the case, searched several addresses, reviewed 48 electronic devices and examined thousands of digital files, including those that were translated from Mandarin.
Police later found and seized a Bitcoin trove initially worth around $2.52 billion, but is now valued at roughly $4.28 billion.
The Met says the seizure is by far the largest of its kind in the UK and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) already obtained a freezing order from the High Court that could lead to the forfeiture of the BTC stack. 
Says Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Prins,
“This verdict and lengthy five-year investigation demonstrates that we’ll leave no stone unturned in our pursuit to catch criminals who look to enjoy the proceeds of illicit funds – no matter how complex the case.”
Jian’s sentencing is set for May 10th.

Final Stretch: Binance vs. SEC Legal Duel Draws to Conclusion - Coin Edition


							

Binance and SEC engage in a thorough legal battle over transparency and regulatory compliance.



SEC pushes for detailed insights into Binance’s operations, focusing on wallet software and asset handling.



Binance responds with extensive document disclosure, aiming to resolve legal confrontation by April.




In the final stages of a lengthy legal battle, crypto firm Binance faces off against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With the discovery phase nearing completion, both parties are preparing for the last lap of this high-stakes confrontation.



According to Coinpedia’s report, in a careful exchange of requests and revelations, the SEC has pushed Binance for detailed insights into its operations. The agency’s focus spans from scrutinizing Binance’s wallet software to its handling of customer assets, seeking clarity on the cryptocurrency exchange’s modus operandi.



Consequently, Binance responded with 300,000 pages of documents, asserting compliance with disclosure obligations. Despite the exhaustive nature of the discovery process, both sides have delved deep into the technical difficulties of cryptocurrency operations.



Acknowledging the need for transparency, Binance pledged to provide additional non-privileged information, including internal communications between its employees and those of its US branch, Binance.US. With the court targeting April to wrap up all discovery and deposition processes, it indicates the imminent resolution of this legal saga.









At the core of the conflict stands Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance. As the SEC directs its inquiries toward Zhao, the exchange’s leadership demonstrates a willingness to engage constructively with regulatory concerns.



While Binance endeavors to streamline communication with the SEC, the regulatory agency remains guarded about its next steps. With a detailed approach, the SEC asserts its attention to safeguarding American investors by ensuring compliance and fairness within the crypto market.

Why Did Bitcoin (BTC) Price Soar Today? Here are Analysts' Theories - Bitcoin Sistemi

Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, started the last week of March on a high note, with an increase of approximately 6% and reclaiming the $ 70,000 level.
According to CoinMarketCap data, BTC price was last recorded at $70,701, an increase of 7.66%.


Another major cryptocurrency, Ethereum, also saw a significant increase, rising 5% to $3,631. The positive trend was not limited to these two, as most other cryptocurrencies also got caught up in the Bitcoin wave.
This increase follows a one-week correction for Bitcoin, which hit an all-time high of $73,797.68 on March 14. Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, told investors that such declines are “within the norm of historical bull market short-term corrections.”





The exact reason for today's significant rise remains unclear. However, Bitcoin's price action in March was characterized by healthy pullbacks followed by new highs. Thorn suggested that investors may have taken a break from selling their Bitcoin ETF shares.

“Record GBTC outflows over the last two weeks, likely driven by the Genesis and Gemini bankruptcy liquidations, contributed to the weakness in spot prices, but several technical indicators pointed to sellers being exhausted,” Thorn said.


Sam Callahan, chief analyst of BTC services firm Swan Bitcoin, suggested that the rise could be linked to recent messages from the FED. “FED officials made clear last week that they are considering both interest rate cuts and reducing the pace of the quantitative tightening program this year,” Callahan said and added:

“Such actions will improve liquidity conditions and act as a positive catalyst for asset prices. Bitcoin serves as a barometer of liquidity conditions and has responded positively to the Fed's message that monetary policy will likely ease in the near future.”

This Is Why Goldman Sachs Clients Focus on Bitcoin Now


The anticipation surrounding Bitcoin’s upcoming halving has sparked a notable shift in investors’ sentiment. Goldman Sachs, for instance, is witnessing a surge in interest from its hedge-fund clients towards the crypto market. 
This resurgence in enthusiasm is not limited to the speculative individual investor but extends to the sophisticated institutional investors.
Goldman Sachs Investors Want to Bet on Bitcoin
Max Minton, Goldman Sachs’ Asia Pacific Head of Digital Assets, said that the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has reignited the spark of interest among the firm’s clients. Many of them are either actively investing in the crypto market or exploring the potential to do so. 

“It was a quieter year last year, but we’ve seen a pickup in interest from clients in onboarding, pipeline, and volume since the start of the year,” Minton said.

Goldman’s current clientele, mainly conventional hedge funds, generate the bulk of interest. Additionally, the institution is broadening its reach to encompass a diverse range of clients. These include asset managers, its own banking customers, and certain firms specializing in digital assets.
Minton mentioned that clients engage with cryptocurrency derivatives to make speculative predictions, enhance yields, and hedge. He also noted that products related to Bitcoin continue to attract the most attention from clients. However, the level of interest in products associated with Ethereum could shift based on the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs in the US.
The impetus for this renewed interest can also be attributed to the forthcoming Bitcoin halving. Scheduled for late April, this event will halve the reward for Bitcoin mining, prompting miners to upgrade to more efficient technology to maintain profitability. This quadrennial update is critical for sustaining the economic model of Bitcoin, with the reward decreasing to 3.125 BTC from the current 6.25.

After the 2012 halving, the market capitalization of Bitcoin surged by more than 8,000%. In a similar vein, following the 2016 halving, Bitcoin’s value experienced a more than 1,400% increase. Meanwhile, it saw a rise of over 700% subsequent to the 2020 halving.
Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model. Source: Global X
Although the stock-to-flow (S2F) model, typically applied to commodities like gold, has its flaws, it serves as one method for assessing Bitcoin’s value. This model has demonstrated a historical correlation with the price fluctuations of Bitcoin. As Bitcoin becomes increasingly scarce, experts project its value will climb from its current price.

“Bitcoin (BTC) is poised for another seismic shift with its next halving event likely in April 2024. Historically, there is a correlation between halving events and subsequent increases in BTC’s price. Based on a stock-to-flow model, BTC could increase to over $130,000 by 2028,” Pedro Palandrani, Researcher at Global X, wrote.

From trading to blockchain innovation, Goldman Sachs’ engagement with the cryptocurrency market reflects a broader institutional acceptance of digital assets. As the halving approaches, the bank’s proactive stance on digital assets, coupled with its clients’ growing interest, represents a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency market.

230% Surge Incoming for AI Altcoin As Markets Bounce Back, According to Veteran Crypto Trader - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed trader says we “haven’t seen anything yet” as far as a crypto bull run, and is anticipating rallies for several altcoin projects.
Pseudonymous trader Criptopaul tells his 145,000 followers on the social media platform X that digital assets are edging toward a “parabolic phase” which will likely begin by Ethereum (ETH) outperforming Bitcoin (BTC).










“I assure you that you haven’t seen anything yet.
-Ethereum still has to outperform BTC and do ATH
-every other layer1-2 outperform Ethereum
-new ath on most of the altcoins that have worked hard since the previous cycle.
-We will probably see a new shakeout during Ethereum new Ath and then start of a huge parabolic phase. There where you should concentrate and start to sells.”
So far, Ethereum has not hit all-time highs, but BTC hit its all-time high on March 15.
One of the altcoins on Noodles’ radar is OPSEC, a project focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized cloud computing.
He says OPSEC is close to exiting a long Wyckoff-style accumulation phase, a charting pattern theory invented by investor Richard Wyckoff that aims to identify pre-rally accumulation setups.
Noodles targets the $8 level, which is 234% from OPSEC’s current price of $2.39.
“OPSEC in re-accumulation area, before next expansion phase and trend continuation, is pretty obvious.
Study Wyckoff , my greatest teacher.”
Source: Noodles/X
The trader is also expecting massive rallies for layer-one blockchain platform Internet Computer (ICP) According to Noodles, ICP is entering into an expansion phase which could eventually take it near the $115 level, a 579% move from current prices.
“ICP expansion phase is going to start here.”

To Infinity And Beyond: Analyst Forecasts Bitcoin To Hit $100,000 In High-Speed


                            Cryptocurrency expert and analyst Doctor Profit has identified regions that are vital for Bitcoin (BTC) presently, which could possibly propel the crypto asset’s price to unprecedented heights at a very fast pace.
For the most part, the cryptocurrency community is concerned about the way that Bitcoin’s price has performed during the last week. Nonetheless, Doctor Profit’s latest weekly update on the crypto market and Bitcoin has provided optimism for investors within the crypto space.
Bitcoin For A Massive Leg Up To $100,000
In his analysis, Doctor Profit explores the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), psychological analysis, and technical analysis (TA) of Bitcoin’s recent performance. 
Drawing attention to the previous Sunday report, the analyst predicted a sideways movement for Bitcoin in the longer term. However, the largest cryptocurrency asset is currently moving in the indicated sideways region, as he points out.

The expert claims that some people are unable to see the wider picture playing out within the sideways movement. Due to this, they fail to understand that price fluctuations in the 20% range are normal and even beneficial for moves in big market caps. 
Thus, Bitcoin is preparing for its next big move, which will push prices over $80,000 and hit $100,000 at high speed. He noted that this bullish sideways movement is referred to as an accumulation area in trading terminology. 
BTC gearing to enter the Super Cycle zone | Doctor Profit on X
During this stage, a convergence of profit-taking, incoming investment, and undecided money, practically leads to a mid-term consolidation. Consequently, he is bullish about the sideways trend and anticipates a looming upward surge. 
Furthermore, Doctor Profit underscored the significance of Bitcoin’s recent breakout above its previous all-time high (ATH) of $69,000, and the necessity of exercising patience as the coin consolidates close to its peak level.
He stated:
What many fail to understand is that Bitcoin just broke through its all-time high (ATH) in the last few weeks and is now slowly building support near the ATH region. People don’t realize that this is a process that takes weeks.
Doctor Profit asserts that before continuing to rise and entering the super cycle, the market would spend weeks in the area of the Golden Bull. “After confirmation at $72,500, it won’t be long until BTC rises beyond $70,000 and enters the super cycle,” he added.
Recent Retest Pattern Aligns With Past Trends
Doctor Profit seems to be pleased with Bitcoin retesting its previous ATH level in the $60,000 range. He highlights the potential of Bitcoin and the slow transformation of the $60,000 resistance level into a solid support point, paving the way for the upcoming super cycle similar to other ATH breakouts.

“Bitcoin now appears mature enough to withstand this pressure at $60,000 and maintain its above-average price without any difficulty,” he stated. Despite ongoing corrections, the analyst has urged investors to be confident, citing the Bitcoin Halving as a catalyst for an impending upward surge.

Trump Meme Coins Fall as Former President Gets Fraud Bond Reduced to $175M - Decrypt

Former U.S. president Donald Trump's $454 million bond just got reduced to $175 million in an appeal. But the most prominent of the many meme coins using his likeness appeal to be cooling off following the news.As markets opened in New York, an Ethereum-based MAGA meme coin—one of many to use the TRUMP ticker—started to lose steam. Early Monday morning, it traded as low as $4.95 and saw a 5.5% drop in an hour. But at the time of writing, it's trading for $5.09 and is down 11% after setting a 24-hour high of $5.74 overnight according to CoinGecko data.On Solana, where the Doland Tremp (TREMP) meme coin picked up a ton of attention at the start of the month, the token is up a huge 84% over the course of the past 24 hours—but most of those gains came ahead of the court decision. It's actually down 12% over the past six hours.TREMP is the largest Solana meme coin inspired by the former president, but scores of others (like Danold Tromp, or DANOLD) are also flooding the market. The standard meme coin warning applies: These are extremely volatile assets that soar and crash in the blink of an eye. Investors should proceed with caution. Both of the meme coins have already seen dizzying gains and big losses earlier this month.Jeo Boden (BODEN), another Solana meme coin themed on a misspelling of President Joe Biden's last name, has gained 30% in the past day and is currently sitting at a $224 million market cap.Trump now has an extra 10 days to pay his bond. If Trump can't pay his bond—which is the result of a fraud judgement against him—then he risks having his assets seized by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Although much of the attention has been on his properties, like the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, his other assets include approximately $5.7 million sitting in a crypto wallet that's been linked to him by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence.The wallet currently contains $3 million worth of the aforementioned TRUMP meme coin. He also holds $1.3 million each of Ethereum (ETH) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH). In December, Trump sold millions worth of ETH after his third NFT collection hit the skids.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

                        CommEx, the exchange that took over Binance’s operations in Russia in September 2023, has announced it is closing down and has stopped accepting deposits.While the exchange has refrained from stating the motives behind this decision, it has outlined that it will wind down all operations before May 10, 2024.CommEx Announces Suspension of Trading OperationsThe announcement was posted on CommEx’s official Telegram group on March 25, informing users of the gradual suspension of operations. They urged users to withdraw their assets to third-party wallets promptly.“With regret, after a thorough analysis of the current situation and a review of strategic plans, we are forced to announce the decision to suspend the work of the trading platform,” said CommExAccording to the provided timeline, CommEX will cease new user registrations and Asset Transfer from Binance on March 25 and discontinue fiat & cryptocurrency deposit services from April 2. CommEx will halt futures trading on March 28, and all existing peer-to-peer orders and listings will be automatically closed on April 5.By April 23, the spot trading platform will be completely shut down, with the website set to be suspended by May 10.Additionally, CommEX stated in the announcement that asset management fees will be imposed for users who still have asset balances on the platform after May 10, 2024. The exchange will charge the account asset management cost 1% of the snapshot assets per day starting May 10, 2024.CommEX also warned users that it would never contact anyone for withdrawals via phone calls, text messages, or emails; any attempt of such should be flagged as a fraudulent practice. It also warns users not to give their personal account information or verification codes to strangers or third parties.Binance Sells Russian Business Citing Regulatory Challenges
Last year, Crypto exchange Binance sold the entirety of its Russian business to CommEX as key executives stepped down from the Russian arm of the exchange in September 2023. This all happened when Binance faced major regulatory challenges related to complying with Western sanctions against Russia. However, as of August 2023, despite regulatory pressure, Binance was still promoting its services for Russian users.Binance later sold its Russian business to CommEx, but details about the deal, including information about CommEx’s founders and executives, remain undisclosed. The exchange officially launched the day before the news was announced. Many crypto observers have speculated that CommEX was just a new name for Binance, allowing the exchange to continue operations in Russia without issues with Western sanctions against the country. Skeptics have found significant evidence for such claims, including CommEX hiring prominent former Russia-related executives from Binance.However, Binance continued to deny the allegations of possible ties between the platform and CommEX. “With this sale, Binance fully exits Russia. We have no plans to get back,” a spokesperson for Binance said.At the time, Binance said there would be no ongoing revenue split from the sale, and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, denied that he owned the exchange. Also, the similarities between Binance and CommEx websites led some to dub CommEx the “Russian version” of Binance US. At the time of the sale, Russia was a significant market for Binance, accounting for 6.9% of total visits to Binance.com.

Crypto Market Records First Outflow in 7 Weeks Worth $942M



Despite the market sentiment, altcoins sparked investor interest, resulting in a net inflow of $16 million.

Crypto investment products witnessed record weekly outflows totaling $942 million, the first outflow after a record 7-week run of inflows totaling $12.3 billion.
Bitcoin ETFs See Reduced Inflows
A recent report from CoinShares revealed that while trading volumes in Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) were high at $28 billion for the week, they were only two-thirds of those in the previous week. The recent price correction reduced total Assets Under Management (AUM) by $10 billion but remained above prior cycle highs at $88 billion.




James Butterfill, a Researcher at CoinShares noted that investors’ reluctance following the recent price correction resulted in smaller inflows into US Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These inflows totaled $1.1 billion, which somewhat offset the large outflows of $2 billion from Grayscale Investments last week.
With $904 million in outflows, Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, took the brunt of the withdrawals. Minor withdrawals totaling $3.7 million were also observed for short-Bitcoin products. This development comes only shortly after Bitcoin retraced more than 10% from its all-time high. Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) were also hit hard, with withdrawals of $3.7 million, $5.6 million, and $34 million, respectively.
Despite the market sentiment, altcoins sparked investor interest, resulting in a net inflow of $16 million. Polkadot (DOT) received the most inflows, totaling $5 million, followed by Avalanche (AVAX) at $2.9 million and Litecoin (LTC) at $2 million.
The negative sentiment was not limited to the US market, as outflows occurred in Sweden ($37 million), Switzerland ($25 million), Hong Kong ($35 million), and Germany ($4 million). However, Brazil and Canada defied the trend, with inflows of $9 million and $8.4 million, respectively.
Bitcoin Price Movements
As of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is experiencing mild recoveries, underscoring the worst of the selloffs might be over. However, CoinGlass data revealed a substantial liquidation event. Leveraged futures positions worth more than $100 million were forced to close in the last 24 hours, with approximately $55 million coming from short bets on Bitcoin.
Nonetheless, renowned author Robert Kiyosaki has reiterated his bullish outlook for Bitcoin’s future. Kiyosaki recently stated in an earlier Coinspeaker report that he planned to purchase an extra 10 Bitcoin units before the upcoming halving event, which is anticipated to take place in April. His conviction that this event could affect the asset’s scarcity and, thus, its value appears to be the driving force behind his decision to increase his Bitcoin holdings.
He advised those who couldn’t afford a whole Bitcoin to think about fractional ownership by buying Satoshis or making an investment in Bitcoin ETFs. His suggestion shows that he is aware of potential accessibility issues for some investors and that he wants to provide everyone with the chance to invest in digital assets.
At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is changing hands for $67,565.00, up by 3.33% in 24 hours, a figure that shows steady recovery from the lows recorded over the weekend.

Why the Media Is Seemingly Less Interested in Bitcoin Than Ever

The pandemic rally, in 2021, when crypto mania truly set in, inextricably tied up with the retail investor revolution, WallStreetBets and GameStop, stonks, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and memes. Investing became a public social activity for the very-online. Then another crash. And now the current rally, in which bitcoin has soared above $72,000, driven by the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) and institutional adoption from big suits like BlackRock and Fidelity. Of course, with crypto it’s never just one thing driving it, and the current rally is not just about the ETF, but I suspect it will be most easily remembered and characterized that way.

Samson Mow Makes Bold Bitcoin ETF Prediction for This Week As BTC Tops $70,000

Samson Mow, Jan3 chief executive and a vocal believer that Bitcoin will ultimately reach the $1 million level, has made a bullish prediction regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs for this week.Mow's bullish ETF predictionExchange-traded funds based on the spot Bitcoin price were approved by the SEC regulator in the middle of January after many months of anticipation by the companies that launched those funds and the whole global Bitcoin community.Since the trading began, ETFs started scooping up monstrous amounts of Bitcoin from the market. On peak days, these purchases went as high as more than 10,000 BTC. The largest part of this Bitcoin was consumed by the ETF leader IBIT launched by BlackRock. Currently, this fund holds more than $15 billion in the BTC equivalent and has surpassed such centralized cryptocurrency exchanges as Kraken and OKX.Over the past few days, though, the inflows into these ETFs suffered stark outflows of more than $850 million worth of Bitcoin. Last week, Samson Mow issued a statement, sharing his expectation that very soon these outflows will likely become inflows again.Today, Mow tweeted that he has a hunch that this week is going to be “a net inflow week,” adding a Bitcoin hashtag. Some commentators interpreted this tweet as related to Bitcoin ETFs. In the meantime, the Bitcoin price has surpassed the $70,000 level, showing a 5.12% increase today and printing several consecutive green candles on the chart.Robert Kiyosaki buying 10 BTCProminent financial expert, investor and the author of the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” book on personal finances Robert Kiyosaki is known as a vocal Bitcoin proponent. Today, he tweeted that he intends to acquire 10 Bitcoins before April arrives.He plans to make this purchase before the Bitcoin halving expected in the second half of April. This event is going to make the world’s flagship cryptocurrency much more scarce than before, taking into account the current purchases that are being made by the ETFs.Kiyosaki believes that by September this year Bitcoin will reach an all-time high of $100,000. In his previous tweets, he declared that this was likely to happen in June and that by the end of 2024 Bitcoin would skyrocket as high as $300,000.

Do Kwon escapes extradition yet again, goes to migrant centre


In what is beginning to resemble a legal Schrödinger’s Cat, Do Kwon has once again had his extradition paused and is being held at an illegal migrant center.
Do was set to be extradited to South Korea and the US, and was scheduled to be shipped from Montenegro shortly. 
According to Montenegrin media, the extradition stoppage is due to legal wrangling between numerous legal departments within the government. Do’s lawyers have already had their appeals denied and he has had his travel documents confiscated so that he cannot leave Montenegro pending a decision on his extradition.
This weekend footage of Do was posted on X (formerly Twitter), where the cryptocurrency founder appeared thinner and in baggy clothes, led by a cadre of police officers after being interrogated.

Read more: Somebody extradite Do Kwon already
Do Kwon is both Extradited and Not-Extradited
Do, who was apprehended a year ago in Montenegro after trying to use a fake passport, has been out on bail in the Eastern European country as he awaits extradition to either the Republic of Korea or the United States. While it’s looking more likely that he’ll be returned to South Korea, the constant problems and legal disputes have kept any real outcome up in the air.
The founder of algorithmic stablecoin and Ponzi scheme Luna/Terra went on the run shortly after Interpol issued a red notice for him in 2022. He fled from Singapore and found his way into Montenegro from Serbia, clearly hoping to somehow outrun the authorities. Unfortunately, when he flashed falsified Costa Rican and Belgian passports to authorities he was taken into custody.
It’s unclear when or if Do will be extradited, but Protos will keep you updated.

Aave Closes In On Zero Token Incentives While Borrowing Surges - The Defiant

“We don’t need it anymore,” said Marc Zeller, founder of the Aave Chan Initiative. Aave is about to achieve the Holy Grail of tokenomics as the token incentives on the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending platform are about to drop to zero while activity continues to climb.According to TokenTerminal, monthly token incentives – additional yield in AAVE tokens that originate from the Aave Reserve, used primarily to incentivize specific actions – have been downtrending since late 2021. AAVE token incentives are down 37% from their peak in Dec. 2023 of $335,000 to $214,000 in March 2024.Incentives spiked 137% in the past 30 days, however, reaching $225,000.Active loans on the platform, on the other hand, are on a consistent uptrend, notching a 31% increase over the past 30 days, reaching $5.7 billion, the highest since June 2022.Aave dominates the lending sector in terms of loans outstanding by a wide margin.According to DeFiLlama, Compound Finance lands in second place, with $971 million borrowed; Morpho claims third with $959 million; Spark ranks fourth, with $588 million; and Venus rounds out the top 5 with $568 million in outstanding loans.AAVE monthly incentives and active loans“We don’t need [token incentives] anymore,” said Marc Zeller, founder of the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI). “After four years, people realized it’s better to use Aave and not lose money in a hack,” he told The Defiant.Aave initially launched its native token, LEND, in Nov. 2017, but executed its transition to AAVE in Oct. 2020. To limit the amount of new AAVE entering the system, the system’s total supply is capped at 16 million, with the token trading for $129 after an 8% jump today.Alternative Token StructuresToken incentives for other top DeFi protocols differ slightly from Aave’s.DeFi AlphaPremium ContentLooking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community.DeFi Daily | WeekdaysDeFi Alpha Letter | WeeklyDefiant Podcast Transcript | WeeklyInbox Dump | SaturdayWeekly Recap | SundayStart for freeCompound Finance distributes a portion of its protocol fees to COMP token holders in the form of COMP tokens, but unlike Aave doesn’t have a separate pool for additional incentives.Morpho offers a triple incentive structure, rewarding users for trading, liquidity mining, and boosting rewards (users need to lock in their MORPHO tokens to boost earnings through other rewards systems in the protocol).What Comes NextThe move now is to implement a profit share switch, said Zeller. He explained that this is different from a fee switch “because Aave has been making money since day one.” Instead, ACI will propose to distribute the platform’s net profit, with a DAO-centric rewards system.Net revenue for the platform, according to DefiLlama, sits at $129 million, with Aave V3 holding $8.8 billion in total value locked. That ranks it in top place in the lending sector, ahead of JustLend with $7.6 billion, which briefly overtook Aave in Nov. 2023.Stani Kulechov, Aave’s creator, touted the aforementioned numbers on X, posting that, “The reason is simple: Aave built the best product for users,” adding that they “didn’t build for the narrative or for the VCs.”Next up for Aave is the ongoing Merits program, which went live on March 19 and aims to airdrop $5 million to wETH borrowers over the next 90 days.Proposed by Zeller on Feb. 16, Merits is a new Aave-Alignment User Reward System designed to prioritize the Aave DAO. It targets its competitors such as Morpho – which Zeller called “a leech on top of Aave” – thanks to its focus on the DAO.

LayerZero CEO Accuses Three Arrows Capital Co-Founder of Deceptive Loan Requests



                    


In a startling revelation, Bryan Pellegrino, the co-founder and CEO of LayerZero, has publicly accused Kyle Davies, co-founder of the now-collapsed Three Arrows Capital (3AC), of attempting to sway his company into transferring its entire treasury to 3AC shortly before its liquidation. 



Pellegrino made these claims in a response to Davies’ comments on a podcast, via an X post. 




According to Pellegrino, Davies sought to secure LayerZero’s treasury by “promising better rates than other borrowers as a last-gasp effort,” showcasing a desperate move ahead of 3AC’s financial turmoil.



The accusations surfaced after Davies, on the Unchained YouTube interview podcast, refrained from issuing an apology to investors for 3AC’s downfall, sparking controversy. 



Pellegrino’s assertions shed light on 3AC’s strategy of soliciting loans from various entities despite its impending insolvency, a tactic Pellegrino criticized for exploiting personal and professional relationships, including those with prominent figures like BitMex co-founder Arthur Hayes.

The crypto community and observers have rallied behind Pellegrino, condemning Davies’ conduct and the broader implications of 3AC’s practices, which relied on deceitful loan acquisition. 



The backlash also saw X users, including @basedkarbon, criticizing Davies’ lack of tact in handling the situation.



Three Arrows Capital, founded by Davies and Su Zhu in 2012, managed an impressive $10 billion in assets by 2021. 



However, the firm’s fortunes plummeted to $3 billion by April 2022, primarily due to the catastrophic fallout from the TerraUSD stablecoin crash, triggering a widespread crypto market crash.



The firm’s decline culminated in a Chapter 15 bankruptcy filing on July 1, 2022, as it sought to shield its assets from creditors amidst a dire financial crisis. 



The collapse of 3AC had a profound impact, ensnaring numerous investors and companies in its wake. The bankruptcy proceedings revealed debts amounting to $3.5 billion owed to 27 entities, including a staggering $2.3 billion to Genesis Global Trading. 



The fallout also severely affected Blockchain.com and Voyager Digital, with the latter filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after being unable to recover approximately $670 million loaned to 3AC.

Bitcoin breaks US$70,000 amidst market optimism


Bitcoin’s value surged past US$70,000 on Monday to reach its highest point since March 16, according to CoinGecko data.
The price spike comes in the face of a record $942 million withdrawal from digital asset investment products in the week prior, breaking a seven-week streak of capital inflows. 
Investment firm Bernstein has responded to the bullish trend by raising its Bitcoin year-end forecast to US$90,000, signaling confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future and associated mining stocks.
Monday’s market movement followed the Swiss National Bank’s unexpected rate cut announcement last week and the U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers’ discussions on rate reductions. 



Meanwhile, BlackRock’s introduction of the BlackRock Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), a tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, has been widely perceived as a positive development for the crypto industry.
Bitcoin is now less than a month away from its expected halving date next month when the network’s rewards will be cut from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.
The halving slows down the inflowing supply of Bitcoin, which some believe will contribute to its scarcity.
Some market observers maintain a high probability of Bitcoin reaching the US$100,000 milestone within the year. U.K. bank Standard Chartered last year set a US$120,000 target for the digital asset.

Crypto Shockwave: Nearly $1 Billion Vanishes From Global Funds In Historic Outflow


								Last week, the crypto investment landscape witnessed a significant exodus of capital from global crypto funds. A recent report from CoinShares highlighted nearly $1 billion net outflow from these funds, marking a historic departure from a 7-week inflow streak that had cumulatively amassed $12.3 billion.
A Closer Look At The Outflows
The magnitude of these outflows at roughly $942 million is particularly notable, almost doubling the previous record of $500 million witnessed towards the end of January.

Major players in the asset management space, including BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares, felt the brunt of this wave of withdrawals, according to CoinShares.
The timing of these outflows coincided with a notable correction in the prices of underlying cryptocurrencies, which erased $10 billion from the fund’s assets under management (AUM). However, the combined AUM of $88 billion still hovers above prior cycle highs.
Notably, these outflows have pronounced impacted trading volumes and asset valuations within the crypto investment product sector. Last week’s trading volume plummeted by a third to $28 billion amidst a price correction that significantly diminished the AUM of these funds.
The US market, particularly new spot Bitcoin ETFs, witnessed over $1 billion in inflows, which were insufficient to offset the nearly $2 billion outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC fund conversion.
According to CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill, the “recent price correction” resulted in “hesitancy from investors, leading to much lower inflows into new ETF issuers in the US, which saw US$1.1bn inflows, partially offsetting incumbent Grayscale’s significant US$2bn outflows last week.”
Global Crypto Sentiment And Market Responses
Meanwhile, last week’s sentiment was not solely concentrated on US-based funds or Bitcoin. Investment products in Sweden, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Germany also experienced outflows, though Brazil and Canada-based funds recorded inflows, showcasing a mixed global investor sentiment.

Additionally, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano-based products faced outflows, underscoring the broad impact of the market’s downturn. In contrast, other altcoin funds like Polkadot, Avalanche, and Litecoin saw net inflows, indicating selective investor interest in the altcoin sector.

This period of market recalibration has also sparked a dialogue among industry leaders about the role and accessibility of Bitcoin ETFs in fostering broader market integration.
Bivu Das of Kraken UK and Daniel Seifert of Coinbase UK have both advocated for the UK market’s access to Bitcoin ETFs, citing the importance of such investment products in establishing a comprehensive crypto ecosystem.

As reported, by offering indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, these instruments propose a regulated and possibly more accessible avenue for investors, contributing to the diversification and maturity of the investment landscape in the digital currency market.

Base meme coins send TVL soaring
In the past few weeks, the spotlight has been on Solana-based meme coins. The likes of dogwifhat, Bonk Book of Meme, Slerf and Myro have dominated the market with massive gains.
But Base meme coins have seen a decent spike in the past 24 hours, with data showing their market cap has increased more than 400% in 24 hours to nearly $1 billion.
Buying frenzy has hit tokens such as Toshi (TOSHI), Degen (DEGEN) and Mochi (MOCHI), which have all soared more than 30% in the past day.
Nansen highlighted the growth in TVL, noting a surge could see it hit $1 billion this week.

RWA tokens on the rise
Real world assets (RWAs) have also contributed to Base’s emerging as a force in the market. 
With the recent Dencun upgrade in place, low fees sees interaction with dApps on the rise. Users and investors are also taking key dips into the RWA market, eyeing gems.
On-chain data shows a notable impact on Base TVL from RWA projects, including a 28% spike in TVL for Tangible RWA and nearly 6% for Cygnus Finance.
Overall rise in RWA tokens saw the sector’s market cap soar more than 25% to above $7 billion. Top tokens in this market include Ondo Finance, Polymesh, Pendle and TokenFi.
Apart from meme coins and RWA, two other narratives likely to lead the bull cycle are artificial intelligence (AI) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks DePINs).

How to Improve Transparency and Public Trust in Crypto Markets

These legislative efforts are novel in using blockchain technology’s noteworthy public transparency and auditability functionality. Blockchains track debits and credits to accounts on a ledger, just like an ordinary accounting system, but in a real-time, transparent, and immutable fashion. The existence of any asset that resides on a public blockchain, whether a tokenized security or a digital commodity, is verifiable by customers and regulators. This is not the case for off-chain transactions, which don’t commit digital asset transactions to the appropriate blockchain. Instead, records of off-chain transactions are stored in the trading platform’s internal systems and not recorded on the blockchain. As a result, customers rely on the internal recordkeeping of unregistered trading platforms to track their record of ownership.

XRP is moving again: $1 price predictions to finally come true? - AMBCrypto



Holders preferred to keep their tokens despite the unimpressive price action.
Technical analysis suggested that the support at $0.61 might prevent XRP from falling.

AMBCrypto’s assessment of the Ripple [XRP] network showed that the 90-day dormant circulation has hit the lowest point since this year started.
On the 12th of March, dormant circulation stood at 84.71 million.
However, press time data showed that this metric was 5.66 million. Dormant circulation gauges the number of “old age” tokens that are moving.
Sometimes, when these tokens are transferred, the participants sell them. Other times, they are sent to other wallets for improved security.

Oldies and newbies ignore exchanges
For XRP, the decline in the metric might be a good development for the price. At press time, XRP’s price was $0.62.
However, this was a massive fall from the value on the aforementioned date, when dormant circulation was high.
If we were to go by the events of the said date, then XRP’s price might not climb from this point. But that is not always the case. With decreasing dormancy, comes decreasing selling pressure.
As such, the price of the token might not nosedive in the short term. However, it is also necessary to analyze the price action from other angles.
That is one of the reasons AMBCrypto checked what was happening with the token on exchanges.
As of this writing, XRP’s exchange inflow was 549,000. The inflow is the number of tokens that have left non-exchange wallets to exchange addresses.
Therefore, it is likely that a chunk of these tokens were exchanged for other tokens or stablecoins.
On the other hand, the exchange outflow was higher at 2.42 million, indicating that more tokens were sent for self-custody. The difference in these metrics point to a possible upswing instead of a decline.

XRP bulls want to revisit $0.70
From a bullish point of view, the price of the Ripple native token might extend toward $0.70. However, traders need to be careful as it does not take long for sentiment to change.
If the sentiment changes, XRP’s price might feel the heat, and this could invalidate the forecast above. In addition, the technical perspective gave an idea of the token’s short-term prediction.
At press time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the neutral point. This indicated that bulls were above bears in determining the price action.
The 4-hour XRP/USD chart also revealed that bulls had formed support around $0.61.

How much are 1,10,100 XRPs worth today?

However, a resistance lay ahead at $0.64, suggesting that there could be a tussle. If the price breaks through this level, then XRP might climb toward $0.68. On the other hand, rejection might cause a decline in value.
Source: TradingView
Furthermore, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) suggested that a significant decrease was unlikely. At press time, the CCI was above zero, indicating that XRP’s price action might continue to target the upside.

                        The European Commission began an extensive investigation targeted at Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta over non-compliance practices under the new Digital Markets Act (DMA) on March 25.The commission inquiry represents the EU’s first major attempt to curb anti-competitive practices by big tech companies labeled as “gatekeepers” by the commission.EU Targets Apple, Google, Meta Practices
According to the announcement, the European Commission has opened five separate investigations to scrutinize the business practices of Apple, Google, and Meta, which may violate the DMA rules on fair competition.The investigation will examine Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and Apple’s restrictive “anti-steering” policies. Under these rules, tech firms are forbidden from blocking businesses from providing cheaper purchase alternatives outside their app stores.“Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple’s rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta’s ‘pay or consent model,” the commission explained.Meanwhile, an investigation has commenced into Apple’s user preference. This probe would confirm if Apple has fully allowed its users to uninstall its default apps and change default settings for services like web browsers on iOS devices.Alphabet is also facing another non-compliance scrutiny over the claim that it abused dominance in its search engine recommendations for users.The inquiry is to ensure Google does not only recommend its specialized Google Shopping data to users over other comparable search results from competitors.The final investigation would see the EU probe Meta’s “pay or consent” model for Facebook and Instagram. The policy requires users to either purchase a subscription for an ad-free experience or consent to data tracking on the free version.Rigorous Enforcement of the Digital Markets Act (DMA)
The DMA was launched in November 2022 and fully took effect on March 7, 2024. It was created to allow fair competition in digital markets, which big tech companies have long dominated.EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager has disclosed that, despite the market law launch in 2022, tech firms “seem to be at odds with the DMA’s intent.”She, however, warned that any company found culpable for violating the tech law would incur a potential fine of up to 10% of the company’s global revenue and 20% for repeated offenses.Meanwhile, Apple seems to be the first company to be fined for its anti-steering provisions by the EU.The EU fined the iPhone maker $1.95 billion earlier this month for restricting app developers from suggesting cheaper music subscription services to iOS users.The company was also accused of offering “higher fees” and a less secure and unresponsive user experience. This even came earlier before the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against Apple on unfair rules targeting crypto apps.On the other hand, Alphabet has insisted on operating in conformity with the digital regulations. This follows Alphabet Director of Competition Oliver Bethell’s statement that the tech company has made “significant changes” to its operations in Europe.The EU investigation is expected to be completed within 12 months, which would give an insight into whether the tech giants have opened up the digital market for fair competition or made changes that best suit their operations.

Solana's Froganas, Howdy Hats, lead NFT sales


Solana-based Froganas non-fungible tokens collection experienced a 111.88% increase in sales to US$1.16 million, coupled with a doubling of transactions to lead all NFT collections on Monday.
Howdy Hats also saw a substantial rise of 19.12% in sales and an 184.55% increase in transactions, as the two Solana-based collections topped the day’s sales charts, according to CryptoSlam.
Despite the market-leading performances from Solana’s NFTs, the blockchain itself trailed Ethereum and Bitcoin in blockchain NFT sales.
On the Ethereum platform, Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) recorded a 24.48% increase in sales, reaching US$1.02 million, with a slight 5.56% uptick in transactions. 



BAYC maintains its position as the second-highest in all-time sales with US$3.1 billion.
BAYC and the two Solana projects were the only three projects to have at least US$1 million in sales on Monday.
DMarket on Mythos Chain recorded just under US$1 million in sales after an 11% decline as the day’s fourth-best performing collection.
Similarly, Bitcoin’s NodeMonkes and JIGO BRC-20 NFTs experienced downturns in both sales and transactions.



On the Bitcoin network, uncategorized BRC-20 and Ordinals assets posted US$1.9 million and US$2.6 million respectively.
Each asset class recorded sales exceeding the entire Polygon network’s US$1.01 million, ranking it fourth in the day’s blockchain rankings.

Bitcoin pro traders were unmoved by BTC’s sell-off, data points to new price highs

The newly launched spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their first week of net outflows from March 18 to March 22. A total of $888 million was withdrawn from the spot ETFs, marking a significant shift from the previous week's $2.57 billion inflow. This has led to speculation about the sustainability of Bitcoin's rally to $70,000 on March 25.Bitcoin can rally in the absence of spot BTC ETF inflowsSome market participants had argued that institutional inflows were a key driver behind Bitcoin's all-time high of $73,755 on March 14, casting doubt on the 9% gains seen between March 23 and March 25. Further raising concerns is the fact that this rally occurred while the S&P 500 index was unable to maintain its all-time high of 5,260 set on March 21.Source: venturefoundΞrAnalyst venturefoundΞr, on March 20, suggested that Bitcoin was facing a reality check after FOMO from ETF investors drove it to a new high before the halving, effectively "trapping" those who bought at the peak. While a 15% gain from March 20 to March 25 shouldn't dismiss bearish concerns outright, Bitcoin's market behavior suggests that its bullish momentum isn't solely reliant on spot ETF inflows.Some traders believe that the recent approval of a $1.2 trillion spending package by the United States on March 23 serves as a key positive catalyst for Bitcoin. This is particularly true in light of the U.S. Federal Reserve's forecast model predicting three interest rate cuts throughout 2024. With the U.S. deficit expected to reach $1.6 trillion in 2024, the pressure on government debt repayment intensifies as interest rates hover above 5.25%.The concurrent rise to all-time highs of scarce assets like gold, Bitcoin, real estate, and the stock market suggests a weakening U.S. dollar. Ultimately, the performance of the North American currency against the euro and the British pound is less relevant as investors seek refuge from fiat currency devaluation.Concluding that Bitcoin's price will continue its upward trajectory due to monetary expansion might seem premature. However, bears arguing that the U.S. fiscal trajectory will lead to a recession—which could negatively affect risk-on assets—miss a crucial point: Bitcoin's price has already surged 64% year-to-date in 2024, leaving those waiting for a dip behind.Bitcoin derivatives held firm during the dip below $62,000To gauge whether professional traders have become more pessimistic about Bitcoin following the disappointing spot ETF inflow data, one should examine the BTC monthly futures contracts. In neutral markets, these contracts typically command a premium of 5% to 10%, accounting for their longer settlement period.Bitcoin 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chData indicates that the annualized BTC futures premium was largely unaffected by the net spot ETF outflows. Currently, an 18% level is viewed as optimistic, suggesting buyers are willing to pay a premium to open leveraged long positions.Related: Bitcoin ETFs could soften BTC price retracement before the halvingExamining the Bitcoin options market is crucial to determine if the March rally to $70,000 has increased the demand for strategies to hedge against potential price corrections. Typically, if traders expect a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will exceed 7%, whereas periods of enthusiasm often show a skew below 7%.Bitcoin 2-month options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas.chSince March 13, the BTC options 25% delta skew has remained in a neutral range, indicating a balanced demand for bullish and bearish options strategies. Notably, there were no signs of panic as Bitcoin tested the $62,000 support on March 20.The indicators from Bitcoin derivatives markets suggest a strong price resilience despite the recent spot ETF outflows, supporting the likelihood that the $70,000 support level is gaining strength.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

SEC alleges multi-billion dollar crypto fraud by Terraform Labs and Co-Founder

The civil trial against Terraform Labs commenced in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launching scathing allegations against the blockchain firm. In the opening statements, SEC attorney Devon Staren characterized Terra as a deceptive enterprise, likening it to a “house of cards” that ultimately collapsed, leaving investors with substantial losses.SEC unveils multi-billion dollar schemeIn a bold move, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has brought to light a staggering fraud allegedly orchestrated by Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon. The SEC’s lawsuit, filed with significant gravity, accuses the firm and Kwon of engaging in a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud. According to the SEC’s assertions, investors bore the brunt of this fraudulent scheme, suffering substantial financial losses due to Terra and Kwon’s misleading representations. At the heart of the allegations lies Terra’s stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), which is purported to have depegged from the U.S. dollar, triggering instability in the market and resulting in detrimental outcomes for investors.The repercussions of Terra’s purported actions reverberated throughout the cryptocurrency market, with several companies grappling with downturns and, in some cases, facing bankruptcy. This exposé by the SEC marks a significant turning point in the ongoing battle against cryptocurrency fraud, underscoring the need for heightened vigilance and regulatory oversight.Kwon’s Absence and Legal ChallengesWhile the trial unfolded in New York, co-founder Do Kwon remained in Montenegro, where he had been arrested for using falsified travel documents. Although reportedly released pending extradition, Kwon’s presence at the trial remained uncertain. Despite legal challenges and delays, the SEC it persisted in pursuing justice against Terra and its key figures.The civil trial, initially slated for January, was postponed to March to accommodate potential in-person defense participation by Kwon. Judge Jed Rakoff ruled in favor of the SEC regarding Terra’s dealings with unregistered securities. However, the judgment favored Kwon and the platform concerning offering and selling security-based swaps. Terraform Labs’ legal battle is among many expected cases in the crypto space.Cryptocurrency titans await verdicts amid Terra’s trial.While the spotlight shines on Terra’s legal battle, the cryptocurrency community awaits the impending sentences of industry heavyweights. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried faces the prospect of sentencing, having been convicted on seven felony charges. Similarly, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, having pleaded guilty to a felony charge, anticipates his legal fate. As these prominent figures navigate their legal challenges, their cases underscore the heightened scrutiny and accountability within the cryptocurrency industry.The SEC’s civil trial against Terraform Labs marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing scrutiny of cryptocurrency firms. With allegations of fraud and market manipulation, the outcome of this trial could significantly impact regulatory measures within the industry. The cryptocurrency community watches closely as legal proceedings unfold, recognizing the broader implications for investor protection and market integrity.

SEC will reportedly seek $2B in case against Ripple, CEO says - Blockworks


The Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $2 billion from Ripple Labs in fines and penalties, Ripple’s chief legal officer said on Monday.
Stuart Alderoty, in a post on X, said that the company will respond to the SEC’s proposal next month. 
“Our response will be filed next month, but as we all have seen time and again, this is a regulator that trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead. They stayed true to form here,” he wrote.
The SEC, Alderoty continued, is “bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple — and the industry at large.”
Read more: Ripple ordered to turn over financial statements by judge
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, on X, said that the $2 billion sought by the SEC is unprecedented because the case “involved no allegations (let alone findings) of fraud and recklessness.” 
“We will continue to expose the SEC for what they are when we respond to this,” he added. 
Garlinghouse accused the SEC of acting “outside the law,” and cited DEBT Box. The agency was dealt a blow last week after the judge overseeing the case sanctioned the regulatory agency. 

Judge Robert Shelby, the Utah judge overseeing the DEBT Box case, accused the SEC of “bad faith conduct” and abusing its power.

A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment on the filing, which isn’t yet public. The court documents will not be publicly available until Tuesday, according to Alderoty and Garlinghouse. 
The SEC and Ripple continue to engage in a multi-year legal battle. In July of last year, Judge Analisa Torres issued a summary judgment. The judgment determined that while the programmatic sales of Ripple’s XRP token did not qualify as unregistered securities transactions, the institutional sales could be categorized as such.
The ruling was a blow to the SEC’s argument which claimed that Ripple knowingly violated securities laws.
Last year, the SEC said it would not be pursuing a trial against Garlinghouse and Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen.

                        Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) criticized North Korea’s crypto usage and the rise of crypto “pig butchering” scams at a Thursday hearing of the Senate of Armed Services, claiming that cryptocurrency as a whole poses “a threat to our national security.”Senator Elizabeth Warren Puts Crypto On Blast, Calls Out North Korea
Questioning Admiral John C. Aquilino of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, Warren alleged that North Korea could pay for over 56 intercontinental ballistic missiles with the $1.7 billion worth of crypto the country stole in 2022.When asked by Warren if the number surprised him, Aquilino confessed it did not. North Korea has long been known for its crypto malware groups, with state-sponsored hacking collective the Lazarus Group and crypto mixer Sinbad sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in November 2023 for illicit activities.VIDEO“(Crypto) is helping rogue states,” said Warren. “It’s helping terrorists. It’s helping criminal organizations fund their operations on a scale like we have never seen before.”However, blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis’ 2024 Crypto Crime Report found that funds sent to crypto mixers from illicit addresses decreased by nearly half a billion dollars last year “likely due to law enforcement and regulatory efforts.”Senate Hearing Address Pig Butchering Scams And More
Warren’s criticism of crypto did not stop with North Korea, however. In her testimony Thursday, the senator claimed that “more than 40,000 people in the United States lost more than $3.5 billion dollars in pig butchering crypto scams that we know of” in last year alone.Common across southeast Asia, “pig butchering” involves perpetrators exploiting a victim’s trust in order to increase the amount of funds a given victim will send to them.“Now, pig butchering is just one scam,” Warren continued. “There are many more. A recent study found that these criminal gangs have stolen and laundered more than $75 billion dollars in crypto in just the last four years.”As Senator Elizabeth Warren criticizes crypto, she paints a vivid picture of the far-reaching consequences of crypto-related crimes.Warren Pushes DAAMLA Yet Again
Additionally, Senator Elizabeth Warren used the hearing to push her bipartisan bill known as the Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act (DAAMLA), which aims to close loopholes in anti-terrorist funding while subjecting key players in the digital asset industry to tougher regulations.“I’ve got a bipartisan bill, Republicans and Democrats, with 20 senators that would put a stop to it,” she said. “I think it is time to pass this bill.”The senator’s comments come amidst increased conversations about cryptocurrency regulation in light of last October’s terrorist attack in Israel that saw Hamas claim the lives of over 1200 Israelis.As Senator Elizabeth Warren criticizes crypto and pushes for stronger oversight, she faces a formidable challenger in her upcoming senate race: pro-crypto Republican candidate John Deaton.

The Fifth Richest Bitcoin Address Makes an Extremely Radical Move - Bitcoin Sistemi


The 5th richest Bitcoin address, known as 37X, transferred a staggering $6 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) to three new addresses.
The transaction took place in the early hours of Saturday, March 23. The 37X address moved almost its entire balance of 94,500 BTC, equivalent to $6.05 billion, leaving behind only a small amount of 1.4 BTC.


Interestingly, 94,500 BTC had been sitting idle at address 37X since it was acquired in 2019. The sudden movement of such a large amount has sparked speculation and curiosity among cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

The majority of the funds, $5.03 billion in BTC, were sent to bc1q8yj. The remaining balance was split between two other addresses, bc1q6m5 and bc1q592, which received $561.46 million and $488.40 million in BTC, respectively. Notably, the funds from bc1q592 have since been transferred further, adding another layer of mystery to the incident.





Following the transaction, the balance of address 37X dropped to only $92,596.52. At its peak, this address contained approximately $7 billion worth of BTC. The address may belong to an institutional investor or fund.

DEGEN Rallies On Increasing Adoption By Base Ecosystem Projects - The Defiant

Originally created as a memecoin airdropped to Farcaster users, the token has evolved to offer grants to early-stage projects and has been integrated into third-party apps.Activity on Base, the Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by Coinbase, shows no signs of slowing down, with weekly transactions hitting an all-time high of nearly 10 million.As investors look to position themselves for ‘Base season,’ DEGEN, a token that was initially airdropped to active users of the web3 social network Farcaster, is leading the charge with an astonishing 1,500% rally in the past 30 days to a market capitalization of $212 million.DEGEN PriceThe token now commands a fully diluted valuation north of $600 million and is increasingly being seen as a proxy bet on the Base ecosystem since the network doesn’t have a native token like most competing Layer 2s. While airdrop farmers are speculating that this may change in the future, Coinbase has been tight-lipped about any potential token plans.While it started out as a way to incentivize engagement on Farcaster, the project has since evolved, raising $1.5 million in funding last month and disbursing grants to incubate new projects.Drakula, a video-sharing app likened to a ‘web3 TikTok,’ received a grant of 20 million DEGEN tokens, currently worth over $300,000. In-app transactions are denominated in the token and the platform recently crossed $10 million in trading volume.Other projects that received grants include the prediction game Perl, which lets users bet using DEGEN, and the asset streaming protocol Superfluid, which developed a feature called ‘StreamYoink’ that lets users earn a steady stream of DEGEN until someone else takes it over.

Bitcoin Stalls As Evening Star Forms: Can BTC Bulls Still Shine?


								Tony “The Bull” Severino, the Head of Research at NewsBTC and a certified CME, has identified an “Evening Star” candlestick pattern on the monthly chart of the Bitcoin CME futures. This formation, which traditionally indicates a potential trend reversal, is forming at a critical point for Bitcoin. 
According to Severino, there could be tell-tale signs suggesting that the Bitcoin upswing could end as the momentum fades.
The Evening Star Formation: BTC Bull Run Over?
Though there are concerns that the pattern is forming on the Bitcoin CME futures chart, it is absent from the spot BTCUSD chart on ordinary charts from Binance or Coinbase, for example. Accordingly, the lack of uniformity on charts has also left Severino questioning the reliability of the signal. 

While the Evening Star pattern suggests a possible reversal, Severino cautions that Bitcoin could still reach higher highs in the coming months before peaking and reversing. However, the analyst stresses that predicting the exact timing of these events is a challenge. 
Based on candlestick analysis, Severino predicts that Bitcoin could peak within the next two quarters, possibly in mid- or late Q3 2024. 
Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView
When writing, Bitcoin is trading at around all-time highs. Following the cool-off of last week, the coin bounced back strongly over the weekend, wiping out some losses. The coin is technically within a bearish breakout formation, trading below the 20-day moving average, clear in the daily chart.
For the uptrend to continue and extend from the formation in the daily chart, BTC must push above $70,000. The validity of this uptrend will be solid if the leg up is with expanding trading volume. 

Severino also notes that the leg up will be valid and the Evening Star formation invalid if there is a strong close above $74,000 by the end of the month. Bitcoin prices peaked at around $73,800 in early March, buoyed by expanding demand, especially from spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Post More Outflows
Despite the potential for a continued rally, some fundamental factors pose challenges. Notably, outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), are rising. Rumors suggest that bankrupt crypto lender Genesis could be liquidating its GBTC holdings, adding further selling pressure to the market.

Large Shiba Inu Transactions Spark Fears Of A Massive Dumping Spree | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales look to be at it again following large transactions involving the meme token in the last 24 hours. As expected, these transactions have raised concerns that crypto investors might be looking to offload their tokens on the market. 
Shiba Inu Whales Move Billions Of SHIB
On-chain data shows that Shiba Inu whales moved billions of SHIB in different transactions. In one transaction, 77.2 billion SHIB tokens were moved to a Coinbase wallet. Meanwhile, over 205 billion SHIB tokens were moved across different wallets, some of which were transferred to a Robinhood wallet. 

The transfer of some of these tokens to crypto trading platforms, Coinbase and Robinhood, has raised suspicions that these Shiba Inu whales might be planning to sell off their holdings to make some profits. If so, it could massively impact the meme coin’s price due to the magnitude of such transactions. 
The SHIB community has seen several smart traders, including MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen, take profits over the past few weeks. This also contributed to the concern that these recent transactions might involve more whales who want to secure their profits. 
However, while the possibility of a sell-off exists, this could be just investors using the recent price dip as an opportunity to accumulate more of the meme coin. SHIB experienced a significant price surge, which saw it climb to become the tenth-largest crypto token by market cap. However, it has dropped out of the top 10 after its recent price decline.
The theory of SHIB accumulation looks plausible considering that more upward trend is expected for the crypto token. Therefore, investors will still be looking to position themselves ahead of this bull run, which could see the meme coin break its all-time high (ATH). 
Shiba Inu Still Has Bullish Momentum
SHIB may be ready for another upward movement if the wave of profit-taking by investors is now over. Crypto analyst Xanrox suggested that the meme coin could hit a new ATH by July, which means more parabolic price moves are to be expected if this price prediction is to be realized by then. 

SHIB’s fundamentals also suggest that it is only a matter of time before the upward trend continues. The Shiba Inu team continues to develop innovations that can help propel SHIB’s price. Meanwhile, although Shibarium’s daily transactions continue to decline, they are likely to pick up at some point, with a massive increase in SHIB burns expected once that happens. 
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002771, down almost 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Solana takes the lead in weekly stablecoin transfer volume

Solana has flipped Ethereum to become the number one blockchain in weekly stablecoin transfer volume. Data from blockchain analytics platform Artemis reveals that Solana’s weekly transfer volume for stablecoins reached $364.7 billion, overtaking the Ethereum network, which reported $152.99 billion. Other top chains like Tron and BNB Chain saw volumes of $101.57 billion and $22.75 billion, respectively​​​.Stablecoin weekly transfer volumes.

Bitcoin Halving Sparks Migration of US Mining Equipment to Low-Cost Power Countries: Report


																As the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event looms in late April, a migration of outdated mining equipment from the United States to regions offering cheaper electricity is underway.
This migration is driven by the need to maintain profitability due to reduced mining rewards and escalating operational costs.
US Bitcoin Miners Prepare for Halving
According to a Bloomberg report, approximately 6,000 aging Bitcoin mining machines are set to be decommissioned in the U.S., with plans to refurbish and resell overseas, particularly in areas with lower energy costs.
Wholesaler SunnySide Digital is at the forefront of this movement, operating a 35,000-square-foot facility in Colorado Springs. The company is refurbishing and reselling the aging equipment to overseas buyers keen to capitalize on mining in more cost-effective environments. They expect to receive and revamp several hundred thousand units around the Bitcoin halving time.
The impending halving will slash the mining reward from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin. As a result, miners are under pressure to maximize efficiency to remain profitable, with many turning to newer, more efficient machines, making older models less viable, particularly in high-cost regions like the United States.




“It’s a natural migration,” remarked Taras Kulyk, CEO of SunnySide Digital, noting that purchasers of outdated machines gravitate towards regions with the most affordable power. Kulyk, who has facilitated the sale of U.S. computers to miners in nations like Ethiopia, Tanzania, Paraguay, and Uruguay, emphasized that this trend is being expedited by the impending halving event.
Bitcoin Miners Flock Overseas
According to Ethan Vera, COO of Luxor Technology, an estimated 600,000 S19 series computers, comprising most of the current mining infrastructure, are relocating from the U.S. to regions primarily in Africa and South America.
Jaran Mellerud, CEO of Hashlabs Mining, points out that while older machines may no longer be profitable in the U.S. post-halving, they can still yield returns when hosted in regions with lower electricity expenses.
Despite risks associated with international relocation, such as transport costs and security concerns, miners like Nuo Xu are compelled to move their equipment to areas with cheaper electricity. Xu highlighted the significant difference in electricity costs between the U.S. and regions like Ethiopia, where costs are substantially lower.
Notably, not all U.S.-based equipment will leave the country. Publicly traded companies like Bit Digital opt to retain older equipment, leveraging them during periods of high Bitcoin prices to generate profits.
In preparation for the halving, miners globally are investing in new hardware. TheMinerMag, a crypto-mining researcher, reports that major public Bitcoin-mining companies have collectively ordered over $1 billion worth of machines since February 2023.

Ripple Faces $2B SEC Fine: Crypto Company Vows To Fight 'Misleading' Charges - Benzinga

Ripple Labs Inc. XRP/USD is at the center of a hefty legal battle, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposing a staggering $2 billion in fines and penalties against the blockchain company. This development was disclosed by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, who indicated that the official filings would be unveiled to the public on Tuesday, marking another chapter in the prolonged dispute between Ripple and the SEC.Alderoty expressed his discontent with the SEC’s approach on social media platform X, stating, “Our response will be filed next month, but as we all have seen time and again, this is a regulator that trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead.They stayed true to form here. Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple — and the industry at large.”Also Read: Bitcoin Rises Above $70K Again: Expert Points To Pattern Signaling Major BreakoutAdding to the company’s defense, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse lambasted the regulatory body for its alleged overreach and disregard for legal boundaries, particularly under the leadership of Gary Gensler. Garlinghouse highlighted several instances where courts have ruled against the SEC in crypto-related cases, emphasizing the criticism the agency has faced for its actions.“Gensler's SEC has repeatedly acted outside the law — not going unnoticed by Judges admonishing the agency for a ‘gross abuse of the power entrusted to it by Congress’ (DEBT Box case) and for acting without ‘faithful allegiance to the law’ (Ripple case). Let's not also forget Gensler's lack of attention to SBFraud,” Ripple’s CEO voiced on X.This ongoing legal saga underscores the growing tension between regulatory bodies and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency sector, with Ripple at the forefront of challenging the SEC’s current regulatory stance.This topic will be a focal point of discussion at Benzinga’s Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 19.Read Next: NFTs Get Divided: New Standard Promises Fractional OwnershipPhoto: Shutterstock

3 reasons why Bitcoin price is up today

Bitcoin (BTC) price rose back above $70,000 for the first time in a week, recovering from the streak of negative flows into spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF) last week.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows the BTC price climbed from an opening of $67,212 to an intra-day high of $70,306 on March 25.

                        Traders use platforms like DEXScreener to find the top crypto gainers today. Source: DEXScreener’s X AccountWhile blue-chip cryptos are pumping on Monday, with Bitcoin (BTC) pushing back above $70,000 and Ether (ETH) back in the $2,600s, traders looking for even faster gains continue to turn to the on-chain shitcoin markets in the hunt for top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin and Ether are both up over 7% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap. And while both could go a lot higher, some traders don’t want to wait 6-12 months for 2x gains.Many would prefer to gamble on newly launched shitcoins that can potentially double their money in a few hours, or 10x their money in a day.On-chain markets refer to the market for digital assets that have been issued directly on top of an existing blockchain.For example, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.These tokens can then be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEX), and also perhaps on centralized exchanges if they get big enough.They are often referred to as meme coin (or shitcoin) markets and virtually anyone can issue a token at any time.As a result, these on-chain markets are replete with scams and pump-and-dump schemes.But shitcoin markets are the only place to find tokens that can rally in the 50-100x region.Here are a few of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that traders will be monitoring, as per DEXScreener.Top Crypto to Buy TodayWrapped Trade AI (wTAI)A just-launched shitcoin called Wrapped Trade AI (wTAI), which appears to be attempting to piggyback off of the gaining tokenization narrative, is pumping since its launch on Monday.The token’s market cap was last around $7.4 million, with $330,000 in liquidity.wTAI doesn’t appear to be a scam. But it could be a pump and dump designed to siphon money from speculators. That’s because it has a 20% buy tax and a 20% sell tax.Traders need to make sure to always do their due diligence. That includes looking deeply into the legitimacy of a project before investing.EPICBOTS ($EPICBOTS)EPICBOTs, a supposed AI-infused Telegram bot protocol, is pumping hard on Monday. As per DEXScreener, it was last up 100% in 24 hours with a market cap of $3.4 million.The token has $350,000 in locked liquidity, reducing rug pull risk.But that doesn’t mean the token isn’t a scam. DEXScreener’s smart contract audit reveals four concerning aspects to the token’s contract.These include a modifiable tax, a whitelist function and a 5% buy and sell tax.Ishi ($ISHI)A recently launched Shiba Inu-themed meme coin called Ishi ($ISHI) is making a comeback on Monday.It was last up 30% in 24 hours, as per DEXScreener, its market cap having recovered to around $2.1 million.The token has $200,000 in locked liquidity, reducing rug pull risk. But the token has a modifiable tax, a blacklist and a whitelist.It could easily be a scam token still. So potential investors must never risk more than they can afford to lose, and should do their due diligence.Crypto Alternatives to Consider
Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy.An innocent-looking project could easily turn out to be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower.A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is getting involved in crypto presales.The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price.These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing.While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales—unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision—savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more.With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market.Here are 14 of the presale projects with the highest potential.See the 14 Cryptocurrencies

Philippines announce plans to block access to Binance exchange 1

The financial regulator of the Philippines has announced plans to block local user access to Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This decision stems from concerns regarding Binance’s unlicensed operations in the country. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the Philippines disclosed that it sought assistance from the National Telecommunication Commission (NTC) to implement the ban on accessing Binance’s website and online trading platform.Philippines set to block access to BinanceThis move, outlined in a document dated March 25, reflects the SEC’s apprehensions about the potential risks posed to Filipino investors due to Binance’s activities without the necessary licenses. Emilio B. Aquino, Chairperson of the SEC, emphasized the necessity of this action in a letter to the NTC. Aquino stated that the SEC had identified Binance’s platform and determined that continued access to its services could endanger the security of funds belonging to investing Filipinos.The SEC’s primary concern revolves around Binance’s offerings of investment products such as leveraged trading services and crypto savings accounts, which are being provided without complying with the requirements outlined in the Securities Regulation Code. The ban on accessing Binance’s services in the Philippines is scheduled to come into effect within three months.This grace period is intended to allow investors using Binance’s platform to exit their positions and transition to alternative platforms or investment strategies. Additionally, the SEC has reached out to major tech companies including Google and Meta (formerly Facebook) requesting them to block advertisements related to Binance from appearing on their platforms for Filipino users. This regulatory action in the Philippines adds to the ongoing challenges faced by Binance on a global scale.CZ faces legal settlements as US orders paymentsIn December 2023, a U.S. court issued a significant ruling against Binance, ordering the exchange to pay $2.7 billion in penalties. Former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao was also directed to pay $150 million as part of the settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This legal dispute stemmed from allegations of Binance evading federal laws and operating an illegal derivatives exchange, leading to a protracted legal battle that concluded with substantial financial penalties.Furthermore, in November 2023, CZ agreed to step down from his role as CEO of Binance as part of a broader settlement with U.S. regulatory authorities including the Department of Justice, the Treasury Department, and the CFTC. This agreement also involved CZ pleading guilty to various civil charges and one criminal charge related to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. Despite these developments, CZ’s sentencing for the money laundering charges has been postponed until April 30, with CZ currently on bail amounting to $175 million.The combination of regulatory actions from different jurisdictions, including the Philippines and the United States, underscores the growing scrutiny and challenges faced by Binance. These developments highlight the importance of regulatory compliance and transparency in the cryptocurrency industry, as authorities worldwide seek to protect investors and maintain financial stability in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.

Shibarium TVL Sets New High, SHIB Price Fails to Follow Suit - DailyCoin


        
WoofSwap contributes $2.34M to Shibarium’s on-chain liquidity.



SHIB fetches 5.7% gains, gearing up to retest the $0.00003 range.



SHIB faces a resistance wall due to a hefty selling demand on Spot.
Shiba Inu’s Ecosystem is thriving, and a new milestone is on the horizon for Shibarium. The Layer-2 scaling solution received a massive liquidity injection on March 23, 2024, when WoofSwap joined the Layer-2 blockchain. The freshly emerged decentralized exchange (DEX) on Shibarium L2 now dominates 65% of Shibarium’s on-chain liquidity, according to DefiLlama.It’s worth noting that Shibarium’s total value locked (TVL) has been below $1 million for the most part since the chain’s inception in August 2023. However, Shibarium’s developing team has announced plans to onboard 1,000 new DeFi projects, which would dramatically boost Shibarium’s on-chain liquidity.SHIB’s Price to Catch Up with New Achievements?While the all-time peak in TVL was recorded on March 23, 2024, Shiba Inu’s price movement remained stagnant until Monday, March 25, 2024. While SHIB couldn’t conquer the $0.000028 resistance levels on Saturday, SHIB Army’s favorite cryptocurrency managed to push through the price barrier in the early hours of Monday. Claiming daily heights of $0.00002969, SHIB gained 5.7% over the past 24 hours.The long-lasting bullish momentum for SHIB took off after the coin jumped to new yearly heights of $0.000044 on March 15, 2024. However, SHIB saw a sizable retracement due to crypto bulls’ lack of conviction. The gradual market correction slimmed SHIB’s monthly gains to 200%, while the profits nearly tripled at the highest point of the run.Shiba Inu Sees $20M Sell Pressure on the Way UpWhile Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain claimed a new milestone in TVL, SHIB custodians are pointing their fingers at the huge distance from Shiba Inu’s all-time high in market value. Attained on October 28, 2021, the $0.00008616 price range is still 66% away, as SHIB got rejected at the $0.00003 resistance cluster today.Combined order liquidity pushes the scales towards sell pressure on SHIBThe struggle is depicted in Shiba Inu’s Spot market combined liquidity book, with the pending sells outscoring pending buys by slightly above $20 million, according to real-time data by blockchain research platform CoinPaprika.At press time, SHIB is exchanging hands at  $0.00002922, according to CoinGecko. With a 205% upswing since last month, SHIB remains one of the top large-cap performers in the alternative crypto markets this quarter.On the Flipside
The rapid TVL surge on Shibarium L2 is mainly due to DAMN, a new memecoin released by WoofSwap.



A play on Solana’s hat-wearing WIF, DAMN soared 525% in three days since its launch on Shibarium. 



Meanwhile, WoofSwap grew by nearly 5000% in a week to comfortably boost Shibarium’s liquidity.

DeFi fund, Texas apparel company sue to defend airdrop against SEC

Beba, a Texas clothing company run by African immigrants, and the DeFi Education Fund have teamed up to defend the company’s recent airdrop of BEBA tokens against potential actions by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission by seeking a declaratory judgment from the U.S. District Court for Western Texas. In a suit filed on March 25, the plaintiffs also asked the court for clarification of the limits of the SEC’s authority in light of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).Beba created 100,000 BEBA tokens and has airdropped 60,880 of them so far, according to the suit. The tokens are intended to be freely traded and are expected to increase in value. The SEC “will take the position that BEBA tokens are investment contracts and that the airdrop is a securities transaction subject to registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933,” it continued. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs argued that token recipients do nothing to become eligible for the airdrop or take actions that involve no “meaningful consideration, like ‘following’ Beba on social media.” Therefore, there is no common enterprise in the airdrop. Nor did Beba promise to take measures to increase the token’s value. Therefore, the airdrop does not represent a contract under the Howey test, they argued.Source: DeFi Education FundTokenholders are eligible for a discount on an item sold by Beba, however. It compared that offer to a customer loyalty program.Related: DeFi group petitions to stop ‘patent troll’ targeting DeFi protocolsIn addition to defending the airdrop, the suit took issue with SEC policies under Chair Gary Gensler. The SEC violates the APA, it claimed, because the act “tells agencies that when they make new rules, they must do so openly, clearly, and with the benefit of public input.” The suit sought:“A declaration that Defendant [the SEC] violated the APA, both procedurally and substantively, when it adopted a new unwritten policy that nearly all digital assets are securities and the majority of transactions involving digital assets are securities transactions.” It also demanded that the court vacate the purported policy or preventing the SEC from enforcing it. Coinbase also argued that the SEC is violating the APA in its suit demanding a rulemaking from the SEC.Magazine: Powers On… Why aren’t more law schools teaching blockchain, DeFi and NFTs?

According to CoinShares, market uncertainty has made investors more hesitant, as evidenced by lower inflows into exchange-traded funds. Grayscale led the outflows with over $2 billion leaving its products last week.
“We believe the recent price correction led to hesitancy from investors, leading to much lower inflows into new ETF issuers in the US, which saw US $1.1 billion inflows, partially offsetting incumbent Grayscale’s significant US $2 billion outflows last week.”
CoinShares also says that, except for Brazil and Canada, the negative sentiment was shared worldwide.
“Poor sentiment was not just focussed on the US, with Sweden, Switzerland, Hong Kong and Germany seeing outflows of US $37 million, US $25 million, US $35 million and US $4 million respectively. However, Brazil and Canada both saw inflows totaling US $9 million and US $8.4 million respectively.”
Bitcoin (BTC), per usual, took the brunt of the outflows, losing $904 million last week.
Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) products saw outflows of $34 million, $5.6 million, and $3.7 million, respectively.
But not all altcoins performed so poorly.
Says CoinShares,
“The rest of the altcoin space fared well, seeing a net inflow of US $16 million, most notable were Polkadot (US $5 million), Avalanche (US $2.9 million) and Litecoin (US $2 million).”

Massive $200 Billion 'Memecoin Bull Storm' Knocks For Shiba Inu, PEPE, DOGE, BONK, DogWifHat, FLOKI ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has long been a driving force in the crypto market, but this time, it’s not alone in the limelight. Memecoins, the humorous and often whimsical tokens inspired by internet culture, are stealing the show.



Among them, Shiba Inu, DogWifHat (WIF), Pepe (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK) are shining brightly, riding the wave of Bitcoin’s remarkable rally. These meme coins have surged in value, showcasing the exuberance and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market.



Bitcoin’s recent surge has had a cascading effect on the broader cryptocurrency market, propelling many altcoins to new highs. Memecoins, known for their meme-based origins and speculative nature, have seen remarkable gains recently, drawing attention from traders and enthusiasts alike.



WIF Leads the Memecoin Frenzy



WIF/USDT Price: Coinmarketcap



Leading the pack is DogWifHat (WIF), which features an adorable dog with a hat as its mascot. Dogwifhat (WIF) has experienced a remarkable surge in value over the last month, leading many investors to speculate whether it can reach $5 by the end of March 2024.



Within just one week, WIF surged by an impressive 184%, pushing its market capitalization above $2.7 billion and solidifying its position as one of the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

&nbsp



At the time of writing, WIF is trading at $2.73 following a 4.62% rally in the last 24 hours. Nonetheless, WIF has demonstrated remarkable momentum, posting a staggering 905% increase over the past 30 days.



Investors bullish on the Solana-based meme token have propelled Dogwifhat on a meteoric rise in 2024. This surge is driven by several factors, including the enduring appeal of meme coins to retail traders in search of the next Dogecoin or Shiba Inu.



Additionally, the ongoing flow of liquidity into alternative cryptocurrencies and excitement over Dogwifhat’s planned use cases in NFTs and metaverse projects have contributed to the token’s remarkable growth.



PEPE and BONK Follow the Trend



Pepecoin is currently priced at $0.000008981, reflecting a 24-hour surge of over 30%, setting a new all-time high.



The popular meme coin has witnessed an astonishing 815% increase in value over the past 30 days, making it one of the top performers in the meme coin market.



In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Bonk (BONK) has emerged as a focal point, witnessing a notable 9.31% surge in its price over the last 24 hours. With its current price at $0.00002561, Bonk (BONK) is experiencing heightened activity and interest. Over the last 30 days, BONK has witnessed over 200% price increase, as per CoinMarketCap data.



This surge is a direct result of recent developments in the crypto sphere, including listing the Bonk token on BitMEX and launching an enticing airdrop campaign for users.



While the allure of meme coins during a bull market is undeniable, trading in these tokens can be highly speculative and risky. New traders should exercise caution and be aware of the volatile nature of meme coins before trading.



Market Outlook for Memecoins



The surge in memecoin prices has been driven by a combination of factors, including increased retail interest, social media hype, and the overall bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market.



However, experts warn that the current rally may not be sustainable, and investors should be prepared for potential price corrections.



As Bitcoin continues its rally, meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, WIF, PEPE, and BONK are expected to remain in the spotlight, offering both potential profits and risks for investors.



While these tokens can provide exciting trading opportunities, investors should approach them cautiously and be prepared for volatility in the meme coin market.

Garlinghouse Says SEC to Press Judge for $2B in Fines and Penalties in Ripple Case

Alderoty wrote that the company will file its response to the SEC’s motion next month, adding "As we all have seen time and time again, this is a regulator that trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead … Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple – and the industry at large. We trust the Court will approach the remedies phase fairly."

‘Web3 Gaming Sucks’, Says Avalanche, Daring Gamers to Look - Decrypt

“Web3 gaming sucks.” It’s a common refrain amongst many gamers who have thumbed their nose at the growing space, but it’s not something you’d expect the team behind a prominent blockchain network to recite around one of the industry's biggest events.But that’s exactly what Ava Labs did last week at the Game Developers Conference, where the phrase was plastered all over the massive Avalanche Gaming booth and across banners that could be seen from all over the expo hall and as attendees went down the escalator. Talk about a conversation starter.While the tongue-in-cheek branding probably drew snickers from crypto haters who found it to be dead-on, the booth also appeared to draw a steady crowd of people who came to play prominent Avalanche games, hang out, and network. And it earned rave reviews from Web3 builders across all sorts of chains.Interestingly, the concept was first pitched before last year’s GDC event in San Francisco, but Ava Labs didn’t feel confident enough in the premise then.“We didn't do it last year because, truthfully, we didn't feel strong enough,” Ava Labs Senior Marketing Manager Andrew “Coop” Cooper told Decrypt's GG from the show floor. “We didn't feel like we had enough support and the great games, and so it had another year to develop.”“This year felt right,” he added, “because we've come a long way both in game development and our community.”Ava Labs used the booth to showcase up-and-coming games such as the first-person extraction shooter Shrapnel, along with Overwatch-esque hero shooter BloodLoop and the survival game Providence.All three look like AAA-level experiences, and we’ve already played and were impressed by the early access build of Shrapnel that’s available on the Epic Games Store. Each game got its own dedicated day during the event, letting players check them out on the gaming PCs at the booth while members of each development team were on hand to chat and promote their games.Crypto gaming perceptions are largely informed by the games that were playable back in 2021 when the NFT market exploded, and the monster-battling game Axie Infinity defined the initial play-to-earn phenomenon. Early games were simple and often repetitive and felt more like DeFi apps dressed up as video games.But quality games take a long time to develop. Games that were announced and funded in 2021 and 2022 are starting to emerge as more cohesive and compelling experiences. Shrapnel is one of them, on Avalanche, as are card-battler Parallel on Ethereum and farming game Pixels on Ethereum scaler Ronin.Cooper and team saw the GDC campaign as an opportunity to embrace the skepticism they’d face at a traditional gaming event like that—and try to change a few minds in the process by showcasing games that are richer and more fleshed-out than some might expect.“I think we really are getting closer to games that maybe other people will want to play just because it's a great game,” said Cooper. “In terms of risk/reward, we felt really confident about [the campaign] this year because we had noodled on it for a year and felt good.“Of course, there was a risk that it flopped,” he added.While Ava Labs might not have convinced all the doubters at one event, the Avalanche Gaming booth’s vibes appeared to land well with attendees. Amid a tough time in the broader gaming industry with sizable layoffs across traditional studios, Cooper said that more developers appeared open to embracing new business and distribution models.The Avalanche Gaming booth at GDC 2024. Photo: Ava LabsIf anything, Ava Labs aimed to have fun with the activation and make sure that attendees could have fun, as well. Cooper said that Foundation and Labs teams around blockchain networks are often focused on tech and engineering, but gamers want entertainment—and they want quality games. Even at a dev-centric event, that embrace appeared to work out.“They get really deep into that tech, and I think we're lacking something that we've done well here—which is like: Just be fun and have something that's exciting,” he said. “Marketing isn't about your technology only, right? It's about giving people something fun to do.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Dogecoin Price Action: Why A 10% Drop Would Cost Traders $66 Million | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin has been quite strong over the weekend despite other assets in the crypto space taking a beating. This has seen the meme coin favor long traders during this time. However, bulls are not completely out of the woods and a drop in price from here would be detrimental to the tune of tens of millions of dollars.
Dogecoin Price Drop To $0.15 Would Wipe Out $66 Million
The Dogecoin price is still holding steady above $0.17, but long traders face a threat if the price were to break down and retreat from here. According to data from Coinglass, there are a lot of traders who would lose money if the DOGE price were to fall 10% from its current level.

The liquidation heat map on the website shows that right above the $0.153 level, there is a lot of leveraged longs. A total of 2.43 million DOGE in leveraged longs have their liquidation price at this point, and a drop below this price mark would lead to massive liquidations. In total, there are $66.89 million worth of longs at this level, and a 10% drop would trigger this liquidation trend.
Source: Coinglass
On the other end of the spectrum, there are a large number of leveraged shorts that will be liquidated if the price were to rise another 10% from here. Coinglass data shows that the liquidation volumes, if Dogecoin moves above $0.1908, would cross more than $55 million.
In the shorter term, short traders stand to suffer $20 million in liquidations if the DOGE price reaches $0.18. Whole long traders risk a similar amount if the price of the meme coin breaks down below $0.17.
Can DOGE Price Reclaim $0.2?
The Dogecoin price continues to get a lot of support, and one of the most recent instances of this is the price surging when the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) announced that it had gotten a number of licenses for its money transmitter business.

Crypto analysts have also shown bullishness toward the meme coin, expecting the Dogecoin price to continue to rise. One such case is from crypto analyst DonAlt who believes that the DOGE price could reach a new all-time high with a target at $1.
DonAlt explains that the meme coin has being trading quite well alongside Bitcoin, so the possibility that it rallies towards $1 is high. The crypto analyst believes that DOGE is a great investment and it would be a great buy if it does dip to $1 again.

SWIFT declares second sandbox connector tests a success for CBDC and more

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messaging network has released the results of the second phase of sandbox testing for its central bank digital currency (CBDC) interlinking solution, which it calls a connector. The project looked at four use cases, not all of which involved CBDC, according to the report it released on the test results. It experimented with digital trading with atomic (instantaneous) settlement using smart contracts. It connected tokenization platforms to facilitate atomic delivery versus payment and worked with financial infrastructure firm CLS Group to show the connector’s capability of connecting existing foreign exchange infrastructures using CBDC.Schematic of a proposed FX settlement system. Source: SWIFTThe fourth use case, involving using its Liquidity Saving Mechanism algorithms to reduce fragmentation of liquidity across platforms, was described as a “paper exercise, accompanied by bilateral discussions.”The project used R3’s Corda and the Hyperledger Fabric and Besu blockchains to demonstrate the connector's interoperability among them. It concluded:“A single point of access provided by Swift can enable institutions to reuse their existing channels, reach new networks, and bring down participation costs.” SWIFT also emphasized that traditional financial solutions will continue to exist and demand interconnectivity as well.With the completion of the sandbox experiments, SWIFT plans to further develop the beta version of its connector, concentrating on the implementation of smart contracts across networks, cryptographically locking and releasing tokens across networks and preserving data and programmability of tokens across networks. Related: Does the Bitcoin halving impact cross-chain interoperability solutions?Over 125 users made more than 750 simulated transactions to demonstrate complex use cases for the SWIFT CBDC interlinking solution. Among the participants in the sandbox’s second phase were ANZ, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, DTCC, HSBC, Société Générale, Standard Chartered, Sumitomo Mitsui and Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, as well as at least seven central banks or monetary authorities. Source: Nick Kerrigan The beginning of the tests was announced in  September. SWIFT wrapped up the first testing phase in March 2023. SWIFT is looking far and wide for future use cases. It has been simultaneously experimenting with settlement using a unified ledger model. Like the CBDC sandbox, this research emphasized the ability to use existing technology, including SWIFT’s.

SEC will ask for $2B in fines and penalties - Ripple chief legal officer

Ripple Labs chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked a federal judge for a $2-billion penalty against the blockchain firm.In a March 25 X post, Alderoty said the SEC requested a judge impose $2 billion in fines and penalties against Ripple as part of a filing under seal until March 26. The civil case against Ripple has been ongoing since the SEC filed in 2020.“Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple - and the industry at large,” said Alderoty. “We trust the Court will approach the remedies phase fairly.”Source: Stuart AlderotyThe Ripple chief legal officer said the firm planned to file a response to the SEC request in April but claimed the regulator “trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead.” On March 18, a Utah judge imposed sanctions on the SEC for acting in “bad faith” regarding the evidence it provided against the firm Debt Box. “There is absolutely no precedent for this,” said Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on X, referring to the $2-billion fine. “We will continue to expose the SEC for what they are when we respond to this.”Related: Judge grants SEC’s deadline extension on Ripple caseFiled by the SEC in December 2020, the regulator’s lawsuit against Ripple, Garlinghouse, and co-founder Chris Larsen alleged the firm raised $1.3 billion in unregistered securities through sales of XRP tokens.

Robert Kiyosaki, Worth $100 Million, Said "I Am Buying More Bitcoin" and Explained Why - Bitcoin Sistemi


Famous author and businessman Robert Kiyosaki, whose net worth is $100 million, recently announced that he plans to purchase 10 more Bitcoins before April.
He cited the upcoming “Halving” event for BTC as the main reason for his decision.


He also predicts that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in value by September 2024.
When asked why, Kiyosaki explained that “smart money” is aware of the economic challenges the world is facing. These include the USA being the biggest debtor country, the “bankruptcy” of China's real estate market, Japan's economic depression that has been going on since 1990, Germany's drift into economic depression, consumers living on credit cards, banks in trouble and the upcoming economic crisis. There is a threat of war.






Kiyosaki also quoted Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor. Saylor asks, “What do you call people who insist on accumulating fiat money, that is, 'fake' money?” He asked the question and answered “poor”.
Kiyosaki's last suggestion is as follows: “Please do not be a poor person who accumulates fake money. Almost everyone in the world can buy at least one silver or one Bitcoin Satoshi. Be smart, take action and be careful.”

Will Ethereum and XRP lead the altcoins' rally now? - AMBCrypto



An analysis suggested a bull rally for altcoins.
Market indicators remained bearish for XRP and Ethereum. 

The market witnessed quite some volatility in the recent past, but altcoins like Ethereum [ETH] and Ripple [XRP] held their ground last week. 
In fact, a recent analysis hinted at yet another altcoin rally in the coming days.  
Are altcoins expecting another rally?
Bitcoin’s [BTC] downtrend caused the entire market to shed its value in the last few weeks. However, as per the latest analysis from Rekt Capital, altcoins managed to hold their ground. 
As per the tweet, despite Bitcoin’s 18% pre-halving retrace, the altcoin market cap continued to hold on to the $315 billion level as support. 
AMBCrypto then planned to take a look at top altcoins like ETH and XRP to see what to expect from them. 
Are people buying ETH?
AMBCrypto found that at press time, selling pressure on ETH was high. This was evident from the rise in its Supply on Exchanges. 
However, it was interesting to note that despite the drops in price and high selling pressure, ETH’s supply led by top addresses rose. This meant that whales were confident in the token. 
Source: Santiment
To see whether whales’ confidence would translate into reality, we then took a look at ETH’s daily chart. Despite the possibility of an altcoin rally, ETH’s metrics remained shaky. 
The token’s MACD displayed a bearish advantage at press time. Additionally, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a sharp downtick, further suggesting a downtrend. 
Source: TradigView
What’s up with XRP?
After Ethereum, we checked XRP’s state, as it is also one of the top altcoins. As per CoinMarketCap, XRP was up by over 2% in the last seven days. 
At press time, the token was trading at $0.6301 with a market cap of over $34 million. 
However, despite the rise in price, the token’s Social Volume dropped. Its Weighted Sentiment also declined, meaning that bearish sentiment around it was dominant in the market.

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25

We then took a look at its daily chart to see whether its metrics were also bearish, like ETH. Not surprisingly, the findings were the same. XRP’s MACD was likewise bearish, and its RSI signaled a price drop. 
It will be interesting to see which direction altcoins move in the coming days, considering the bearish indicators of the top altcoins.

Bitcoin Top In Yet? What The Legendary MVRV Ratio Says


                            Here’s what the latest trend in the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio suggests about where the market is currently in terms of a top.
Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Has Seen A Decline To The 2.34 Level
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the BTC MVRV ratio surged high earlier this year as the cryptocurrency rally took place.
The “MVRV ratio” is a popular indicator that tracks the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap. The former is simply the total valuation of the asset’s supply at the current spot price, while the latter is an on-chain capitalization model.

The realized cap measures the total sum of the value of the cryptocurrency’s supply, assuming that each coin in circulation has its true value at the price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain rather than the current spot value.
One way to interpret the realized cap is that since it takes into account the buying price of every token in circulation (assuming that the last transaction of every token was indeed the point at which it last changed hands), it essentially sums up the total capital the investors have invested in the asset.
As such, the MVRV ratio tells us how the total value that Bitcoin investors are carrying right now (that is, the market cap) compares against the value they put in (the realized cap).
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV ratio over the past few years:

Looks like the value of the metric has been turning down in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio has had a value greater than 1 for a while now. When the indicator has such values, the market cap is greater than the realized cap, and hence, the investors carry net profits.
With the latest rally in the asset, this indicator has surged to relatively high levels, a natural consequence of the holders’ profits ballooning up with the price surge.
After the recent drawdown in the price, though, the MVRV ratio has also turned itself around, as it’s now heading down. At present, the ratio has a value of around 2.34.
“Traditionally, an MVRV ratio above 3 has been a reliable marker for predicting price peaks,” notes IntoTheBlock. So far, in the current rally, the metric hasn’t crossed this mark. It did come close recently, but the latest decline has meant it has gained a bit more distance to the level.

Why have tops historically occurred at high values of the Bitcoin MVRV ratio? The answer is that investors in profits are more likely to participate in selling, and this temptation to take profits only increases as their gains grow larger.
Because of this, selloffs are most probable when the market is holding extreme levels of profits, which is exactly what high MVRV ratio values reflect.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,200, up 3% over the past 24 hours.

Ava Labs CEO Warns of Substandard L2 Projects, Says Next Cycle Will Be Worse


																Emin Gün Sirer, the founder and CEO of Ava Labs, has sounded an alarm on the rise of substandard layer 2 (L2) solutions in the crypto space.
Drawing parallels with the fallout from the FTX collapse, he cautioned investors about the dangers associated with investing in these “trash” projects.
Ava Labs Founder Highlights L2 Red Flags
On March 23, Sirer took to X to voice his concerns about the crypto community’s habit of ignoring warning signs, especially regarding people seen as successful at first glance. He warned that the upcoming cycle would likely see heightened noise and worsened behavior. Sirer added that it is easy to launch low-quality L2 solutions, tempting individuals to engage in such practices.


The Ava Labs CEO outlined specific issues regarding the gap between marketing promises and the technical realities of some L2 projects.




A major red flag he noted was the presence of centralized sequencers in these projects, which lack fraud-proof mechanisms. He also cautioned against L2 solutions with token sales only for fundraising purposes without a clear utility within their network, which often signals a lack of substantive value or innovation.
Sirer further warned that the project founders’ premature selling of native tokens could indicate a lack of confidence in the long-term viability. In addition, if a limited number of tokens are in circulation, they are vulnerable to price manipulation by artificially inflating the project’s value and misleading investors about its potential.
To differentiate between genuine L2 projects and those that are not, Sirer advises that investors seek solutions that address the core issues in the crypto space, such as performance, scalability, and seamless integration with traditional financial systems. Sirer further mentioned the importance of L2 platforms supporting different use cases with benefits beyond technical enhancements.
He stressed the importance of looking into project founders’ moral character and behavior since ethical misconduct indicates a project’s lack of integrity.
Diverse Perspectives on L2 Solutions
In response to Sirer’s insights, Robert Sasu, a core developer at MultiversX, has echoed the importance of foundational blockchain qualities such as decentralization, security, and thoughtful design.


On the other hand, @nextalphaa brought a different perspective to the discussion on Ethereum’s L2 solutions. The user highlighted Ethereum’s permissionless and inclusive nature, arguing that it promotes different projects that contribute to the ecosystem’s goals of more transparency and decentralization.
Meanwhile, Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem has experienced substantial growth, reaching a total locked value exceeding $38 billion. A milestone in October 2023 saw transaction activity on L2 networks surpass those on the Ethereum mainnet. Currently, these L2 networks process about five times as many transactions as the mainnet, according to L2beat.

Litecoin's price can jump 22%, but not before THIS happens - AMBCrypto



The liquidation levels indicated a bearish signal but $599,660 might be wiped out if LTC hit $91.78.
Increasing falling and a falling price suggested a decline toward $85.40.

According to analyst Rekt Capital, Litecoin’s [LTC] price might continue its upswing in the coming weeks.
The analyst posted this on X (formerly Twitter), noting that the successful retest of the multi-year macro downtrend was a sign that the LTC’s price could increase.
From the chart he shared, the altcoin might experience a 22.72% jump. If this is the case, Litecoin might hit $110. At press time, LTC changed hands at $89.74, indicating a 27.99% increase in the last 30 days.
The price of the cryptocurrency also increased in the last 24 hours.
The coin might ascend, but first…
However, AMBCrypto decided to check the chances of a rise to the predicted price. To have a view of this, we employed the liquidation levels indicator provided by Hyblock.
This indicator shows the estimated price levels where large liquidation events might occur. For a trader, an idea of other traders’ possible liquidation levels might offer an edge.
At press time, there was a cluster of liquidity from $90 to $93, suggesting that LTC might move toward this region. Should the price hit this point, a lot of shorts might see their positions wiped out.
However, the Cumulative Liquidation Levels Delta (CLLD) displayed another signal. If the CCLD is positive, it means there are long liquidations.
On the other hand, a negative reading of the CCLD suggests short liquidations.
Source: Hyblock
As of this writing, the CCLD was positive. For the price, this fuels a bearish bias, as Litecoin might undergo a full retracement and erase its recent gains.
If this is the case, the value of the cryptocurrency could tap new lows before it heads toward $110.
Large liquidation looms
Furthermore, we also considered the liquidation heatmap. According to Coinglass, many positions risk liquidations if LTC continues to increase.
For example, if the price hits $91.78, contracts worth $599,660 would lose their funds. Also, if the price rises to $93.07, liquidations at that zone would be worth $128,200 on the Binance exchange.
Source: Coinglass
In terms of the volume, on-chin data from Santiment showed that it increased. At press time LTC’s volume had hit 638.83 million.
However, the price of the altcoin has been falling within the last hour. With the volume increasing and price decreasing, it means that the earlier upswing was not as strong as before.
Hence, the value of Litecoin might decrease. In the short term, LTC’s price might fall to $85.40.

Nonetheless, the prediction is no guarantee that the coin might evade climbing in the short term. Should a wave of buying pressure hit LTC, the price might revisit the $100 region within a short period.
If not, a decline could be imminent.

Crypto Trader Predicts Parabolic Rally for Decentralized Video Streaming Altcoin - Here’s His Target - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst believes one decentralized video-streaming altcoin project is about to go on a massive rally.
Pseudonymous trader Kaleo tells his 632,300 followers on the social media platform X that Theta Network (THETA), a platform for decentralized video delivery, could soar by more than 200% as the social finance (SoFi) space finds renewed interest.










”I wouldn’t sleep on THETA here. I’m still incredibly bullish on SoFi over the next few months as you have tokens like ARENA and the FT (Friend.tech) airdrop that will be rolling out and bringing more attention back to the sector.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at his chart, the trader suggests that THETA could soar beyond $10. THETA is trading for $3.10 at time of writing, up 10.5% in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the trader says he is bullish on Avalanche (AVAX)-based native governance token of TraderJoe (JOE), the biggest decentralized exchange (DEX) on Avalanche.
“With the AVAX memecoin rush kicking off this week (million dollar of incentives for LP (liquidity pool) staking), JOE is easily still one of my highest conviction plays here.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at his chart, the trader suggests JOE will increase to $3.50 around April. Joe is trading for $0.92 at time of writing, up 10.5% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the trader is bullish on BNB, the native asset of the world’s largest crypto exchange platform. He takes a look at BNB in its Bitcoin pair (BNB/BTC) to back up his thesis.
“BNB/BTC. Full send soon.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at his chart, the trader suggests that BNB/BTC is printing a bullish pattern by setting higher low prices and could soon soar to 0.0102 BTC ($710).
BNB/BTC is trading for 0.008496 BTC ($591) at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.

BREAKING: Nilam Resources Allegedly Plans to Buy 24,500 Bitcoin (BTC) - Bitcoin Sistemi


South American gold and precious metals producer Nilam Resources announced that it plans to purchase 24,800 Bitcoins (approximately $1.7 billion).
UPDATE
Some claims that the company's press release about purchasing Bitcoin are fake are being discussed among the cryptocurrency community. Cryptocurrency users should act knowing that the news may be fake.


The fact that it is not logical for Nilam to notify in advance that he will buy BTC, in addition to the fact that Nilam, whose total market value is 4 million dollars, will buy BTC for 1.7 billion dollars, strengthens the possibility that the claims may be fake. The cryptocurrency community is considering the possibility that this could be a scam to boost Nilam shares.

SEC to Seek $2 Billion From Ripple Labs, Says Chief Legal Officer - Decrypt

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will seek $2 billion in penalties from Ripple, the fintech firm’s chief legal officer has announced. Stuart Alderoty said on Twitter on Monday that the top regulator will seek the fine from a judge tomorrow. “As you will see when the SEC’s brief is made public tomorrow, they ask the Judge for $2B in fines and penalties,” he wrote. He added that the regulator “trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead” and claimed the regulator wanted to “punish and intimidate Ripple—and the industry at large.”Ripple and the SEC—the company behind the cryptocurrency XRP—have been locked in a legal battle since 2020. The regulator hit the fintech company with a $1.3 billion lawsuit, alleging that it sold unregistered securities in the form of XRP, now the sixth biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. But last year, Ripple scored a partial win in the courts against the SEC when a judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors did not qualify as securities.Despite the judge saying that $728 million worth of contracts for institutional sales did constitute unregistered securities sales, investors and Ripple Labs interpreted the partial ruling as a win for the broader crypto industry.The lawsuit is still ongoing. Last month, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called the SEC “very hostile,” adding that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler was a “political liability” and that his way of regulating the crypto industry wasn’t working.Ripple is just one of the many companies that the SEC has targeted in recent years. The financial watchdog has hit major American crypto exchanges and lenders with lawsuits, alleging that they repeatedly flogged unregistered securities in the form of digital tokens.The SEC declined further comment; Ripple could not provide a comment to Decrypt at time of writing.This article has been updated with additional information.

Polygon zkEVM Outage Resolved: What Led to the Network Halt? - DailyCoin


        
Developers claim to have fully resolved the issue that led to Polygon zkEVM’s outage over the weekend.



Developers initially linked the outage to software that bundled transactions from the Layer 2 chain to the Ethereum mainnet.



A statement from a Polygon Labs executive suggests that the complexity of ZK technology may have contributed to the recent debacle.
In March 2023, Polygon Labs threw its hat in the Ethereum Layer 2 ring with the launch of the Polygon zkEVM in beta. However, a year after its release, there are signs that the network has yet to reach its finished form.On March 23, 2024, the network hit a snag that halted block production for at least ten hours. According to developers at the time of writing, however, the issue that led to this hours-long outage has been resolved, and the network has resumed normal operations.But What led to the network halt?Polygon zkEVM Developers Deploy Emergency FixOn Monday, March 25, Polygon Labs disclosed that developers have fully resolved the issue that led to the Polygon zkEVM outage over the weekend. According to the firm, the resolution follows an intervention by the network’s emergency council (a small group of network participants trusted to oversee upgrades and step in during a crisis) that allowed developers to deploy a fix.Per the statement, developers would release a full report on what led to the issue early next week. They had initially attributed the outage to the network’s sequencer, a software responsible for ordering transactions on the network, going out of sync with the Ethereum mainnet. The report will likely detail the root cause of this incident.While users wait for the report, a Polygon Labs executive has implied that recent difficulties faced by the Layer 2 chain might be linked to the technological complexities of the approach the firm has chosen to scale Ethereum.“ZK is Hard”Responding to the recent Polygon zkEVM crisis, Polygon Labs VP Product David Silverman quipped, “zk is hard.”"zk is hard, zk is still inevitable. a hard hard weekend, but tremendously proud of the team getting the network back up."While ZK-rollups are hailed for providing better security guarantees and faster settlement than Optimistic rollups, the technology remains relatively new. At the same time, it faces significant hurdles, including the computationally intensive process of generating proofs and Ethereum’s non-ZK-friendly design.To tackle these challenges, Polygon Labs and other proponents like StarkWare have continued to lead innovations in the space, mostly recently linking up to develop a more efficient proving system dubbed Circle STARKs.On the Flipside
Network outages are becoming increasingly frequent in the crypto space, and the Ethereum Layer 2 space is no exception. In December 2023, Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum Layer 2 network by TVL, experienced an over five-hour outage due to a surge in inscriptions. In the same month, zkSync Era, the largest ZK-rollup by TVL, also experienced a four-hour outage.



Polygon zkEVM is still in beta, allowing developers more room to conduct extensive testing and iron out quirks.



The outage had no effect on Polygon PoS or any other CDK-powered chain.
Why This MattersThe Polygon zkEVM outage adds to recent incidents, highlighting that tech in the Ethereum Layer 2 space is still evolving and yet to fully mature.Read this for more on the Polygon outage:Polygon’s 12-Hour Outage Is Not What You Think.

CryptoQuant CEO Unveils ‘Max Pain’ Price Level for Bitcoin, Says BTC ETF Netflows Are Slowing - The Daily Hodl


								The head of blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant says that Bitcoin (BTC) could dip to a “max pain” price range before the bull market is able to continue.
Ki Young Ju tells his 340,000 followers on the social media platform X that the net inflows of capital to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have cooled off, suggesting that sellers may be taking over the market.










The analytics expert says that based on BTC’s historical price action, a maximum pain correction could pull Bitcoin down to $51,000.
“Bitcoin spot ETF netflows are slowing.
Demand may rebound if the BTC price approaches critical support levels.
New whales, mainly ETF buyers, have a $56,000 on-chain cost basis. Corrections typically entail a max drawdown of around 30% in bull markets, with a max pain of $51,000.”
Source: Ki Young Ju/X
Supporting the idea that a more severe Bitcoin correction may be around the corner, CryptoQuant’s data also suggests that the larger holders of BTC – in this case miners – have started selling more aggressively.
“Large Bitcoin holders started selling more aggressively, and miners have also been offloading their holdings as prices have soared.”
Source: CryptoQuant/X
CryptQuant’s data also shows that shorter-term holders are taking profits as well – at a rate not seen in nearly five years.
“BTC traders started to sell, taking advantage of high-profit margins. This selling behavior hasn’t been seen at this scale since May 2019.”
Source: CryptoQuant/X
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $67,184, up over 4% in the past day.

Crypto Airdrops Are Not Securities, Lawsuit Against SEC Argues - Decrypt

The crypto industry is clapping back at U.S. regulators with a pre-emptive lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), spotlighting its aggressive enforcement of securities law. On Monday, the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) filed a lawsuit in a Texas federal court against the SEC, arguing that Beba, a Texas-based apparel company, did not violate U.S. securities laws by airdropping its BEBA crypto token to customers for free. The suit seeks a court order officially declaring Beba’s airdrop legal, potentially protecting other airdrops like it from SEC litigation.  “Beba has engaged and plans to engage in a course of activity that is, in fact, compliant with securities law but that SEC policy has declared unlawful,” the DEF wrote in a Texas District Court filing. Beba hasn’t actually been sued by the SEC but is pre-emptively invoking the Declaratory Judgment Act. The law permits a party to seek legal recourse before suffering damages if they reasonably believe they will be subject to unjustified enforcement actions. Going on the offensive marks a shift for the crypto industry, which has historically played defense against sporadic SEC lawsuits filed against companies and projects without warning. “It certainly is a change in strategy for us,” Amanda Tuminelli, DEF’s Chief Legal Officer, told Decrypt. Key to DEF’s approach in filing Monday’s lawsuit is an accusation that the SEC has violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) by creating unofficial, internal policies about crypto without disclosing them publicly. The SEC has repeatedly maintained that crypto-specific rules at the agency are not needed, and that regulators are only enforcing existing securities laws, which it says plainly apply to many crypto offerings. “They definitely have a policy that they are using to bring all these actions and send subpoenas and do investigations,” Tuminelli said. “Because they've adopted that policy behind closed doors and refused to write it down, that is a violation of the APA.”Last month, also in a Texas federal court, a group of prominent crypto companies, including Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz, sued the SEC, claiming the agency does not have jurisdiction over much of the crypto industry. The suit marked one of, if not the first, proactive legal actions against the federal regulator over its crypto policies. The SEC has been aggressively pursuing legal action against crypto companies for years. So why are crypto firms only now opting for offensive lawsuits?“It is not easy to find people who want to sue the SEC,” Tuminelli said. “Who are like, ‘Yes! Let me put myself right in the SEC’s crosshairs and risk them knowing who I am!’”But at this point, the risks for companies like Beba that utilize crypto tokens might be so evident that any tactical advantage might be worth attracting the SEC’s ire pre-emptively.  History shows that the SEC has targeted crypto firms similar to Beba in the past;  in 2018, it sued Tomahawk Exploration LLC for the promotion and distribution of “Tomahawkcoins,” despite the firm never having never raised any money. In 2022, the agency sued the Hydrogen Technology Corporation for distributing free “Hydro” tokens for marketing purposes and creating a secondary market. According to DEF, such distributions can’t be called securities transactions because they involve no investment of money from counterparties—a central tenant to the SEC’s Howey Test, which is used to identify investment contracts. In recent months, free airdrops have taken crypto by storm, raising billions of dollars for companies and projects—despite initially dropping tokens to users for free, unlike the legally vulnerable and now-outmoded practice of initial coin offerings (ICOs). In a message to Decrypt, University of Kentucky law professor Brian L. Frye said that DEF has made a “solid case” that airdrops fall outside of the SEC’s jurisdiction. In the past, Frye has criticized crypto firms like Coinbase for underestimating how broad the SEC’s authority is based on Howey, but he believes DEF’s claims around airdrops are better reasoned. By contrast, he thinks the fund’s efforts to prove the SEC violated the APA might have more of an uphill battle.“The SEC isn’t claiming to make a new rule for crypto, but regulating under its existing authority, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Howey,” Frye explained. “You don’t need notice and comment when you can make your case to the court.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Robert Kiyosaki Says 'Buy As Much Bitcoin As You Can Afford' - Benzinga

Renowned investor and author Robert Kiyosaki is bullish on Bitcoin, urging investors to buy as much as possible. How Has Bitcoin Been Doing The Past Week?Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around  $67,000 with a $1.25 trillion market cap. BTC's price soared to an all-time high of $73,797 last week, largely the result of exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows from institutions and the imminent halving in April. The amount of BTC being mined is halved every four years to maintain scarcity. In April, the amount of BTC mined per block will be cut from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC reducing the daily BTC produced from 900 BTC to 450 BTC. As retail and private investors have noted this, more Bitcoin has been purchased, resulting in a  51% year-to-date rally. Don't Miss:When assets like Bitcoin hit new all-time highs, profit-taking is natural. BTC is down about 13% from the recent highs but is still strong because of the massive gains made over the last few months.Kiyosaki's Price Target Kiyosaki, author of "Rich Dad Poor Dad," recently posted his predictions on the financial markets and BTC on X.  Kiyosaki said China is borrowing money to prop up its market because many consumers have stopped buying stocks. “This is the time to buy real gold, real silver and as many Bitcoin as you can afford," Kiyosaki posted. Kiyosaki’s conviction in Bitcoin is based on the asset's capped supply of 21 million. Kiyosaki has said that investing in deflationary assets is one of the smartest things you can do with your money. Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold because of its limited supply, which contributes to increased demand, so it’s no wonder it's one of Kiyosaki's favorite investments."I love gold and silver. I own gold and silver mines. The problem with gold and silver is … the higher the prices go, the more gold and silver is found. … No matter how high the price of Bitcoin goes, there will only be 21 million ever. That’s why I love Bitcoin," he posted on X. Saying Kiyosaki is bullish on BTC is an understatement. Kiyosaki said that with the combination of scarcity, utility and institutional interest, BTC will reach $300,000 per coin by the end of 2024. At the time of writing, that’s almost a 500% increase from where prices are now. Kiyosaki's advice for investors is not to procrastinate. He said buying BTC is one of the best things you can do to set yourself up for a better future. "Rich Dad Poor Dad" asserts that you don't need a lot of money to start investing. Although the book was released in 1997, the takeaways are relevant today — the key to building wealth is making your money work for you. Whether it’s $20, $200 or $2,000, getting started investing is the first step. Bitcoin has been a high-performing asset and many investors like Kiyosaki, believe it will continue to increase in price because of its scarcity. With a net worth of $100 million, it's fair to say Kiyosaki knows what he's talking about. Read Next:

Bitcoin Shatters Profit-Taking Streak From 2021 Bull Run


								On-chain data shows the recent Bitcoin consecutive profit-taking day streak has now surpassed the longest run from the 2021 bull rally.
Bitcoin Has Now Seen 157 Straight Days Of Net Profit-Taking
As analyst James Van Straten explained as a new post on X, BTC has already surpassed the longest profit-taking spree from the previous bull run during this rally so far.
The relevant indicator here is the “Net Realized Profit/Loss,” which tracks the net amount of profit or loss (in USD) that Bitcoin investors as a whole are realizing with their selling.

This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each sold coin to see what price it was moved at before this. Assuming that the last transaction of the coin was the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time would have been its cost basis leading up to its latest sale.
The indicator then subtracts this price from the current spot price at which it’s being sold/transferred to calculate the realized profit or loss. Naturally, if this difference is positive, the coin’s sale is contributing to the profit-taking volume, while it being negative implies loss realization.
The Net Realized Profit/Loss sums up all these profits and losses for all the coins being sold at a given moment to output the overall situation in the market.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average (MA) of this Bitcoin indicator over the past few years:

The 7-day MA value of the metric appears to have been positive in recent months | Source: @ali_charts on X
As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day MA of the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss has been positive for the past few months. To be more particular, the indicator has held these values for 157 consecutive days now.
When this metric has green values, it means that the market as a whole is participating in a net amount of profit-taking. Similarly, red values imply the dominance of loss-taking.
It would appear that the investors have been taking net profit for 157 straight days now, which is longer than the longest profit-taking streak during the 2021 bull run (155 days).
From the chart, it’s visible that Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss shot especially high as the cryptocurrency’s price explored new all-time highs earlier. The price top so far coincided with the peak of this spike in the indicator, where its 7-day MA value hit $3.6 billion.
This profit-taking level was similar to the largest event observed during the last bull run. According to Straten, this is one of the reasons the asset has seen such a massive selloff.

Despite hitting record levels already, the profit-taking may not be ending anytime soon; however, as the analyst says, “this trend will continue as we are in a bull run and is still relatively mild compared to the 2021 bull run.”
BTC Price
Bullish momentum appears to have returned for Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency has surpassed the $69,000 level after a surge of more than 5% over the past day.

SEC sanctioned for ‘abuse of power,’ probes Ethereum: Law Decoded

A United States district court has imposed sanctions on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for acting in “bad faith” in its lawsuit against Debt Box. The SEC initially filed a motion to dismiss without prejudice, but that was denied by Judge Robert Shelby, who slammed the regulator for intentionally lying to the court about evidence it obtained to secure a temporary restraining order and freeze Debt Box’s assets in August 2023. The “critical evidence” the SEC offered to have obtained “lacked any basis,” which was nonetheless advanced in “deliberately false and misleading ways,” Shelby explained.Meanwhile, several advocacy groups have filed amicus briefs in support of an appeal by Coinbase, calling for the SEC to create clear rules for the crypto industry. In separate filings with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the Crypto Council for Innovation, the Satoshi Action Fund, the Texas Blockchain Council, investment firm Paradigm, digital asset company Lejilex and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the SEC lacked clear guidelines for market participants to successfully follow in the United States. Many of the filings argued that companies would be more inclined to leave the country without clear rules of the road.That, however, hasn’t stopped the SEC from expanding its activities. On March 19, it asked Congress for an extra $158 million from the federal budget for 2025 to address “significant growth and change in our markets,” including the “Wild West of the crypto markets.” The Congressional Budget Justification — a document outlining the SEC’s budgetary needs for the upcoming 2025 fiscal year — requests over $2.5 billion for 2025, up from the $2.4 billion it requested in 2024.The commission has reportedly issued subpoenas to companies related to attempts to label Ether (ETH) as a security. Several U.S.-based companies reportedly received subpoenas from the SEC requesting they provide documents and financial records pertaining to dealings with the Ethereum Foundation.

The adjustment in tax rates, as recommended by the IMF, aims to collect yearly taxes on capital gains on real estate assets, irrespective of whether the owner chooses to sell or retain the property. Additionally, property developers could have to comply with stricter tracking and reporting requirements, which will be supported by hefty fines for noncompliance, ultimately enforcing new tax rules in the real estate market.Continue readingNigeria orders Binance to disclose all user data, launches criminal investigationA Nigerian High Court has directed the operators of Binance Holdings to provide the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission with comprehensive data and information relating to all persons from Nigeria who are trading on its platform.

Philippines Blocks Binance Over Unlicensed Operations, Citing Investor Protection - Benzinga

The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took decisive action to block the online presence of cryptocurrency exchange Binance in the country. What Happened: In mid-March, the Commission En Banc approved the filing of a formal request with the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to assist in blocking Binance’s website and other web pages used by the exchange. Despite conducting promotional campaigns on social media to attract Filipino investors, Binance lacks the required SEC license to engage in such activities.

BOME Meme Coin Surges Amid Market Turbulence: Major Cryptocurrencies Tumble as Industry Luminaries Weigh In



                    
The past week has been a rollercoaster for the cryptocurrency market, marked by significant events that shaped the landscape. 



Unexpectedly, meme coins grabbed headlines, major cryptocurrencies experienced setbacks, and prominent figures voiced their opinions on the market’s future.




In a surprising turn of events, the “Book Of Meme” (BOME/USD) made remarkable gains, outshining its competitor, the so-called “Dogecoin Killer,” Shiba Inu (SHIB/USD). 



On Sunday, BOME reported a 6.4% increase in its price and a significant 13.4% rise in trading volume, with a notable $1.5 billion in trades. 



This surge was further bolstered by Binance’s announcement of BOME’s upcoming listing on both its spot market and futures platform.



The same week, major cryptocurrencies faced a downturn, with Tuesday highlighting a dramatic fall. 



The sector saw over $650 million in liquidations within a day, largely due to Bitcoin’s (BTC/USD) decline below the $63,000 mark. 



This drop resulted in an 8% shrinkage of the market cap within a mere 24 hours.

In the midst of market turmoil, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ shared his investment insights. 



He advocated for gold, silver, and Bitcoin as preferable investments over stocks and bonds, citing China’s economic volatility and its “foolish” financial strategies as a backdrop for his advice.




Further adding to the discourse, 10x Research released a report forecasting a downturn in Bitcoin’s value. 



This prediction came to pass as Bitcoin fell by 13% over the week, underscoring the report’s identification of risk factors and potential support levels should the downturn persist.



Controversy also arose from Peter Schiff, a known Bitcoin skeptic, who criticized CNBC’s “Squawk Box” for allegedly displaying a bias towards Bitcoin. 



He accused the show of highlighting the cryptocurrency’s successes while overlooking its failures, specifically pointing out a lack of coverage on a significant 6% loss Bitcoin suffered overnight.



These developments reflect the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, with fluctuations driven by various factors from market sentiment to economic conditions, illustrating the unpredictable journey of digital currencies.

Binance phases out Tron USDC amidst regulatory backlash

In response to escalating regulatory pressures and an impending blockade by the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Binance, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, has announced the cessation of support for Tron network-based USD Coin (USDC) stablecoins. This strategic move comes on the heels of Circle’s withdrawal from the Tron blockchain, as regulatory scrutiny intensifies across various jurisdictionsBinance ends Tron USDC supportBinance’s decision to terminate support for Tron-based USDC was communicated through a statement indicating that the cessation of support would come into effect by April 5. Notably, transactions involving USDC via other supported networks, such as Ethereum, remain unaffected by this change. With less than two weeks’ notice, Binance users utilizing Tron-based USDC must swiftly withdraw their assets or convert them to USDC on alternative networks. The decision underscores the challenges faced by cryptocurrency exchanges amidst a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, with the Philippines SEC’s move representing the latest in a series of regulatory setbacks for Binance. As the cryptocurrency industry grapples with increased scrutiny and regulatory compliance demands, exchanges must navigate complex regulatory frameworks to maintain operational integrity and ensure compliance with evolving standards.Reasons behind the decisionThe abrupt end to support for Tron-based USDC follows Circle’s announcement of its departure from the Tron blockchain, citing an “enterprise-wide approach” involving various departments, including business organization and compliance. Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron network, acknowledged Circle’s decision, highlighting the decentralized nature of the blockchain akin to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Circle’s disassociation from Sun last year, prompted by concerns raised by international bodies like the United Nations regarding alleged involvement in illicit financial activities, likely contributed to this move.Simultaneously, the Philippines‘ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced plans to block access to Binance for its citizens within the next three months. The SEC has raised concerns over Binance’s unregistered status in the country, emphasizing the need to safeguard the public from potential risks associated with unregulated investment products. The financial regulator has also urged tech giants Google and Meta to cease Binance-related advertising targeting Filipino users on their platforms. Last year, the Philippines SEC issued a cautionary advisory against Binance, highlighting its unregistered operations in the Asian country.Navigating global regulatory watersThe move to block Binance in the Philippines marks the latest regulatory setbacks for the cryptocurrency exchange. Binance has faced heightened scrutiny across various jurisdictions, including the United States and Nigeria. These regulatory challenges underscore the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation globally, with authorities increasingly focusing on ensuring compliance and consumer protection within the burgeoning crypto industry.Binance’s decision to cease support for Tron-based USDC and the impending regulatory blockade in the Philippines highlights the complex regulatory environment shaping the cryptocurrency landscape. As the industry matures, exchanges and blockchain projects must navigate regulatory requirements to maintain operational integrity and ensure compliance with evolving standards.

Is Nigeria Strong-Arming Binance?

Of course, Nigeria might do well to welcome the crypto industry to the country, which will help jumpstart a financial services industry and contribute to the national coffers. Notably, after Gambaryan and Anjarwalla’s arrest, a Binance spokesperson said that Nigeria was “not yet” one of its top markets, though the country, with a population of more than 200 million people, holds “extraordinary potential and we hope to continue to invest there.”

The SEC and Terra (LUNA) Case Continues to Evolve - Here are the Latest Developments - Bitcoin Sistemi


The highly anticipated civil lawsuit between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Terra (LUNA) altcoin developer Terraform Labs began today in a court in Manhattan.
The courtroom was noticeably less crowded than in previous hearings, and all participants wore suits, indicating the seriousness of the case.


The day began with jury selection, a process in which each side takes turns vetting potential jurors. The initial pool was comprised predominantly of women, a surprising development attributed to the court clerk's first day on the job. The final jury consists of three men and six women, mostly minorities. It was noteworthy that none of the selected jury members had cryptocurrency.
After the jury was selected, opening statements were made by both the SEC and defense teams. The SEC's argument mirrored previous hearings, with “This is a case about fraud” and “This case is not about technology” in its opening and closing sentences.






The defense quoted directly from an interview with Do Kwon and said, “Failure does not mean fraud.” Advocates strongly objected to the SEC's distortion of the facts.
Judge Rakoff set the ground rules early, stating that the hearing was expected to last two weeks and that only four-word objections would be allowed. A minor disagreement arose over how to refer to Do Kwon's absence, with the judge questioning whether saying “he is overseas and unavailable” would invite the jury to make assumptions. The defense accepted this statement. It is known that Kwon is currently in Montenegro after serving time in prison for a fake passport.


The trial will continue tomorrow and the world will be watching this landmark case closely.

Bitcoin Believer From 2018 Nails It: Is He Right About $150,000? - Benzinga

Thomas Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, took a bullish stance on Bitcoin BTC/USD in 2018. His position seems prescient in light of today’s market.What Happened: Lee’s central argument rested on the potential of Bitcoin to become a mainstream store of value. The Wall Street strategist envisioned a future where Bitcoin captures even a small fraction (1%) of the global value currently parked in traditional assets. This, he calculated, could translate to a price surge of Bitcoin to $150,000 per coin.Fast-forward to 2024, Bitcoin surged past the $70,000 mark. The spike underscores the cryptocurrency’s growing acceptance and integration into the financial landscape.The size of the crypto market is akin to the GDP of some of the world’s largest economies, Lee said. Lee’s foresight into the integration of cryptocurrencies within the broader financial system and their evolving role in investment portfolios will be a topic of interest at the upcoming Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 19. Also Read: NFTs Get Divided: New Standard Promises Fractional OwnershipWhy It Matters: Lee’s comparison has only become more valid over time. The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies are continually expanding, drawing in more institutional investors and Wall Street attention.Furthermore, Lee emphasized cryptocurrency’s role as an uncorrelated asset class, providing “uncorrelated alpha” that makes it an attractive option for portfolio diversification. This characteristic has increasingly made crypto a staple in the investment strategies of individuals and institutions alike, seeking to hedge against volatility in traditional markets.As we approach Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 19, Lee’s analysis from 2018 serves as a foundational piece for discussions on the trajectory of digital assets.Read Next: Binance Executive Flees Nigeria To Avoid Tax Evasion ProsecutionImage generated using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Interesting Development at the Company in Russia to which Binance Transferred All its Operations - Bitcoin Sistemi


Russian cryptocurrency exchange CommEx, which previously acquired Binance's Russian business, announced that its activities will be phased out.
The closure process began with the suspension of new user registrations and the termination of asset transfers from Binance on March 25, 2024.


In an official announcement on its Telegram channel, CommEx stated that it has also stopped accepting deposits in both fiat and cryptocurrencies. The next phase of the closure will follow the expiration of futures trading later this week, followed by the suspension of new peer-to-peer listings on April 2. All existing peer-to-peer orders and listings will be automatically closed on April 5.

CommEx's spot market is planned to close on April 23. The final step in the phased closure will be the closure of the stock exchange's official website, which will become inaccessible to users as of May 10, 2024.





The reasons for the closure of the company were not disclosed.
As part of its efforts to fully exit Russia amid regulatory scrutiny, Binance sold its Russian business to CommEx last September, which was officially launched just before the sale was announced.

US Announces New Wave of Sanctions Including Some Cryptocurrency Companies - Bitcoin Sistemi


The US Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on several Russian financial services and technology players, including blockchain firm Atomyze, for their role in developing or providing services in cryptocurrencies aimed at evading sanctions against Russia related to the Ukraine war.
The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified 13 entities and two individuals in the latest round of sanctions. These sanctions target Russia's core financial infrastructure to prevent Russia from using the international financial system to further its Ukrainian war goals.


Five of these entities were identified by OFAC because they are owned or controlled by individuals currently sanctioned. Among the firms targeted was Atomyze, a fintech firm controlled by sanctioned Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin's Interros Holding investment group.
Atomyze was targeted for its work to tokenize precious metals and diamonds for Russian companies and its partnership with sanctioned Russian banks Rosbank and Sovcombank. Atomyze won Russia's first government license to issue and exchange digital financial assets in February 2022, just three weeks before Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In July 2022, Atomyze launched the first digital token backed by palladium produced by Nornickel, a sanctioned metal producer also controlled by Potanin.






Other companies placed on OFAC's list of specially designated nationals include fintech firm Lighthouse, which closed the first cash-backed Russian digital asset deal in June 2022. The Treasury said Lighthouse was working with Russia's sanctioned central bank and major sanctioned lenders VTB and Sberbank.
Other financial technology firms subject to OFAC sanctions include B-Crypto, Masterchain and Veb3 Technology. The sanctions generally prohibit US dollar transactions by the companies in question and the US financial system.

SEC Targets Ripple Labs: A $2 Billion XRP Lawsuit Bombshell Unveiled | Cryptoglobe


                                
On July 13, 2023, in the case of SEC v. Ripple Labs, Inc., document number 2023 WL 4507900 in the Southern District of New York, Judge Analisa Torres ruled in a summary judgment that while Ripple’s direct sales of XRP to institutional buyers were considered securities transactions, its sales on secondary trading platforms were not. The court also declined to grant summary judgment concerning allegations against Ripple executives Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen. The SEC had accused them of supporting Ripple’s purported violations, indicating that these claims must be resolved at trial (which is expected to start next month).



On March 22, 2024, James K. Filan, an American attorney known for his insights into legal proceedings involving financial regulations, revealed on the social media platform X that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has confidentially submitted its initial brief related to remedies, along with supporting documentation, in a sealed format. The details of these documents remain inaccessible to the public as of now. However, Filan noted that versions of these documents, redacted to omit sensitive information, are expected to be made publicly available by no later than March 26, 2024, offering stakeholders and observers insight into the SEC’s proposed actions or penalties in the context of this legal matter.







A short time ago, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, issued a statement in reaction to James K. Filan’s announcement regarding the SEC’s remedies-related brief. According to Alderoty, when the SEC’s brief becomes public on March 26, 2024, it will reveal the regulatory body’s request for $2 billion in fines and penalties against Ripple. Alderoty criticized the SEC’s approach, accusing the regulator of relying on statements that are “false, mischaracterized, and designed to mislead.” He argued that the SEC’s actions are not in faithful application of the law but are instead aimed at punishing and intimidating Ripple as well as the broader industry.



Alderoty’s statement suggests that Ripple views the SEC’s demands as excessive and unfounded, reflecting a deeper issue of regulatory overreach. Ripple’s response to the SEC’s brief is scheduled for filing next month, indicating that Ripple intends to vigorously defend its position. Despite the contentious nature of the SEC’s claims, Alderoty expressed confidence in the judicial process, stating a trust in the court to handle the remedies phase with fairness.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In a fervent response to Stuart Alderoty’s disclosure about the SEC’s legal actions against Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s leadership for what he perceives as recurrent legal overreaches. Garlinghouse highlighted instances where judges have rebuked the SEC, citing a “gross abuse of power” in the DEBT Box case and a lack of “faithful allegiance to the law” in Ripple’s ongoing litigation. He pointedly criticized Gensler’s oversight in the case of SBFraud, emphasizing the disproportionality of the SEC’s $2 billion penalty request against Ripple, given the absence of any fraud or recklessness allegations.







Last week, Bloomberg News highlighted a significant judicial critique of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Judge Robert Shelby from the Salt Lake City federal district court in Utah. In an unusual judicial censure, the judge lambasted the SEC for what he deemed a glaring overstep of its regulatory authority in its lawsuit against Digital Licensing Inc., also known as DEBT Box. This critique was detailed in an 80-page ruling following the SEC’s allegations in July 2023 that DEBT Box had swindled investors out of around $49 million, actions that initially led to a court-ordered asset freeze and receivership at the urging of the SEC.



The core of the judge’s rebuke was directed at the SEC’s conduct throughout its case against the cryptocurrency firm, especially after it was discovered that the SEC might have made “materially false and misleading” statements to obtain the asset freeze. A significant point of contention was the SEC’s unfounded claim that DEBT Box was moving investor funds overseas, a claim later found to be speculative and partially based on a DEBT Box official’s video on YouTube.



Judge Shelby’s harsh critique underscored the SEC’s use of misrepresentations and misleading assertions, which he saw as detrimental to both the case against DEBT Box and the broader integrity of the legal process. Consequently, Shelby ordered the SEC to reimburse DEBT Box for its legal expenses and other costs, marking a notable reprimand of the regulatory agency’s actions.

Dogecoin Outpaces Cardano In Social Media Driven Bull Rally - DailyCoin


        
Dogecoin reclaimed a $26.5 billion market cap as the price towered to $0.186.



Outpacing Cardano for the 9th spot, DOGE builds a strong social presence.



Dogecoin’s founder Shibetoshi Nakamoto confesses his $1 million BTC wish.
Dogecoin (DOGE) embarked on a remarkable journey to claim the weekly heights of $0.186 today, following the leading digital asset Bitcoin (BTC), which broke through the $69,000 resistance barrier at 5 PM. Following the news, Dogecoin forced Cardano (ADA) to step aside for the 9th position by global crypto market cap.Tapping $69,290.35 as the highest point so far, Bitcoin swiftly retraced to trade slightly below $69K, while Dogecoin’s high price correlation with BTC significantly boosted the canine crypto. According to on-chain data by IntoTheBlock, the BTC vs. DOGE price correlation is at 0.91, but that’s not the only factor driving the double-digit run.The memecoin bonanza continues on crypto-friendly social media platforms, with Dogecoin mentions taking up the lion’s share of all memecurrency-related social activity. According to blockchain’s social data analytics firm LunarCrush, DOGE witnessed a tremendous surge in mentions last Saturday, with 21.68 million interactions.DOGE Creator Shares $1M Bitcoin DreamDuring Dogecoin’s run to $0.1727 on Saturday, the light-hearted DOGE Army shared memes with encouraging messages about DOGE’s growth and possible X Payments inclusion. Among prominent crypto community members was Dogecoin’s founder, Billy Markus.Alternatively known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, he tweeted his wish for Bitcoin to “go to 1 million dollars per coin while i am sleeping.” Applauded with laughs, the former IBM developer and computer virtuoso posted the message a day before Bitcoin (BTC) tacked on the bullish outbreak to claim a 7-day height at $69,290.35.As Bitcoin and Dogecoin are the two largest blockchains powered by a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus, the historically high price correlation is a key factor for DOGE’s bullish price momentum. On the other hand, many of Dogecoin’s bull runs are associated with Elon Musk’s X vision, as the community expects to see Dogecoin’s integration for P2P payments.On the Flipside
With a whopping trading volume of $5.22 billion over the past 24 hours, DOGE could face a strong resistance wall upwards due to selling orders piling up to $200 million.



In contrast to $140 million pending buys, this gap confirms the overbought condition on Dogecoin’s 1-day technical charts, pointing to a 69.07 Relative Strength Index (RSI).

This Bitcoin halving cycle might play out differently: 21Shares report - Crypto Briefing




This halving cycle might see an earlier rally compared to previous ones mainly due to the impact of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), said 21Shares in a recent report. According to 21Shares, the circumstances surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving appear to diverge from historical patterns. A combination of factors on the supply and demand side creates favorable supply-demand dynamics; as a result, the rally for this halving cycle might kick off earlier than in past instances.Notably, the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has opened the door for significant institutional investment, leading to a surge in demand and price growth, 21Shares noted. Additionally, traditional finance players like banks and wealth managers are starting to offer Bitcoin investment options to clients, further fueling the demand for BTC.“We’re starting to see the early innings of this with banks like Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch providing access to spot Bitcoin ETFs to select wealth management clients, while Morgan Stanley is allegedly evaluating the Bitcoin funds for its brokerage platform. Cetera is also amongst the first wealth managers to officially roll out a formal policy on BTC ETFs, signifying that a new wave of demand is starting to roll in.”While demand is strong, supply is decreasing, 21Shares highlighted. Existing Bitcoin holders are showing strong conviction by holding onto their coins, reducing the circulating supply. The firm also pointed to the fact that less Bitcoin is being held on exchanges, making it less liquid and available for purchase.“Although the supply they [long-term holders] hold declined by 4% from 14.9M to 14.29M, the supply held by short-term holders has surged by over 33%, rising from nearly 2.3M to 3.07M. This showcases the balancing act between the two cohorts, which usually takes place at the start of a bull market post-halving, but now has emerged earlier due to the exogenous ETF demand, resulting in a near-neutralizing market force,” wrote 21Shares.
“This scenario would coincide with BTC’s exchange balance hitting a five-year low, reaching 2.3M,” added the team.These factors, coupled with the reduction of new Bitcoin created following the upcoming halving, potentially make supply more tightening.To analyze Bitcoin’s market sentiment and compare them to historical trends, 21Shares used two technical metrics: Market-Value-to-Realized-Value (MVRV) and Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL).Currently, the MVRV Z-Score is around 3, lower than the 6 observed in February 2021 (a market peak). 21Shares key takeaways are Bitcoin might not be at its peak valuation yet compared to 2021. However, the MVRV is higher than historical averages for periods leading up to halving events, which was 1.07 on average in the last 3 cycles.Similar to MVRV, NUPL suggests investors haven’t reached peak greed levels. Currently, NUPL is around 0.6, which is lower than the 0.7 observed before the 2021 price surge to $60,000. Compared to prior halving cycles, the current NUPL suggests a growing bull market.In a word, both MVRV and NUPL suggest this halving cycle might be different with a potential earlier price surge due to ETF inflows bringing in new institutional investors. However, despite the bullish signs, the report acknowledges the possibility of short-term price corrections.As noted by 21Shares, historically, it took Bitcoin (BTC) around 172 days to surpass its previous all-time high (ATH) and 308 days to reach a new cycle peak. However, Bitcoin already set a new ATH earlier this month, contrasting with previous cycles where it traded at an average of 40%-50% below its ATH in the weeks leading up to the halving.“…the exogenous demand stemming from the ETF inflows could very well set a new precedent of growth during this cycle unlike previous ones, evident by Bitcoin’s impressive performance that broke its all-time high (ATH) before the halving,” wrote 21Shares.

The London Stock Exchange (LSE), home to leading blue-chip stocks, will debut Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on May 28, according to the exchange’s notice released today. The latest move comes after the exchange’s announcement that it would start accepting applications for crypto ETNs in the second quarter of this year.Companies interested in listing their Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs on the LSE’s new market can start submitting their applications on April 8, the LSE confirmed.With the set launch date, issuers will have time to meet listing requirements and prepare necessary documents, including a prospectus that needs approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the LSE noted. The exchange’s goal is to allow the maximum number of issuers to participate on the first day.To be considered for the initial offering, issuers must submit a detailed letter and a draft base prospectus by 15 April, demonstrating their compliance with the requirements outlined in the Crypto ETN factsheet. The FCA’s approval of these prospectuses is mandatory for ETNs to be listed on both the Main Market and the Official List.The LSE made it clear that issuers who do not meet the necessary criteria or miss the submission and approval deadlines will not be able to participate in the launch of the LSE’s Crypto ETN market.Like exchange-traded funds (ETFs), ETNs also offer exposure to a basket of assets. However, these two differ in structure. An ETF is like a basket of stocks or other holdings that you partly own. An ETN is more like an unsecured debt note issued by a bank. The bank uses the proceeds to invest in assets that track a specific index. The value of the ETN reflects the performance of those assets.When you buy an ETF share, you’re acquiring a portion of the underlying assets while buying an ETN means loaning your money to the bank in exchange for a note that promises a return based on the underlying index.Under FCA regulations, the upcoming Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs will be restricted to “professional investors” only. This means credit institutions and investment firms authorized to operate in financial markets will be the only ones able to participate, while retail investors are excluded.A bid to increase profits?According to a recent report from Bloomberg, the LSE is facing challenges that threaten its position as a leading financial hub. The number of companies listed on the LSE has fallen dramatically, with 2023 seeing the worst year for IPOs since 2009. Moreover, trading activity on the LSE has shrunk significantly compared to pre-crisis levels.The report added that the LSE had fallen behind global rival exchanges. Several factors contributed to the struggle, including a shift in investor preferences, competition from other exchanges, and the regulatory landscape.With increasing institutional investor interest, the digital asset market presents a booming opportunity for the LSE. If the exchange can create a regulated and secure environment for digital assets, this will attract investment and help the UK maintain its edge in the digital asset economy.

Crypto Investors Pull Back: $942 Million Leaves Investment Products After Market Correction, $XRP and $DOT See Inflows | Cryptoglobe


                                
Cryptocurrency investment products saw outflows totaling $942 million over the past week, after seven weeks of inflows that totaled more than $12 billion amid “hesitancy” among investors that came as a result of a recent cryptocurrency market correction.



According to CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows report, trading volumes in exchange-traded products (ETPs) remained high over the past week at $28 billion, a figure that represents two-thirds of the volumes seen in the prior week, after a price correction saw the total assets under management of these products drop by $10 billion to $88 billion.



The report notably details that Bitcoin-focused investment products suffered $904 million of outflows, while Ethereum-focused products saw $34.2 million of outflows. Altcoins including Solana and Cardano also saw outflows of $5.6 million and $3.7 million respectively, with multi-asset products seeing $7.3 million of outflows.



Notably, investment products offering exposure to XRP saw $1.2 million of inflows, while those offering exposure to Polkadot ($DOT) saw $5 million of inflows.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

As CryptoGlobe reported, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds experienced record net outflows over the past week amid market uncertainty, with the price of Bitcoin dropping from a new all-time high above the $73,000 mark to a low around $61,000 before recovering.



In the past week alone, a staggering $888 million bid farewell to these funds, marking the longest run of net outflows to date. This new record surpasses the previous four-day streak set just a couple of months ago in January. Monday, March 18th, stood out as a particularly grim day, with Grayscale’s GBTC bearing the brunt of the outflow onslaught.



Last Friday, Coinbase Research shed light on a potential source of selling pressure that could be influencing the spot Bitcoin ETF market. The bankruptcy estate of Genesis Global is reportedly gearing up to sell a substantial chunk of GBTC shares, separate from the shares pledged as collateral for a loan from Gemini Earn users.



While the dots have yet to be officially connected, the timing of the significant changes in GBTC shares outstanding is certainly raising eyebrows.

                        Suspected South Korean crypto fraudsters allegedly fooled a wealthy financier into parting with over $4.1 million, the nation’s police force said on March 25.Per Chosun Ilbo, officers in Busan’s Haeundae District arrested a “group of people in their 20s and 30s.”Police think the group “defrauded a financier in his 60s” by convincing him that he would receive 70% profits on his investment.South Korean ‘Crypto Fraudsters’ Said Profits Would Materialize ‘in a Month’
The group of suspects were arrested on charges of aiding and abetting fraud.Officers said that the group approached the financier in September 2022. Between the same month and December 2022, police said, the group convinced the alleged victim to make six separate payments.They also told the financier that he could expect to receive his profits in just four weeks, police said.Group Used Fake Documents, Police Claim
The group allegedly told the man that he should capitalize on “a boom time for crypto.” Police said the suspects “forged balance certificate files” to make it look like they were holding around $15 million worth of tokens.The reality, police said, was that the group “barely had any virtual currency in their trading accounts.”The group, police claimed, also sought to win the man’s confidence by using an accomplice to pose as a rich real estate agent working in Seoul’s affluent Gangnam District.The accomplice pretended to sign a $3 million contract with the group, supposedly entrusting them with his money.This contract also proved to be “forged,” police spokespeople explained.Fraud Cases Rise as Crypto Booms
South Korean crypto fraudsters are becoming increasingly active in the crypto-keen nation.

                        The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is now readying a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for retail and wholesale use, according to a Central Bank of UAE (CBUAE) announcement on Saturday.The national bank kicked off its digital dirham implementation strategy during a signing event on March 23 with R3 and G42 Cloud, companies that will serve as the digital currency’s infrastructure and technology providers.Implementing A UAE CBDC
R3 is a major CBDC tech developer that’s been involved with numerous Bank of International Settlements (BIS) projects. Meanwhile, G42 Cloud is part of the AI holding company G42, which agreed to cooperate with OpenAI on financial services technology in October.“As part of the UAE’s digital transformation, CBDC will help address the pain points of domestic and cross-border payments, enhance financial inclusion, and the move towards a cashless society,” read the CBUAE’s weekend statement.The first phase of UAE CBDC implementation marks one of nine initiatives in the CBUAE’s Financial Infrastructure Transformation (FIT) Programme. It also features three “pillars” intended for construction over the next 12 to 15 months.The first is the soft launch of mBridge, which will help the bank facilitate real-time cross-border transactions to settle international trades. Last month, the central bank completed its very first cross-border transaction using the digital dirham and Chinese digital yuan, valued at $13.6 million, through mBridge.After that, the bank will begin proof of concept work on CBDC bridges with India, whose Reserve Bank is making technological advances surrounding the privacy of its own developing CBDC. Finally, the bank will begin proof of concept work around domestic CBDC use cases, including retail and wholesale payments.Why CBUAE Wants A Digital Dirham
Aside from strengthening the nation’s payment infrastructure, CBUAE claims it will prepare the country for a potential “tokenized” world in the future, where normal people interact with blockchain-based tokens for financial and non-financial purposes.“CBDC will accelerate our digitalization journey and promote financial inclusion,” said CBUAE Governor H.E. Khaled Mohamed Balama. “We look forward to exploring the opportunities that CBDC will bring to the wider economy and society.”Last month, Bridge Tower Capital and Deus X launched a $250 million joint venture to build digital asset infrastructure in the UAE. The venture, BridgeTower Middle East, promotes institutional crypto adoption across the region.

NFT market bleeds as BAYC, CryptoPunks fall: What now? - AMBCrypto



NFT sales volume has steadily declined since the beginning of March.
This has impacted the values of Blue-Chip NFTs.

According to NFTGo’s data, the decline in non-fungible token (NFT) sales volume this month has pushed the Blue-Chip NFT Index to a 30-day low.
Blue-chips are NFT collections considered to be high-quality and have a high potential for future growth. They are often characterized by their high floor price, strong community, and potential for future utility. 
NFT projects such as CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club [BAYC], CryptoKitties, and Milady make this list. 
The Blue-Chip Index tracks the performance of these digital assets by weighting their market capitalization to determine their performance. 
When this index climbs, it indicates that the values of top NFT collections are rising. Conversely, when it declines, these NFTs are declining in performance. 
Data from NFTGo showed that the index has declined by 26% since the 11th of March, suggesting a drop in the performance of top NFT collections in the past two weeks.
Source: NFTGo
Top collections lose their shine, but there is a silver lining
Ranked by market capitalization, CryptoPunks, and BAYC are the top two leading NFT projects. 
Per NFTGo’s data, the CryptoPunks collection has a market capitalization of 506,000 ETH, while BAYC trails behind with a market capitalization of 136,000 ETH. 
A look at CryptoPunks’ floor price showed a steady drop since the beginning of March. 
As of this writing, an NFT from the CryptoPunks’ collection could be obtained for an average floor price of 49.75 ETH, worth around $172,000. At the beginning of the month, this went for $197,000.
Source: NFT Floor Price
Traders have taken advantage of the drop in CryptoPunks’ floor price, as the collection has seen more sales in the past 24 days than in the first two months of the year. 
According to CryptoSlam’s data, CryptoPunks’ sales volume so far this month has totaled $56 million, surpassing February’s $21 million by 166% and January’s $33 million by 70%.
Regarding BAYC, its floor price has also trended downward since the beginning of the month. Data from NFT Floor Price showed that this has since fallen by 40%. 
At press time, an NFT from the BAYC collection could be acquired for $45,000.

Following a similar trend, the month so far has also witnessed a sharp rise in BAYC’s sales volume. In the past 24 days, this has totaled $36 million, exceeding February’s $21 million by 71%.

Bitcoin starts week off with a bang, surges to $71,000 | Cryptopolitan

Boom! Bitcoin just exploded back over the $70,000 mark, recovering from a week’s slump with a swagger only Bitcoin can pull off. The king of cryptocurrencies, not quite comfortable below seven-oh, made a jump from around $67,000 all the way to a $71,000 on March 25. And just like that, at press time, it’s priced at $71,009, flexing a 9% gain in the past 24 hours. Talk about making a comeback! The Rollercoaster Ride: Bitcoin’s Recent Ups and DownsJust when skeptics like Jim Cramer and his buddies started showing off their “I told you so” banners, my girl Bitcoin flipped the script. After a dizzying dive to $60,771, caused by a frosty reception to spot BTC ETFs, she bounced back, shushing naysayers with a 9% surge. Last week was kind of bleak, what with investors pulling a whole $942 million out of the crypto market faster than you can say “Satoshi.”CoinShares blamed Bitcoin’s price dip, which shaved $10 billion off total assets under management, though they still remained at $88 billion. Amid this withdrawal drama, Bitcoin bore the brunt and bled like $904 million. Meanwhile, the short-bitcoin crowd also backed off slightly, withdrawing about $3.7 million all in all. But it didn’t end there. Genesis was aggressively offloading GBTC shares as if they were going out of style, hinting at the pressure points behind Bitcoin’s ETF exodus. The Metrics: A Tale of ResurgenceMeanwhile as I dug deeper, a sudden spike in the “Age Consumed” metric caught my eye. This measure of how long BTC that has been stored quickly went up to 162.89 million on March 23, the highest level in two years. Transaction volumes spiked, showing us a network with renewed energy and potential for further surges.On the altcoin front, things have heated up too. Last week saw a $16 million influx into altcoins, with Polkadot, Avalanche, and Litecoin on the top of the list. This much increase in activity hasn’t gone unnoticed, because the altcoins outshone Bitcoin in the weekly charts. BNB, Dogecoin, and Toncoin also had impressive gains, outpacing Bitcoin’s relatively modest rise. Despite this, the total crypto market cap is still nursing its wounds, lingering at $1.19 trillion, far away from its peak.Experts foresee a potential altseason happening any time now, though Bitcoin’s dominance at 51.77% and a lukewarm Altcoin Season Index score suggest we’re not quite there yet. So, there you have it. Bitcoin is thriving, flipping the script on skeptics.

Is Bitcoin’s pre-halving retrace over? 52K BTC accumulated on Sunday alone

Bitcoin’s pre-halving retrace may already be over following one of the largest accumulation days in years, which saw Bitcoin reclaiming the $71,000 price level.On March 25, blockchain analytics firm Santiment reported that Bitcoin just “caught traders off guard” with a rebound as “key stakeholders” had a huge accumulation day over the weekend. Wallets, which it terms ‘sharks’ and ‘whales’ holding between 10 and 10,000 coins, accumulated 51,959 BTC on March 24 worth around $3.4 billion at the time, the firm revealed. It added that this equates to 0.263% of the entire currently available supply being accumulated in one day.As the Bitcoin halving approaches, three weeks away on or around April 19, “it would be unsurprising to see these wallets continue to grow, resulting in a positive impact on crypto-wide market caps,” it noted. Source: SantimentCrypto analysts were concerned about a more sizeable pre-halving retrace, assuming that history would rhyme with previous market cycles. However, BTC only fell around 17% from its March 14 all-time high of $73,738, dipping to $61,494 on March 20, according to CoinGecko. Technical analyst ‘Rekt Capital’ said that if this ends up being the end of the pre-halving retrace, Bitcoin will have almost equaled the 2020 pre-halving retrace.“Bitcoin pulled back -18% in this cycle whereas BTC retraced just over -19% in 2020,” he noted. Source: Rekt CapitalThe analyst had previously predicted that this pre-halving retrace “would more likely be on the shallower side than on the deeper side” and could also be much shorter than has otherwise been the case historically.Related: Trading Bitcoin’s halving: 3 traders share their thoughtsReporting on market volatility and last week’s dip on March 25, crypto research firm Kaiko, revealed that after an analysis of buy and sell orders, “selling intensified following the U.S. market close.”It concluded that “liquidity in the cryptocurrency market is not only fragmented across exchanges but also across trading pairs.”BTC was trading up 5.2% on the day at $70,252 at the time of writing after hitting an intraday high of $71,000 in late trading on March 25.

Optimism (OP) Price Surges 10%: More Gains Ahead?


Optimism (OP) price noted a 10% rally in the past 24 hours, and on a technical level, it is poised for further rally.
However, considering the broader market cues, OP might end up correcting by 15%. Here is why.
Optimism Faces Bearish Pressure
Optimism price, trading at $3.78 at the time of writing, is reeling from a 10.81% rally observed in the last 24 hours. In the short-term timeframe, this marked considerable profits for investors, preparing for further rise, which likely may not come.
The reason is that the recent rally intensified the selling pressure as profits surged. This can be noted in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The 7-day MVRV ratio gauges investors’ profit/loss on assets bought in the last week.
Optimism’s MVRV at 10.16% suggests recent buyers’ profits are up 10.16%, likely to sell, signaling a potential downturn. MVRV between 3% and 9% signifies a danger zone for OP, hinting at potential corrections.

Furthermore, a major resistance in the path of a rally is the 95 million OP that investors bought. This supply was purchased within the $3.87 and $4.85 range, amounting to $361 million.

 Optimism price might find difficulty in turning this entire supply profitable owing to the potential of selling at the hands of investors. This would result in corrections as OP would fail to breach the key $4 resistance level.
OP Price Prediction: What if Not a 20% Rally?
Optimism price will likely fall back to $3.40 if the aforementioned conditions end up being true. The market would subsequently cool down, and if the broader bearish cues weight upon OP, the altcoin could end up declining to $3.20.

However, the Golden Cross being observed on the 4-hour chart is the first in nearly two months. The golden cross occurs in when the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crosses above a 200-day EMA, indicating a potential bullish trend reversal in the market.

The last time this occurred, Optimism’s price ended up rallying by nearly 20%. A similar rise this time around would send OP to $4.50, invalidating the bearish thesis and flipping $4 into support.

Pixelmon CEO bets on fractionalized NFTs for its huge comeback

Crypto project Pixelmon, once dubbed the “worst NFT project ever,” — is turning to fractionalized nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to make its return from the dead. First launched in February 2021, the Pixelmon project became an instant sensation for all the wrong reasons, explained the project’s now-CEO Giulio Xiloyannis in an interview with Cointelegraph. Source: ZachXBTThe project was launched on Feb. 25 of that year by a 19-year-old developer who promised to deliver a Pokemon-esque game where people could collect, trade, train and battle monsters called Pixelmon.However, the project became the laughingstock of the crypto world after raising $70 million in Ether (ETH) at the time, only to reveal 68 “questionable” NFT characters upon launch, including “Kevin” — an awkward-looking character that became the mascot of what was later described as the “worst NFT project ever.” Kevin is the most famous NFT of the original Pixelmon project. Source: PixelmonXiloyannis said when hswooped in to acquire the Pixelmon project in May 2022, he knew immediately that all of the artwork would need to be redone if the team were to revive the project and make something of it for its community. The only NFT that wouldn’t be redone was Kevin, which Xiloyannis described as a symbol of crypto something and shouldn’t be altered. “Yes he’s a funny meme, but he's the symbol that nothing ever dies in blockchain — that there is this resilience in the industry. That’s why we kept him as a symbol and that’s why we keep nurturing him.”Fractionalizing the intellectual property of NFTsXiloyannis is aware of how the term “fractionalized NFT IP” could be confusing to many but says the reality of it is relatively simple once it’s broken down. He pointed to Pokemon as an example of Pixelmon fitting into the seemingly complex cross-section of blockchain gaming, NFTs, and intellectual property rights. “Imagine if Nintendo had minted 100 NFTs of Pikachu in the 90s, and by owning one of them, you had a 1% right to royalties from Pikachu’s usage,” he said. “Every time it gets used on a shirt, on a mug, or a purchase of a skin in-game, you receive royalties on-chain paid to your account equal to 1% of the total royalties of Pikachu.”Unlike other NFT-based blockchain games, which use the NFT to enforce “gated” access to the game, the soon-to-be-released Pixelmon will be completely free to play, something that Xilyoannis believes holds the key to real adoption. Kevin is the only original NFT to keep its spot in the new version of the game. Source: OpenSeaBy owning a Pixelmon NFT, holders are entitled to royalties whenever the monster’s likeness is used outside of the game, much in a similar way to how royalties would be paid to the owner of a hypothetical Pikachu NFT every time it was emblazoned on a piece of merch or appeared in another show or game. The owners of Pixelmon NFTs are paid out in the form of the MON Protocols’ native MON token, which recently conducted a token pre-sale for holders and distributed select amounts of MON to holders based on the rarity of their NFT. There are still risks with IP ownershipWhile Xiloyannis said he “obviously” believes in the fractionalized IP model, he explained some of the potential risks that could come along with it for holders. Outside of the worst-case scenario — where the game simply doesn’t pick up any traction and NFT holders aren’t sufficiently reimbursed for their initial investment — Xiloyannis says the main problem lies in the distribution of attention. “Fractionalized IP ownership is ultimately a very, very subjective bet on which character is going to get love. You could end up purchasing an asset that gets used a lot in-game, but nobody spends money on outside of the game,” he explained. Ironically, Xiloyannis explained this is one of the reasons that the infamous “Kevin” could become one of the most sought-after NFTs in the collection, as holders try to make a bet on which character will be the most used. In the last month, several of the 119 available “OG Kevin” NFTs have sold for over 4 ETH (roughly $14,000).However, Xiloyannis warned that trying to pick the right monster could be like buying the NFT of an unpopular Pokemon before the game launches, only to later realize you didn’t select the right one.

The second-biggest risk Xiloyannis says, is the structure of the Pixelmon company itself. Built on a decentralized model of governance, Pixelmon — which is the perpetual licensee of all the IP rights — vets all licensing agreements through its community of holders. “Imagine a paradox scenario. Disney wants to put one of our characters inside the next Frozen movie and yet for some weird reason, our holders vote no. So there is some business risk there. And that business risk is essentially the biggest risk.”“In the end, we were convinced that letting early fans — the people who know what really made this great — control where this goes is probably better for the longevity of an IP than, you know, like, letting Netflix destroy The Witcher,” he added. Xiloyannis added that the community of Mon Protocol had grown significantly over the last eighteen months, currently boasting over 1 million wallets by March 2023.

Several crypto firms are looking to Pixelmon with growing optimism. On March 19, Blockchain game publisher Immutable launched a $100 million fund, choosing to allocate a significant portion of that capital to Pixelmon.Additionally, on Feb. 1, Pixelmon raised $8 million in a seed investment round, including firms such as Animoca Brands and Delphi Ventures.Magazine: Bitcoin ETFs make Coinbase a ‘honeypot’ for hackers and governments — Trezor CEO

This Is Where We Are In The Bitcoin Cycle Based On History


																How close is the current “Bitcoin cycle” to its bull market peak? History suggests it could be closer than most think.
Lead Glassnode analyst James Check showcased a chart on Monday comparing Bitcoin (BTC)’s price action over the last three years to that of other Bitcoin epochs after touching their respective all-time highs.
The Bitcoin Cycle Top, According To Glassnode
By Check’s measure, Bitcoin is effectively in the same position it was back in December 2020. At the time, the asset had just cracked its all-time high above $19,600 originally registered on December 12, 2017 – a 36-month wait – and would blast to $64,000 within just a few months.
Bitcoin is in a very similar position today: roughly 35 months after peaking in April 2021, the asset has rebounded to a high of $74,000 in March 2024. It even experienced a brief pullback last week as long-term holders took money off the table, reminiscent of 20% to 30% price pullbacks in prior cycles.
“The reason I use April is that’s when bear market sentiment set in, and thus recovery duration should be measured from that point,” explained Check.




Bitcoin’s price technically hit its highest price in 2021 at $69,000 in November. However, Glassnode has previously noted how Bitcoin’s true “peak” was in April 2021 from an on-chain behavioral perspective, when long-term holders began selling their coins en masse towards the top, much like in prior cycles.
Earlier this month, Check noted that this selloff is already underway this year. At the time. Long-term holders were distributing coins at a rate of 257,000 BTC per month, compared to 319,000 BTC and 836,000 BTC during major market expansions in 2019 and 2021 respectively.
Where Is Bitcoin Heading Next?
According to the analyst, even Bitcoin “shrimp” – investors with less than 1 BTC – are starting to sell their coins despite diligently accumulating and HODLing throughout the bear market.
Nevertheless, Check has expressed confidence in the state of the market, calling it one of the most “robust” bull markets in history. “Chopsolidation and some bull crabbing is the most probable outcome for weeks to months imho,” he tweeted on Sunday.
The analyst predicted this year that Bitcoin will top $250,000 per coin by the end of its current bull cycle.
Bitcoin’s price surged over 4% on Monday to more than $70,000, bouncing back from a pullback last week coupled by large outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Interestingly, outflows from the ETF don’t seem to have slowed on Monday, tallying $350 million.

Trader Says Shiba Inu May Be Repeating 2021 Bull Market Pattern, Updates Outlook on Solana and Dogecoin - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto strategist who accurately called the latest Bitcoin (BTC) correction says the top meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be mirroring a pattern last seen during the 2021 bull market.
Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 436,200 followers on the social media platform X that SHIB is in the process of retesting its weekly support level at $0.0000279.










According to the crypto strategist, SHIB retested the same price area in the last market cycle before witnessing rallies to its all-time high of $0.0000861.
“SHIB ultimately reached the blue resistance but rejected from it.
In late 2021, SHIB also wasn’t able to break blue resistance on the first attempt.
In fact, in late 2021 that blue resistance rejection forced SHIB to retest the orange level as new support (orange circle) before confirming further upside.
Right now, SHIB is in the process of a retest of the orange level once again.
Could history be repeating itself?
Source: Rekt Capital/X
At time of writing, SHIB is worth $0.000028.
Next up, the trader says the smart contract platform Solana (SOL) has flipped resistance at $175 into support.
“The Solana retest is still in progress and still successful.” 
Source: Rekt Capital/X
At time of writing, SOL is worth $185.24.
As for SHIB rival Dogecoin (DOGE), Rekt says the altcoin may be in the midst of printing a bullish continuation pattern on the weekly chart after breaching a multi-month diagonal resistance.
“Dogecoin perfectly retested the macro downtrend once again, rebounding +38% since the new macro uptrend has been fully confirmed. 
And if Dogecoin continues to hold these highs, it may very well develop a bull flag here.”

At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.173.

Anonymous Whales Transfer Half Trillion SHIB Tokens, Sparking Speculation of Coordinated Crypto Moves



                    
In the last 24 hours, an astonishing transfer of half a trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens by anonymous “whales” has caught the crypto community’s attention. 



The question on everyone’s mind is: What’s the strategy behind these massive movements, and is there a connection among these whales? Analyzing transaction data could shed some light on the matter.




Diving into the specifics, it appears that a handful of significant players are orchestrating these shifts, moving SHIB across various wallets and exchanges. 



A notable transaction includes the movement of 77.18 billion SHIB to a Coinbase wallet. 



Additionally, 205 billion SHIB were shuffled between different wallets, with a substantial 53.06 billion SHIB transfer directed to Robinhood’s wallet. 



The interconnectedness of these transactions remains unclear, yet the synchronicity hints at potential coordination.



The SHIB/USDT chart by TradingView highlights SHIB’s volatile price journey, currently hovering around the $0.000027 mark. 



After experiencing a sharp increase, SHIB seems to be in a minor retreat.

Presently, the critical support level is at $0.000019, which SHIB has successfully maintained above in recent times. 



This stability offers a glimmer of hope for the future. SHIB faces resistance at approximately the $0.000030 level. 




Surpassing this barrier could signal the beginning of another upward trend, potentially reaching new highs.



Looking forward, SHIB’s potential to capitalize on recent transactions and a general market shift towards bullishness could set the stage for a significant price increase. 



With the market showing signs of recovery after a recent downturn, SHIB’s trajectory might be poised for an upward movement, spurred on by the mysterious yet impactful actions of these anonymous whales.

Bitcoin (BTC) to Test ATH Again? Solana (SOL) Surge Isn't Stopping, Ethereum (ETH) Paints Symmetrical Triangle Pattern

The market saw BTC take a dip a few weeks ago, but things are looking up again. By looking at the latest chart, we can see signs that Bitcoin might be on its way to reaching its all-time high (ATH) again.The chart shows BTC's price making a U-turn after a dip. The current price hovers around $66,902, but just a while ago, it took a step back to about $53,324. This lower price is what we call a support level. The acceleration of the rally is what we are currently looking for.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewOn the other side, there is a price called "resistance." Think of it like a ceiling. Currently, that ceiling is near the highest price Bitcoin has ever reached, around $69,000. If Bitcoin can break through this ceiling, we could see it climbing to new highs.Bitcoin has been gaining strength, moving above the orange line, which is the average price over the past 100 days. This is a positive sign. The big black line below, that is, the average over 200 days, shows that the overall trend has been going up. If buyers keep showing strong interest, and more people want to buy BTC than sell it, we could see the price make a push for that $69,000 ceiling.Will Solana keep on moving? Solana has been climbing up in value while the market was in correction. As expected, many people keep on looking at the chart and asking if the rally is going to stop in the foreseeable future.Let’s dive into the numbers. Right now, Solana is at about $186.75. This is after a big jump from prices like $118.98, which was a strong "support" level. Support is like a floor, below which the price does not want to go. For Solana, the resistance is near $200. If the price breaks through this roof, it could go even higher, securing ATH potential.Looking at the trend, Solana has been moving up faster since passing the average line, which is the blue one in the middle. This line is like a guide, showing the average price over 50 days. Above it is where Solana is now, showing that it has solid energy to move up.For growth, if more people want to buy SOL than sell it, the price could push past $200 and move toward the next big resistance, maybe around $210 or more. But, remember, prices of cryptocurrencies like Solana may be like a roller coaster, with ups and downs.As for the future, if Solana can keep above the 50-day line (the blue one), and especially if it goes over $200, it looks like the surge will not stop anytime soon. Ethereum's promising pictureLately, Ethereum has been drawing a triangle on the price chart. This is not just any shape; it is what traders call a "symmetrical triangle pattern." When we see this pattern, it usually means that a big price move could happen soon, but we cannot tell if it will go up or down.Ethereum's price has been going up and down between two lines that are coming closer together. The top line is sloping down, and the bottom line is going up. Right now, Ethereum is around $3,442.7. The lines meet around the price of $3,000, which is a very important spot to watch.If ETH breaks above the top line, the price could shoot up, possibly going higher than the recent high of about $3,575. This is the "resistance" level. But, if the price drops below the bottom line, it could go down to around $2,918 or even lower to $2,534, which are "support" levels.So, what does this triangle tell us about what might happen with Ethereum's price? The triangle is getting tighter, and soon Ethereum will have to choose a direction. Unfortunately, we cannot tell whether it will be a move up or down.

Nigeria throws a brand new accusation at Binance as drama continues | Cryptopolitan

The heat just got turned up a notch between Nigeria and Binance, the crypto exchange that is seeing more drama than a daytime soap opera. This time, Nigeria’s slinging some serious mud, accusing Binance and a couple of its top dogs of dodging taxes, right as one of them pulled a Harry Houdini and “disappeared.” But let me take a quick breather. So like I said. Nigeria’s tax hawks, aka the Federal Inland Revenue Service, are pointing fingers at Binance for not doing their tax homework. They say the exchange hasn’t been playing by the rules, skipping out on value-added and corporation taxes like they’re going out of style. And let’s be real, when it comes to taxes, there’s no such thing as fashionably late. In any case, these charges are turning the drama dial up to eleven, especially since Nigeria is desperately trying to get out of an economic squeeze tighter than a pair of skinny jeans. Cryptocurrency: The Unofficial Naira Pricing GuideCryptocurrency exchanges were the new cool kids on the block, setting the price for Nigeria’s naira like they own the place. And Binance? It’s basically the prom king of crypto in Nigeria, guys. The crypto trade in there is literally booming louder than a bass drop. But of course Nigeria played hardball with crypto exchanges back last week, bagging two Binance execs for a four-week time-out. Trust me, it was not as funny as I am making it sound.Anyway, these Binance executives, Nadeem Anjarwalla and Tigran Gambaryan, initially thought they were just popping over for chats and tea. Instead, they got an extended stay courtesy of Nigeria, complete with confiscated passports. Talk about hospitality. Ha! But Anjarwalla, a man of mystery with UK and Kenyan passports, has somehow slipped through the cracks and ran for the hills. Though we all know that’s not really what happened. And apparently, there is an international manhunt going on right now for Anjarwalla, with the Interpol involved.A Tangled Web of Drama and DetentionNigeria’s National Security Adviser’s office threw in their two cents, saying Anjarwalla pulled a fast one with a “smuggled” passport. Yeah, that makes sense. As for the folks supposed to keep an eye on him? Yeah, they’re in hot water right now, facing the music for letting Anjarwalla disappear. And let me tell you this, Nigerian authorities are not known for their leniency.But Binance is still playing it cool, insisting they’re working with Nigerian authorities to untangle this mess. And just when you thought it couldn’t get any dumber, Nigeria’s accusing Binance of being a hotbed for shady deals, throwing around words like “money laundering” and “terrorism financing.” Of course no proof has hit the public eye yet.Binance, for its part, shut down naira transactions quickly. So, what have we learned from this rollercoaster of events? Well, for starters, the cryptocurrency industry is wilder than a night out in Vegas. Binance, caught in the crossfire, is juggling accusations, disappearing executives, and a community of users just looking to get their crypto fix.

Grayscale sees Ether ETF approvals despite SEC ‘lack of engagement’

Grayscale is confident that spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds will be approved in May despite recent “chatter” about the U.S. securities regulator’s “lack of engagement” with applicants.“I don’t think perceived lack of engagement from regulators should be indicative of one outcome or another [...] I personally am not deterred by it and believe the ETFs should be approved,” explained Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm in an X post on March 25. Source: Craig SalmSalm explained that in the months before spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, many of the issues common to spot Ether ETFs “were figured out” — such as details of creation and redemption procedures, cash and in-kind models, asset protection, loss prevention, and custody.“So in many ways, the SEC already has engaged and issuers simply have less to engage on this time," he said, adding: “The case is just as strong as it was for spot #Bitcoin ETFs.”However, ETF issuers looking to incorporate staking into their spot Ether ETFs would have an additional issue to “hash out” with the regulator. Those applicants include Ark 21Shares, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton.Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart recently shared concern over a “lack of engagement” from the SEC, and have since reduced their odds for an approved spot Ether in May to 25%.In a March 25 post on X, Balchunas said it was a “pessimistic 25%," adding the lack of engagement seems to be “purposeful” as opposed to “procrastination.” Related: Pundits worry SEC’s Ethereum probe could be used to hold back ETFsHowever, Salm said the recent approval of Ether Futures ETFs and regulation of those products as commodity futures put the spot Ether ETFs in a strong position to be approved as futures and spot products have a “high correlation.”A similar conclusion was reached by Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal and Brian Quintenz, a former commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week.BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and Hashdex are among the spot Ether ETF applicants vying for SEC approval.The SEC must decide on VanEck’s application by May 23 and analysts predict all applicants will learn their fate on that date.Magazine: ‘Am I sorry?

Here's How Much $100 In Bitcoin Could Be Worth In 2030 If Cathie Wood's New Price Target Is Reached - Benzinga

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood is among the prominent voices calling for the price of leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin BTC/USD to trade higher in the coming years.Wood recently announced a new projected price target for Bitcoin in 2030. Speaking at a recent conference, Wood said Bitcoin could hit a price of $3.8 million by the year 2030. The new estimate, which is ahead of her previous bullish price target of $1.48 million, comes based on institutional adoption.Here's a look at how a small investment in Bitcoin today could increase over time based on her bullish take.Following Wood Into Bitcoin: With Bitcoin hitting all-time highs in 2024, investors could be reluctant to invest in the assets as it soars.Here's a look at how much a small investment today could be worth if Wood's price target comes true, based on a price of $70,600.24 for Bitcoin at the time of writing.Bear Case, $257,500: $100 today would be worth $360.50Base Case, $682,000: $100 today would be worth $954.80Bull Case, $1.48 million: $100 today would be worth $2,072.00New Bull Case, $3.8 million: $100 today would be worth $5,320.00As you can see, a small investment would turn into a sizable return if Wood's base or bullish predictions come true. Even the bearish price target hitting would more than double the investment from today.While there's no guarantee that any of the price targets will hit, the exercise shows how a small investment in cryptocurrency could add up over time.Related Link: EXCLUSIVE: Why Does Cathie Wood Think Bitcoin Is Going To $1 Million — What Does She Know That We Don't?What Happened: Bitcoin soared in price over the last year, hitting several new all-time highs in 2024.Wood saw Bitcoin hitting new highs going forward and raised her bullish case to $3.8 million for the cryptocurrency in 2030.Wood's Ark Fund was also one of several companies to have a Bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC with its Ark 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB. The Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong inflows and are breaking records for new ETFs."With this institutional green light that the SEC has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we've done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you," Wood said.Adding $2.3 million to the $1.5 million leads to a new price target of $3.8 million for 2030 based on institutional investors allocating 5% of their portfolio to Bitcoin.In its Big Ideas 2023, Ark Invest shared a base case price target of Bitcoin of $682,000, a bull case of $1.48 million and a bear case of $257,500.The approval of the Bitcoin ETFs led to Wood saying in an interview that "the probability of the bull case has increased."What Benzinga Readers Think: Benzinga polled its audience on X, formerly known as Twitter, asking "Cathie Wood says Bitcoin could skyrocket to $3.8M by 2030 thanks to ‘Institutional Green Light.' Do you Agree?"The results were as follows:Yes: 25.2%No: 60.1%Maybe: 14.7%Along with believing in Bitcoin and having strong future price targets, Wood has put her money where her mouth is with the launch of the Bitcoin ETF and investing in companies exposed to the cryptocurrency sector.The flagship Ark Innovation ETF ARKK counts cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase Holdings COIN as its top holding, representing 10% of assets. The fund also has Block Inc SQ and Robinhood Markets HOOD as top 10 holdings, representing 6.9% and 4.4% of assets respectively. Both companies have exposure to cryptocurrency.Read Next: EXCLUSIVE: Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High: Here's When Benzinga Readers Think $100K Milestone Could Be ReachedPhoto: Cathie Wood, Courtesy Ark Invest; Bitcoin, via Shutterstock

AVAX Soars 9% As Avalanche And Chainlink Announce Partnership For Global Asset Circulation


                            According to a recent announcement from blockchain platform Avalanche (AVAX), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) has partnered with Chainlink (LINK) Labs to explore the potential of on-chain digital assets for global movement and settlement. 
Using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), the collaboration aims to connect the Avalanche and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains to enable uninterrupted delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement of tokenized assets across networks in multiple currencies.
Tokenized Asset Transaction Across Avalanche And Ethereum Using Chainlink
ANZ, a provider of banking products and services to millions of customers in nearly 30 markets, has reportedly taken an unusual approach to exploring the world of on-chain digital assets. 
By leveraging Chainlink’s CCIP, ANZ is validating how customers can access, trade, and settle tokenized assets across multiple networks and currencies using Delivery vs. Payment. This approach aims to improve settlement efficiency and risk management for digital assets that fall under the classification of “securities” and their transactions.

According to Avalanche, Chainlink’s CCIP has been “crucial” in abstracting the complexities of moving tokenized assets across various blockchains, ensuring “atomic” cross-chain Delivery vs. Payment settlement. 
Notably, within the collaboration, ANZ simulated a transaction where a customer used ANZ’s Digital Asset Services (DAS) portal to purchase tokenized ANZ-issued New Zealand dollar stablecoins (NZ$DC) on Avalanche.  
Subsequently, the customer purchased tokenized Australian nature-based assets issued as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), denominated in tokenized ANZ-issued Australian dollar stablecoins (A$DC), on Ethereum. 
Furthermore, ANZ facilitated the FX conversion between the two currencies, while CCIP provided the necessary infrastructure to transfer tokens and data between Ethereum and Avalanche.
ANZ Harnesses Avalanche’s Evergreen Subnet
Monday’s announcement also revealed that ANZ used its Avalanche Evergreen Subnet for the project, leveraging its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, permissioning, and custom gas token features. 
The Evergreen Subnet allowed ANZ to explore new use cases and business models using customizable networks like Avalanche.
ANZ’s collaboration with Chainlink and Avalanche showcases how traditional financial institutions embrace blockchain technology to enhance capital markets. 
Ultimately, Avalanche revealed that the initial results of the test transactions were promising, and the initiative could change how the financial services industry approaches tokenized assets. 
The next steps include deploying the solution on blockchain mainnets and extending the workflows to include communication between different blockchain networks for different use cases.
AVAX Nears 22-Month High 
At the time of writing, Avalanche’s token AVAX has been on a steady uptrend, resulting in a remarkable increase of over 60% in the last 30 days. Currently, the token is trading at $58.31, just below its 22-month high of $65 set on Monday the 18th.
Within the last 24 hours, AVAX experienced a 9% increase after the announcement of the collaboration with Chainlink and ANZ Group. This surge allowed the token to break through the $55 resistance level. However, the $60 level is expected to be another obstacle that could lead to a consolidation period between $55 and $60 should the bullish momentum fade.

Further demonstrating the interest in AVAX, the token’s trading volume in the last 24 hours reached $1,135,122,192, indicating a significant increase of 127.20% compared to the previous day.

Crypto Funds Hit Record $1B Weekly Outflows on BTC Price Scare - DailyCoin


        
Crypto funds saw record outflows last week.



CoinShares has attributed the apparent shift in market sentiment to jitters following Bitcoin’s price correction.



Despite the broader trend of outflows, a basket of altcoins managed to fare well.
Following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., significantly high investor demand has largely led to record inflows for crypto funds. Last week, however, this demand appeared to dwindle amid concerns about Bitcoin price action, ending a record-breaking run of inflows.$1B Outflow Breaks 7-Week StreakLast week, crypto funds saw record outflows totaling $942 million, according to CoinShares’ most recent fund flows report. The net weekly outflows ended a seven-week streak of inflows that had seen crypto funds record a whopping $12.3 billion, far more than the $10.6 billion recorded for the whole of 2021 at the peak of the last bull market cycle.CoinShares suggested that last week’s record net weekly outflows came amid jitters over Bitcoin’s price action. The asset had quickly retreated below $61,000 after clinching new all-time highs above $74,000."We believe the recent price correction led to hesitancy from investors, leading to much lower inflows into new ETF issuers in the US," CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill wrote.Last week, the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs saw a record five days of net outflows, only able to rake in $1.1 billion in inflows. All the while, Grayscale’s GBTC continued to bleed heavily, with outflows totaling $2 billion. For context, these funds had recorded over $3 billion in inflows the week before, far outpacing about $1.2 billion in outflows from GBTC.Table showing crypto fund flows by countrySource: CoinSharesBeyond the U.S., crypto funds in Sweden, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Germany also saw net outflows of $37 million, $25 million, $35 million, and $4 million, respectively. Brazil and Canada were the only regions to buck the trend, with net inflows totaling $9 million and $8.4 million, respectively. Looking specifically at how funds tied to different assets fared, Bitcoin funds unsurprisingly saw the largest net outflows totaling $904 million. Funds tied to Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano also suffered net outflows totaling $34 million, $5.6 million, and $3.7 million, respectively.In a twist suggesting capital rotation to smaller cap assets, other altcoins fared better, with net inflows totaling $16 million. Notable mentions in this category include Polkadot, Avalanche, and Litecoin, with $5 million, $2.9 million, and $2 million, respectively.Read this for more on recent Bitcoin ETF flows:Bitcoin ETFs End Week in Net Outflows Amid BTC PullbackNigeria’s crackdown on Binance has taken a new turn.

SEC Declares Binance A 'Threat', Imposes Access Restrictions On Philippine Users | Bitcoinist.com


								The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a significant regulatory step by blocking local access to Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. 
According to a release issued by the regulator on Monday, the SEC’s decision was based on Binance’s failure to obtain the necessary license from the commission to operate as an investment and trading platform. 
Binance’s Website And Services Blocked 
In its March 12 meeting, the SEC approved filing a formal request with the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to assist in blocking Binance’s website and related web pages. 

The SEC said Binance was offering investment and trading services without the required license and allegedly posed a “threat” to the safety of Filipino investors’ funds. SEC Chairman Emilio Aquino emphasized the importance of protecting the interests of investors in the request sent to the NTC. Aquino states:
The SEC has identified the aforementioned platform and concluded that the public’s continued access to these websites/apps poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing  Filipinos.
With an average daily trading volume of $65 billion and support for over 402 cryptocurrencies, Binance has gained a substantial user base of more than 183 million members in the Asian country, according to the regulator.
However, the SEC emphasized that Binance has not obtained the necessary license to solicit investments from the public or operate a securities exchange. Consequently, the SEC issued a public warning against investing in or using Binance’s services. 
The commission has been actively exploring the possibility of blocking Binance’s website and online presence in the Philippines since November 2023. However, due to the “sizable operations” of Binance, the SEC has allowed sufficient time for investors to transition their portfolios toward authorized investment products and platforms.
CommEX To Close Operations Following Binance Acquisition
CommEX, the exchange that acquired Binance’s Russia business in September, has announced its decision to shut down. As per the company’s statement on its website, the delisting process will commence on May 10, rendering users unable to access any content associated with the exchange. However, a series of steps will be implemented, leading to the closure.
Effective March 25, 2024, CommEX will stop new user registrations, asset transfers from Binance, and fiat and cryptocurrency deposit services. Then, on March 28, the exchange will stop opening positions for simple futures and futures trading and only allow users to close existing positions.

More changes will follow: Starting April 2, 2024, P2P services will prohibit merchants from creating new advertisements and prevent users from creating new orders; the system will automatically close existing P2P orders and advertising services.
Trading pairs for Simple Futures and Futures Trading will be delisted on April 18, prompting users to close all open positions to avoid automatic settlements. In addition, the spot market will be closed on April 23rd, automatically canceling all spot orders and disabling the Convert feature.
Finally, on May 10, 2024, the official website of CommEX will be delisted, resulting in the unavailability of any content related to the exchange.

Roger Ver Dismisses Adam Back’s Invitation to Return to Bitcoin, Stands Firm on BCH - Decrypt

Despite a public invitation to return to the Bitcoin community, early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver is sticking with Bitcoin Cash (BCH)—and says layer-2 blockchains are off the mark.Blockstream CEO and early Bitcoin developer Adam Back extended an olive branch to Ver after the latter’s book was published. In “Hijacking Bitcoin: The Hidden History of BTC,” Ver asserts that the original vision of Bitcoin has been corrupted. Ver spoke with Decrypt about the current state of Bitcoin Cash and his response to Back—and he's not going back.“The software development has been captured by a small group of insiders who completely inverted the original design,” he told Decrypt.The layer-2 debate embodies a philosophical divide between BTC and BCH. Bitcoiners believe that L2 solutions help the chain scale, whereas BCH enthusiasts believe those so-called solutions are centralized solutions to problems that can be better solved by incorporating bigger blocks into the original network. On the other hand, bigger blocks are disliked by small miners, as they require more power and lead to more corporate interests in the space.Both sides claim to support the original vision of Bitcoin, meanwhile, as laid out by pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.In his invitation, Beck urged Ver to give L2s a chance. Ver remained skeptical.“These 'second layers' are either centralized systems or they don’t work reliably,” Ver told Decrypt, “This is especially true for Adam Back's Liquid Network, on which his company takes every single transaction fee.”Despite the evolution of the cryptocurrency market since the Bitcoin Cash fork in 2017, Ver maintains that “BCH remains the truest representation of Satoshi’s vision.”Beyond the monetary aspect, Roger Ver seems to see himself as an orthodox when it comes to following Satoshi’s guidelines. This has also been the case for those behind Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV), in turn a BCH fork promoted by Craig Wright that also claims to be the only one following Nakamoto’s original plan.Rivalries are perhaps less important today than they were back in 2017, but the maxis within each camp seem to feel the differences among them are still too big to reach common ground. Decrypt asked Roger Ver if he saw any chance of both communities collaborating in the future, and he seemed to advocate letting the market decide."Once people wake up and realize that the development of BTC has been captured, and they realize that second layers have failed to scale Bitcoin, my hope is that people will recognize BCH is an excellent alternative, is technically superior, and can be both digital gold and digital cash at the same time," Ver said.What aspects of Bitcoin have been compromised? “The book explains the details,” he replied.Ver is probably the most notable leading voice in the BCH community, but he emphasized the decentralized nature of the network and the community when asked about the future roadmap for the token.“There is no CEO of Bitcoin Cash,” he told Decrypt. “I don’t find this question very relevant to myself.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

'Notcoin' Game to End Mining on April 1-When Is the NOT Token Airdrop? - Decrypt

Following a glitch-like teaser earlier today, Notcoin confirmed that it will end the "mining phase" of the game on April 1. But the "glitch" has created more questions than it's answered: Will April 1 be the day of the airdrop that Notcoin players have been waiting for? Or is this the Notcoin team building up for an April Fools' joke on their vast, 30 million-strong player base?Notcoin is a viral clicker game that’s had millions of Telegram users tapping a graphic of a coin on their phone screen in order to earn in-game currency. Initially, it wasn’t clear whether the in-game coins would ever be exchangeable for a real cryptocurrency—but the team recently confirmed that an airdrop is indeed on the way via The Open Network (TON).Players who logged into the Notcoin game on Monday were greeted with a strange, glitch-like graphic that briefly said “7 days” before disappearing.The team also shared a post in the Notcoin community channel with a clip from "Avengers Endgame" (revisiting a moment from "Guardians of the Galaxy") and a note saying “The mining phase ends on April 1.” The post continues on to thank members of the Notcoin community, in the game’s typically cryptic Notcoin fashion, for being a part of the ride so far."The team built the app, but it is you who’ve seen something," the message reads. "Something that is not fit to what one might expect. Absurd, but makes sense. That’s you who got it. That’s all you guys. Me and all the contributors are thankful for every single day and night building it for you, with you."While none of the messaging has given clarity around when the token will launch, a Notcoin representative confirmed to Decrypt’s GG that the airdrop will occur within the next two weeks. And although the mining phase is coming to an end, the game isn’t finished. More information will be released about the next phase of Notcoin once the mining phase ends.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.
