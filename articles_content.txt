There is a consistent daily increase in unique addresses, indicating sustained user interest and adoption of the OP Mainnet.

The steady rise in daily unique active addresses is a strong network health indicator. 
More unique addresses interact with the OP Mainnet, suggesting a growing user base and increased network activity. This growth can lead to higher network value, as user adoption is a critical factor in a token’s success and value.
Daily Transactions
The analysis of daily transactions is crucial for understanding the network’s activity levels. High transaction volumes indicate robust network usage and engagement, which are positive signs of network vitality.
Daily transactions exhibit significant volatility, with substantial changes in the number of transactions from one day to the next.

Between June 1 and June 10, OP Mainnet saw an increase of 53,778 transactions (from 487,984 to 541,762). This represents a marked improvement in daily activity, reflecting increased user engagement or significant network events driving higher transaction volumes.

The fundamental outlook for Optimism remains bullish. Despite Bitcoin’s price drop to $67,000, the Optimism token has not experienced another sharp decline today and has maintained its range. 
A breakout below the $2.05 level could signal a significant continued decline. Well, if the price holds above this level and Bitcoin recovers to $70,000, Optimism could trade back at $2.30 to $2.40 in the mid-term.

Warning from the EU for Bitcoin (BTC) and These Altcoins! - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Decrypt, the latest report published by the EU Homeland Security Innovation Center wrote that the Bitcoin Lightning Network and other second-layer solutions could be used as potential tools in criminal activities.
The EU report Mimblewimble made comparisons with other encryption technologies, such as token mixers and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash, noting that these technologies, apart from the Bitcoin Lightning Network, can also be used by criminals to hide data.


The report also targeted cryptocurrency mixers like Tornado Cash and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero, Zcash, Grin and Dash.
The report also touched on Mimblewimble, the cryptographic protocol used by cryptocurrencies such as Grin, Beam, and Litecoin (LTC).






“ Cryptocurrency mixers such as the Bitcoin Lightning Network, Tornado Cash, and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash can be misused as potential tools in criminal activities.
Apart from these, Mimblewimble, a cryptographic protocol adopted by digital currencies such as Grin, Beam and Litecoin, is also defined as a significant obstacle in monitoring cryptocurrency transactions.
“In this regard, the EU is concerned that these technologies create difficulties for law enforcement by hiding transaction data.”

While the EU report emphasizes the need for regulatory measures to reduce the risks associated with privacy-oriented cryptocurrency technologies, it points out that these regulations may have a deterrent feature for criminals.

Dormant Bitcoin whale awakes, turns $30M into $535M in 5 years


    A 5.5-year dormant Bitcoin (BTC) whale became active on June 11, moving 8,000 BTC to a Binance address. This Bitcoin investor would realize over $500 million in profits if selling these coins at current prices.



Notably, the Bitcoin wallet address ‘1FMbcnYvvccZ6hR324cFRpn1QX9TCkqtAe‘ acquired the 8,000 BTC at a dollar-cost average of $3,810, Lookonchain reported. This would result in a theoretical $30 million investment that the page says occurred on December 6, 2018.



As developed, the dormant Bitcoin whale woke up after 5.5 years and sent the whole balance to Binance. Usually, sending cryptocurrencies to an exchange shows an intention to sell or, in this case, to realize a 5-year profit.







At the prices by the time of Lookonchain‘s post on X, the 8,000 BTC stack was worth $535 million.







Dormant Bitcoin whale acquisition history



Finbold went one step further and looked into the acquisition history of this dormant Bitcoin whale, crossing it with price.



In particular, ‘1FMbcnYvvccZ6hR324cFRpn1QX9TCkqtAe’ first received 6,800 BTC on November 28, 2018, at $3,754 per coin. The whale added 1,000 BTC on December 5 at $3,487 and 200 BTC on March 13, 2019.

Moving all the coins now signals a bearish bias from this particular whale, which could affect overall market perception.



Analysts have spotted high volatility signals for this week, ahead of the FOMC meeting and interest rate decision, while Bitcoin’s low network activity measured by on-chain transactions volume and spot trading volume has also suggested a lack of interest in BTC besides the speculative demand through derivatives like futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Interestingly, the network saw all-time high fees of $195 per transaction due to UTXO consolidation operations from OKX this weekend. This has raised concerns about the network’s accessibility while macroeconomics imposes a challenge for risk assets, including for the cryptocurrency, stock, and finance markets.



In closing, Bitcoin trades at $66,300 by press time, close to its all-time high of $73,805 and 20 times higher than when the dormant whale acquired its 8,000 BTC.

May Inflation Report Clashes With Fed Meeting: Traders Brace For Volatile Wednesday - SPDR Gold Trust (ARCA:GLD) - Benzinga

For the first time since June 2020, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be released on the same day as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.This sets up a potentially volatile Wednesday for financial markets.Following three consecutive months of higher-than-expected inflation readings in the first quarter of 2024, April's data showed an easing in price pressures, aligning with forecasts. The new CPI data will thus be crucial in determining if inflationary pressures are continuing to decline, which could support hopes of reaching the Federal Reserve's 2% target.This heightens the significance of the May inflation report, due from the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday.The outcome of the May inflation report will also heavily influence Fed Chair Jerome Powell's stance during his press conference on the same day.A softer inflation reading could bolster the case for interest rate cuts down the road this year, while a higher-than-expected number might necessitate a more aggressive approach, probably reiterating the need to keep rates high for longer. Market participants currently estimate a 50-50 chance of a rate cut in September, with expectations of only one fully priced rate cut by year-end.Read Also: Fed Meeting Preview: Economists Predict Steady Rates In June, Fewer Cuts AheadMay Inflation Report Preview: What Do Economists Expect?
The consensus among economists, as compiled by Econoday, forecasts that the headline annual inflation rate will hold steady at 3.4%. 



On a monthly basis, the overall CPI is expected to advance by 0.1%, down from April’s 0.3% rise.



The core annual inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is projected to remain at 3.6%, , with a monthly advance of 0.3%, unchanged from April. 
Goldman Sachs economist Manuel Abecasis expects a slower pace of inflation in sectors such as consumer electronics and personal care, which should reflect in the May data. He also predicts a continued rise in car insurance prices, albeit at a slower pace, and stable rent and Owner’s Equivalent Rent (OER) inflation rates.“Going forward, we expect monthly core CPI inflation to remain in the 0.2-0.3% range for the next few months before settling around 0.2% by end-2024. We forecast year-over-year core CPI inflation of 3.5% and core PCE inflation of 2.8% in December 2024,” Abecasis stated.Prominent veteran market analyst Ed Yardeni believes the May CPI report will confirm ongoing moderation in inflation. “The Cleveland Fed's Inflation Nowcasting model shows headline and core CPI rose 3.36% and 3.55% year-over-year in May, which would be the lowest annual core inflation reading since April 2021,” he noted. Yardeni also expects a decline in shelter inflation and used car prices, with hopes that other auto-related consumer prices will stabilize.Bank of America’s economist Michael Gapen sees the May report continuing the positive trend from April. “After averaging 0.4% month-over-month from January through March, inflation took a step in the right direction in April. We expect core and headline CPI at 0.3% and 0.1% month-over-month for May, respectively, keeping annual rates unchanged from April at 3.6% and 3.4%,” Gapen commented.Prior Market Reactions To The CPI ReportThe release of April's CPI report on May 15, 2024, triggered rallies across stocks, bonds, gold, and speculative assets.
The S&P 500, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, rose by 1.2% on that day. 



The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, monitored through the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, rallied 1.6%. 



Long-dated bond yield fell, pushing the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT up by 1.4%. 



Gold, tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust GLD, rose 1.3%. 



Bitcoin BTC/USD skyrocketed 7.4%, marking its strongest day in two months, the third strongest year to date. 



A measure of the dollar, as gauged by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF UUP, fell 0.7%, recording its worst 1-day performance since mid-December 2023.

Ethereum Whale Activity On The Rise Following Spot ETH ETF Approval ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ethereum (ETH) has been exhibiting signs of weakness, continuing its descent below the $4,000 mark this week. The daily price chart reveals a downward trend, with the cryptocurrency declining by approximately 5.89% over the past seven days. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including a broader market pullback led by Bitcoin.



Nevertheless, amidst this price drop, Ethereum whale activity has surged significantly following the approval of the spot ETH ETF last month. Over the weekend, Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst, highlighted this development, noting that Ethereum addresses holding 10,000 or more ETH have increased by 3% in the last three weeks, indicating a significant spike in buying pressure.







Technical analysts also believe ETH is poised for a potential surge. Notably, the cryptocurrency recently broke through its consolidation pattern resistance, spurred by the ETF approval news on May 20th. However, the initial market reaction seemed premature and fueled by rumors, leading to a subsequent consolidation phase.



In a post on TradingView, analyst RLinda noted that ETH is currently forming a consolidation pattern with the potential for an upward breakout.



“The candlestick patterns on W1, D1, and H4 form interesting bullish premises indicating that it is the buyer who is assembling a position with the aim of breaking the $3,830-$3,950 resistance with the aim of rallying and updating ATH.” She wrote.

&nbsp







However, some analysts urge caution. Analyst “Greatest Trader” from CryptoQuant warned that Ethereum’s decline might persist in the short term if market conditions do not improve. Despite ETH’s struggle to surpass the $4,000 mark, he noted that attention is now on the futures market participants’ behavior. He presented a chart showing that the 7-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, which measures the relative aggressiveness of buyers versus sellers, has declined sharply and has not risen above one.



“This trend suggests that the majority of futures traders have been selling Ethereum aggressively, either for speculative purposes or to realize profits. This significant drop in the metric is a bearish signal, suggesting that the current downward retracement could persist if this trend continues.” He stated.







ETH was trading at $3,473 at press time, reflecting a 4.95% drop over the past 24 hours. Notably, the coin’s price experienced a flash crash earlier on Tuesday, partially attributed to a whale dumping roughly 150,000 ETH worth $1.1 billion on Coinbase.

European law authorities raise concerns over privacy coins, Layer-2 networks and crypto mixers

The EU Innovation Hub for Internal Security has released its first comprehensive report on encryption, focusing significantly on crypto-related issues.The report, a collaboration between Europol, Eurojust, and other EU agencies, delves into how cryptocurrencies are impacting law enforcement efforts.It highlights the significant gaps in law enforcement’s ability to track and recover illicit digital assets moved via decentralized methods like privacy coins, layer-2 networks, and crypto mixers.Crypto and Law EnforcementAccording to the report, cryptocurrencies, which rely heavily on public-private key cryptography, pose unique challenges and opportunities for law enforcement.The report outlines how cryptocurrencies are increasingly used for laundering criminal proceeds, complicating efforts to trace illicit funds. The rise of technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and Layer-2 (L2) networks, which enhance privacy, may further obscure the origins and movements of these funds.The report said that currently, law enforcement can only recover funds moved via custodial wallets — where users do not hold their own private keys — by cooperating with exchanges and service providers to seize crypto suspected of criminal activity.This cooperation is crucial, given the stringent user identification measures (know-your-customer, or KYC) mandated by anti-money laundering regulations. However, illicit funds moved via decentralized wallets and addresses remain beyond the reach of law enforcement due to the enhanced privacy offered by these technologies.Technological Advancements and Data ObfuscationThe report highlighted several advancements that complicate tracking crypto transactions. Privacy coins like Monero obscure transaction details, presenting significant tracing challenges despite being less popular than Bitcoin among criminals.Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies such as Dash and Litecoin offer optional encryption features that enhance transaction obfuscation. Mimblewimble, a protocol used by Grin and Beam, hides transaction details and uses aggregate verification techniques.ZKPs, used by currencies like Zcash and mixing services like Tornado Cash, verify transactions without revealing details, posing substantial tracing challenges.Furthermore, L2 solutions like the Lightning Network for Bitcoin create payment channels that do not broadcast all transactions to the blockchain, complicating law enforcement tracking efforts.Future stepsThe report noted the paramount need for law enforcement to keep up with technological developments and emphasized that access to suspects’ private keys is critical for overcoming encryption challenges.The report also urged state agencies to enhance technical capabilities and foster closer collaboration with crypto exchanges and custodial wallet providers, which are essential for effectively tackling the misuse of digital assets for criminal purposes.The report called for continued research into “user-controlled” encryption and its impact on digital forensics and decryption capabilities. It also highlighted quantum computing’s potential to revolutionize cryptographic protocols and said that EU funding schemes are vital for supporting research projects to address these challenges.The report urged policymakers to prioritize funding to enhance law enforcement’s ability to counteract the misuse of cryptocurrencies.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Biggest Bank in the World Says Ethereum Is ‘Digital Oil,’ Bitcoin ‘Digital Gold’: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The world’s biggest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), is reportedly calling Bitcoin (BTC) “digital gold” and Ethereum (ETH) “digital oil.”
In a new report shared by Matthew Siegel, VanEck’s head of digital assets, the ICBC gives praise to the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap.










The report also says that market demand is strong for digital assets, pushing innovation in the sector.
“Market demand drives the continuous iteration of digital currencies.” 
The report draws comparisons between Bitcoin and gold while also saying the crypto king has added benefits.
“Bitcoin retains the scarcity similar to gold through mathematical consensus, while solving its problem of being difficult to divide, difficult to identify authenticity and inconvenient to carry. Its monetary attributes are gradually weakening, while its asset attributes are constantly strengthening.” 
In calling Ethereum “digital oil,” the report praises various characteristics of the top smart contract platform’s ecosystem. While ICBC highlights some of the network’s shortcomings, it also believes technological advances will resolve them over time.
“Ethereum has been continuously upgrading its technology in terms of security, scalability, and sustainability, providing technical power for the digital future… 
Ethereum introduces Turing completeness with its exclusive programming language (Solidity) and virtual machine (EVM), allowing developers to write and arrange for a variety of complex smart contracts and applications, providing a strong platform support for blockchain technology. Its flexibility has been widely recognized in the fields of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and is gradually extending to the physical infrastructure network (DePin). 
In essence, Ethereum’s Turing completeness enables it to execute any programming instructions under the premise of correct instructions and sufficient resources, but it also poses several practical problems… 
Looking ahead, Ethereum developers will continue to work on finding the Pareto optimum between sustainability, security and efficiency.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $66,502 at time of writing, down 5% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading for $3,464 at time of writing, down more than 6% on the day.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $10 billion market cap in the second half of the year


    The cryptocurrency market experienced volatile trading last week, starting on a high note only to reverse course by week’s end. Initially, optimism surged as several analysts predicted Bitcoin (BTC) would reach new highs. 



However, the release of robust U.S. job data on Friday altered the sentiment, resulting in a downturn in the crypto markets.



Despite this, several cryptocurrencies are approaching significant market cap milestones, including the notable $10 billion mark.







Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies likely to surpass this threshold. These predictions hinge not only on market conditions but also on the potential benefits of high supply inflation, which could lead to an increased market cap even if price movements remain minimal.



Polkadot (DOT)



Polkadot (DOT), currently trading at $6.34 with a market cap of $9.14 billion, is on track to hit a $10 billion market cap by year-end.



Despite recent market fluctuations, its ecosystem continues to grow, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $70,383  and key projects like Energy Web, Xcavate, and Phyken Network showcasing its expanding influence in the blockchain space.

Polkadot’s integration of Real-World Assets (RWAs) and the upcoming release of Polkadot 2.0 are clear indicators of its commitment to innovation and mass adoption.







The increasing adoption of Polkadot’s Software Development Kit (SDK) for asset tokenization and the positive outlook from industry experts like Michaël van de Poppe strengthen its market position. 



These strategic developments, along with Polkadot’s strong framework for asset tokenization, suggest substantial growth potential, making the $10 billion market cap a realistic target.



Chainlink (LINK)



Chainlink (LINK), currently trading at $14.87 with a market cap of $8.73 billion, has strong potential to reach a $10 billion market cap soon. 



Despite a recent 7.39% one-day decrease and trading 23% below its yearly high of $22.85, Chainlink’s innovative developments and growing ecosystem continue to drive investor confidence.



A recent collaboration with The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and major U.S. financial institutions like JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) and BNY Mellon underscores its potential.



Chainlink price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap



The successful pilot project, Smart NAV, demonstrated the use of Chainlink’s interoperability protocol CCIP to standardize and disseminate net asset value (NAV) data across blockchains. 



This project highlighted Chainlink’s role in enabling on-chain use cases such as tokenized funds and smart contracts. 



With such significant industry support and real-world applications, Chainlink is on track to achieve a $10 billion market cap.



It’s worth noting that despite being supported by several fundamentals, the possibility of the highlighted cryptocurrencies reaching the $10 billion mark will largely depend on market conditions.

Ethereum Buying Pressure Reaches Critical Level Amid Massive Whale Buying


																Institutional investors have been accumulating Ethereum at a rapid pace after the SEC’s recent approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that this accumulation trend has created buying pressure that could be the much-needed catalyst for Ethereum to break above the $4,000 price mark.
According to a social media post by Ali Martinez, the number of Ethereum addresses holding over 10,000 ETH tokens has increased by 3% in the last three weeks, showing a positive trend among large investors. 
Whales Accumulating Pushes Ethereum Buying Pressure
Speculation over ETF approvals and increasing institutional buy-in have helped fuel Ethereum’s price increase earlier this year. The first price surge occurred in February when multiple reports came out of the SEC potentially approving Spot Ethereum ETF applications after the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs.

	Related Reading


 This saw the price of Ethereum surging over 83% throughout the month to reach above $4,000 again for the first time since 2021. Similarly, court rulings in May, which increased the odds of Spot Ethereum ETF approval, pushed the price of ETH above $3,000 again. 
Now that the SEC has finally approved these spot ETF applications, institutional investors are taking the chance to load up their portfolios with Ethereum. According to Glassnode data, this accumulation, which has been going on for the past three weeks, has pushed the number of wallets holding over 10,000 ETH past 975 and steadily approaching 1,000 addresses. Furthermore, data shows that the number of ETH mega-whale addresses has steadily increased in the past 30 days, with the recent metric showing an addition of 15 whale addresses. 

On-chain data also reveals that social sentiment for ETH has stabilized after intense enthusiasm post-Spot Ethereum ETF approval. However, this hasn’t stopped the massive withdrawal from exchanges, leading Ethereum to become scarcer on centralized exchanges. This trend has now seen the Ethereum balance on centralized exchanges dropping below Bitcoin, even as Spot Bitcoin ETF wallets also accumulate Bitcoins. According to Glassnode data, less than 10.56% of Ethereum’s total supply is currently held on major exchanges.  
ETH Price Outlook: What’s Next After Critical Buying Pressure?
With whales doubling down on Ethereum, the buying pressure has reached a critical point. This surge of interest signals a very bullish outlook for Ethereum’s price in the coming months, although there could be short-term volatility. 

	Related Reading


At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,527 and has fallen 3.83% in the past 24 hours. While the increase in buying pressure is a good start, the bulls still have some work to do to push Ethereum’s price higher. The first major resistance wall is around $3,700, where 1.82 million addresses hold 1.8 million ETH.

Is This One of the Reasons for Today's Big Decline in Bitcoin? Here's the 535 Million Dollar Worth Transaction - Bitcoin Sistemi


Data provided by cryptocurrency analysis company Arkham reveals that a wallet that has been dormant for a long time has been carrying a large amount of Bitcoin.
According to data, a cryptocurrency wallet that has been dormant for 5.5 years without any movement moved 8,000 Bitcoins, which corresponds to approximately $ 535 million, at the time of writing.


The data shows that the BTC assets in question were distributed across a number of different cryptocurrency wallets, four of which belonged to Binance deposit addresses. The amount transferred to Binance was recorded as 1,416 BTC.
The giant whale wallet paid approximately $108 in fees for the transfer of the $535 million BTC in question.






The overall cryptocurrency market witnessed an unexpected decline today. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has decreased by approximately 4.57% in the last 24 hours. With the decline, the BTC price fell below $ 67,000 and is trading at $ 66,588 at the time of writing.
The general reason for the decrease is thought to be that both CPI and interest rate decision data will come from the USA tomorrow.

Bitcoin's Value Is ‘Many Multiples’ Above Its Current Price: Billionaire Investor Bill Miller - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsLegendary investor Bill Miller says he’s “still betting on Bitcoin,” which has ample room to rise despite currently trading close to all-time highs.In a Tuesday article, the billionaire argued that Bitcoin’s “intrinsic value” is “many multiples” of its market cap today and that the asset is at the center of a “secular shift around how humans think about capital and its governance.”“The promise of Bitcoin is simple,” Miller wrote. “Namely, that changes in someone’s purchasing power should not be controlled by an authority tied to the circumstances of one’s birth.”Given that its blockchain-based accounting is “far superior” to all fiat alternatives, the investor claimed Bitcoin’s $1.5 trillion market cap is a fraction of a percent of its total addressable market.Miller has been one of Bitcoin’s most vocal high-net-worth proponents for several years. In 2015, Miller Value Partners published “A Value Investor’s Case For Bitcoin,” which claimed Bitcoin “could have enormous upside if it catches on” as a store of value similar to gold, and captured the precious metal’s market cap. At the time, that model would have brought Bitcoin’s price to $314,000 per coin.Miller assigned just a 0.25% probability of this happening back then, but today he doesn’t find it so farfetched—especially in a fiat world fast approaching “a quadrillion dollars” of total capital.“Humans are notoriously bad at contextualizing the relevance and potential of new technologies,” he said.Miller’s track record suggests he has a knack for spotting good investments. During his time at Legg Mason, he’s known for investments that outperformed the stock market for fifteen straight years from 1991 to 2005. He also purchased Amazon (AMZN) stock at its IPO in 1997, which has exploded over 205,000% since.In 2022, Miller revealed that his portfolio was split 50/50 between both Amazon and Bitcoin—and that he was buying the latter asset with leverage.“I believe that continuing to ignore Bitcoin will serve those who do it over the next decade as well as it has over the past one—not well,” he concluded in his latest piece. “It’s still early.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Andrew Tate's $1M Solana Meme Coin Investment Causes Stir Amidst Facing Criminal Charges - Benzinga

Controversial influencer Andrew Tate has stirred up social media with his announcement of a $1 million investment in Solana meme coins, despite facing serious criminal charges.Tate, known for his provocative online presence, announced on Friday his plans to invest heavily in various Solana-based meme coins. This move has sparked a frenzy on social media, with followers promoting their meme coins for his potential investment.Don’t Miss:Tate’s investment claims, however, may be exaggerated. Evidence suggests that he has spent significantly less than the announced $1 million. This is not his first venture into the crypto world, as he previously expressed interest in investing in Bitcoin.Earlier this year, Tate claimed on an X post that he made $85 million on the last DeFi Bull Run on Pancake and prefaced it with telling his followers that as great as meme coins are, there are “genuinely technological useful or innovating blockchain coins”.Despite his ongoing legal troubles, including serious charges in Romania and a pending extradition request from British authorities, Tate’s bold crypto investment announcements have kept the public’s attention on him.His recent announcement to invest in various “junk” tokens is seen by some as a distraction from these legal issues, while also highlighting the unpredictable market influence of such popular figures.While some critics question the legitimacy of his claims, his public statements reflect a broader pattern of controversial actions designed to maintain public attention.Read Next:Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Just Don’t Call It Blockchain: Apple's New AI Privacy Tech Explained - Decrypt

Apple is taking a deep dive into AI with its new Apple Intelligence suite of features across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. While some requests will, with user permission, be routed to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a top exec says Apple's own AI services rely on a “blockchain-ish” model to ensure user privacy.But what does that really mean? Following Apple's keynote presentation, its Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi and SVP of Machine Learning and AI Strategy John Giannandrea took the stage for a press interview about the consumer tech giant’s big AI push, moderated by content creator Justine “iJustine” Ezarik.Asked how Apple would make sure its customer information remained private if it leaves their devices, Federighi explained that user requests sent to Apple servers are anonymized, as their IP addresses are masked and the server itself is prevented from keeping a log of information. On top of that, an image of the server software will be publicly shared so that it can be audited by independent security researchers, and user devices will only interact with servers with auditable software.“It’s a clever kind of blockchain-ish attestation log to make sure the iPhone will only trust the software that’s been publicly put out there,” Federighi said, adding that Apple will soon issue a white paper about its security model. “It’s a really extraordinary step up in terms of the level of trust you can place in server computing.”As the company dives deeper into AI and the personal data it uses to deliver its services, he added, “it’s essential that you can know that no one—not Apple, not anyone else—would have access to any of the information used to process your request.”One of Apple’s most prominent executives indeed said that the firm is using “blockchain-ish” tech—but Federighi did not say specifically that the firm is using an actual blockchain, and certainly didn’t say that the tech juggernaut is building on a decentralized model.Decrypt reached out to Apple to clarify Federighi’s comments, but did not immediately receive a response.What it meansApple shared some details in an extensive security blog post on Monday about Private Cloud Compute (PCC), which Apple designed to handle user requests. As Federighi noted, it anonymizes user requests and then relies on servers that use publicly auditable software to handle those AI needs.Apple calls that last point “Verifiable Transparency.” Sound familiar?In essence, Apple will make its software images public to prove that its system is secure. Then, it will build a check into the system to ensure that devices can only interact with servers that use software that’s been shared publicly for auditing purposes. And that system is built with cryptography.“This promise, too, is an enforceable guarantee: user devices will be willing to send data only to PCC nodes that can cryptographically attest to running publicly listed software,” the post reads, with a bullet point further emphasizing that Apple will be “publishing the measurements of all code running on PCC in an append-only and cryptographically tamper-proof transparency log.”Furthermore, the post adds: “Specifically, the user’s device will wrap its request payload key only to the public keys of those PCC nodes whose attested measurements match a software release in the public transparency log. And the same strict code signing technologies that prevent loading unauthorized software also ensure that all code on the PCC node is included in the attestation.”Public keys? Nodes? A “cryptographically tamper-proof transparency log,” of all things? It’s not difficult to understand why Federighi would call it a “blockchain-ish” approach. It’s also easy to see why crypto-natives are taking shots at Apple on social media for not actually calling it a blockchain when it apparently shares so many commonalities.“Say blockchains without saying blockchains,” tweeted Wei Dai, Research Partner at crypto investment firm 1KX, with a screenshot from the blog post.But while the Private Cloud Compute model is designed to be transparent and invites public scrutiny, Apple is not launching a decentralized network: It’s still ultimately running the show as a centralized player. There’s no decentralized consensus model in play, and users still ultimately have to trust what Apple is saying regarding its privacy mechanisms.“That’s not my read,” tweeted Riccardo “fluffypony” Spagni, founder of privacy coin Monero, in reply to Dai. “I think it’s more like a linked list, or actually more like [Github]. There’s no consensus mechanism here, there’s a central publisher.”“This isn’t a blockchain,” Spagni added in a further reply.However, Apple has been exploring the potential for blockchain tech. In a patent application filed in 2023 and published earlier this year, Apple sought to patent a “Distributed Network Management System“ that explicitly mentions the potential use of blockchain in some implementations. Elsewhere, a recently granted Apple patent describes a “decentralized ledger” used in the process of publishing media assets.Private Cloud Compute isn’t a blockchain, based on what we know so far. But Apple said in its security post that more details are forthcoming, and the firm doesn’t appear to have shut the door on potential use cases for blockchain tech. What’s here is “blockchain-ish,” at least, in the words of Craig Federighi—and that’s an interesting claim from Apple all the same.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

SushiSwap dissolves DAO, repositions as Sushi Labs with new council structure - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Decentralized exchange SushiSwap has rebranded as Sushi Labs, an autonomous company replacing the protocol’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), although the SushiSwap name will still be used for its DEX-focused operations.In a bid to address slowing growth and liquidity issues, SushiSwap has introduced a new business model under the name Sushi Labs. The revamp replaces the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with a “council structure” similar to that of derivatives protocol Synthetix.Sushi Labs will operate under four councils: the Sushi High Kitchen, the Treasury Council, the Grants Council, and the Ambassador Council. The High Kitchen, comprising six to eight members, will serve as the central governing body overseeing a multisig setup for transactions.Jared Grey, now Sushi Labs’ managing director, asserted that the new organizational structure, budget, and leveraging of successful products like Route Processor will help enhance liquidity on the Sushi DEX.
“Many attribute Sushi’s stagnated growth and AMM liquidity issues to LPs migrating to other DEXs and seeking better yield. However, with our newly established organizational structure, sufficient budget, and leveraging successful products like Route Processor, we have the tools to enhance liquidity on the Sushi DEX,” Grey explains.
The transition also involves a shift to a multitoken product suite, which Sushi claims will help distribute product costs and provide more reward opportunities for token holders.While the move has sparked debate and criticism for its centralized nature, with some community members accusing the protocol of a hostile takeover, Sushi maintains that the changes are necessary to address financial challenges and improve liquidity management.The decentralized exchange generated $1.62 million in fees in May 2023, a sharp decline compared to its performance during the previous bull cycle.

Could Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Lose Key Support Due to Selling?


Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price continues to show a drawdown in response to rapidly developing bearish market conditions.
The surge in selling and declining confidence among SHIB holders will potentially catalyze the correction.
Shiba Inu Investors Lose Optimism

Shiba Inu’s price could decline in the coming days as SHIB holders continue to sell their holdings. The total supply on the exchange has noted a sharp uptick, bringing it to a six-month high.
In the last 48 hours, the wallets across all exchanges have risen by more than 4.66 trillion SHIB. This $103 million worth of supply has been sold off by investors looking to secure whatever gains they have accumulated. The selling could also have been the result of investors offsetting their losses.

This sentiment to prevent further losses has also been extended to some of the most secure investors. Long-term holders known for their resilience have been moving their assets.

In the last few days, multiple spikes have been noted in the age-consumed metric. This metric calculates the total days lost by multiplying the total supply moved with the total number of days it has been since the last move.
Spikes in the same hint at large amounts of supplies or very old coins moving, both of which are bearish for the asset.

Thus, Shiba Inu’s price could be observed to be at a drawdown for these reasons.
SHIB Price Prediction: One Last Support

Shiba Inu’s price has already failed the breach of $0.00002584 and fallen out of the consolidation between this level and $0.00002267. The meme coin is now headed towards the critical support at $0.00002093, which has not been broken since April.
There is a chance of a drop below it, potentially sending SHIB to $0.00002000. This would mark a multi-month low for the asset.

But if Shiba Inu’s price bounces back from $0.00002093, it could recover slightly. This would result in SHIB’s continuing consolidation, also invalidating the bearish thesis.

Analysts Remain Optimistic Despite Large Ethereum Sell-Off


							

A massive $1.1 billion Ethereum dump was made by a wallet collecting ETH since November 2018.



Ethereum’s current market behavior is seen as a precursor to a bullish altcoin season.



Market sentiment remains optimistic with predictions of a $10k ETH in the current bull run.




An Ethereum whale transaction has captured the attention of the crypto community. A wallet, which had been accumulating Ethereum since November 11, 2018, executed a massive $1.1 billion sale, split into two transactions of 150,000 ETH each. The identity behind these transactions remains unknown, but the sheer size of the trade has sparked widespread discussion and analysis.







Despite this large-scale sell-off, market sentiment towards Ethereum and altcoins remains notably optimistic. Prominent voices in the crypto community, such as ParabolicPump, argue that Ethereum’s price movements are indicative of broader market trends. 



According to ParabolicPump, Ethereum’s price chart suggests the market is still within a bullish cycle that has yet to peak. The current live price of Ethereum stands at $3,532.80, reflecting a 3.77% decrease over the past 24 hours. However, this short-term dip has not dampened the long-term outlook.









Crypto analysts suggest that the current price action is intended to shake out weaker holders, and as the bull cycle continues, significant gains are anticipated. Ethereum has not yet reached new all-time highs in the current cycle, as highlighted by ParabolicPump, who projects that Ethereum’s price could reach $10,000. Reaching this milestone would likely spark more interest from retail investors, further driving the market.



This optimistic outlook extends beyond Ethereum to the altcoin space. Analysts believe that near the end of the cycle, altcoins will see their biggest price fluctuations. Known as “Altseason,” this period is marked by parabolic increases for numerous altcoins, propelled by the popularity of prominent cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.







The recent Ethereum sale and the ongoing bullish sentiment present a complex landscape for investors. While large whale movements can signal potential market volatility, the overarching narrative suggests continued growth.

This Is Why Bitcoin Could Rally Post-FOMC Meeting


Bitcoin’s price has consistently exhibited notable volatility around Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. 
Historical data from recent meetings indicates that Bitcoin tends to experience a drop in value before the FOMC’s interest rate decisions, followed by significant gains post-announcement.
Bitcoin Dips Before FOMC, Rallies Post Fed Decision

The Federal Open Market Committee is a branch of the Federal Reserve System responsible for overseeing the nation’s open market operations. The FOMC meetings are crucial events where key decisions on the interest rate at which banks lend to each other and monetary policy are made.
These meetings typically occur eight times a year and involve a thorough discussion of the US economy and the various factors influencing its performance.
On December 13, 2023, the FOMC decided to hold rates steady between 5.25% and 5.50%. Leading up to this meeting, Bitcoin’s price fell by 8.76%. However, after the announcement, Bitcoin surged by 22.07%. This pattern repeated on January 31, 2024, when the FOMC again held rates steady, causing a 4.55% drop in Bitcoin’s value before the meeting and a 26.34% increase afterward.

The trend continued on March 20, 2024, with Bitcoin dropping 11.82% before the FOMC meeting and rising 18.09% post-decision. Similarly, on May 1, 2024, Bitcoin saw a 12.69% decline before the rates were held steady and a 15.95% rise after the announcement.

Looking ahead to the upcoming FOMC meeting on June 12, 2024, Bitcoin has already dropped 8.25%. US Senators Elizabeth Warren, Jacky Rosen, and John Hickenlooper have urged the Federal Reserve to cut rates, citing the adverse effects of current monetary policy on inflation and the economy. 


“The Fed’s monetary policy is not helping to reduce inflation. Indeed, it is driving up housing and auto insurance costs—two of the key drivers of inflation—threatening the health of the economy and risking a recession that could push thousands of American workers out of their jobs,” the senators stated in their letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

Given the historical data, market watchers anticipate a potential rebound in Bitcoin’s price post-announcement. The consistent pattern suggests that regardless of the Fed’s decision, Bitcoin often recovers and even thrives after the initial uncertainty surrounding the FOMC meetings dissipates.
Understanding these trends can help investors make informed decisions, balancing the risks and opportunities presented by Bitcoin’s inherent volatility around major economic announcements.

New Crypto IEO To Watch - eTukTuk ($TUK) Listings Soon


This article was paid for*
One of the hottest crypto presales of 2024 – eTukTuk ($TUK) – is now in its final stages and could end soon. The presale has already raised over $3.4 million, a sign of its strong demand and the growing potential of green cryptocurrencies. 
eTukTuk’s play-to-earn game – inspired by Crazy Taxi – as well as its long-term goal of popularizing eTukTuks in developing nations such as Sri Lanka have caught the attention of smart money traders. 
A few popular YouTube trading experts such as Gain Trading Crypto have tipped eTukTuk as the next 100x cryptocurrency. 

VIDEO

Earn Rewards for Playing eTukTuk’s P2E Games
The eTukTuk project identifies renewable energy to be the need of the hour, with climate change and global warming becoming increasingly dire every year. For instance, UK-based NGO Christian Aid reported that extreme weather – caused by anthropogenic climate change – is costing $41 billion globally. 
eTukTuk has come up with a unique solution to combat this issue and raise awareness about the worsening crisis. 
It has launched play-to-earn games – now available on both Android and iOS devices – inspired by the popular Crazy Taxi game. Players can race their eTukTuks through the vibrant streets of Sri Lanka, win and earn free crypto in the form of additional $TUK tokens. 

Players can continue to unlock new cities, upgrade their vehicles and earn bonus rewards, simply by continuing to participate in the thrilling races. Additionally, investors can stake their $TUK holdings and earn passive income, currently at an APY of over 80%. 

However, its play-to-earn games are only a part of the broader eTukTuk solution. 
The project aims to create an EV movement in developing nations such as Sri Lanka by tackling common obstacles. For instance, it is creating charging stations in remote areas, ensuring that the eTukTuks become just as viable as the fossil fuel-based tuk-tuks that are prevalent in these nations. 
Similarly, eTukTuk is looking to launch its own Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs), a more cost-effective and sustainable alternative to the common tuk-tuks. 
eTukTuk Price Prediction From Experts
As previously mentioned, smart money traders are backing eTukTuk as one of the most important new crypto IEOs to watch, owing to its play-to-earn utility as well as its strong performance during the presale. 
In a recent video, popular trader Michael Wrubel – who has over 300k subscribers – claimed to be bullish on eTukTuk. 

VIDEO

Similarly, Cilinix Crypto tipped $TUK as an excellent long-term investment. 

VIDEO

eTukTuk could also be one of the cryptocurrencies that benefit significantly from Elon Musk and the upcoming US presidential elections. 
For instance, a recent report highlighted that Elon Musk could land an advisory role in the Trump administration. Despite Musk’s recent conservative leanings, he remains an avid supporter of renewable energy, especially EVs, considering his ownership of Tesla. 
Being one of the top green crypto presales, eTukTuk could witness a significant bounce in such a scenario. $TUK could even be one of the rare crypto tokens that could benefit from a Biden victory, considering the Democrat’s pro-renewable energy stance. 
Interested buyers looking to get into eTukTuk early have no time to lose, considering that its presale is now in its final stages. They can head to the eTukTuk website and use the over-the-counter widget to purchase the token.

US gov’t chasing USDT held on Binance after $1M pig-butchering scam


The US has launched a forfeiture complaint against almost $200,000 worth of tether (USDT) held on Binance in connection to pig-butchering scams that stole over $1 million. That’s according to documents filed in the District Court of Columbia.
The court claims that the USDT represents the proceeds of “wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, and money laundering conspiracy.” 
According to the documents submitted on June 7, an anonymous victim of two pig-butchering scams, reported to the police that they had lost roughly $1.1 million between January 2021 and December 2022. 
The victim first developed a romantic relationship with a scammer known as Eva Markus on Facebook Dating, believing they were an engineer and diamond mine owner. Markus convinced the victim her diamond mine had exploded and that she needed the funds to hire an attorney to return to America. The victim transferred more than $400,000.

The victim then started a second romantic relationship with another woman on Facebook Dating claiming to be called Lisa Warren. Warren claimed to invest in crypto and convinced the victim, who was looking to recoup their losses from Markus, to send her $55,000 in bitcoin as an investment.
The victim was then persuaded to sell their home and hand over the profits as a crypto investment, altogether sending roughly $600,000 in crypto. However, after some digging and recovering only $15,000 in funds, the victim realized they had been scammed and alerted the police. 
Binance froze USDT for FBI 
The bitcoin sent to Warren’s wallet address was used to track down the illicit funds. Authorities discovered funds from the Markus scam had been mostly cashed out but that roughly half of the funds lost to Warren remained intact. 
The FBI traced the crypto transactions to a Binance account held under the name Izuchukwu Henry Okolo. Binance discovered in November 2023 that Okolo had converted their bitcoin to 196,721 USDT. The exchange froze the funds and alerted the FBI who later seized them.
Binance has come under increased scrutiny after US regulators appointed legal firm Sullivan & Cromwell and forensic accounting expert Forensic Risk Alliance to monitor the exchange. The firms will check that Binance is adhering to money-laundering and sanction laws following its $4.3 billion settlement with the US government. 
The documents also disclose that criminals involved in the pig butchering scams may be victims themselves. The US has also found Okolo’s submitted claims about the nature of the seized USDT to be false.

Bitcoin Slips Under $67,000: Can BTC Rely On This Historical Support Again?


																Bitcoin has observed a plunge during the past day, taking the asset’s price under $67,000. Here’s the historical support level that the asset could visit next.
Bitcoin Is Now Not Far From The Short-Term Holder Realized Price
As analyst James Van Straten pointed out in a post on X, the Realized Price of the Bitcoin Short-Term Holders has been going up recently and currently sits around the $64,000 level.
The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain metric that keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor in the BTC market. This indicator is based on the “Realized Cap” model for the cryptocurrency.

	Related Reading


When the asset’s spot price is greater than the Realized Price, it means the investors are carrying some net unrealized profits right now. On the other hand, the coin’s value under the metric suggests the dominance of losses in the market.
In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of a specific sector segment is of interest: the Short-Term Holders (STHs). The STHs include all the investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days.
Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Realized Price of the Bitcoin STHs over the last few years:
The value of the indicator appears to have been going up in recent months | Source: @jvs_btc on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH Realized Price rapidly climbed during the rally towards the all-time high price (ATH) earlier in the year. This trend naturally makes sense, as the STHs represent the new investors in the market, who would have had to buy at higher prices as the asset climbed up, thus pushing the cohort’s average up.
Since BTC’s consolidation phase following the March ATH, the indicator’s uptrend has slowed, but its value is increasing nonetheless. After the latest increase, the metric has approached $64,000.
Now, what significance does the Realized Price of the STHs have? Historically, this indicator has taken turns acting as a major support and resistance line for the cryptocurrency.
During bullish periods, this metric can facilitate bottom formations for the cryptocurrency, thus keeping it above itself, while bearish trends generally witness the line acting as a barrier preventing the coin from escaping above it. Transitions beyond this level have generally reflected a flip trend for the coin.
This apparent pattern has held up likely because the STHs, being the relatively inexperienced hands, can be quite reactive. The cost basis is an important level for any investor, but this cohort, in particular, can be more likely to panic when a retest of their cost basis takes place.
When the sentiment in the market is bullish, the STHs could decide to buy more when the price drops to their average cost basis, believing the drawdown to be merely a “dip” opportunity. In bearish phases, though, they may react to such a retest by panic selling instead.

The chart shows that Bitcoin found support around this line during the crash at the end of April/start of May, potentially implying a bullish sentiment has continued to be dominant.
With BTC seeing a drop below $67,000 in the past day and the STH Realized Price closing in at $64,000, it will be interesting to see how a potential retest would play out this time.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,800, down over 3% in the past week.

Orbit Hacker Sends $32,000,000 Worth of Ethereum (ETH) to Tornado Cash: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								The hacker who attacked the decentralized cross-chain protocol Orbit Bridge in December is beginning to move the stolen crypto.
The digital asset de-anonymizing platform Arkham notes that the hacker moved 8,671 Ethereum (ETH) worth $32 million to a new address and is in the process of depositing the crypto stack into Tornado Cash, a controversial coin mixing service that facilitates anonymous digital asset transactions.










The exploiter purloined more than $100 million worth of crypto from Orbit Bridge in late December and still holds $66 million in ETH and over $20 million in the stablecoins DAI and USDT.
Orbit Bridge serves as a bridging service for Orbit Chain (ORC), a cross-chain platform focused on scalability.
Following the breach, the Orbit Chain team sent out notifications urging the hacker to negotiate by 10:00 AM on January 11th. The hacker did not respond, however, leading the project to offer up to $8 million to anyone who could provide information that would identify the hackers or recover the stolen funds.
Orbit Chain’s native token, ORC, is trading at $0.00669 at time of writing and is down more than 90% from its December price, according to CoinGecko.
The US sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022 for national security purposes. One of the project’s founders, Roman Storm, was arrested last year and slapped with charges related to allegedly laundering $1 billion in criminal proceeds, including hundreds of millions of dollars for the Lazarus Group, the sanctioned North Korean cybercriminal outfit.

Pendle, initially built on Ethereum (ETH), is a protocol that aims to tokenize yield by enabling markets for it on yield-bearing coins. It also allows users to earn a yield on their fixed assets.
PENDLE, the platform’s native token, can be used to earn rewards by those who provide liquidity to the protocol. Locking up PENDLE tokens can be done for up to two years and allows users to vote on governance proposals while also earning 3% of all the yield accrued by its yield-bearing tokens (YT).
Lookonchain also spotted a whale depositing $3.83 million worth of PENDLE to crypto exchange Binance early on Tuesday to take massive profits. The whale still holds over $21 million worth of PENDLE coins, according to the firm.
“A whale deposited 755K PENDLE ($3.83M) to Binance for profit…
The whale withdrew 5.02M PENDLE ($2.73M at the time) from Binance on Aug 18, 2023, when the price was $0.54.
He currently has 4.27M PENDLE ($21.7M) left, with a total profit of $22.8M (+834%)!”

Peter Schiff Issues Major Bitcoin Warning: ETFs Won't Save You


Gold bug Peter Schiff recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to warn Bitcoin pumpers that institutional exchange-traded fund (ETF) buyers are not going to save them.According to Schiff, this makes the cryptocurrency market "even more unstable" since he believes that all ETF buyers are future sellers. "In contrast, many spot buyers intend to hold their Bitcoin until it ultimately replaces fiat currencies," he added.  Earlier today, the price of the leading cryptocurrency dropped to an intraday low of $66,207, losing more than 5%. Last week, Bitcoin failed to break above the $72,000 level despite strong buying pressure due to stronger-than-anticipated US jobs data. As reported by U.Today, US-based spot Bitcoin ETF recorded its second-biggest inflows to date last Tuesday. However, Bitcoin's 19-day streak of uninterrupted inflows has now ended. On Monday, the ETF products saw nearly $65 million worth of outflows. BlackRock's IBIT failed to save the day with modest inflows of only $6.3 million. All eyes on the US macro data Bitcoin is expected to experience more volatility on Wednesday due to the upcoming consumer price index (CPI) report for May. The critical inflation reading will provide market participants with crucial clues about the Federal Reserve's future policy moves. Accelerating inflation figures will be another bearish headwind for Bitcoin (and vice versa). The Fed is also expected to announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday. However, it is unlikely to trigger more volatility since rates are widely expected to remain unchanged.

Anthony Scaramucci Says Bitcoin Can Hit $700K, Predicting Match To Gold - 'Could Bitcoin 10x In The Next 15 Years? I Believe It' - Benzinga

Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge Capital, has predicted that Bitcoin could potentially become a $500,000, even $700,000 asset, despite only 5% adoption in the U.S.In an interview with David Lin on June 7th, Scaramucci suggested that if Bitcoin continues to scale and adopt at the same pace as in the past decade, its value could reach unprecedented heights. He compared Bitcoin’s potential growth to that of gold, touting, “If gold is at $16 trillion and Bitcoin is at $1.5 trillion, could Bitcoin surge 10x in the next 15 years?”Scaramucci had previously spoken to CNBC last April about his $16 trillion market cap prediction for Bitcoin reminding viewers, no one who held onto the asset had lost money in the past 4 years.Don’t Miss:Scaramucci explained to Lin that in the digital world, people would accept a store of value if it meets certain criteria: scarcity, ease of use, and trustworthiness. He told David, “There's no reason why this can't be a $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 asset.”Scaramucci also noted that Bitcoin is currently tracking like a tech asset, similar to Nvidia and other major tech stocks. However, as it matures, it will start to exhibit properties similar to gold. He also mentioned that rate cuts by central banks could impact Bitcoin, as they expand market equity and provide relief in sectors like real estate.Last month, Scaramucci joined Benzinga’s PreMarket Prep Monday. When the topic of 5% adoption in the US surfaced, he said, “That’s akin to Web 1 in 1999. I would just tell you to look at the Web 1 volatility of stocks like Amazon, eBay, etcetera, back in 1999. As things adapt and scale (and I predict Bitcoin will scale), you will see a situation where Bitcoin has a billion users. The value of that network will be exponentially larger, and Bitcoin will be at $150,000.”While acknowledging gold’s 5,000-year history as a valuable asset, Scaramucci pointed out that gold isn’t as user-friendly or transportable as Bitcoin. He said, “I understand why people own gold. I understand the 5,000-year human commitment to gold, but it's just not as user-friendly, it's not as transportable as Bitcoin.”Read Next:

Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Teases Major Change For ADA - Here’s What We Know | Bitcoinist.com


								The Cardano Chang hard fork is finally within reach, promising historic changes for the blockchain. Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson, has teased significant updates and major changes set to take place for ADA. 
Cardano To Record Historic Moment With Chang Hard Fork
In an X (formerly Twitter) post on June 9, Hoskinson announced the imminent release of the highly anticipated Chang hard fork. The Cardano founder declared that June will be the month that the Cardano Node will reach 9.0, signaling the network’s readiness for the new hard fork. 

The Chang hard fork is an upgrade designed to empower the Cardano community with greater influence over the network’s governance. This update will grant ADA holders voting rights on proposals and introduce important tools and infrastructure to support the proposed governance changes, potentially enhancing the network’s decentralization and positively affecting the value of ADA. 
Hoskinson disclosed that the forthcoming upgrade was contingent on 70% of Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) installing the new node, after which the hard fork will transition Cardano into the “Age of Voltaire.” He emphasized the remarkable nature of this development, declaring the Chang hard fork to be the most significant milestone in the history of Cardano and the broader cryptocurrency industry. 
Hoskinson highlighted the major changes set to occur within the Cardano blockchain, noting that Cardano will transform into a decentralized civilization that will extend its reach to all parts of the world, attracting millions of residents. He expressed confidence that Cardano will have the most advanced blockchain governance system, annual budgets, treasury and the support and wisdom of its rapidly growing community to guide the ecosystem towards these changes. 
Reflecting on Cardano’s developmental journey throughout the years, Hoskinson expressed his pride in the Cardano community’s efforts and achievements over the past decade. He disclosed that the community has successfully transformed Cardano into a nation set to significantly impact the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. 
Moreover, he shared his optimism about the blockchain’s future, highlighting that Cardano brings hope to both the crypto industry and the world. Hoskinson concluded his statement by urging community members to continue their dedicated efforts towards improving the blockchain in the coming decade. 
A New Era Of Change For ADA
A Cardano community member identified as ‘Rami,’ on X has expressed confidence in the Chang hard fork’s ability to reinvigorate the sluggish ADA market. 
According to Rami, historically, ADA has witnessed substantial price increases triggered by past hard fork events. He disclosed that in the 60 days preceding Cardano’s previous four hard forks, ADA had undergone a significant change, surging massively against the broader market trends. 

Based on this trend, Rami suggests that ADA could witness a significant boost in value due to the upcoming Chang hard fork. He mentioned that the upgrade is expected to bring improvements in Cardano’s smart contracts efficiency via Plutus V3, an upgrade which boosts Cardano’s smart contracts capabilities. 
Additionally, the Chang hard fork is anticipated to introduce on-chain governance and distribute one billion ADA tokens to the community. Rami has also disclosed that the upgrade will usher in positive developments within Cardano’s network, including improved speed on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), increased usage of stablecoins, and the potential for airdrops.

Whale deposited 755,000 PENDLE, equivalent to $3.83 million to Binance for profit.



The same whale withdrew 5.02 million PENDLE, worth $2.73 million on August 18, 2023.



Arthur Hayes locked 1.65 million PENDLE worth $8.4 million until September 5, 2024.




Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics platform, has detected significant trades involving PENDLE, the native cryptocurrency of the Pendle protocol. The platform identified a whale who deposited 755,000 PENDLE, equivalent to $3.83 million, to Binance for profit-taking.







According to Lookonchain, the same whale withdrew 5.02 million PENDLE, worth $2.73 million, from Binance on August 18, 2023, when PENDLE traded at $0.54. After the recent transfer to Binance, the whale still holds 4.27 million PENDLE, equivalent to $2.17 million, with a total profit of $22.8 million, representing an 834% return.



Meanwhile, Lookonchain also spotted that BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes recently locked 1.65 million PENDLE, worth $8.4 million, until September 5, 2024. Hayes’ lock-up follows his unstaking of 1.55 million PENDLE, equivalent to $9.41 million, on June 6. Following the June 6 unlock, Hayes’ PENDLE holding dropped to $1.69 million, amounting to $10.26 million.









Arthur Hayes held a position in PENDLE with an average purchase price of $2.24 per token, according to Lookonchain. The on-chain analytics firm also revealed that Hayes had $6.46 million in unrealized profits on his PENDLE holdings at the time of the report



For the uninitiated, Pendle is a protocol that enables the tokenization and trading of future yield. It offers a more granular control over their yield by providing optionality and opportunities for utilization.



Pendle’s native token, PENDLE, traded for $5.15 at the time of writing, according to TradingView data. The altcoin reached an all-time high of $7.53 on April 11 before retracing amid a general crypto market pullback.

Avalanche (AVAX) Under Pressure: Prolonged Downtrend Next?


Avalanche (AVAX), the token of the smart contract blockchain, has been swinging toward lower price levels for almost a month. As a result, traders in the derivatives market are moving from a previous bullish thesis to a bearish bias.
AVAX had an impressive performance in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. But recently, the token seems to have lost its stroke of luck.
Bulls Are Staying Away From Avalanche
AVAX trades at $31.53. However, the Long/Short Ratio shows traders expect the price to fall despite the 8.66% 7-day decrease. Evidence of this sentiment is reflected in the Long/Short Ratio.
The Long/Short Ratio measures traders’ expectations toward a cryptocurrency. Values of this indicator above 1 indicate that there are more long positions than shorts. Conversely, a Long/Short Ratio ratio lower than 1 suggests increased bearish predictions. 
A long is a market participant expecting the price of a token to increase while filling the bid on a contract. On the other hand, a short is a trader betting on a price decrease. 
According to the derivatives information portal Coinglass, AVAX’s Long/Short Ratio was 0.79. This reinforces the aforementioned perception in the market.

AVAX Long/Short Ratio. Source: Coinglass
Besides the ratio, Open Interest aligns with the potential price decrease. Open Interest refers to the value of outstanding contracts in the market.
This indicator decreases or increases based on net positioning. Unlike the Long/Short Ratio, Open Interest does not indicate whether there are more longs or more shorts. Instead, an increase in Open Interest refers to an influx of liquidity and open contracts.
However, a decrease suggests a rise in closed positions and increased outflow of money. As of this writing, AVAX’s open interest was $211.64 million. On June 7, when the price of AVAX was $35, Open Interest was much higher. 
AVAX Open Interest. Source: TradingView
For the token’s value, the decrease may confirm a downward trend as opposed to the upward strength an increase in Open Interest may offer.
AVAX Price Prediction: Long Road From Rally
Meanwhile, AVAX’s market structure on the daily chart suggests a potential fall. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a crucial indicator that corroborates this bias. 

EMA measures trend direction and reflects how prices can change within a given period. On the AVAX/USD daily chart, the 20 EMA (blue) crossed below the 50 EMA (yellow) since April 13. 
This position is called a death cross and is a bearish trend. It occurs when the longer EMA crosses above the shorter EMA. The opposite is the golden cross that occurs when the shorter EMA crosses above the longer EMA.
AVAX Daily Analysis. Source: TradingView
This position puts AVAX at risk of a decline to $29.38. Further, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) supports the potential price decrease.
The chart below shows that the -DMI (red) was 27.58, while the +DMI (blue) was 11.85. DMI measures both strength and direction. Therefore, the difference between the +/-DMI suggests a downward direction for AVAX.  

Also, the Average Directional Index (ADX) trends upward. The ADX (yellow) shows the strength of the direction. If the ADX spikes, it means that the direction has strength behind the movement. 
However, a low DMI reading means that the directional strength is weak. In AVAX’s case, it was the former.

Therefore, the price may drop below $30 in the short term. However, the prediction may be null and void if the broader market begins to recover, as AVAX may follow the directions of other altcoins.

Uniswap Labs Levels Up With Crypto The Game | Bankless


I’ve played in 17 of the 20 competition days across Crypto The Game (CTG) Seasons 1 and 2, and I had an absolute blast in these first two runs.  Brimming with alliances, betrayals, and nail-biting challenges, this is a game where luck, social skills, and strategy come together like nowhere else in crypto. It’s a true Survivor-style showdown, as intense as it is addictive, and in my opinion the game has a bright future. That’s why I was excited to learn that the team behind Uniswap, another app with a bright future, just acquired CTG! Let’s dig into the big ideas here 👇What’s the scoop?On June 10th, Uniswap Labs announced its acquisition of CTG and that the game’s builders—Dylan Abruscato, Tyler Cagle, and Bryan Lee—would be joining its fold to continue developing the highly anticipated Season 3 contest.Along with working on Season 3, the CTG maestros will also explore new onchain events for the Uniswap community, blending the excitement of games and limited-time social activations into the wider Uniswap ecosystem. “Uniswap Labs first learned about CTG because so many members of the Uniswap community—team members, investors, users, etc.—played Season 1 and were hooked,” CTG creator Dylan Abruscato told me via DM yesterday.“As a result, UL decided to sponsor a challenge during Season 2, which gave them a behind-the-scenes look into CTG. This also gave us a chance to collaborate and we quickly realized that we all shared a passion for building products that offer the best onchain experiences for our users.”Why it matters?Uniswap Labs is a powerhouse across DeFi and NFTs, and if anyone has the brainpower and resources to elevate CTG to the next level, it's them. Look for CTG to get bigger and bolder accordingly.This acquisition is also a compelling strategic move by Uniswap, as the DeFi giant can now leverage the engaging nature of CTG to funnel interest to its frontend.via David PhelpsAs David Phelps, co-founder of JokeRace, recently argued, winning on the frontend is crucial for monetization in crypto, where protocols can be easily forked and used by competitors. “Even DeFi will need to be social,” Phelps said,  and Uniswap’s acquisition of CTG notably aligns with this moat strategy of creating unique social experiences to foster enduring, profitable engagement. If this move works well for Uniswap, look for other crypto projects to try to emulate this social blueprint. The big pictureSomething I watch closely for in crypto is indie projects. Projects that bootstrap themselves with small teams from the bottom up to bring to life experiences that bigger, more traditional incumbents don’t have the guts or interest for.  Part of the magic of early CTG has been its indie spirit, its vision for a game that could transcend the status quo. And though it’s now in the fold of crypto giant Uniswap, I fully expect CTG to continue being guided by its indie roots. “The fact that our Season 1 winner was someone like MFL, a player from West Japan who speaks no English, yet won over the entire CTG community, has to be my favorite storyline. This is exactly why we're building CTG,” Abruscato told me.“Someone like MFL, who would never have been cast in a traditional TV reality competition, not only played but also won our game show, thanks to it being onchain.”And while some skeptics say that blockchain tech is a solution in search of a problem, the CTG creator believes the game’s onchain elements have only enhanced its core mission instead of serving as the core mission. “I can't really speak for any other crypto apps, but whenever I chat with other crypto builders, I always tell them to come up with an idea first, and then decide if building it onchain makes it a better product,” Abruscato said. “CTG would never have had the impact it did if I had sat down at a whiteboard and tried to think of an idea for a crypto game. It started as an idea, and building it onchain made it more fun.”Zooming outCan CTG maintain its user interest and engagement in the long term as it scales up under Uniswap? I believe so—all the ingredients for success are there.And how will other DeFi and NFT projects respond to Uniswap's acquisition of CTG? Will this move trigger a wave of similar acquisitions and partnerships, or will it remain a unique, one-of-a-kind strategy for the foreseeable future?These are open questions, and I’m excited to see how the answers unfold. In the meantime, I’m eagerly anticipating the arrival of CTG Season 3 and its new thrills. Keep your eyes peeled for S3 updates for now!

Is Now The Time To Buy Bitcoin? Latest Chart Analysis Says Yes - Here’s Why


																Bitcoin has recently been spotlighted due to an intriguing buy signal identified on its hourly chart. This indication emerges amidst a notable fluctuation in Bitcoin’s price, setting the stage for potential short-term gains.
Renowned crypto analyst Ali has highlighted a significant development on the hourly chart of Bitcoin, specifically noting a ‘buy signal’ detected by the TD Sequential indicator. This technical tool, developed by Tom DeMark, is respected for its ability to predict price reversals by analyzing exhaustion points in trends.

	Related Reading


Decoding The TD Sequential Indicator On Bitcoin Chart
The TD Sequential operates in two main phases: the setup and the countdown. The setup phase requires nine consecutive price bars closing progressively higher or lower, depending on the trend’s direction.
Following a successful setup, the countdown phase begins, searching for a sequence of 13 bars that continue the trend but must close beyond the high or low of two bars prior.
Completing this countdown typically signals an exhausted trend, poised for a reversal. Bitcoin’s hourly chart shows the completion of this pattern, suggesting an imminent uptick over the next few hours.

This technical prognosis arrives as Bitcoin contends with downward pressure, recently dipping below $67,000, a price level not seen since late May. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $66,855, marking a 3.7% decline, which has sparked widespread commentary among investors and analysts.

Buy The Dip, Says Mow
Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and a notable Bitcoin advocate, recently stirred the Bitcoin community with a post on his X account that included an optimistic forecast for Bitcoin’s price. Revisiting his earlier post, he added a highly optimistic prediction that Bitcoin could reach as high as $1 million per BTC.
In his post, Mow used a visual diagram to compare the current available capital in the market with the amount of Bitcoin available and potentially mine-able in the future.

The illustration did not specify quantities but effectively showed the small amount of Bitcoin available relative to the vast amount of capital that could potentially purchase it.
The diagram, designed as overlapping triangles resembling an hourglass, emphasized the scarcity of Bitcoin in comparison to available capital.

Mow’s post highlighted his perspective on the ongoing price dip, suggesting that despite the drop, the fundamental outlook for Bitcoin remains strong due to its limited supply and growing adoption. He use the term “BTFD” – “buy the f**king dip” – to suggest a bullish outlook.

Trader That Called May 2021 Crypto Collapse Updates Bitcoin Outlook, Says BTC ‘Still on Track’ for Bull Market - The Daily Hodl


								A trader known for several accurate crypto market calls says that Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a bullish market trend.
Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 146,500 followers on the social media platform X that as long as Bitcoin remains above an ascending diagonal level, the crypto king is still poised to print fresh all-time highs (ATHs).










“BTC still on track.”
Source: Dave the Wave/X
The analyst says that Bitcoin could still fall lower than its current value and remain in an uptrend provided that it stays above a diagonal support that has kept BTC bullish since October 2023.
“Plenty of wiggle room for BTC price yet. Dashed diagonal line the weightier one here.”
Source: Dave the Wave/X
The analyst also predicts a market top for Bitcoin in December 2025 by using his version of the logarithmic growth channel (LGC) curve, which aims to predict Bitcoin’s longer-term cycle lows and highs while filtering out shorter-term volatility.
“If you subscribe to the BTC four-year cycle theory, then it may not help you much with the top (again). However, if you subscribe to the LGC theory, it may once again be useful.”
Source: Dave the Wave/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Bitcoin could hit the top of the LGC model and soar above $300,000 at the end of 2025.
Bitcoin is trading for $68,654 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.

This Altcoin Announces the Implementation of a Major Update: Vitalik Buterin Also Speaks Out - Bitcoin Sistemi

Optimism (OP) Mainnet announced that the “permissionless fault proofs” mechanism, which is an important step towards achieving full decentralization, has been successfully implemented.
Optimism (OP) Mainnet announced that the “permissionless fault proofs” mechanism, which is an important step towards achieving full decentralization, has been successfully implemented.


This mechanism, which ensures the validity of transactions and the state of the blockchain, has brought OP Stack to “Phase 1” decentralization as defined by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.
The Fault Proof System, currently live on OP Mainnet, allows users to withdraw tokens from the network without the need for trusted third parties such as central bridges. This development is expected to increase the security and independence of transactions on the platform.





Along with OP Mainnet, other OP Stack Chains such as Base, Mode, and Zora will soon upgrade, further expanding the reach and impact of this innovative technology.
Security Council, also known as multi-sig, retains the ability to return the system to a permissible state in the event of a failure or to protect against network attacks. But the ultimate goal is to achieve full decentralization by reducing the role of the Security Council and supporting multiple proof systems through the Proof-of-Fault System.



As part of the journey towards “Phase 2” decentralization, new proof systems such as Asterisc and Kona will be tested. This follows Buterin's framework of gradually decentralizing Layer 2 solutions (L2s).
Buterin himself welcomed this development, saying:






“Welcome to the tier 1-plus tier 2 club, Optimism. “I look forward to many more L2s joining this club soon, especially some ZKs.”

Ethereum Funds Draw Highest Inflows Since March - The Defiant

Institutions poured $69 million into the asset last week. Large entities are warming up to Ethereum again, according to CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly report.Funds holding the asset had their best week since March, notching $69 million worth of purchases, and bringing the year-to-date flows up to $81 million. Figures like these are in stark contrast to last year, when CoinShares called Ethereum the “least loved asset”.“It's too early to tell,” James Butterfill, head of research for CoinShares told The Defiant, “but sentiment has definitely improved and it comes off a couple of years of very weak sentiment when compared to Bitcoin or Solana.”Butterfill put a pin in the expectations of immediate positive price action for ETH, however.“We could well see a repeat of bitcoin outflows in the early launch stage of the ETFs in July, as many investors have been locked in to the ETH Grayscale product in recent years due to the steep discount to NAV, once it converts to an ETF and becomes more liquid, many investor may decide to sell at that point,” he said.Ethereum dropped 5% to $3,499 today. The asset gained 20% in the past 30 days.ETH Price - CoinGeckoAccording to the June 10 report, institutions added $2 billion worth of digital assets to their balance sheets, mainly in Bitcoin. Entities bought more than $1.9 billion worth of BTC over the past seven days.These numbers mark the fifth-straight week of accumulation, with total inflows reaching $4.3 billion.“Institutions seem to be treating Bitcoin less as a speculative asset and more as a diversification tool, especially given the high correlation between equities and bonds,” Butterfill noted. “They are increasingly buying and holding Bitcoin, as indicated by the minimal outflows from ETPs this year.”Grayscale Continues To SurpriseFor Butterfill, the biggest shocker in the past seven days has been Grayscale’s marginal outflows.After the fund sold in vast quantities in the beginning of the year when the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched, the faucet has been all but closed. Only $29 million worth of cryptocurrencies were sold by the firm, which brings the total for the year up to $17.8 billion. The fund still holds nearly $20 billion worth of bitcoin.“Its outflows were very low, and they have been steadily subsiding in recent weeks,” he told The Defiant. Butterfill said this suggests that there is stabilization for Grayscale, although it might also be in anticipation of the mini-fund they are launching, which comes with much lower fees.BlackRock is now the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets, surpassing Grayscale. According to a Dune dashboard, the largest asset manager in the world now holds more than 301,000 BTC or $21 billion, versus Grayscale’s 285,000 bitcoin or $19.8 billion.Spot Bitcoin ETFs are mostly concentrated in the top 3 asset managers. BlackRock and Grayscale are followed by Fidelity, which holds nearly 20% of all Bitcoin ETFs (or $12 billion worth) held in these instruments. Fourth place belongs to 21Shares with $3.4 billion (5.6% market share).

Crypto Trader Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says BTC Forming Topping Structure - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is warning traders that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely fall further before rising again.
Pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 476,200 followers on the social media platform X that BTC’s technicals has confirms that the crypto king has already seen its local top.










“It is confirmed
Bitcoin’s recent advances to the upside fed into a local topping structure (blue box) as seen in recent months
And a new Lower High has developed (black).”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
According to the analyst, BTC’s movements are mimicking a pattern produced earlier this year.
“This current cluster of Bitcoin price action (orange box) is starting to resemble the mid-March/mid-April local topping structure.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
Looking into BTC’s past, Rekt Capital says the flagship crypto is simply following a historical precedent of struggling to break out immediately after the halvings which slash miners’ rewards in half roughly every four years.
“History prevails
Bitcoin was not able to breakout this early in the Post-Halving period, as history suggested.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
Now looking forward, the pseudonymous analyst says Bitcoin has greater gains to come.
“This current BTC pullback is supposed to distract you from the fact that the next months will be able to change your life forever.”
Last week, the analyst suggested that BTC was only days away from “a historic breakout.”
BTC is worth $66,600 at time of writing, down 5% in the last 24 hours.

Fan Tokens Rally as Investors Bet on Soccer Fever


							

Fan tokens linked to soccer teams are seeing increased trading activity ahead of Euro 2024 and Copa América.



The Chiliz cryptocurrency market value has risen to over $1.07 billion, nearing levels last seen during the 2022 World Cup.



Despite the uptick in fan token activity, the sector faces scrutiny over balancing team engagement and financial speculation.




As excitement builds for the upcoming Euro 2024 and Copa América tournaments, fan tokens are becoming a focal point in the cryptoverse as reported by Reuters, a crypto news source. These digital assets, issued by national teams and clubs, offer supporters a tradeable way to engage with their favorite teams. Recent data reveals a significant increase in activity around these tokens, reflecting growing interest ahead of these major soccer events.



Chiliz, the native cryptocurrency of the Socios blockchain that hosts many fan tokens, has seen its market value climb from $687 million at the start of the year to over $1.07 billion. This surge brings it close to levels last observed during the 2022 World Cup, according to CoinGecko. Additionally, fan token trading volumes have also increased, reaching over $170 million in May compared to the $25 million to $57 million range seen in January, as per Kaiko data. The total market value of listed fan tokens now hovers around the $413 million mark.



This summer could be crucial for the fan token sector, which remains relatively new. These tokens typically offer perks like raffle entries, early ticket access, merchandise discounts, and opportunities to vote on minor team decisions such as match songs. While supporters appreciate these tokens as a rare instance of real-world crypto utility, critics argue that the speculative nature of these tradable assets could overshadow their intended purpose of fan engagement.



A spokesperson for Chiliz emphasized that the company’s marketing clearly states that “fan tokens are fan-engagement tools and should be used as such.” For instance, the price of Portugal’s fan token has edged up about 2% in the past 30 days to $2.94, while Argentina’s token briefly reached its highest level since 2022 at $2.46, although both remain below their 2022 World Cup peaks. Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at Bitfinex, noted that the recent increase in trading volumes might be temporary, pointing to a decline in activity following the World Cup.



During the previous crypto boom in 2021, numerous top soccer teams and sports stars promoted crypto assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fan tokens, which led to criticism. British lawmakers cautioned last year that the rise of NFTs in sports could pose financial risks to supporters and potentially harm club reputations. Similarly, the Football Supporters’ Association of England and Wales criticized fan token partnerships as attempts to monetize trivial matters or impose financial barriers on genuine supporter engagement.









Adam McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko, observed that changes in token volume and price do not always correspond with team performance. He stated that there is no clear evidence that holders benefit from holding these tokens as a form of investment on the respective team’s success. A study analyzing fan token trading around major sporting events found that it often follows a “buy the rumor, sell the news” pattern, with volumes and returns typically increasing ahead of major tournaments and then falling as important matches begin.



However, another study found that fans who buy tokens usually take advantage of the benefits offered via voting on club-related decisions. Lennart Ante, CEO of the Blockchain Research Lab, noted that when fans can influence club decisions, they engage more actively. He highlighted the dual nature of fan tokens as both engagement tools and speculative assets, suggesting that the future of fan tokens could depend on how the distribution between engagement-focused users and speculators evolves.

AI Alliance Merger Delayed for a Month As Token Prices Fall - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Artificial Superintelligence Alliance has pushed back the date of its proposed token merger, the group announced on Tuesday. The merger of AI-themed coins FET, AGIX, and OCEAN into a new ASI token will now take place on July 15.The alliance—a consortium of AI-focused blockchain developers SingularityNET, Fetch AI, and Ocean Protocol—announced the merger in April, and set the date the following month for June 13. However, it will no longer take place on Thursday."Due to technical constraints and the demanding regulatory environment, we recently became aware of the need to delay the merger to ensure we meet the exacting processes required for our tokenholders,” Fetch AI CEO Humayun Sheikh told Decrypt via Telegram.Sheikh, who also serves as the chairman of the board of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, said the group is working with centralized exchanges to finalize the remaining steps.“The finalization of the three-way tokenomic merger on July 15 will be a major milestone,” SingularityNET founder and alliance CEO Ben Goertzel said in a statement. “We anticipate a series of progressively more exciting milestones after that as we leverage our $ASI token-based network to move toward increasingly capable AI systems and, in time, actual superintelligence.”Its unclear whether the merger delay had an immediate impact on the price of the three coins involved, as AI-related tokens overall have been in the doldrums—along with the rest of the crypto market.The market capitalization for AI tokens in general is down 8.7% for today, according to CoinGecko. The individual tokens of ASI members are similarly in the red: SingularityNET (AGIX) is trading at $0.67, down 6.6% for the day; Fetch AI (FET) is $1.58, down 7.4% for the day, and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) is $0.69, down 5.5% for the day.Over the last seven days, the three are all down over 20%: FET is down 25.8%, AGIX by 24.0%, and OCEAN is down 23.5%.It's a far cry from March, when allliance member tokens surged following the initial merger announcement. If it goes through, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance will have a combined market capitalization of $5.5 billion, based on their current token values.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

BODEN Solana Meme Coins Soar on Hunter Biden Guilty Verdict - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe son of U.S. president Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, has been found guilty on three counts related to gun charges—and in the hours that followed, Biden-related meme coins have soared in price.Jeo Boden, an intentionally misspelled Joe Biden meme coin on Solana, jumped 9% in the hour that followed the guilty verdict, though its 24-hour trend is negative due to earlier losses during the span—it's down by 6% since this time yesterday at a current price above $0.18.Hunter was found guilty on three counts relating to the purchase of a firearm in 2018. A jury decided that he lied about being a drug user when filling out the forms, which led to him being found guilty of three felonies in connection to the incident.When his conviction was read out, the meme coin Hunter Boden (HUNTBODEN)—similarly an intentionally misspelled meme coin—spiked by 116% in less than 30 minutes, according to CoinGecko. This spike was short-lived, but even with a sizable dip, the token is up 30% on the day at a price of nearly $0.0015.That said, Hunter Boden has a tiny market capitalization of $1.6 million, according to DEX Screener, with only 862 unique wallets trading the token. Coins this small are more sensitive to volatility and should always be traded with care.Interestingly, this is the opposite reaction that Donald Trump tokens had following the former president being found guilty for 34 felony charges. In reaction to the news in late May, TRUMP fell 25%, MAGA Hat (MAGA) slipped 16%, while Super Trump (STRUMP) also dropped 16%. But TRUMP and other tokens soon spiked in price after that initial dip.Following Hunter Biden’s guilty verdict Tuesday, meme coin Doland Tremp (TREMP) dropped 7%. On that note, Polymarket odds suggest betters believe that Joe Biden is 1% more likely to win the 2024 presidential election following Hunter Biden’s conviction.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

This Altcoin Announces 1 Billion Token Grant Program - Bitcoin Sistemi


Polygon, a leading Layer-2 network, announced the launch of the Community Grant Program, a major initiative aimed at fostering innovation and growth within its ecosystem, according to its official blog post.
The program announced today plans to distribute 1 billion POL tokens, currently known as MATIC, to developers over the next decade.


The grant program started with an initial package of 35 million tokens, equivalent to $23 million at current market prices. These tokens, currently denominated in MATIC, are now ready for distribution.
Funding for the program will come from Polygon's Community Treasury. The team predicts that approximately 100 million POL tokens will be distributed annually under the program.






Participants in the program will be able to choose between two different tracks. The “Public Grant Path” will be open to all developers who want to develop on the Polygon platform. The “Consumer Crypto Path,” on the other hand, is geared towards projects that encourage the adoption of cryptocurrencies. This includes a wide range of sectors such as gaming, decentralized social applications, artificial intelligence and blockchain integrations, and NFT innovations.

Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Moves Over $535 Million Worth of BTC


A Bitcoin wallet that has been numb for years has resurfaced, moving 8,000 BTC, worth about $535.64 million, after almost six years of latency.
The wallet, dating back to mid-2018, transferred the holdings to multiple addresses, including a Binance deposit, when BTC crashed.
Dormant Bitcoin Wallet From 2018 Moves $535 Million

On June 11, during the early hours of the US session, a dormant wallet moved its first transaction after 5.5 years of inactivity. The wallet address transferred 8,000 BTC from Coinbase cold storage, Akrham data shows. The value of the moved assets was $535.64 million as of press time.
Dormant Bitcoin wallets, which are addresses showing no activity for long periods, can cause a stir when they suddenly become active, especially with large transfers. Analysts often see these movements as bearish indicators, suggesting that large holders, or whales, are cashing in their holdings.
More intriguingly, the dormant wallet became active amid an ongoing BTC price crash, now down nearly 5%. This market turbulence led to liquidations totaling over $255 million across the crypto market, with $235 million being long positions.

CryptoQuant data reveals that on June 10, the Bitcoin average dormancy was 9.3098. This metric shows the average number of destroyed days of moved coins, increasing when long-term holders move or sell their coins, which can signal a potential price drop.
On May 21, a dormant Bitcoin wallet from 2013 was reactivated, transferring $7.6 million in BTC after nearly 11 years of inactivity. As shown in the chart, this transaction coincided with a subsequent Bitcoin price drop, moving from the $70,000 to $67,000 range. It is evident that large holders moving their holdings to exchanges often cause price fluctuations, typically favoring the bears.

However, some experts, including Javier Bastardo, the Bitcoin Ambassador at Bitfinex, challenge this assumption. He recently expressed that dormant Bitcoin whales’ activities would not significantly impact the market.

“I don’t think this is a significant movement that will affect or influence BTC price. However, it’s important for users to understand that there are a significant number of long-term investors who are ready to hold their BTC positions for years,” Bastardo told BeInCrypto.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66,449, down almost 5% in the past 24 hours.

Funding Open-Source Generative AI With Crypto

While the momentum in open-source generative AI is strong, a more detailed analysis shows a different reality. Open-source generative AI is facing a massive funding issue. When it comes to large foundation models, only large companies such as Databricks, Snowflake, Meta or well-funded startups like Mistral are keeping up with the performance of large closed models. Most of the releases from other labs, like Databricks and Snowflake, are focused on optimized enterprise workloads, while most of the recent open-source research is focusing on complementary techniques rather than on new models.

Ethereum And Altcoins May 'Quickly Rebound' After FOMC Meeting, Trader Predicts - Benzinga

Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe highlighted the ongoing decline in altcoin prices, attributing it to market weakness and upcoming economic events.What Happened: Michaël van de Poppe tweeted that altcoins are experiencing significant declines ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting which is a major contributing factor. He mentioned that altcoins have been correcting substantially over the past week due to several reasons, including overall market weakness and no conclusion on the Ethereum ETH/USD ETF.He also noted that the "Roaring Kitty" saga has impacted altcoin prices, with some dropping by more than 20%.

$1 Billion in Bitcoin Just Moved from Coinbase - Are Whales Massively Buying the Dip? ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
A major Bitcoin whale has just moved $1.06 billion worth of Bitcoin from its Coinbase account. The major transaction occurred as the price of the premier digital currency dropped below $67k earlier today, a -4.31% change in the last 24 hours.



According to data from on-chain reporters, the whale sent the BTC in twin batches from its Coinbase wallet. The first transaction was roughly 7,999.999 BTC (rounded off to 8,000 BTC) worth $536 million, and a similar 8,000 BTC transaction followed later.



Are Bitcoin Whales Going on a Buying Spree?



As these transactions show, big Bitcoin whales are on a buying spree at the moment. However, many are waiting before making further aggressive buys in the cryptocurrency market.



Yesterday was a slightly bearish day for Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and today’s data is still not in. We cannot expect big purchases by the ETFs because of the price drop, but perhaps a few of them will defy expectations to do so. All in all, ETFs aren’t apparently buying this dip, and crypto whales are stealing the show right now. They are often ahead of the curve when snapping up BTC at relatively lower prices.



Miners Selling Bitcoin Sparks Price Drop



Bitcoin dropped below $67k earlier today to post the first significant loss in the last few weeks. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was looking steady at the $70k figure, but the short-term selling put pressure on the market, and that resulted in an eventful day for the bears. Here is the price action from the last 24 hours:

Marathon Digital, the largest Bitcoin mining company in the world, undertook the most important selling. It sold 1,000 BTC worth around $67 million, which caused some short-term panic in the market. However, once it was understood that it was Marathon Digital, fears subsided because mining companies needed to sell their BTC from time to time to pay for electricity and maintenance, and this seems like the case.



The Future



Bitcoin is at a crossroads once more, with big buyers trying to take advantage of the falling price index. However, bigger buys can be expected as the index nears the long-term $60k price support.

Ethereum Struggling With MEV Bots, Executive Argues That Solana Has Succeeded


								Unlike Bitcoin, where transactions are ordered on a first-come, first-served basis, Ethereum and Solana rely on a pool of validators to confirm transactions and add them to the next block. This process allows for flexibility, as users can expedite their transactions by paying higher fees.
At the protocol level, prioritizing transactions based on gas fees has inadvertently led to the rise of complex Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots on Solana and Ethereum. By exploiting the system, these bots have become a significant factor in the ongoing debate about gas fees.
MEV Bots Pushing Gas Fees Higher On Ethereum?
Now, the debate surrounding validators, gas fees, and the impact of MEV bots on Solana and Ethereum is escalating. Mert Mumtaz, the co-founder of Solana RPC provider Helius, taking to X, highlighted the role of a single sandwich bot, Jaredfromsubway, which was the top source of gas fees on Ethereum. 

This bot alone is responsible for a staggering 142 ETH per day, surpassing fees paid by major players like Coinbase. 
MEV bot biggest source of gas fee on Ethereum | Source: @0xMert_ via X
With this MEV bot being the highest source of gas fees on Ethereum, the co-founder argues that by not subsidizing validators, the Ethereum Foundation is indirectly endorsing MEV bot operators to continue “robbing” retail traders.
As it is, Ethereum, notorious for its scalability issues, is the most expensive network to transact on. Though on-chain scaling is a concern, the proliferation of MEV bots as seen with Jaredfromsubway, could be contributing immensely.
Is Solana Doing A Better Job At Addressing MEV Bots?
In light of this, the analyst points out that Ethereum developers have failed to address the MEV menace despite years of dedicated research and solutions at various protocol levels. 
Because of this persistent problem and coordinated and extensive research that continues to fail in Ethereum, the analyst thinks Solana is doing much better in handling the impact of MEV bots on gas fees. 
Solana price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: SOLUSDT on Binance, TradingView
Solana currently and actively subsides most of its validators. The subsidy, absent in Ethereum, penalizes operators engaging in MEV operations, discouraging the behavior. Nonetheless, it is crucial to know that the subsidy is on voting costs and not the cost of hardware and operation.
Even so, some think this approach only offers “band-aid” solutions. If anything, they argue that Solana actually “invented” and “weaponized” MEV. There are other claims that SOL holders like Multicoin Capital prioritize chains based on their MEV capture potential.

Recently, some of these subsidized validators were caught enabling MEV to “sandwich” users. While the Solana Foundation swiftly removed their stake, it remains to be seen whether MEV attacks will stop.

Billionaire investor Bill Miller believes Bitcoin is ‘significantly undervalued’ at current market cap

Billionaire investor Bill Miller IV, Chairman and CIO of Miller Value Partners, reiterated his unwavering belief in Bitcoin in a June 11 blog post titled “Why I’m Still Betting on Bitcoin.”Despite Bitcoin’s significant gains against fiat currencies, Miller argued that the flagship crypto remains vastly “undervalued” and predicts a major shift in global capital governance.According to Miller:“The promise of Bitcoin is simple – namely, that changes in someone’s purchasing power should not be controlled by an authority tied to the circumstances of one’s birth.”Bitcoin was trading a little above $67,000 as of press time, down 5% over the past 24 hours, based on CryptoSlate data.Superior alternativeMiller’s conviction stems from Bitcoin’s unique technological attributes, particularly its decentralized governance and transparent global ledger. He emphasized that traditional monetary systems, influenced by human judgment and political manipulation, are inherently flawed.Miller argued that Bitcoin offers a superior alternative as a secure, unalterable, and automated system.

Inflation, Interest Rates, and Bitcoin: What Traders Are Watching


							

CPI data and FOMC decisions are crucial for crypto market trends.



Bitcoin often corrects before CPI release, then rebounds.



Recent Bitcoin dip highlights the market’s anticipation of policy changes.




A significant week awaits the cryptocurrency market, with incoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decisions. Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading, emphasizes the importance of these events for market dynamics.







Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets have historically reacted to economic announcements. Typically, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies often experience a correction before FOMC decisions and CPI data releases, followed by an upward movement.



As traders and investors anticipate policy statements from the U.S. central bank, Coin Edition had an updated report on Bitcoin’s price, which fell by more than 2.5%.



Upcoming CPI data will reveal inflation trends that influence the FOMC’s interest rate decisions. The FOMC is considering raising interest rates to curb inflation, which could lead to market volatility if CPI data is higher than expected. Lower CPI readings, on the other hand, may suggest a more dovish stance, stabilizing or boosting market confidence.









Similar events have impacted the cryptocurrency market in the past as well. When the CPI revealed higher-than-expected inflation earlier this year, BTC initially declined but quickly recovered as the market adjusted.



Traders are monitoring this cyclical reaction pattern in anticipation of the latest economic data release.



Furthermore, FOMC decisions on interest rates also affect investor sentiment. Rate hikes strengthen the U.S. dollar, which can negatively impact Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin has historically surged after initial losses, although the market’s reaction is not always predictable.



Even as the market awaits critical announcements, the focus is on how FOMC decisions and CPI data will impact traditional and cryptocurrency markets. The next few days could shape market movements, so traders should exercise caution and be prepared for volatility.

Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Continue To Drive High Trading Volume, Report Finds - Benzinga

Meme coins remain a major force in the cryptocurrency market and drive major trading volume, according to a new research report.What Happened: The Coinmetrics report highlights that meme coins, including popular tokens like Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, have garnered substantial attention, achieving $13 billion in trading volumes over a seven-day period in March.This surge surpasses major assets such as Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD, indicating a shift in investor interest towards more speculative digital assets, according to the report co-authored by researchers Tanay Ved and Matías Andrade, Bitcoin.com reported.Ved and Andrade point out that decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are crucial in supporting this growth by offering the necessary infrastructure for asset trading and liquidity. According to Coinmetrics, the rapid ascent of meme coins can be linked to their cultural appeal and community-driven origins. These tokens, often infused with humor and references to popular culture and political figures, have carved out a unique niche in the crypto market.The researchers suggest that future developments in the meme coin sector could transform the broader financial landscape.Also Read: Democrat Senators Urge Federal Reserve To Cut Interest Rates As Bitcoin Rally StallsWhy It Matters: However, they caution that the concentration of ownership among ‘whales’—large holders of these tokens—poses risks such as market manipulation and liquidity challenges.This highlights the need for careful investment in this highly volatile sector."The high Gini coefficient of ~0.8 indicates a substantial centralization of token holdings, posing risks such as market manipulation and liquidity issues, in addition to a degree of volatility that is intolerable for most investors," the Coinmetrics report states.As meme coins continue to attract attention, they offer new opportunities for investors ready to embrace their speculative nature. Nevertheless, the researchers stress the importance of understanding the inherent risks, including extreme price volatility and the potential for rapid market changes driven by social media and community hype.What’s Next: These insights into the evolving meme coin market will be a key topic at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin’s Direction Ahead Of ‘Huge’ FOMC Meeting And Key CPI Data: Up, Down Or Sideways?

Bitcoin potential upside muted by hedge funds shorting futures, Glassnode reports - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Despite the impressive flows registered by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US have seen impressive inflows, the expected positive impact on the market prices is being hindered by a strategy called “cash-and-carry.” According to on-chain analysis firm Glassnode, investors are longing Bitcoin through US Spot ETFs and shorting the asset via futures traded in the CME.The CME Group futures market’s open interest has stabilized above $8 billion, indicating that traditional market traders are increasingly adopting the cash-and-carry strategy. This involves buying a long spot position and simultaneously shorting a futures contract. Hedge funds, in particular, are amassing large net short positions in Bitcoin, totaling over $6.3 billion in CME Bitcoin and $97 million in Micro CME Bitcoin markets. This supports the notion that ETFs are being used primarily for longing spot exposure in these arbitrage trades.Image: GlassnodeThe cash-and-carry trade between long US Spot ETF products and shorting futures has effectively neutralized the buy-side inflows into ETFs, leading to a neutral impact on market prices and indicating a need for organic buy-side demand to stimulate positive price movement.Notably, the amount of BTC funneled into large institutions grows daily with the ETF trading. Mt. Gox Trustee holds 141,00 BTC, the US Government 207,000 BTC, all exchanges combined have 2.3 million BTC, and miners, excluding Patoshi, possess 706,000 BTC. The total balance of these entities is approximately 4.23M BTC, representing 27% of the adjusted circulating supply.Image: GlassnodeCoinbase, through its exchange and custody services, holds a significant portion of the aggregate exchange and US Spot ETF balances, with 270,000 BTC and 569,000 BTC respectively. The exchange’s role in market pricing has grown, especially with an increase in whale deposits to Coinbase wallets post-ETF launch. However, a notable part of these deposits correlates with outflows from the GBTC address cluster, which has been exerting selling pressure.

Tether Unveils $1 Billion Warchest For Deals And Investments In Key Markets | Bitcoinist.com


								Stablecoin issuer Tether and its investment arm, Tether Investments, have revealed their intention to allocate more than $1 billion to various investment opportunities over the next 12 months. 
According to a Bloomberg report, Paolo Ardoino, Chief Executive Officer behind the USDT stablecoin, shared insights into the company’s next investment strategies and areas of focus in a recent interview.
Tether’s Expansion Plans
According to the report, the firm is particularly interested in alternative financial infrastructure for emerging markets, artificial intelligence (AI), and biotechnology, with approximately $2 billion invested in these sectors.

Tether has invested most of its reserves, which back USDT, in US Treasury bills and other securities. This strategy has resulted in significant profits amid the prevailing high-interest-rate environment.
While Tether remains committed to retaining 100% of its reserves and setting aside an additional 6% cushion from profits to ensure redemptions of USDT, the company plans to allocate a portion of its remaining profits to investment opportunities. 
During the interview, Ardoino emphasized the company’s focus on expanding its distribution network and investing in infrastructure within emerging markets. The company has already allocated over $1 billion to AI initiatives, including support for Northern Data Group, a data center operator.
Ardoino stated that Tether’s investments aim to leverage technology that facilitates disintermediation in traditional finance, reducing dependence on major tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. 
Additionally, the company’s CEO highlighted that Tether’s profitability has attracted many potential investment opportunities globally, with the company receiving “dozens or even hundreds” of proposals each month. However, Tether selectively chooses only a small percentage of these opportunities.
Venturing Into Biotech Amid Industry Retreat
Tether’s recent efforts to diversify beyond stablecoins, which have faced regulatory challenges worldwide, have positioned the company as a significant deal-maker. As Bitcoinist reported in April, Tether reorganized into four divisions focusing on finance, data, Bitcoin mining and energy, and education. 
Moreover, the stablecoin issuer also plans to launch a platform later this year, enabling companies to issue bonds and equity in digital-token form while also providing central banks the capability to offer central-bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

Ardoino explained that Tether’s approach to investing differs from traditional venture capitalists in that it doesn’t just look for companies expected to reach profitability targets within the next year or two. Instead, Tether invests in projects that it finds “exceptionally compelling,” and that align with its strategic vision.
In addition to its interest in AI and emerging markets, the firm reportedly makes forays into the biotech sector. In particular, it has backed Blackrock Neurotech, a company specializing in brain-computer interface technology. Ardoino expressed Tether’s willingness to invest in biotech when other players have scaled back their involvement in the space.

Donald Trump's Altcoin Assets Also Melted With The Decline - Here is Trump's Loss - Bitcoin Sistemi


With the major decline in the cryptocurrency market today, a major decline was seen in the memecoin assets of Donald Trump, the former US President and the Republican candidate in the next election.
Data shows that Donald Trump lost $12 million from the memecoins he owned today.


Memecoins in Trump's wallet have largely melted since last week. With the declines over the past week, the total value of the former president's memecoins has decreased from $ 33.15 million to $ 11 million currently.

TROG, the largest asset in the cryptocurrency wallet, lost 90% of its value in the process. While Trump has $24.7 million of the altcoin in his wallet, he currently has only $2.72 million in TROG assets, including losses in value.





However, it should not be forgotten that none of the memecoins in question were purchased by Trump himself. These assets consist of tokens sent to Trump by various cryptocurrency developers to draw attention to their projects.
Recently, there has been an increase in popularity in political-themed altcoins, especially with the approach of the US elections.

Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Breakout Of Critical Zone, Sets Target As High As $7.5 | Bitcoinist.com


								A crypto analyst has boldly predicted a significant price breakout for the XRP price, setting a target as high as $7.5 despite the cryptocurrency trading below $1 presently. While this projection may seem ambitious, if realized, it would mark new all-time highs for XRP, decisively ending the cryptocurrency’s years-long downward trend.
XRP’s Roadmap To $7.5 Price Target
On June 10, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Egrag Crypto’ took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his bullish projections about the XRP price. According to the analyst, XRP is poised to reach a critical target level of $7.5 before the start of 2025. 
He expressed a strong belief that the XRP price will potentially break the “White Triangle” pattern and hit a measured move at $1.5, effectively kickstarting a short but robust upward momentum. Sharing a price chart of XRP’s movements from 2020 to 2026, Egrag Crypto illustrated a unique triangle pattern which emphasized a critical Fibonacci 1.618 zone, ranging from $6.5 to $7.5. 
Source: X
The analyst revealed that this Fibonacci 1.618 zone was a key resistance area, emphasizing the significance of this range as a prime opportunity for profit-taking by investors. Given XRP’s current price, a rise to new all-time highs may seem far-fetched to most XRP investors who have consistently experienced the cryptocurrency’s long-term price stagnation. 
Egrag Crypto’s bullish projection for XRP serves as a beacon of hope to XRP supporters who anticipate potential price increases for the cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst has urged the XRP army to remain steady and patient, emphasizing that XRP’s breakout might follow the pump of other major cryptocurrencies in the market. 
“Trust me, all we need is for other coins to pump before XRP. The rotational profits will pour 100% into XRP because it is the BLACKHORSE which all my bets are on,” the analyst stated.
Looking further ahead, Egrag crypto has also projected a rise to mid-double digits for XRP. He disclosed that if XRP manages to close every week above the Fibonacci 1.618 level, the cryptocurrency could see a new price target at the Fibonacci 2.414 and 2.618 levels. These levels indicate a potential bullish surge between $25 to $45.  
Update On XRP Price Performance
Despite Egrag Crypto’s bullish outlook for the XRP price during this cycle, the price of the cryptocurrency has continued to spiral downwards. XRP is showing a disappointing price performance, recording a 2.15% decline in the last 24 hours. 
The cryptocurrency has been consolidating around the $0.5 price mark for years. At one point this year, it even rose as high as $0.6, witnessing gains as the volatility in the crypto market’s volatility calmed slightly.

As of writing, the price of XRP is trading below $0.5, experiencing a steady decrease in its value from the previous month. The cryptocurrency’s price is currently $0.48, marking a substantial 6.61% decline over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap.
Despite the bearish performance, XRP’s trading volume is surging. The cryptocurrency has seen a remarkable 80.02% increase in its 24-hour trading volume, underscoring the sustained interest and demand for XRP amongst crypto traders and investors.

Toncoin (TON) Flips Ethereum In Daily Active Users, Fueling $10 Price Target Predictions


																Toncoin (TON), the native token of The Open Network, experienced a 12% price drop from its recent all-time high of $7.76 over the past week, following the overall market correction led by Bitcoin (BTC). 
However, despite the temporary setback, the optimistic sentiment surrounding TON and its network has led crypto analysts to speculate on a potential continuation of the halted uptrend, with some even predicting a surge beyond the current record levels toward double-digit territory.
Setting The Stage For $10 Price Target
Crypto analysis firm Delphi Digital made an intriguing observation, noting that TON’s daily active addresses have surpassed those of Ethereum (ETH) for the first time.

In a recent social media post, renowned crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) analyst known as “Crypto King” recommended newcomers to explore TON, highlighting its super-fast and user-friendly blockchain infrastructure. 
The analyst also emphasized the credibility of TON’s development team, which is the same team behind Telegram. Crypto King believes TON could experience a significant price spike, potentially reaching as high as $10 in the coming weeks.
Market expert Alex Clay shares a similar viewpoint, noting that despite the market downturn, TON maintains its bullish structure and is poised for double-digit gains. 
According to Clay, TON is on track to reach $10, with the potential for short-term targets of $10.5 and $11.6. Clay also mentions the presence of a Daily Cup & Handle pattern, further bolstering the positive outlook for TON.
Toncoin Price Dips Despite Favorable Market Metrics
Token Terminal data reveals notable figures for TON’s blockchain by examining key metrics that indicate bullishness over the long term. The fully diluted market cap has seen a 3.6% increase over the past 30 days. However, trading volume for the token has decreased by 11.6% over the same period.

On the other hand, the number of token holders has witnessed a significant surge of 76.3%. In terms of revenue and fees, there have been positive increases of 26.0% and 26.0% respectively over the past 30 days. 
Interestingly, the active user base on TON’s network has skyrocketed by an impressive 245.1%, with approximately 5.42 million monthly active users.

Despite the positive growth seen in various metrics over the past 30 days, Toncoin has experienced a 3% decrease in price during the same timeframe, resulting in a current trading price of $6.82. 
In the short term, bullish investors will need to closely monitor the nearest support level at $6.80, effectively preventing the token from further declining to lower levels. Conversely, the nearest resistance level is $7.53, representing the last obstacle before a potential retest of Toncoin’s all-time high.

All about the memecoin supercycle and Solana's role - AMBCrypto



Memecoins are gateways for traders to experience the rest of crypto, says an executive
Most of the memes were discounted amidst the overall market drawdown ahead of the Fed decision. 

Memecoins have rallied harder than most crypto categories during the 2024 market cycle. In fact, memes were the best-performing category in Q1. However, the memecoins have equally attracted the market participants’ love and hate. 
The recent fray of select celebrities into memecoins saw  Ethereum [ETH] founder Vitalik Buterin register his ‘unhappiness’ with the trend. 
On his part, Meow, the pseudonymous CEO of Solana-based DEX Jupiter Exchange, called meme tokens ‘user-generated money.’
Giving an illustration and comparison to Web 2’s user-generated content, the executive deemed memecoins as the Web 3 equivalent of Web 2’s content. But most importantly, the executed noted, 
‘Memecoins are likely to be the gateway to understanding the rest of the crypto stack – infra, defi, RWAs’
Solana – Home of memecoins
The current memecoin supercycle has perhaps benefited Solana more than any blockchain so far, as users jumped on the chain to trade memes. 
For example, Solana has outperformed Ethereum on the DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes front for the past five trading days. Interestingly, the DEX volumes are majorly dominated by meme trading pairs, Dexscreener data revealed. 
This validates Meow’s statement that memecoins could be a gateway to DeFi and the rest of the crypto stack. 
That said, the executive acknowledged Solana’s instrumental part in onboarding and hopefully turning memecoin mania into other crypto stacks. 
‘You cannot actually talk about the current memecoin trend without giving flowers to Solana – the combination of speed, txn cost, crucial mass of devs, highly usable apps in one single state machine created the underlying infra to make this happen.’ 
Memecoins bleeds as BTC dips
However, another crypto analyst, Alex Kruger, claimed that new memecoins wouldn’t be successful unless they have different mechanics like Notcoin – the tap-to-earn game designed to onboard users into Web 3. 
In the meantime, the overall meme segment was down by over 5% in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin [BTC] dipped to $67K ahead of the Fed decision. 
Most of the legacy memes like Dogecoin [DOGE] were down double-digits on the weekly charts. 
Additionally, Pepe [PEPE], Shiba Inu [SHIB], dogwifhat [WIF] were all in the red as they flashed discounted prices.

Mistral Is Now Worth $6 Billion, Drawing Fresh Cash Amid Open-Source AI Boom - Decrypt

AI startup Mistral has closed a substantial €600 million (about $644 million) funding round, the Paris-based firm announced on Tuesday. The fundraise was reportedly based on a company valuation of $6 billion—a nearly threefold increase from its $2 billion valuation in less than six months.“Mistral AI has grown about 3x in valuation since December and about 25x in the last 12 months,” Mistral AI researcher Devendra Chaplot wrote on LinkedIn—adding that the company is hiring.The Series B fundraising round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from notable investors like Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, Salesforce Ventures, Cisco, and IBM.“We are grateful to our new and existing investors for their continued confidence and support for our global expansion,” Arthur Mensch, CEO and cofounder of Mistral AI tweeted. “This will accelerate our roadmap as we continue to bring frontier AI into everyone’s hands.”The cash infusion could make Mistral the world’s most valuable open-source AI company and the fourth largest AI company in general, behind only OpenAI, Anthropic and Databricks. The company was founded in April 2023 by a team that included former employees of Meta and Google's DeepMind AI project.In announcing the fundraise, Mensch emphasized the capital-intensive nature of the industry, citing the need for increased computing power and talent acquisition to "break the barriers of artificial intelligence." The capital will accelerate the company's roadmap, enhancing computing capacity, recruitment efforts, and global expansion plans—particularly in the United States, he said.Mistral AI has been focused on commercializing its proprietary models through API-based products tailored for corporate clients with specific business needs, largely aimed at privacy or personalization. Simultaneously, the company has developed and released open-source models like Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B, and Mixtral 8x22B under the Apache 2.0 license, making them accessible to developers and researchers.This open-source focus is a key factor in Mistral AI's success. By comparison, Stability AI—which develops Stable Diffusion, the world’s leading open-source image generator with virtually no competition in the space—is valued at over $1 billion.Both firms are still dwarfed by top AI firm OpenAI, which also tripled its valuation with a February deal that put its worth at a whopping $80 billion.At a technical level, the highly efficient models from Mistral can outperform larger offerings on various benchmarks, making open-source models competitive with top commercial AI models like GPT-3.5 Turbo from OpenAI, Claude 2 from Anthropic, or Gemini Pro from Google on the LMSys Chatbot Arena Leaderboard.Although Mistral AI offers a free chatbot, revenue streams include enterprise plans, licensing proprietary models on a pay-per-token basis, and a forthcoming API that supports model fine-tuning for customers through usage fees or subscriptions. The company also plans to commercialize its models through a multi-year partnership with Microsoft's Azure platform, which includes a $16.3 million investment and equity participation.The AI boom has revitalized the open-source industry, with significant contributions from major tech companies. Meta leads the charge with 1909 open source models released to date. Google has over 800 contributions, Microsoft has shared 300 models, and Apple 47 contributions.Beyond the open-source community, significant investments are being made in AI developments across various fields. Several AI startups, including Inflection.ai, Modal.com, Character.ai, and Perplexity.ai have recently secured substantial funding rounds to advance generative AI applications.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Major Bitcoin investors, colloquially known as whales, have recently opened massive long positions on the flagship cryptocurrency via popular cryptocurrency exchanges Bybit and HTX at around $69,000.



That’s according to Ki Young Ju, CEO of cryptocurrency analytics firm CryptoQuant, who pointed out that these massive long positions are interesting in light of similar activity seen back in August 2023, when Bitcoin whales opened large long positions on BTC ahead of a parabolic price rise that saw the cryptocurrency move from around $25,000 to a new all-time high above $73,500.







According to Young Ju, the price of the flagship cryptocurrency isn’t currently overvalued “based on network fundamentals,” which he backed up with the Thermo Cap ratio, with Thermo Cap being described as the “cumulative value of all Bitcoin mined so far, representing the total investment cost in the network.”



Per his words, a higher Thermo Cap ratio indicates stronger network fundamentals, with that ratio being found by dividing market capitalization by the Thermo Cap.







As CryptoGlobe reported, the price of Bitcoin could benefit from the growth of money supply in the United States as global liquidity has recently surged to near the $100 trillion mark, at a time in which BTC itself is trading at $71,000.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

According to a chart shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) by the founder of on-chain data service LookIntoBitcoin, Philip Swift, global supply – known as M2 – is nearing a historic high around $100 trillion.



This unprecedented level of liquidity is historically correlated with Bitcoin price movements, according to Swift. His platform tracks global M2 data and compares it to Bitcoin price behavior, and shows that the current M2 of $94 trillion dwarfs the figure observed in late 2021, when Bitcoin hit its previous all-time high of $69,000, with a $3 trillion increase.



Furthermore, M2 has rebounded a full 10% since dipping to $85 trillion in late 2022, coinciding with the depths of the crypto bear market.  These findings resonate with other recent liquidity-based analyses, which also project a bullish outlook for Bitcoin.



The relationship between Bitcoin and the U.S. M1 money supply is also noteworthy. This metric is currently breaking out of a seven-year consolidation period – the longest in Bitcoin’s history – suggesting significant room for growth.

Ripple Expands Crypto Footprint with Two Strategic Acquisitions


							

Ripple’s acquisitions of Metaco and Standard Custody bolster its cryptocurrency market position.



Jack McDonald’s dual role enhances Ripple’s stablecoin initiatives, ensuring seamless integration.



Ripple’s proactive growth strategy underscores its commitment to innovation and excellence.




Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the completion of two significant acquisitions, marking a major step forward in the company’s expansion strategy. Ripple has acquired Metaco and Standard Custody to further solidify its position in the cryptocurrency sector.







Jack McDonald also added to his Twitter post highlighting that he has joined the Ripple team assuming the role of Senior Vice President of Stablecoins. McDonald’s appointment underscores Ripple’s dedication to fostering talent and expertise within its ranks.



Ripple made public earlier this year that it intended to purchase Standard Custody, and that acquisition has finally happened. This purchase demonstrates Ripple’s dedication to growing its product line and improving its skills in the cryptocurrency industry.







McDonald’s dual role as CEO of Standard Custody and Senior Vice President of Stablecoins positions him strategically within Ripple, ensuring seamless integration and alignment of objectives across both entities. His leadership will play a pivotal role in steering Ripple’s stablecoin initiatives towards fruition.



The closing of these deals demonstrates Ripple’s proactive strategy for expansion and innovation. With the addition of new products to its portfolio and the acquisition of top talent like McDonald, Ripple is well-positioned to make significant strides in developing and implementing blockchain-based solutions.



Garlinghouse expressed optimism about the future and highlighted Ripple’s commitment to bringing about significant change in the crypto asset market. Now that Metaco and Standard Custody are part of its organization, Ripple is in a good position to carry out its goal of making cross-border transactions easy, safe, and effective.









McDonald’s joining the team strengthens Ripple’s standing as a major participant in the bitcoin market. His knowledge and visionary leadership will surely help make Ripple’s stablecoin projects a success and open the door for more expansion and innovation in the XRPL ecosystem.



Jack McDonald’s hiring and Ripple’s recent acquisitions demonstrate the company’s dedication to growth, innovation, and quality in the cryptocurrency industry. With an emphasis on strategic leadership and teamwork, Ripple is well-positioned to continue bringing about positive change in the industry.

GameStop Stock Surges as Roaring Kitty Skewers Recent Losses - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsVideo game retailer GameStop saw a considerable rebound on Wednesday, closing up 22.8% after experiencing two consecutive days of significant losses. That followed last week’s spike amid the latest return of influencer Roaring Kitty (aka Keith Gill).After a challenging start to the week, GameStop's stock plummeted by more than 8% in early Tuesday trading. However, by the end of the day, it had surged, marking an impressive turnaround. This recovery can be attributed to several factors, including completing a major share offering and shifting market sentiment.Meanwhile, Roaring Kitty continued to poke fun at himself and the ongoing developments, even as he lost around $350 million on his GME position from last Thursday through the close of business on Monday.He shared a meme on Twitter on Tuesday that showed a character looking at an “Options Basics 101” course, apparently skewering himself over his own paper losses. Roaring Kitty has yet to share his latest disclosure of his portfolio, as of this writing, including the value of his options holdings—though he’s sure to see a sizable increase given the price jump.Share offering impactOn Tuesday, GameStop announced the completion of its previously disclosed at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program. The company sold the maximum number of shares registered under the ATM program, generating approximately $2.137 billion in gross proceeds. GameStop intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments. This successful share offering significantly bolstered the company's financial position, increasing its cash reserves to over $4 billion and contributing to the stock's rapid recovery.The surge in GameStop's stock price has been met with a mixture of surprise and enthusiasm across social media and trading platforms. More than 136 million shares were traded on Tuesday as retail investors rode the stock's revival, buoyed by the recent return of Roaring Kitty after he accumulated sizable GME options.Moreover, analysts from S3 Partners have noted a significant amount of short squeeze activity, which has likely fueled the rapid price increase. This phenomenon occurs when investors who have bet against the stock are forced to buy shares to cover their positions, driving the price up further.Broader market trends also likely played a role in GameStop's stock movements.Wall Street traded relatively flat as investors exercised caution in anticipation of the upcoming inflation report and Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.The S&P 500 was down about 0.2%, experiencing its poorest daily performance so far this month. However, the tech-centric Nasdaq 100 remained stable, supported by a robust surge in Apple following Monday’s reveal of its new AI offerings.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

ZKsync Announces Historic Airdrop with 3.6 Billion Tokens Distributed


																Matter Labs, the creators of ZKsync, announced on Tuesday that a community airdrop for their new ZK tokens will start next week.
The Ethereum Layer 2 service provider will distribute 3.675 billion tokens, representing 17.5% of the total token supply through airdrops, to about 695,232 eligible wallets.
ZK Airdrop Coming Next Week
In the release, the team announced that ZK will have a total supply of around 21 billion tokens. As per Matter Labs’ statement, the 17.5% airdrop makes this the most extensive token distribution from a Layer 2 network.
The report further states that 89% of the airdropped tokens will go to a group classified as users, while 11% will be apportioned to the contributors. Users are people who met the threshold of transactional activities by the snapshot date, March 24.
On the other hand, contributors, including developers, researchers, the community, individuals, and companies, actively participated in turning ZKsnyc into the L2 behemoth it is today. While users will claim tokens from next week, the contributors will have to wait for at least one more and begin making claims from June 24.




ZKSync has provided a wallet eligibility checker where individuals can check whether they qualify for the airdrops. As per the documentation, every airdropped token is immediately unlocked and can be transferred immediately without requiring a vesting period.
Interestingly, 66% of the total ZK tokens allocation is apportioned to the community, while only 33% is allocated to investors and teams. While talking about their decision to apportion more to the community, the ZKsync Association said:
“Awarding more tokens in the airdrop than to the Matter Labs team and investors is more than a symbolic decision for the community… The community will have the largest supply of liquid tokens to direct protocol governance upgrades.”
The distribution of these team tokens will start in June 2025 and continue for a four-year vesting period ending in 2028. The decision to delay the unlock dates for team tokens by one year comes a few months after another competitor, StarkWare, was forced to postpone the team unlock date following criticism online.
Real Tokens for Real People
As per the ZkSync statement, this airdrop focuses on rewarding real people while filtering out bots and sybil wallets. The network employs many criteria to spot and reward wallets from real people with real on-chain activity.
When asked whether there would be selling pressure due to a large sum of tokens being unlocked immediately on the airdrop, Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski said, “People are free to dispose of their tokens.”
Alex said that they want holders of the tokens to participate in governance. If one does not want to, they can sell them.

Token Unlocks to Test Crypto Market Stability This Week


							

Significant token unlocks this week could lead to increased market volatility and notable price movements.



Major Tokens like DYDX, Pendle, and Aptos are set to unlock millions in tokens, impacting prices.



Token unlock events can lead to price fluctuations, offering both risks and opportunities for traders.




Investors prepare for a wave of token unlocks this week, which could inject millions of dollars worth of new cryptocurrencies into the market and potentially create significant price volatility. Projects like DYDX, Pendle, Aptos (APT), 1inch, Immutable X (IMX), CyberConnect (CYBER), and Strike (STRK) are among those set to release previously locked tokens into circulation.







Source: Token unlocks



DYDX, a decentralized exchange, will unlock $2.71 million worth of tokens, constituting 0.58% of its total supply. Currently trading at $1.75, DYDX has experienced a 7.41% decline over the past 24 hours. With a market cap of $467.76 million and 55.6% of its total supply already unlocked, this event could further influence DYDX’s market performance.



Pendle, priced at $5.18, has a market cap of $809.27 million. It will release $192.97 thousand worth of tokens, a relatively small 0.02% of its total supply. This minor unlock may not significantly impact Pendle’s price, but it remains a point of interest for traders.



Aptos (APT) will unlock $91.38 million worth of tokens, accounting for 2.58% of its supply. Currently priced at $8.09, APT has seen a 4.27% decrease in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $3.55 billion, this significant unlock could trigger heightened trading activity and price volatility.



1inch, a decentralized exchange aggregator, is set to unlock $6.36 thousand worth of tokens, a minuscule fraction of its supply. Its current price is $0.424, down 5% over the last day. With 85.6% of its supply already unlocked, this event is likely to have minimal immediate impact.










Immutable X (IMX) will release $48.25 million worth of tokens, representing 1.72% of its supply. Priced at $1.89, IMX has seen a 5.5% decrease in the last 24 hours. As a leading Layer 2 scaling solution for NFTs, IMX’s token unlock could influence its market dynamics and attract significant trading interest.



CyberConnect (CYBER) will unlock $6.82 million worth of tokens, representing 3.96% of its supply. Currently priced at $7.70, CYBER has dropped by 5.06% over the past day. This unlock event could lead to notable price fluctuations as the market absorbs the new tokens.



Strike (STRK) will release $69.38 thousand worth of tokens, 4.92% of its supply. With a current price of $1.08 and a 4.07% decline in the last 24 hours, STRK’s unlock might prompt increased trading activity and potential price changes.



The increased supply from major token unlocks will, no doubt, impact the value of digital assets like DYDX, Pendle, and Aptos, potentially reshaping the landscape for investors.

Will Shiba inu (SHIB) Lose $0.00002? Bitcoin (BTC) Plummets After Hitting $70,000, Solana (SOL) Might Be Safest Asset on Market's Top Right Now

Bitcoin surged above $70,000 yesterday once again, driving the hopes and dreams of the cryptocurrency market up. However, things have changed very rapidly as the selling pressure spiked, leading to a drop below $69,000 for the digital gold.After hitting this milestone the chart shows that Bitcoin saw a significant decline. Selling pressure has suddenly increased, which could indicate that investors are taking profits following the recent rally. BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAs a result, traders may be concerned as BTC is finding it difficult to hold its position above important support levels. Bitcoin is currently trading just above its 50-day EMA at about $68,000. The next support level, which is located around the 200 EMA, may be tested if the price is unable to hold this level of support. Bearish divergence is also visible on the RSI, suggesting that the momentum may be waning. Overall the long-term trend for Bitcoin is still positive despite this setback. Perhaps the market was just correcting itself before the next leg up, which is why the recent decline was so beneficial. Investors should continue to exercise caution though and keep an eye out for any new indications of weakness in price action.Solana's surprising stabilitySolana is probably one of the few assets on the market with a stable position right now, safely trading at the 100 EMA, at around $150. Despite the overall negative sentiment around the asset, SOL is still in an uptrend if we look at the long-term trend, and the current support level may become a foundation for a future reversal.As it remains stable at $150 and lines up with the 100 EMA, the chart demonstrates Solana's resilience. This suggests a level of strong support that may serve as a springboard for further gains. Solana has succeeded in keeping a more stable trading range, in contrast to many other cryptocurrencies that are seeing considerable volatility. In spite of the recent market decline, Solana's price action is still bullish when analyzing the long-term trend. The fact that the asset has managed to hold above the 100 EMA shows that the bulls are still in charge. A more neutral outlook is also offered by the RSI, which indicates that there is potential for upward movement without becoming overbought. Traders' interest is consistent even though the trading volume is lower than it was at previous peaks. The notion that Solana might be preparing for a comeback is supported by the volume's consistency,  particularly if the mood of the market as a whole improves. Shiba Inu has failed to hold the 100 EMA support level and has opened below it during this trading session. The fact that the price of the meme token is moving below this moving average raises substantial concerns and may be a negative signal for investors. The next support level for the asset is not far away but is located below a crucial resistance level.Shiba Inu in troubleShiba Inu is struggling to find support above the 100 EMA, which is bad news for the asset. It appears that selling pressure has increased as the price breaks below this support level, bringing it closer to the next major support level, which is located around $0.000019. The RSI is currently in the vicinity of the oversold area, suggesting that the selling pressure might continue. Nevertheless, if buyers intervene to take advantage of the lower prices, the oversold situation could also create the chance for a brief rebound. The volume profile indicates a decline. It may be difficult for SHIB to mount a significant recovery in the near future since lower volume in a downtrend usually signals waning buying interest. The decreasing volume adds credence to the meme token's pessimistic forecast. The next significant support, which is located around the 200 EMA, might be tested in less than a week if the current selling pressure persists.

Litecoin Doubles Activity To Beat BTC, Now Most Used Crypto


								Data shows that Litecoin has seen a rapid surge in active addresses, making the asset the most used in the sector, compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Litecoin Has More Than Doubled Its Active Addresses This Month
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the Daily Active Addresses have recently seen a big jump for LTC. The Daily Active Addresses here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total number of addresses taking part in some transaction activity on the network daily.
Naturally, this metric considers both senders and receivers and only counts the unique number of such addresses. This indicator may be used as a proxy for the amount of traffic the Litecoin blockchain receives.

When the value of this metric is high, it means many addresses are making moves on the network right now. Such a trend implies there is high interest in the asset.
On the other hand, the low indicator suggests that investors may not pay much attention to the cryptocurrency as the network isn’t witnessing much activity.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Daily Active Addresses for Litecoin over the past few months:

The value of the indicator appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on X
As the above graph shows, the Litecoin Daily Active Addresses have observed extraordinarily high values since the 4th of this month. During May, the asset had averaged a value of 345,000 on this metric, but over the past week, the average has been sitting at 704,000.
This means that the active user count on the blockchain has more than doubled compared to the past month. The official Litecoin X handle has also posted about this recent explosion in network activity, sharing a chart for the number of active addresses from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock.

This chart also includes the data for another metric: the daily number of new addresses being opened on the network. From its graph, it’s apparent that at the same time as this activity boom has happened, the adoption of the cryptocurrency has also picked up.

In the active addresses indicator, LTC has surpassed the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum. “More people using Litecoin than any other crypto right now!” notes the LTC X handle.
Litecoin has historically been around the top of the sector in usage-related metrics because the network offers cheap and fast transactions. While LTC’s price has been stagnant, its usage metrics shooting up suggest that this network capability can still attract users.
LTC Price
So far, Litecoin has not been able to recover from the April crash, as its price is still trading around the $77 mark.

Trader Warns up to 40% Correction on the Table for Surging Memecoin, Updates Outlook on Fantom and Sui - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist says that a deep drawdown may be in sight for a scorching-hot memecoin.
Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 720,500 followers on the social media platform X that Floki (FLOKI) may see a severe correction after rallying by more than 13x in just a few months.










“It’s up 1,200% since the start of this run and made a liquidity sweep above the previous high. The risk of a heavy correction is higher than a continuation upward. Interested only after a 30-40% correction, but not here.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
A 40% correction from the highs will take Floki down to $0.0002. At time of writing, Floki is worth $0.000265, down over 5% in the past day.
Turning to the smart contract protocol Fantom (FTM), Van de Poppe thinks the altcoin is poised to revisit support at $0.50.
“Continuously making lower highs and lower lows. It’s tested the $0.60 support multiple times, and a breakdown seems likely. In that case, I have two areas of interest for swing trading in the coming period.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, FTM is trading for $0.674, down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours.
The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is fellow layer-1 protocol Sui (SUI). Van de Poppe sees SUI rallying by almost 40% if it takes out its immediate resistance at $1.17.
“SUI is one of the strongest performers in the markets. It made a higher low and is looking for continuation towards $1.60 if the momentum is providing a breakout above $1.17.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, SUI is trading at $1.04, down nearly 5% on the day.

Massive XRP Whales Withdraw $28 Million from Binance Amid Market Correction: On-Chain Data Reveals | Cryptoglobe


                                
Blockchain data shows that massive XRP whales have been withdrawing funds off of the leading crypto exchange Binance amid a wider cryptocurrency market correction, suggesting growing accumulation for these tokens.



According to data shared by on-chain whale monitoring service Whale Alert, in two separate transactions whales moved a total of over $28 million worth of XRP off of the leading cryptocurrency exchange to unknown wallets on the XRP Ledger.



The first transaction saw the whales move 26.4 million XRP worth around $13.1 million, while the second one saw the movement of 30.4 million XRP worth over $15 million.







The unknown wallets are likely to be self-custodial wallets controlled by these whales, and such transfers from exchanges to these wallets are known as “exchange outflows.” Investors may choose to withdraw their holdings from exchanges for various reasons, including long-term storage.



Exchange outflows can be perceived as a bullish signal, suggesting potential buying pressure and reduce the supply of the cryptocurrency on trading platforms, meaning growing demand could lead to a price rise.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

However, the data also revealed a contrasting transaction. An inflow of roughly 30.3 million XRP ($15 million) was seen moving onto popular cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp. Exchange inflows, where investors move their holdings onto exchanges, can be seen as a potential bearish indicator, hinting at possible selling intentions.



As reported, a cryptocurrency analyst has recently revealed he believes the price of the native token of the XRP Ledger is set to soon vastly outperform the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) over a key technical indicator.



The analyst revealed that on a monthly timeframe the price o XRP in BTC is in “reversal territory.” Per his words the XRP/BTC monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at its lowest level ever, and in the last two occasions it dropped so significantly XRP rose 5,251% and 498% against the flagship cryptocurrency.



The analyst noted, however, that he can see “many potential positive catalysts coming for XRP,” and that once something changes its narrative then “sentiment can change extremely quickly.”

Ethereum ETFs: ProShares Latest to Seek SEC Approval


							

SEC adds ProShares’ Ethereum ETF filing, highlighting ETF traction in crypto regulation.



ProShares aims to replicate success with Ethereum ETF after SEC’s spot ETH futures approval.



Uncertainties surround ProShares’ Ethereum ETF as SEC evaluates risks and merits.




ProShares has filed an application for an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), the latest move in a flurry of activity that signals growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies.



The Securities and Exchange Commission has acknowledged the filing and will begin a review process, potentially paving the way for yet another investment vehicle tied to Ethereum (ETH). This follows the SEC’s recent approval of eight other Ethereum-related ETFs.



While the SEC’s initial approval of 19b-4 filings from eight asset management firms for spot Ether ETFs on U.S. exchanges marked a milestone, ProShares aims to distinguish itself with a unique Ethereum-focused offering.







ProShares established itself as an early player in the cryptocurrency ETF market by obtaining SEC approval for a spot investment vehicle connected to ETH futures. The asset manager hopes to duplicate the success it had with its Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which is listed under the ticker BITO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca, by utilizing its knowledge and experience.









Despite the promising prospects, uncertainties loom over the fate of ProShares’ Ethereum ETF offering. While the SEC’s decision to seek public comments on the application signals progress, the timeline for final approval remains ambiguous. Experts anticipate a deliberative process, with the commission evaluating the merits and potential risks associated with the proposed ETF before reaching a verdict.ProShares’ Ethereum ETF filing, accepted by the SEC, is a reflection of the evolving relationship between regulatory frameworks and cryptocurrency markets. While the path to final approval is still uncertain, the emergence of diverse investment options highlights the growing acceptance of digital assets like Ethereum in the mainstream. The stage is set for further innovation and the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional investment avenues, with stakeholders closely monitoring developments.

Elon Musk Drops ‘Founding Agreement’ Lawsuit Against OpenAI - Decrypt

Telsa CEO Elon Musk has dropped his lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman. Musk’s decision to drop the lawsuit comes the day before a federal judge was set to decide whether the case should be dismissed or allowed to move forward, according to a report by CNBC.In court documents filed in San Francisco Superior Court on Tuesday, attorneys for Musk requested the breach of contract lawsuit be dismissed without prejudice, which leaves open the possibility of refiling at a later date. The move was not accompanied by any public statements by Musk.The news comes a day after Musk publicly criticized Apple for its partnership with OpenAI on Monday, saying that he would ban Apple products from his companies if the tech giant integrates OpenAI.In March, Musk sued OpenAI, Altman, and OpenAI president Greg Brockman for breach of contract, saying that the ChatGPT developer had abandoned its original mission of developing AI for the “benefit of humanity, not profit.”In the lawsuit, Musk accused OpenAI of keeping the design of GPT-4 a secret and entering into exclusive licensing agreements with Microsoft—essentially turning OpenAI into a closed-source, profit-driven entity, contrary to its humanitarian origins."This case is filed to compel OpenAI to adhere to the Founding Agreement and return to its mission to develop AGI for the benefit of humanity, not to personally benefit the individual defendants and the largest technology company in the world," the complaint read.The referenced “Founding Agreement” has not been released, although Musk's lawsuit cited the company's California Certificate of Incorporation, which it said required that the company's technology “will benefit the public and the corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit when applicable.”The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person,” it continued.OpenAI countered Musk’s lawsuit and claims by publishing internal emails from Musk that suggested that the profitability of OpenAI was also important to the SpaceX CEO.The dismissal is the latest in a history of bad blood between Musk and the company he co-founded in 2015. Musk has claimed responsibility for the success of OpenAI."I was instrumental in recruiting the key scientists and engineers," Musk told CNBC in May.Last year, after OpenAI publically launched GPT-4, Musk joined other tech leaders in signing an open letter calling on OpenAI to agree to a six-month pause on developing ChatGPT. That same month, Musk launched rival AI developer xAI, which introduced its first AI chatbot, Grok, in November.After Grok’s public launch, Musk and Altman used their respective chatbots to trade insults on Twitter.“Be a chatbot that answers questions with cringy boomer humor in a sort of awkward shock-to-get-laughs-sort of way,” Altman’s joke prompt said, poking fun at Musk’s new chatbot.“Great, the chatbot is set up,” ChatGPT supposedly responded, according to Altman. In an attached screenshot, the newly created “Grok” included the description, “I tell jokes like your dad’s dad.”Musk shot back, using Grok to call out OpenAI’s polished programming.“GPT-4? More like GPT-Snore!” Musk posted. “When it comes to humor, GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”While Musk has withdrawn his lawsuit, OpenAI remains under broad scrutiny over its safety and security posture. Several founding executives have left the company, saying Altman and company leadership were prioritizing “shiny products” instead of cautious AI development.Last month, OpenAI announced a new safety and security committee—although the committee leadership includes Altman.OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Why Bitcoin's Soaring Open Interest Is a Big Deal for Crypto


							

Bitcoin’s open interest hits $18.75B, signaling robust market engagement and bullish sentiment.



TD Sequential buy signal suggests potential short-term upward correction in Bitcoin’s price.



Record open interest and technical indicators point to a bullish outlook for Bitcoin.




Bitcoin’s open interest has reached an all-time high of $18.752 billion. This increase signals strong engagement and heightened trading activity across Bitcoin markets, suggesting a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency’s near future. As investors and traders monitor these developments, the rising open interest could foreshadow more significant price movements and increased volatility.







Bitcoin’s price action and open interest are correlated, as open interest is defined as the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, including futures and options, that have not yet been settled. The current rise in open interest, coupled with a relatively stable price, suggests that despite the volatility typical of cryptocurrencies, there is a sentiment that Bitcoin’s value could increase.









This aligns with a buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator, a technical analysis tool used to identify potential reversal points and entry points in price trends. Bitcoin’s price chart, analyzed by crypto analyst Ali, showed a green ‘1’ candlestick and a ‘9’ on the TD Sequential on the hourly charts. This signal suggests that the market may be preparing for a short-term bullish trend.







Source: Twitter



The combination of increasing open interest and positive technical signals offers encouraging news for those invested in the cryptocurrency space. It reflects a broader market sentiment that could drive Bitcoin’s price action, though risks remain.



The current trends in open interest and technical analyses like the TD Sequential serve as crucial barometers for Bitcoin’s short-term financial health. These indicators can help predict market behavior and enhance the trading strategies of those participating in the cryptocurrency market.

Australia’s Blockchain Leader Rebrands: Meet The Digital Economic Council Of Australia (DECA)


								The leading industry association, formerly known as Blockchain Australia, has undergone a comprehensive rebranding.
Now called the Digital Economic Council of Australia (DECA), the organization has broadened its scope to encompass a wider array of digital economic activities, signaling a “transformative leap” towards inclusivity in the evolving tech space.
Strategic Rebranding To Embrace A Broader Vision Aside from Blockchain
Amy-Rose Goodey steps in as the new CEO of DECA, succeeding Simon Callaghan, whose resignation coincided with the organization’s strategic overhaul.

This name change marks a “deliberate move” to embrace blockchain technology and other emerging digital sectors such as digital ID, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.
Goodey, previously the COO of Blockchain Australia, emphasized the necessity of evolving with the industry, reflecting the expanding landscape that now includes digital identities, AI, and the broader spectrum of Web3 technologies.
Under Goodey’s leadership, DECA aims to redefine its focus, catering to a diverse membership that spans crypto and Web3 companies, governmental bodies, charities, and sectors involved in tokenization, payments, and banking. The former COO of Blockchain Australia particularly noted:
Originally, we had a lot of focus on the digital asset businesses who were the primary cohort, but we have expanded significantly… We’ve got digital ID and AI, and obviously, we’ve got Web3, consultants, cybersecurity — all of these different businesses need to feel like they’re reflected in the association.
This initiative seeks to bridge the gap between traditional financial institutions and crypto enterprises, advocating for nuanced regulatory frameworks that “boost innovation” while ensuring “strong consumer protection.”
Aligning With Australia’s New Crypto Asset Regulations
The rebranding comes at a critical time when Australia’s regulatory environment regarding digital assets is tightening, albeit in a structured manner that could help long-term industry growth.
For instance, recent legislative adjustments have seen the prohibition of digital currency and credit card usage for online gambling, aiming to curb financial excesses and promote responsible behavior among consumers.
Kai Cantwell, who serves as the CEO of Responsible Wagering Australia, an independent body for providers licensed to offer gambling services in Australia, noted:
This is an important measure to protect customers, making it easier for people to stay in control of their own gambling behavior.
Moreover, DECA’s transformation aligns with significant developments in the financial sector, such as the approval and trading of Monochrome Asset Management’s Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Australia.

This move is poised to enhance the accessibility and attractiveness of cryptocurrency investments in the region, reflecting a growing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream financial markets.

Shiba Inu ETF Petition Gains Ground With Over 10,000 Signatures Collected | Bitcoinist.com


								With the approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Shiba Inu community have continued to push for a SHIB ETF. The latest development in this effort is a petition to leading Crypto ETF issuer, Grayscale, to launch a Shiba Inu ETF.
Shiba Inu ETF Petition Crosses 10,000 Signatures
In an interesting turn of events, the Shiba Inu community has been able to gather more than 10,000 signatures for its petition to have Grayscale list a Shiba Inu ETF. The petition which was created on the Charge.org website appeals to Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein to look into taking on a SHIB ETF.

The petition lists some of the justifications for such an ETF, with the first being Market Trends. According to the petition, Shiba Inu has emerged as the second-favorite cryptocurrency in the United States, even surpassing Ethereum, which has already received approval from the SEC.
Another justification listed is enhanced accessibility and investment exposure. This is because a SHIB ETF is expected to make it easier for a broader audience of investors to actually participate in the meme coin since it helps bypass hurdles such as wallet creation and direction purchases.
The third justification listed is the Shiba Inu adherence to regulatory standards, as well as ensuring security. The petition argues that since the meme coin is build on the Ethereum blockchain, which has already passed the Howey Test, it is not a security under US law. As a result, the meme coin is already compliant to laws, which could help to boost user confidence.
Last but not least is the Shiba Inu leadership in the crypto space. The meme coin has grown rapidly since 2020 to become one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the space. It is currently the 11th-largest cryptocurrency and boasts one of the strongest communities in the space.

The petition was first created three months ago, in February 2024, seemingly slowing down for a whole. However, with the excitement around the Spot Ethereum ETF approval, it has picked up steam, recording almost 10,500 signatures at the time of writing. In the last 24 hours alone, the petition has seen more than 677 signatures, indicating a rise in excitement.
The petition for a Shiba Inu ETF has now moved on toward its next target of 15,000 signatures. However, it is yet to get a response from Grayscale or CEO Michael Sonnenshein. Meanwhile, expectations are that the likes of XRP or Solana are next in line to get an ETF approval from the regulator.

WIF To Tumble? Analyst Sets $1 Target For Dogwifhat


																Dogwifhat (WIF), the memecoin sensation that took the crypto market by storm during Q1, has followed Bitcoin’s recent downturn. As the dog-themed token faces a price decline of over 10%, some crypto analysts consider that a stop at $1 may be the next target for WIF.

	Related Reading


Is The Hat Still On?
Dogwifhat was the talk of the town earlier this year after becoming one of the leading champions of the Q1 memecoin frenzy. The token had a 95,000% “turbo parabolic” run from $0.004773 to its all-time high (ATH) of $4.58 at the end of March.
Since then, WIF has hovered between the $2.3 and $3.7 price range, briefly testing the $4 resistance level at the end of May. Its most recent performance has led crypto analyst Bluntz to set a $1 target for the memecoin.
In an X post, the analyst and trader stated that WIF’s descent to the $1 prince range is “inevitable.” According to Bluntz’s chart, the token displays a macro five-wave impulse followed by the formation of an a,b,c zig-zag pattern.
To the analyst, “the plan hasn’t changed,” but the b wave “took longer than initially thought.” Additionally, he set the target for the c wave between the $1 and $2 price range, which should offer a “generational buy opportunity” to investors.

Nonetheless, the analyst’s seemingly bearish forecast is based on his previous bullish prediction. To Bluntz, the memecoin will significantly retrace before the “next parabolic leg” that could see WIF reach a new ATH.
According to crypto trader Otsukimi, WIF’s chart exhibits a solid performance. To the trader, it “shows a solid last stand with a trend support alongside the mid of the complicated range.”
Moreover, he considers WIF’s bullish consolidation to be “very wide,” which makes a bounce back from its current levels possible.
Elon WIF Hat
As the week started, Dogwifhat was acknowledged by X owner and ‘Dogefather’ Elon Musk. During a live stream, Musk claimed having heard of the memecoin sensation before changing the topic. “Yes, I have heard of dogWiFihat, dogwifhat,” he said.
The crypto community quickly shared the news and speculated whether Musk liked the token. One user claimed, “You can tell he had more to say but stopped himself.”
Others were expectant of the impact the mention could have in the memecoin’s price. The ‘Musk Effect’ didn’t reach WIF, as the token continued hovering between the $2.65-$2.8 range.
However, Musk’s impact propelled a quickly created dogwifihat (WIFIHAT). The token surged by 6,200% in the hours following the live stream, going from $0.00007048 to $0.004506. WIFIHAT saw a short-lived rally as it shredded over 95% of its gains in the past 24 hours.

WIF has also seen a decline of 14.6% on the last day, trading at $2.44 at the time of writing. This performance represents a 26.3% and 18% decrease in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Nonetheless, the token’s market activity has seen a 76.1% increase in the past 24 hours, with a daily trading volume of $705.6 million.

zkSync's token launch sparks debate: Here's all you need to know - AMBCrypto



The project disclosed 17.5% of the total 21 billion supply would go its early users.
However, the TVL dropped to $133 million amid debate about fairness with the distribution.

Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum [ETH], ZKSync, has announced the date for its token launch.  According to the announcement, the ZK token would launch on the 17th of June.
However, the disclosure seemed to have caused controversy especially, among early users of the protocol. zkSync began development on its Mainnet in 2023.
The fundamentals of the project attracted a lot of users to the network. There was also speculation that the project would reward its community with the ZK token which ZKSync seemed to have fulfilled.
Not everyone is happy
In the announcement  dated 11th of June, the protocol said “ZK is the Endgame.” It also gave information about the token distribution. From the information AMBCrypto got,  17.5% of the total 21 billion supply would go to its community.
In addition, the team and investors would get 16.1% and 17.2% respectively. Others were dedicated to the token assembly and ecosystem initiatives.
Source: ZK Nation
With respect to this, the project disclosed that,
“17.5% of the overall supply will be distributed through a one-time airdrop. The rest will be distributed over time, through ecosystem initiatives, managed by the ZKsync Foundation, and the ZK Nation governance process, to support a growing ecosystem as new users come onchain.”
However, the development did not go down well with some of the early users. At press time, AMBCrypto found series of comments noting that the distribution was unfair.
On X, a certain user with the handle “Caneleo” mentioned that the maximum allocation should have been 20,000 tokens. According to him, this would have allowed ZK to reach some wallets that were considered ineligible.
TVL tanks, but will ZK launch at $1?
At the same time, ZKSync explained how it arrived at the distribution. It noted that 89% of the 17.5% were allocated to those who transacted a substantial figure on the network.
The remaining 11% went to developers, researchers, and the likes. Nonetheless, the clarification did not change the opinions of some of the ineligible users.
Furthermore, the Total Value Locked (TVL) of ZKSync had begun to tank at press time.  The TVL measures the value of assets locked or staked in a protocol.
A few weeks back, the TVL of ZKSync Era was almost $200 million. This surge was caused by the trust that participants had in the protocol that it would yield a good return.
Source: DeFiLlama
However, at press time, the value was down to $133.03 million. The recent decrease implied that users were increasingly withdrawing their assets from the protocol.

Realistic or not, here’s ZK’s market cap in ETH terms

Should this continue, the TVL might drop as low as $100 million. In the meantime, there have been predictions about the ZK token with some saying it could hit $1 at launch.
However, details from Whales Market, a pre-listing platform, showed the price trading at $0.34 as of this writing.

NFT Prices Tumble As Crypto Investors Place Big Bets On Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs


																In a market dominated by optimism surrounding the price spikes of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the non-fungible token (NFT) market has seen a decline in popularity. NFTs, which include digital artwork and collectibles recorded on blockchains, have recently experienced a notable loss of appeal. 
According to a Bloomberg report, Google searches for NFTs have reached their lowest levels since 2021, when these tokens first gained mainstream attention.
Popular NFT Collections Experience Steep Price Declines
A significant drop in sales further highlights the NFT market’s struggles. Researcher DappRadar reveals that NFT sales have decreased by more than six percent to $8.5 billion in the first five months of this year compared to the same period in the previous year. 
This decline starkly contrasts the industry’s peak in January 2022, when it recorded an impressive $17.2 billion in NFT sales within a single month.

	Related Reading


The report further notes that the sentiment surrounding NFTs hit last month when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated steps toward approving exchange-traded funds (ETFs) directly investing in Ethereum. 
In anticipation of this approval, some investors reportedly began reallocating their investments into ETH while divesting from NFTs. 
Nicolas Lallement, co-founder of NFT data tracker NFT Price Floor, explains that capital rotation is common in crypto markets, with Ethereum likely to continue attracting and absorbing market capital, resulting in price drops for other assets like NFTs.
This year, many popular NFT collections have experienced significant price declines. NFT Price Floor reports that prices for these collections are down by 40 percent to 50 percent year-to-date. CryptoPunks, a collection minted on the Ethereum network, is trading around 2021 levels and has dropped by 29% from its lowest point in the previous year. 
Similarly, collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Chromie Squiggle have seen their price floors, based on Ethereum, decrease to approximately half of what they were at the lowest point of last year.
Market Correction Looms
Daniel Maegaard, an NFT collector, confirms that most NFT collections continue to decline or remain stagnant after the peak euphoria observed in 2021. Maegaard has recently sold several blue-chip NFTs, including works by digital artists XCOPY, Hackatao, and Coldie. 
While some NFT art collections, such as XCOPY’s, have posted positive returns over the past 90 days, Lallement says the overall trend points to a market correction.

Amidst the challenges faced by the NFT market, one platform that has shown resilience is the NFT marketplace, Magic Eden. The platform has been gaining market share as trading activity on its platform has increased, as per Sara Gherghelas, an analyst at DappRadar. Although Magic Eden recorded record volume in April, trading activity has since decreased.
In sum, the current state of the non-fungible token market reflects a decline in popularity and prices. While some individual collections have shown positive returns, overall market sentiment suggests a continuation of the NFT market correction.

At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,480, following Bitcoin’s lead, with a sharp 5% drop in the past 24 hours and over 8% in the past seven days.

French Startup Mistral AI Hits $6 Billion with $640 Million Raise


Paris-based artificial intelligence startup Mistral AI has raised €600 million (approximately $640 million) in funding, bringing its valuation to $6 billion.
This new funding round marks the largest for a startup developing large-scale general-purpose AI models outside of Silicon Valley. It also provides the French startup with additional resources to compete with Silicon Valley’s leading AI companies.
Mistral AI Triples Valuation with New $640 Million Raise
A recent report reveals Mistral’s latest funding consists of €468 million ($502 million) in equity and €132 million ($141 million) in debt. Existing backers General Catalyst and Lightspeed Venture Partners are among the biggest investors in Mistral’s new Series B funding round. Arthur Mensch, the co-founder and CEO of Mistral AI, expressed his gratitude for this funding round.


“We are grateful to our new and existing investors for their continued confidence and support for our global expansion. This will accelerate our roadmap as we continue to bring frontier AI into everyone’s hands,” he wrote.

Devendra Chaplot, a researcher at Mistral AI, also echoes Mensch’s enthusiasm for this funding.

“With a $640 million raise at a $6 billion+ valuation, Mistral AI has grown ~3x in valuation since December and ~25x in the last 12 months!” Chaplot stated.

Meta and Google’s DeepMind alumni co-founded Mistral AI in April 2023. The company aims to create foundational models rivaling today’s best-performing models. These include OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3, and Meta’s Llama 3.
Mistral AI has released several models, such as Mistral 7B, Mistral 8x7B, and Mistral 8x22B. The company offers these under an open-source Apache 2.0 license. This license allows unrestricted use and reproduction, provided there’s proper attribution.

The company’s most advanced offerings, like Mistral Large, are proprietary. They are intended to be repackaged as API-first products. Companies can use Mistral Large through an API that they’ll have to pay for according to their usage.
The company also offers a free chat assistant called Le Chat. Meanwhile, Codestral, its first generative AI model for coding, has a restrictive license.
In June 2023, Mistral AI secured €105 million ($113 million) from a founding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. This achievement is particularly noteworthy, considering the funding was secured shortly after the company’s launch. Jean-Nöel Barrot, the former minister in charge of digital transition and telecommunications in France, acknowledged Mistral AI’s achievement.

“Congratulations to the startup Mistral AI which raises €105 million only one month after its creation: a record!” Barrot said.

Investors Bullish on AI Growth Despite Recognized Risks

Investors’ confidence in generative AI startups like Mistral AI is plausible. A recent survey from McKinsey shows that 67% of the respondents expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next three years.
Despite the potential, the survey noted that while businesses begin to see the benefits of generative AI, they also recognize the diverse risks associated with the technology. These can range from data management risks such as data privacy, bias, or intellectual property (IP) infringement to model management risks, which tend to focus on inaccurate output or lack of explainability.

However, KPMG experts believe blockchain technology could solve companies’ challenges in safeguarding their IP and avoiding infringement. Blockchain technology could offer a secure and immutable way to track and manage IP, ensuring attribution and potential royalties for reused content and reducing the risk of IP misappropriation.
For instance, a company could store its IP as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with embedded smart contracts on a blockchain, specifying the terms of use for generative AI. This approach could help prevent unauthorized use of proprietary data and ensure proper credit or compensation. Ultimately, it can help companies leverage artificial intelligence’s benefits while mitigating risks associated with IP protection and legal challenges.

Bitcoin Futures Experience Historic Spike In Net Short Interest As BTC Nears $65,000 Support | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin (BTC) futures are experiencing a surge in net short interest among leveraged funds, although this should not be mistaken for a bearish sentiment among hedge funds. Instead, experts suggest that the increase in short interest is primarily driven by the growing popularity of a market-neutral strategy known as the basis trade.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Fuel Adoption Of Basis Trade Strategy?
The basis trade strategy aims to capitalize on discrepancies between spot and futures markets, and it is believed to account for a significant portion of the short interest observed in nearly 18,000 Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures contracts, according to Bloomberg. 
Ravi Doshi, the head of markets at prime broker FalconX, highlighted the popularity of the basis trade by pointing out that there is currently over $7.5 billion in net-short futures. In contrast, the peak short position in 2021 was only $2 billion.

The basis trade has gained traction in cryptocurrency since the introduction of spot-bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. These ETFs have made it easier for traders to execute the basis trade, as they can buy the ETFs and sell futures representing Bitcoin at higher price levels, profiting from the price differentials.
While there is a rising short interest in futures, demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has also rebounded, with these ETFs collectively holding over $61 billion in assets, according to Bloomberg data. 
However, Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, cautions against attributing the popularity of the basis trade as the primary driver of flows into the ETFs. Lunde emphasizes that organic directional demand is the key source behind the strong ETF flow, rather than traders motivated solely by futures premium arbitrage.
Short-Term Data Reflects Dynamic Market Sentiment
The basis, representing the difference between spot and futures prices, was more significant from late November 2023 until mid-March 2024, averaging around 20% annualized, except for a brief decline in February. 
Since then, the premium has hovered between 11% and 16% in recent weeks before dipping to approximately 6%, according to Lunde.
Despite the significant popularity of the basis trade, it should be noted that short-term ETF flow data may not always be a reliable indicator of investor interest in the asset class. 
Although Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed $15.6 billion in net inflows since their launch in January, recent data shows outflows of $65 million on Monday. 

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the interplay between Bitcoin futures, spot ETFs, and the basis trade strategy provides valuable insights into the dynamics of investor behavior. 
The record short interest in Bitcoin futures, driven by the popularity of the basis trade, underscores the growing sophistication of trading strategies within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is trading at $66,270, indicating a 5% drop in price over the past 24 hours. The downtrend will likely continue, with the token’s last support before a potential retest of $65,000 at $66,300.

DePIN - Overcoming the Challenges for a Decentralized Future - The Daily Hodl


								
 
The recent emergence of DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) offered a unique solution to the various limitations of centralization by presenting a distributed, incentivized system that integrates community-driven blockchain technology.
This decentralized route ensured individuals could participate in owning and managing physical infrastructure without having to rely on centralized providers.
In itself, DePIN’s potential applications cut across many sectors, including the IoT (Internet of Things), cloud computing, supply and logistics and more.
However, DePIN faces its own challenges and potential pitfalls that must be strategically addressed.
Otherwise, we might be looking at a repeat of what happened with Web 3.0 – massive traction but unsustainable adoption.
Let’s explore some of these challenges and see how they directly affect the use, performance and adoption of DePIN solutions.
The scalability bottleneck
DePIN is a strong contender in at least two fields of the blockchain trilemma – the very core of its identity is built on decentralization, and its architecture prioritizes security.
However, one of the biggest challenges that lurks in the shadow of DePIN is scalability.
As DePIN networks grow and expand, the volume of transactions across the blockchain network will also invariably increase.
Also, in sectors like IoT, where integration with the physical world is a fundamental necessity, data has to be constantly uploaded and transactions confirmed in real-time to allow users a smooth, seamless experience.
Unfortunately, the current blockchain infrastructure is simply not ready to handle the sheer scale and size of a fully matured DePIN ecosystem.
To circumvent this limitation, many DePIN projects like Render, Nosana, HiveMapper and Helium launched their networks on the Solana chain since it boasts high transaction speeds 10 times faster than Bitcoin – up to 65,000 transactions per second.
However, Solana is plagued with its problem of performance instability and outages, with more than six major crashes so far.










Limited interoperability
The operational basis of the DePIN remains its ability to integrate, share and exchange data with other applications and blockchain networks.
However, most of the cross-chain and interoperability solutions that exist at the moment (e.g., side chains and zero-knowledge proof cross chains) are limited to only specific blockchain ecosystems.
This is not to mention the new layer of complexity they can introduce to the network due to their resource-intensive nature, which could also potentially contribute to slowing down the network’s processing speed.
Regulatory concerns
Another potential pitfall concerns regulatory compliance. While DePIN’s anonymous nature promotes privacy, it also makes it an ideal breeding ground for spurious projects and money laundering schemes.
With government regulations on many areas of blockchain and decentralization still sketchy, potential users still stand the risk of falling victim to rogue projects.
Many DePIN projects have yet to embrace an open-source model. Hence, there is often a lack of transparency on what is actually happening under the hood.
Is user data secure on the blockchain or is it being siphoned to a remote centralized server? This brings us to another important point.
DePIN theaters
In the early days of Web 3.0 and DeFi (decentralized finance), some projects kept up the appearance of decentralization but were far from being decentralized.
Fast forward to a few years later, we could also see the same patterns.
DePIN theaters are projects that masquerade as decentralized networks and ride on the wave of market trends and user sentiments.
These projects build on centralized infrastructure and rely on conventional providers while presenting a decentralized front to users.
They not only contradict the fundamental tenets of decentralization but also pose a danger to true DePIN projects.
They may also steal users’ funds or mine their data for monetary gain, thus tainting the public image and reputation of DePIN.
Undefined incentive mechanisms
DePIN relies on an incentive-based system to encourage community members to play their parts in the ecosystem by using their physical hardware to contribute to the network.
These rewards often exist as tokens or allocated points.
However, in many cases, these tokens have little or no utility outside the specific ecosystem they are earned, and community members can only spend them on designated items.
There are even DePIN projects without a properly defined incentive mechanism. This may discourage users long-term, causing them to abandon DePIN for other technologies.
What is the way forward
DePIN truly offers massive opportunities to redefine the digital world as we know it.
It could bridge the GPU compute shortfall, enhance data sovereignty and make critical services more affordable without compromising on security.
However, to ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of these advantages, it is imperative to understand that DePIN is still evolving.
As such, like every other emerging technology, there will often be ‘teething problems.’
As DePIN and blockchain technology grow and evolve, a lot of the challenges DePIN is currently susceptible to will be phased out by technological innovation.
However, in the immediate term, there are also proactive steps stakeholders in the DePIN sector can take to ensure a streamlined growth process.
These include better learning resources – DePIN can be a particularly overwhelming sector with many components – adopting an open-source approach to promote transparency and using a defined incentive mechanism.
Also, there is a need for a hardline stance on decentralization – if it’s not running on a decentralized infrastructure, it is not DePIN.
The future is not written in stone. DePIN represents a world where the people control the narrative, and as it evolves to navigate the challenges of the modern world, its potential is limitless.

OKX Sees $630 Million Exodus Amid Mounting Security Concerns as Users Flock to Binance | Cryptoglobe


                                
Popular cryptocurrency exchange OKX has seen over $630 million in outflows over the last seven days as mounting security concerns have seen users head for the exits, with data suggesting they’re moving to leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance instead.



According to data from DeFiLlama, OKX has seen $633.8 million of outflows over the last 7-day period, while leading exchange Binance saw $1.36 billion of inflows over the same period. Other major competitors, including Bitfinex, Robinhood, Bybit, and Crypto.com all saw outflows, while HTX and KuCoin saw minor inflows of $19 million and $1.8 million respectively.



Users are moving their funds off of OKX, as BeinCrypto reported, after two different users saw their accounts get depleted with a “surprisingly similar” method by hackers who managed to breach victims’ two-factor authentication credentials through an SMS risk notification from “Hong Kong.”



According to a security expert on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the attackers then created a new API key, leading investigatiors to believe they then traded the funds for their own gain.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Security researchers at Dilation Effect identified a critical weakness on the cryptocurrency exchange: users can switch from Google Authenticator, a more secure verification method, to less secure options like email or SMS authentication which allowed the hackers to bypass users’ two-factor authentication.



Furthermore, OKX reportedly lacks crucial risk control measures. Unlike other exchanges, OKX doesn’t automatically implement a 24-hour withdrawal ban when users engage in sensitive activities like disabling 2FA or changing login credentials.



Additionally, withdrawals from whitelisted addresses lack dynamic verification based on withdrawal limits, potentially allowing attackers to exploit these loopholes. In response to these concerns, OKX has assured users that they are investigating the incidents and will bear the financial burden if the platform is found to be at fault, although, the exchange has not yet addressed the specific security flaws identified by researchers.

Bitcoin No Longer Electronic Cash? Circulation At 13yr Low


								On-chain data suggests Bitcoin is no longer being used as electronic cash by its userbase as the token’s circulation has seen a steep drop.
Bitcoin ‘Velocity’ Has Plunged To Historical Lows Recently
As explained by CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju in a post on X, Bitcoin’s circulation has recently slowed down. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is “Velocity,” which keeps track of the rate at which the cryptocurrency’s tokens are circulating in the market.

When the value of this metric is high, the coins move around faster on the network. On the other hand, a low value implies tokens are still inside an address long before being transferred.
Below is a chart that shows how the Velocity of Bitcoin has changed throughout its history.

The value of the metric appears to have registered a rapid decline over the last couple of years | Source: @ki_young_ju on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Velocity had been rising during the 2021 bull run and had observed a peak in the middle of the 2022 bear market. Following this top, though, the metric completely reversed its trend as it started sharply going down instead.
This drawdown continued until the last few months of 2023, and the indicator has been moving sideways since then. The chart shows that these low levels that the metric has recently been consolidating are the lowest in around 13 years.
This would mean the cryptocurrency’s circulation rate is the same as in 2011. Now, as for the significance of the recent trend, it may tell us how the current userbase of the cryptocurrency is looking at the asset.
Bitcoin was originally meant to be cash in electronic form that works peer-to-peer (P2P), without requiring any central entity at all. The fact that the BTC tokens are no longer being circulated would imply that they aren’t being used much for monetary transactions. As the CryptoQuant founder puts it,
Despite Satoshi’s vision of “P2P Electronic Cash,” Bitcoin is primarily used as “Digital Gold,” with institutions holding it without frequent transactions.

It’s unclear whether the recent low Velocity is here to stay for BTC, given that the indicator did observe a rapid increase to high values just a few years back.
As the graph shows, the indicator has gone through cycles over the cryptocurrency’s history, shifting between highs and lows. Ju notes Bitcoin will see its velocity “peak someday when BTC is widely used for payments.”
BTC Price
Bitcoin has extended its latest decline as its price is now down to just $66,400. The cryptocurrency’s returns now stand at -8% since the $72,000 high registered on Friday.

In Conversation With Brian Nelson

I think it goes back to a couple of core principles that Treasury has reflected for a long time in its rulemaking. One is, you know, focus on the activity, not necessarily the product, and then based on the activity, making sure that we are building regulatory obligations to meet the risk associated with that type of activity. And certainly, that reflects the really the core of what we do and how we think about our regulations, which is that they need to be risk based and drive risk based behavior. So when you think about, again, these 80s and mixers and you reflect on the fact that they are really both I'm very attracted to elicit actors. But to this is, I think the important point and in terms of like, how do we manage privacy versus anonymity, you have these mixing entities that are not doing meaningful KYC, there's no AML/CFT, there are none of the things that are in place to manage exactly this tension. So it's not that everybody needs to know who you are transacting with. But there has to be a capacity, we think, for a U.S.person to be in a position to FOLLOW U.S.law, and not engage with a sanctioned individual, or a U.S.financial institution to not unwittingly engage in activity that is supporting the building of weapons in North Korea, and the like. So, ultimately, that's the good news is we balanced it, and I think we have sort of the policy framework to balance it. But we recognize that the technology is developing quickly, we recognize that we need to engage closely with industry so that we understand the technology and as we think through potential new regulatory authorities, and, you know, a new definition of financial institution that clearly covers virtual assets, and virtual assets are riders and, and the like that, that we are doing in a way that is informed by what we are learning from, from, frankly, from smart people in this room.

Bitfarms Outlines Defense Plan Against Rival Riot's Ongoing Takeover Bid


																Bitfarms announced on Monday that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a shareholder rights plan, effective immediately, to preserve the integrity of its strategic alternatives review process in response to an unsolicited takeover offer from Riot Platforms Inc.
The plan, commonly known as a “poison pill,” is intended to prevent any party from gaining control of Bitfarms without providing fair value to all shareholders.
‘Poison pill’ Strategy
A poison pill strategy is a defensive measure used to prevent corporate takeovers by making a deal too expensive for the acquiring company. Bitfarms stated that it would issue new stock to existing shareholders, diluting the stake of any entity pursuing a hostile takeover.
Under the Rights Plan, one right will be issued for each common share outstanding as of June 20. These rights will become exercisable if any person or entity acquires 15% or more of Bitfarms’ outstanding common shares without complying with the plan’s “Permitted Bid” provisions.
Permitted Bids must be made to all shareholders, remain open for 105 days, and meet other specific conditions. While the Rights Plan is effective immediately, it requires shareholder ratification within six months.




Bitfarms also disclosed that the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) will defer its consideration of the Rights Plan until it is assured that the appropriate securities commission will not intervene. This deferral does not affect the plan’s adoption or operation, which will remain effective for a minimum of six months from June 10, the date of adoption, unless terminated earlier.
Riot’s Takeover Plans
Riot Platforms made its unsolicited proposal public in May, offering to buy Bitfarms for about $950 million. The company also expressed its intention to request a special shareholder meeting to add independent directors to Bitfarms’ board.
This came after Bitfarms rejected Riot’s takeover approach in April. Riot initially offered $2.30 per share in cash and stock for Bitfarms, approximately 20% above the firm’s share price before the offer was made.
Following an evaluation of the proposal, Bitfarms’ Special Committee of independent directors concluded that Riot’s offer significantly undervalued the company and its growth prospects.
On May 28, Riot acquired a 9.25% stake in Bitfarms, becoming the company’s largest shareholder. Riot further increased its stake by purchasing an additional 1.5 million shares on June 5, raising its total ownership to approximately 12%. By June 5, Riot beneficially owned 47,830,440 shares of Bitfarms.

Trump Wants 'All Remaining' Bitcoin To Be Made In The US


								In a notable gathering at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday (June 11) night, former President Donald Trump met with key figures in the Bitcoin mining industry, affirming his support for the sector and pledging to advocate for its interests both domestically and internationally. Trump expressed a deep appreciation for the role of miners in stabilizing the national energy grid and underscored his readiness to support their efforts from the White House.
Following the meeting, the Trump campaign posted via Truth Social, “VOTE FOR TRUMP! Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC. Biden’s hatred of Bitcoin only helps China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left. We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!”
Trump Commits To Bitcoin
David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine and a notable advocate in Trump’s circle for BTC policy, conveyed the significance of the event on X (formerly Twitter), stating, “Today was a historic moment in our journey towards hyperbitcoinization. The former and next President of the United States gathered America’s hashrate and committed to championing our cause in DC and on the global stage. BTC will THRIVE in the US. Orange Man+Orange Coin= Good.”

The sentiment was echoed by several industry leaders who were present. Brian Morgenstern, Head of Public Policy at Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), highlighted the constructive discussions, remarking, “Great conversation today with President Trump about the importance of Bitcoin mining & energy abundance in the US.”
Jason Les, CEO of Riot, also commented positively on the discussions: “Very good meeting with President Trump on Bitcoin and US energy dominance!!!”
S Matthew Schultz, Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of Cleanspark, shared a personal note, emphasizing Trump’s support for their operations in states like Georgia, Mississippi, and Wyoming, “So. I just ran into a guy that’s a huge fan of Bitcoin and LOVES what we’re doing at Cleanspark in Georgia and Mississippi and Wyoming.”
Adding to the narrative, Zach Bradford, CEO of Cleanspark Inc., underscored the impact of BTC mining on local communities and infrastructure development, “We work hard everyday making rural Georgia and Mississippi communities Great. BTC mining is helping to build the infrastructure of the future and we are working hard to make sure as America’s Bitcoin Miner we have support from our leaders past, present and future.”

The dialogue also covered the political struggles and misconceptions surrounding the mining industry. Amanda Fabiano, founder of Fabiano Consulting and board member at Terawulf Inc. (NASDAQ: WULF), stressed the need for informed political support: “Our industry has faced an enormous amount of political struggle, fueled by misinformation and misguided narratives. Our industry needs politicians that are interested in learning about the benefits of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining.”
Salman Khan, CFO at Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA), added his perspective on the bipartisan discussions, “Today, I met former President Trump to discuss important bipartisan issues that affect our ency. We appreciate the recognition of our industry’s importance and are committed to advocate for its future.”
This meeting comes at a time when the Biden administration and Democratic lawmakers have intensified scrutiny over the environmental impact of BTC mining. Trump’s proactive stance, including his promise to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht and accept BTC and crypto for campaign donations, signals a potential shift in political dynamics that could influence the cryptocurrency industry’s trajectory.
At press time, BTC traded at $67,447.

Why Solana nodes are '10x higher than Ethereum' - founder Anatoly Yakovenko - AMBCrypto



Solana’s founder proposed a mechanism to lower entry barriers to node operations. 
The executive mulled ways of dealing with voting fees to address the issue. 

Solana [SOL] and Ethereum [ETH] leaders have debated various issues in the space for a while. 
Most recently, the Solana Foundation’s clampdown on validators using MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) sandwich attacks caught major attention. 
The Foundation withdrew financial support to some validators to reduce the attacks.  
It emerged that running a Solana validator node is very costly, about $65K per year, which calls for the Solana Foundation to offer financial support in some cases. 
On the contrary, an Ethereum validator costs 32 ETH as a one-off payment, and excludes hardware and other resources. 
Why Solana nodes are 10x costlier
Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko clarified the cost difference on ‘Ethereum’s better investment’ in its consensus system. 
‘Economic barrier for honest nodes participate in consensus on Solana is 10x higher than ethereum atm.  Largely due to the investment Ethereum has made into BLS aggregation for consensus messages.” 
The BLS refers to Boneh-Lynn-Shacham, an efficient signature scheme leveraged by Ethereum. Notably, the scheme can contain several independently verified messages by validators. 
This allows several messages to be aggregated effectively, lowering overall costs. 
As Yakovenko noted, Solana’s current mechanism doesn’t match Ethereum’s technique. However, the founder added that Solana would eventually implement such a system. 
‘Maybe that’s something that Solana will implement eventually, maybe it will be voting subcommittees, maybe nothing. As hardware improves, the lower bound fee to send a message to the entire cluster will drop, so the cost per vote will drop, and the economic barrier will drop as well’ 
However, one user noted that most of the cost was inflated by voting fees and asked how Solana would solve that. In his response, Yakovenko said, 
‘Voting subcommittees would allow lowering the vote fee, and rotating the boxes in/out of the committee, which would reduce the vote load and results in lower vote costs’ 
In the past seven days, 80% of total Solana transactions were related to votes, underscoring their dominance on block transactions. 
Source: Solscan
Since the vote transactions also attract fees like the rest, validators bear the cost. Their higher dominance suggests that voting fees are the main contributor and perhaps barrier to entry into the space. 
It remains to be seen whether Solana will implement the solution as floated by the founder. 
In the meantime, SOL shed 6% as crypto investors de-risked ahead of the FOMC (Federal Open Meeting Committee) meeting. 
SOL hit a low of $145 on the 11th of June, the level last hit in mid-May, as the market rout extended liquidations across the markets.

Historic Bitcoin Move from US Presidential Candidate Donald Trump! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Former US President Donald Trump, who was hostile to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies during his previous presidency, has experienced a major change.
While re-nominated Trump has loudly supported BTC and cryptocurrencies in this election campaign, Trump recently met with a number of Bitcoin miners.


According to Bloomberg, Trump told miners that he would support Bitcoin mining.
Stating that Joe Biden and his administration opposed Bitcoin mining and helped rival countries, Donald Trump promised to support Bitcoin miners and the mining industry if he returns to the White House.





Among the attendees of Trump's meeting with Bitcoin miners was Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining company CleanSpark Inc. and representatives from Riot Platforms were also present.
“I just ran into a guy who is a huge Bitcoin fan and supports what we do at CleanSpark Inc. in Georgia, Mississippi, and Wyoming,” CleanSpark co-founder S. Matthew Schultz said in the X post.


Donald Trump also wrote the following about BTC mining on his social media platform Truth Social:

“VOTE FOR TRUMP! Bitcoin mining could be our last line of defense against CBDC.
Biden's hatred of Bitcoin only benefits China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left.
We want all remaining Bitcoins to be produced IN the USA!!! It will help us become ENERGY MASTERS!!!”

Key Points:




ProShares filed for a spot Ethereum ETF, with BNY Mellon and Coinbase in key roles.



The SEC is reviewing NYSE Arca’s proposal to list and trade ProShares spot Ethereum ETF, with a decision expected in 45 days.



The timeline for final approvals and the launch of ProShares spot Ethereum ETF remains uncertain.




ProShares has submitted an S-1 registration statement for the ProShares spot Ethereum ETF, according to a June 11 filing.



ProShares Spot Ethereum ETF Now Has Updated S-1 Application 4



ProShares Spot Ethereum ETF Updated Registration Statement



The document elaborates on various participants’ roles in ProShares spot Ethereum ETF, with the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) as a pivotal player. BNY Mellon will act as the transfer agent, processing purchase and redemption orders and maintaining ownership records. Additionally, BNY Mellon will be the fund’s administrator and cash custodian.



The filing also details the roles of other key participants. Coinbase Custody will hold the Ethereum, Coinbase Inc. will operate as the prime execution agency, Delaware Trust Company will act as the trustee, and ProShare Capital Management will be the fund’s sponsor. Coinbase Credit is set to function as the trade credit lender, enabling ProShares to borrow Ethereum and cash for transactions that surpass its trading balance.



The document indicates flexibility in these roles, including an initial two-year term for BNY Mellon’s administrator position, with provisions for annual renewals. ProShares reserves the right to add or terminate Ethereum custodians, cash custodians, and prime execution agents as needed. Coinbase also retains the option to resign from its role as a cash customer.




Timeline for Ethereum ETFs Approval Remains Uncertain



Previously, the SEC has acknowledged NYSE Arca’s proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the ProShares spot Ethereum ETF. This proposal, submitted on June 10, is currently open for public comment for 21 days following its publication in the Federal Register. The SEC then has 45 days to approve, disapprove, or extend its review period. If approved, NYSE Arca can list and trade shares of the fund. However, no definitive timeline for the final approvals and launch has been established.



While the SEC has approved the form 19b-4 filings for eight Ether ETFs, the S-1 registration statements, including that of ProShares spot Ethereum ETF, still await approval. Experts remain divided on the potential timeline for these approvals, leaving the launch dates uncertain.

Bitcoin Is 'Still Significantly Undervalued': Finance Guru Bill Miller IV


																In his latest blog post titled “Why I’m Still Betting on Bitcoin,” financial expert and seasoned investor Bill Miller IV, CFA, CMT, Chairman and CIO of Miller Value Partners, reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin. According to Miller, who is the Chairman, CIO of Miller Value Partners and son of legendary investor Bill Miller III, Bitcoin remains in the early stages of a secular transition in global capital and governance perspectives.
Bitcoin: It’s Still Early
Miller’s analysis begins with a reflection on a thesis he first introduced in 2015 in his paper, “A Value Investor’s Case for…Bitcoin?!”. He argued that Bitcoin held potential far beyond its valuation at the time, either as a revolutionary payment network or as a viable alternative to traditional fiat capital.
Fast forward to today, Miller observes Bitcoin’s ascendancy but maintains that its journey is far from over. His current valuation places Bitcoin’s market capitalization at about $1.5 trillion, a figure he considers minuscule compared to the nearly quadrillion-dollar global fiat capital system.

“Despite Bitcoin recently hitting new highs against every fiat currency, I believe Bitcoin today is still significantly undervalued and that the world is likely in the early stages of a secular shift around how humans think about capital and its governance,” Miller writes. He points out the inadequacies of current monetary systems, which are prone to human error and manipulation, often leading to the devaluation of currency through inflation and mismanagement.
Supporting his argument, Miller references “Broken Money” by Lyn Alden, which outlines the historical precedence for superior monetary technologies eventually eclipsing their outdated counterparts. Alden’s analysis suggests that when people are presented with better options for preserving or growing their financial resources, they will invariably gravitate towards those options.
“History shows that the best monetary technology inevitably wins, as people trade inferior depreciating capital technologies for superior ones that better align with users’ goal of preserving or growing their option set over time,” writes Miller. Bitcoin, with its decentralized, transparent, and immutable ledger, offers a robust alternative to the governance-laden fiat systems.
Miller also delves deeper into the technical and philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin, describing it as a “true technological breakthrough.” Unlike traditional monetary systems, Bitcoin operates on a global scale without the need for centralized control, enabling transactions that are resistant to censorship and confiscation. This property alone, according to Miller, radically changes the dynamics of how property rights are transferred and managed across borders and generations.

He also comments on the general public’s struggle to understand and value revolutionary technologies, citing the substantial returns generated by companies like NVIDIA, Google, and Meta as examples of what happens when new paradigms are embraced. “Humans are notoriously bad at contextualizing the relevance and potential of new technologies,” Miller states, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s case is no different.
“This gap is especially wide for groundbreaking concepts of an epistemic nature – that is, inventions that change the way we think about and relate to information and each other. It also explains why NVIDIA, Google and Meta have generated outsized returns relative to other stocks,” Miller states.
In a compelling conclusion to his argument, Miller acknowledges the inherent risks and volatility associated with Bitcoin. As a technology and asset class that is still in its developmental phase, it faces potential shifts in perception and regulatory landscapes. However, he warns that underestimating Bitcoin’s long-term potential could be as harmful as ignoring the early signs of any major technological shift.
“It’s still early,” concludes Miller, suggesting that the journey for Bitcoin is just beginning. He remains confident that as the world continues to grapple with the limitations of fiat currencies and the possibilities presented by digital assets, Bitcoin’s true value will eventually be realized, reflecting its capacity to redefine the fabric of economic systems worldwide. This stance not only reinforces his investment strategy but also serves as a bold forecast for the future of finance.

Top Trader Predicts Final Leg Down for Bitcoin (BTC) Before Rally to New All-Time Highs - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto analyst known for making timely Bitcoin calls believes BTC is due for a final corrective move before an explosion to fresh record highs.
Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 261,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be forming a bull pennant pattern on the three-day chart.










According to the analyst, BTC may see a leg down close to $60,000 to set the stage for a rally above $80,000.
“For now, I’m leaning towards some high time frame BTC consolidation.
Makes the most sense to me, but what’s more concerning is alts are crushed and BTC has barely even sneezed so far.
A pullback into $62,500 which for BTC would only be 12% could be devastating for some other alts.” 
Source: Bluntz/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that Bitcoin will rally close to $87,500 by the end of the year. At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $67,315, down over 3% in the past day.
The crypto strategist is also keeping a close eye on the memecoin dogwifhat (WIF). The analyst says WIF looks bearish and will likely witness a collapse to $1.
Source: Bluntz/X
Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis approach that states that a bullish asset tends to witness an ABC correction after completing a five-wave rally. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to be suggesting that WIF has already completed a five-wave surge when it rose close to $5. The chart also shows WIF dropping to $1.068 to end its ABC correction.
At time of writing, WIF is worth $2.54.

Metaplanet's Stock Surges by 10% After Third BTC Purchase


																Metaplanet, a Japanese company, announced on June 11 a purchase of 23.351 BTC worth about $1.59 million, elevating its BTC holdings to 141.07, worth $9.6 million.
This pro-bitcoin move by Metaplanet triggered a remarkable 10.8% price surge in its publicly traded shares.
Metaplanet Buys 23.351 BTC
The Tokyo-based company, which has earned the nickname Asia’s MicroStrategy, announced that following the latest purchase round, its bitcoin holdings were bought at an average price of 10.27 million Yen, an equivalent of about $65,365.
This recent acquisition follows two previous ones of about 97.85 BTC and 19.87 BTC on April 23 and May 10, respectively. Albeit owning only a tiny fraction of BTC compared to behemoths like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet now stands as the world’s 30th largest corporate holder of the asset.
Following the announcement of the new BTC acquisition, Metaplanet’s stock has jumped by about 10%. Moreover, since unveiling its bitcoin investment strategy on April 9, Metaplanet’s stock has hiked by about 368% from a low of 19 Yen to the current 89 Yen. These price hikes testify to investors’ approval of the move into crypto.




When announcing its BTC strategy, Metaplanet highlighted a few factors behind its decision. Bitcoin is a good hedge against the rapidly surging Japanese international debt burden. Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 261 in early 2024, the highest of all developed countries.
Moreover, bitcoin can be a huge hedge against the rapid depreciation of the Yen. Since January 2021, the Yen has depreciated by about 35% against the USD, while BTC has appreciated over 200% against the Yen in the past year alone. Hence, Metaplanet wants to reduce its exposure to the weakening Yen and take advantage of the potential of BTC.
Corporates Reap Rewards as Bitcoin Surges
As the most prominent cryptocurrency dances slightly above $67K, Metaplanet’s bitcoin exposure boasts an unrealized profit of about 2.5%. These profits come even as BTC trades a few thousand below its all-time high of $73K.
Metaplanet vows to continue expanding its bitcoin reserve. Following the footsteps of MicroStrategy, Metaplanet revealed on May 13 plans to use “a wide range of capital markets instruments” as it increases its BTC reserves.
Like Metaplanet, corporate investors, including MicroStrategy, are reaping massive rewards. Saylor Tracker data reveals that the firm he co-founded has an unrealized profit of nearly $6.5 billion on its BTC exposure.
This trend extends beyond Metaplanet and MicroStrategy. Just yesterday, Canada’s DeFi Technologies added 110 BTC to its treasury, causing an 11% spike in stock prices.

Bitcoin Price Takes a Tumble, But 'Buy the Dip' Calls Spike


							

Bitcoin’s price reacted sharply to the upcoming CPI report.



Experts predict the CPI report could significantly impact crypto prices.



Bitcoin’s recent dip has been met with both skepticism and optimism from analysts.




The United States awaits the release of the May 2024 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, and blockchain analysis platform Santiment predicts Bitcoin (BTC) to react strongly.



In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Santiment stated that experts forecast a 3.4% year-over-year or 0.3% month-over-month increase for the US CPI, due on June 12th at 12:30 pm UTC.







Santiment noted, “If actual numbers are lower than expected, it signals slowing inflation, likely boosting crypto prices. If numbers are higher, it signals persistent inflation concerns, likely causing crypto to drop.”









Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s recent price dip has been labeled a “scam dump” by crypto researcher “gumshoe,” who highlighted similar dips before all four Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings in 2024. The researcher said: 




“BTC dumped 10% in the 48 hours before all of them on FOMC day… it recovered the entire move the market always prices in overly bearish statements, then reverses.” 




Santiment also observed that Bitcoin’s dip below $67,000 triggered a surge in social media buy calls. The firm noted, “Historically, when the gap between sell calls and buy calls narrows, panic and FUD set in, often leading to crypto rebounds.”

Donald Trump Advocates for Bitcoin Miners at Mar-a-Lago Meeting | Cryptoglobe


                                
Yesterday, at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump met with several Bitcoin miners, expressing strong support for the cryptocurrency sector. 



As reported by David Pan for Bloomberg News, this meeting, detailed by Matthew Schultz, executive chairman at CleanSpark Inc., saw Trump positioning himself as an advocate for Bitcoin miners, highlighting their role in stabilizing the energy grid.







Per the Bloomberg report, Trump emphasized his understanding and appreciation of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, during the discussions. According to Schultz, Trump believes that Bitcoin miners play a crucial role in balancing energy supply, a significant endorsement amid the growing scrutiny the industry faces. This statement aligns with Trump’s broader strategy to appeal to a diverse voter base by incorporating digital assets into his campaign rhetoric.



Jason Les, CEO and director of Riot Platforms Inc., also attended the meeting at Mar-a-Lago. Les confirmed the event through a post on X (formerly Twitter), signaling the involvement of major industry players in these discussions.







This meeting comes at a time when Bitcoin miners are facing significant backlash over their environmental impact and energy consumption. Democrats have been particularly vocal in scrutinizing the industry’s carbon emissions and energy use. However, the sector has found a staunch ally in Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who has been a prominent supporter of the crypto industry.



Following the Mar-a-Lago dinner, Trump took to his platform, Truth Social, on June 11 to advocate for Bitcoin mining. He positioned it as a defense against the potential implementation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) by the Biden administration. Trump claimed that Biden’s stance on Bitcoin benefits adversaries like China and Russia and urged for Bitcoin to be produced domestically to enhance U.S. energy dominance.







At a high-profile fundraiser in San Francisco last Thursday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a compelling case for his support of the cryptocurrency industry while criticizing Democratic regulatory approaches. The event, hosted at the Pacific Heights home of tech investors David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, successfully raised $12 million, as reported by attendees to Reuters.



According to Alexandra Ulmer’s report for Reuters, Trump positioned himself as a fervent advocate for cryptocurrencies during the event. Trevor Traina, a tech executive and former U.S. ambassador, noted that Trump described himself as the future “crypto president.” This declaration comes at a time when the cryptocurrency sector is seeking to influence political figures amid increased scrutiny following significant industry bankruptcies in 2022, which exposed fraudulent activities and resulted in substantial investor losses.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Republican National Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon conveyed that Trump emphasized the importance of cryptocurrency and expressed his robust support for the industry. However, Trump did not provide detailed plans regarding his approach to crypto policy.



Trump’s remarks contrast with President Joe Biden’s 2022 executive order aimed at ensuring the responsible development of digital assets. This order prompted agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to develop regulatory guidelines to mitigate risks associated with cryptocurrencies. The Biden administration has also indicated a willingness to work with Congress on a regulatory framework for digital assets.



Robyn Patterson, a spokesperson for the White House, reiterated the administration’s stance, highlighting efforts to balance innovation in digital assets with consumer protection against the risks of new technologies.



Despite San Francisco’s predominantly liberal leaning, Trump has found support among a growing number of venture capitalists and crypto investors in the area, according to the Reuters report. These supporters, including several prominent figures, are concerned about what they perceive as overregulation under the current administration. Jacob Helberg, a Palantir adviser, mentioned that Trump vowed to halt what he described as the “Biden-Gensler crusade against crypto” within an hour of taking office, referring to SEC Chair Gary Gensler.



The event attracted notable attendees from the crypto industry, including executives from Coinbase and the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, known for their significant crypto investments.



David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, who have been vocal about their crypto investments, especially in Bitcoin, hosted the fundraiser in the Pacific Heights neighborhood. The alignment of the crypto community with Trump signals a strategic move driven by concerns over regulatory pressures seen as detrimental to industry growth and innovation.



Last month, Trump endorsed cryptocurrency during a special event for Trump NFT holders at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. He voiced concern over the departure of crypto companies from the U.S., citing a perceived hostility towards digital assets. “If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be here,” he stated.

BingX: the partnership of the crypto exchange for UEFA 2024 is coming

At the beginning of June, the new partnership of the crypto exchange BingX for UEFA 2024 will be activated. 

How the crypto exchange BingX works 
BingX is a crypto exchange that was founded about six years ago, and for about three years it has been undergoing profound renewal.
As of today, it claims to have more than 10 million users in more than 100 different countries worldwide.
However, it is not just a simple crypto exchange, because in addition to allowing spot and derivatives trading on a wide range of cryptocurrencies, BingX also allows trading on other markets.
Probably its greatest strength is copy trading, in addition to its automatic trading systems through bots and grids. 
Copy trading allows you to automatically copy the operations carried out by expert traders active on the platform, so for example you can analyze their strategies to learn how to improve your own performance.
To choose which traders are the most profitable to follow, BingX shows a ranking of the most performing copy traders, based on past profits, risk level, and the number of followers. Of course, it is also possible to examine individual traders one by one to analyze their performance. 
If you identify a profitable trader that you want to copy, it is sufficient to set some options, such as capital allocation and the maximum limit of daily operations, and start the automatic replication of their operations on your own account. 
The partnership
The one with Certik, which will start from mid-June, is not the only partnership of BingX.
The exchange in fact over the years has already signed and initiated several partnerships, among which the most famous is probably the one with the renowned English football team Chelsea FC. For example, in mid-July the team will launch new training kits with the exchange’s logo. 
The Chelsea Football Club is absolutely one of the strongest and most famous football teams in the English Premier League, so much so that it is the fifth most successful team ever in England with as many as 23 official titles won. 
Furthermore, at an international level, it is the second English team for the number of official titles won (9), including 2 Champions League and one Club World Cup.
Another important partnership in the world of sports is with UFC fighters Junyong Park and Da Woon Jung.
Cryptocurrencies and fiat
The exchange supports more than 700 trading pairs, offering a wide range of assets for both spot trading and derivatives trading.
In particular, it supports more than 830 cryptocurrencies, including all the main tokens.
As for deposits or purchases in fiat currency, it offers different payment methods, including those with credit cards.
The choice is therefore decidedly wide, and combining this with the fact of being able to use copy trading offers a very broad service intended for a wide range of users. 
Events and initiatives
BingX actively participates in and also supports various crypto events around the world. 
In addition to those related to the partnership with Chelsea, for example, they have recently been present at the Blockchain Week in Paris, during which the Chief Product Officer of BingX, Vivien Lin, gave a keynote on creating user-centered products.
A few months ago, they were sponsors of the 4th Annual Crypto Summit in Moscow, the largest in the crypto sector in the region.
Furthermore, it often organizes promotional initiatives, such as the SuperX Trading Competition in March, during which it offered a prize of even one million USDT.
The exchange, however, is also active in the education sector, so much so that at the end of 2023 it announced the “Istanbul Financial Literacy” initiative for the students of İstanbul Bilgi Üniversitesi in Turkey. 
So not only does it organize many events and initiatives, but it also does so in different parts of the world, to support the growth of the crypto sector globally. 
Among the various sponsorships are also Art Basel Miami and NFT TAIPEI in the digital art sector. 
A global exchange
Therefore, both for the range of products offered, for the geographical distribution of its users, and especially for the many initiatives it organizes or sponsors around the world, it is a global exchange. 
Furthermore, it is not only a wide-ranging exchange, but also of significant depth, as it allows trading for both users who are still beginners and professionals in the field. 
In fact, in addition to spot trading, copy trading, and the Earn section, it also offers decidedly more professional tools, such as derivatives trading and automatic bots. 
Allows trading of both perpetual futures and futures with expiration, with the possibility of also using leverage and speculating both bull and bear.
BingX also integrates bots that perform operations autonomously based on preset configurations, such as grid bots that take advantage of price fluctuations within defined ranges.

US Inflation Fears Drive $200 Million Outflows from Bitcoin ETFs


Spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw significant daily outflows of over $200 million as uncertainty around US inflation data gripped the market.
Investors reevaluate their positions in risk assets, including Bitcoin ETFs, as inflation fears grow. These developments highlight the intricate relationship between macroeconomic indicators and the crypto market.
Market Anticipation Drives Bitcoin ETF Sell-Off

SoSo Value data shows US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily net outflow of $200.31 million as of June 11. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) were the hardest hit, with outflows of $121 million and $56 million, respectively. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded no flows during the same period.

This shift is notable, as these ETFs had been experiencing positive inflows since May 13. However, outflows began to occur starting on June 10, as market participants anticipated the release of the US May Consumer Price Index (CPI) data today.

Jesse Cohen, a Global Markets Analyst at Investing.com, highlighted the heightened market volatility surrounding the upcoming CPI report. He indicated that a cooler-than-expected CPI report could extend the ongoing market rally. It reassures investors about potential Fed rate cuts in the coming months.

“However, a surprisingly strong inflation reading could trigger market volatility, as it may delay expectations of a rate cut and raise concerns about inflationary pressures,” he added.

Research firm The Kobeissi Letter also weighed in. It noted the divided expectations regarding the CPI data. The firm pointed out that while major banks expect CPI inflation to come in at 3.4%, prediction markets indicate a 17% chance of inflation above 3.4% and a 41% chance below 3.4%.

“CPI inflation above 3.4% [today] would mean that inflation has risen 3 out of the last 4 months,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote.

Mixed economic signals further complicate the outlook for inflation and market performance. For instance, US firms added 272,000 jobs in May, and wages rose at an annual rate of 4.1%, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 4%. This paradox of rising employment and wages alongside increasing unemployment adds to the economic uncertainty.
Matthew Dixon, CEO of crypto rating platform Evai, highlighted the critical nature of the upcoming CPI and Federal Reserve meeting. He acknowledged the genuine risk of higher inflation, which would be positive for the dollar but negative for risk assets, including Bitcoin.

“It’s also possible we see CPI subside and dovish Fed resulting in a boost to risk assets,” he said.


However, Bitcoin’s price historically tends to rebound after FOMC announcements despite initial volatility. Pseudonymous crypto researcher Gumshoe noted this in his recent analysis.

“There have been 4 FOMC [meetings] in 2024. […] BTC dumped 10% in the 48 hours before all of them. On FOMC day, it recovered the entire move. The market always prices in overly bearish statements and then reverses,” Gumshoe outlined.

As the market braces for the impending inflation data, the spot Bitcoin ETF outflows show cautious sentiment among investors. The outcome of the US CPI report and the Federal Reserve’s subsequent actions will likely set the tone for market movements in the near term.

Donald Trump Meets Crypto Miners: Commits Full Support


Former President Donald Trump has publicly expressed his support for crypto miners. This stance was conveyed during a notable gathering at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, hosting key figures from the crypto mining sector.
Trump’s pro-crypto posture could potentially mobilize support among tech-savvy voters and key stakeholders in the digital asset sector. 
Donald Trump Meets With CleanSpark and Riot Platforms Executive

Matthew Schultz, Executive Chairman at CleanSpark Inc., shared insights from the event, during which Trump expressed his understanding and appreciation for crypto. Riot Platforms CEO Jason Les and the head of public policy, Brian Morgenstern, also met with Trump.

“President Trump will protect your right to own Bitcoin, to mine Bitcoin, to transact with Bitcoin, and for many of us, to work in the Bitcoin industry,” Morgenstern said.

Read more: Best Crypto Mining Stocks to Buy or Watch Now

Trump highlighted Bitcoin mining’s role in stabilizing the energy grid and affirmed his support for the sector. Emphasizing energy dominance, Trump pledged to champion these technologies, particularly if he were to return to the White House.

“We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be made in the USA. It will help us be energy-dominant,” Trump said.

These developments occur as crypto miners face intense scrutiny over their environmental impact and the strain they place on local power grids. Trump’s backing could significantly influence public and political perceptions, potentially swaying the broader narrative around the industry.

In February, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) started to collect data on how much electricity crypto miners use. However, this initiative met with strong resistance, leading to a court decision that temporarily stopped the data collection.
Moreover, the Biden administration is taking decisive steps toward regulating digital assets, citing environmental sustainability. A notable measure from the Department of the Treasury proposes a 30% tax on the electricity that crypto mining firms use by 2025, contained within the Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue Proposals. 
Trump, in contrast, is actively engaging with the crypto community to bolster his political comeback. At a recent Libertarian Party convention, he vowed to commute Ross Ulbricht’s sentence and announced his campaign’s acceptance of crypto donations. His involvement was further highlighted during a fundraiser that attracted leading figures like the Winklevoss twins and raised $12 million to support his campaign against Joe Biden.
Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?
Trump’s renewed focus on crypto appears to be a strategic move to attract new voters, positioning digital assets as a key component of his platform. This stance starkly contrasts with the current administration’s approach, which leans heavily towards stringent regulations.

Shiba Inu: Are more losses coming? Analyzing SHIB's key levels - AMBCrypto



Shiba Inu could plummet further if key resistance levels are broken.
Metrics suggested a potential bearish run.

Shiba Inu [SHIB] has experienced a 15.17% drop in the last six days. With its price closing below the 100 EMA support level and opening below it in the current trading session, this indicates a substantial bearish signal.
SHIB’s prices may plummet to $0.000019 support level if the bearish momentum spirals into a breakdown of the price below the $0.0000205 consolidation support level.
As of this writing, AMBCrypto’s look at CoinMarketCap data showed that SHIB was priced at $0.00002215, down 4.36% in the last 24 hours and 7.22% in the last seven days.
SHIB’s market capitalization dropped by 4.21% to $13.08 billion, while the trading volume increased by 21.31% in the last 24 hours.
Source: TradingView
Shiba Inu’s losses strain the chain
AMBCrypto further analyzed Santiment’s daily transaction volume in profits and the transaction volume in profit-to loss ratio. The current drop in the profit bars was a concerning sign.
The ratio data indicated fluctuating volumes of profits to loss, with several spikes in loss volume in the recent price drops. This suggested that more traders were selling at a loss-probably due to panic of further declines.
Source: Santiment
AMBCrypto also looked at SHIB’s Supply on Exchange per Santiment, which showed an uptrend with a recent spike on supply. 
This means increased selling pressure from the investors looking to exit positions — a bearish signal.
Source: Santiment
The stochastic RSI indicator was oversold at 2.49 at press time, suggesting that a likely short-term reversal cannot be completely ruled out. However, the overall trend remains bearish, with SHIB trading below the moving averages during this period.
What’s next for SHIB?
With increased number of spikes in the profit-to-loss ratio, ascending supply on exchanges and decline in transaction volumes in profit, market sentiments for Shiba Inu were bearish, with critical support levels being tested.

The price may continue to plummet further to the $0.000019 support level unless a substantial buying interest or a reversal signal is experienced. 
However, if a reversal occurs in the short term, SHIB may pull back to $0.000024 resistance level.

The rise of presidential and celebrity meme coins - Crypto Valley Journal

Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency inspired by jokes circulating on the Internet. Meme coins are designed to be funny and have no initial intrinsic value. The coin's price is largely driven by internet narratives and community engagement. Their popularity is triggered by viral online content such as tweets, videos or news.One of the first meme coins to be launched and the most notable by market capitalization is Dogecoin (DOGE). The cryptocurrency was created in 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. The coin is famously branded with the image of a Shiba Inu dog. Dogecoin gained cult status and saw its value skyrocket over the past years. Celebrities like Elon Musk endorsed the coin, while some companies such as Tesla even accept DOGE as a payment option. At its peak, Dogecoin reached a market capitalization of over $80 billion. It has since dropped significantly, but is still worth around $20 billion. This highlights the extreme volatility of the meme coin space, but also the sense of opportunity for people, being the main attraction for capital into the meme market.Launching a meme coin on different blockchainsDue to the open-source nature of blockchain technology, creators can fork existing cryptocurrencies with minimal changes, making meme coins relatively easy to create. In addition, there is no need for an attached utility or custom code, nor is there a need to develop a product. This low barrier to entry has led to the proliferation of the meme coin sector, which has experienced significant growth, especially in the most recent cycle. Many meme coins that followed DOGE piggybacked on its success. Other major post-DOGE launches include Shiba Inu, Floki, Baby Doge or Bonk. All of these used a derivative of the Shiba Inu dog as their meme.While the first meme mania happened on Ethereum, there is a shift towards the Solana ecosystem. Compared to Ethereum, Solana has much lower transaction fees. Solana's transaction fees are also not strongly affected by network usage. This is in stark contrast to Ethereum, where transaction fees are usually within a few dollars, but can exceed $50 or even $100 when the network is congested. The low fees encourage trading and make it easier to bring new users into the ecosystem.How Solana captured the lion's share of the meme coin ecosystemA major contributor to the 2024 Meme coin frenzy on Solana was the dApp pump.fun. It has made it much easier to create and invest in small cap meme coins. The platform allows an extremely simplified and cheap approach to launch a coin. Launching a token only costs around 0.02 SOL, which is less than $3, and requires no coding experience. The creator simply fills out a form and uploads an image or gif file. Users of the pump.fun platform act as liquidity providers for the meme coin by buying coins, which increases the token's bonding curve. The bonding curve is a mathematical function that determines the price of a token based on its supply; as more tokens are purchased, the price increases. Once the market cap on pump.fun reaches $69,000, $12,000 of liquidity is automatically deposited into the Solana DEX Raydium and burned.This simplified mechanism eliminates the need to provide an initial liquidity pool and lowers the requirements and therefore the barriers to entry for launching a token. According to Dune, the pump.fun platform has generated over $35 million in revenue and nearly 100 million tokens have been issued through the dApp. All of this happened within 4 months of the dApp's launch in March 2024. Not even an insider exploit by an individual who stole nearly $2 million from the bonding curve contracts in May could stop its growth.Total cumulative number of tokens deployed on pump.fun / Source: Dune AnalyticsMeme coins celebrate their revivalAt the time of writing, the total market capitalization of meme coins is around $60 million, according to data from CoinGecko. Traditionally, Ethereum has been the chain where most of the trading volume takes place, but in early 2021 there were isolated instances where the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) had a strong performance. At that time, the DEX PancakeSwap was able to gain significant volume that it hasn't been able to hold. In 2024, Solana has established itself as a strong competitor to Ethereum in terms of trading activity. Solana surpassed Ethereum in total trading volume in March and again in early June. These surges were mainly due to meme coin trading.DEX volume by chain / Source: DeFi LlamaOther metrics also demonstrate Solana's growth. For example, the total number of active wallets has doubled since the beginning of the year. This indicates an influx of new users. Also, over 15k new tokens and a comparable number of NFTs are being minted on Solana on a daily basis. This shows how actively the blockchain is being used.New SPL tokens / Source: SolscanPresidential and celebrity memesAs alluded to in the introduction, meme coins often start out as jokes or parodies, but can gain significant value and a strong following. Their value is driven by community sentiment, viral marketing and celebrity endorsement rather than basic financial metrics or use cases. This contrasts sharply with the traditional financial perspective which emphasizes fundamentals such as products, design, business models, founding team, or detailed roadmaps. Below are some examples of recent popular memes on Solana.Jeo Boden: $BODEN - a misspelled version of the current US president Joe Biden - experienced monumental success at an all-time high of nearly $750 million in market capitalization. The meme coin is designed to make fun of Biden's mental health. The Boden meme culture taps into Internet trends and even has its own meme lore, characters, and spelling, adding a distinct definition of the community into the mix.Doland Tremp: There are many meme coins around the ex-president Donald Trump and his prominent slogans such as "Make America Great Again". The Tremp coin is one of them and uses the appeal of a prominent cultural or internet figure to drive its popularity. Just like with Jeo Boden, some traders are hoping for additional attention as the election season kicks off.MOTHER Iggy: Australian rapper Iggy Azalea made waves in the cryptocurrency world with the launch of her meme coin, $MOTHER. Unlike most celebrity-driven coins that quickly fizzle out, MOTHER has seen remarkable success. Gaining over 22,000% in value since its announcement, the coin's market capitalization sits at approximately $150 million, driven by Azalea's active promotion and engagement with her fans. HULKMANIA: Not all meme coin launches tied to celebrities are successful. In fact, most of them are simply cash grabs designed to enrich the creator. One stellar example is HULK, a meme coin by professional wrestling icon Hulk Hogan. The HULK coin experienced a rug pull shortly after its release. The token initially soared to a market cap of nearly $19 million before crashing to $1 million just two days later, after a rapid sell-off by token holders. Hogan denied any involvement, claiming that his Twitter account had been hacked or misused to promote the coin.ConclusionMeme coins, fueled by internet culture and community engagement, have become a significant part of the cryptocurrency market. Their ease of creation due to new applications on the Solana blockchain has led their proliferation. Meme coins represent a fascinating intersection of internet culture and financial speculation. From a traditional financial perspective, they are often viewed with skepticism. Mainly due to their speculative nature and lack of intrinsic value. While they offer potential for high returns, they also come with significant risk, demonstrated by the controversy surrounding Hulk Hogan's HULK coin. Most celebrities do not have their fan's best interests in mind, so these coins in particular should be viewed with great skepticism.

Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) Votes on Revised Burn Tax Distribution


							

Terra Luna Classic community votes on revised LUNC burn tax distribution proposal by developer Frag.



Proposal aims to implement the burn tax changes and enhance LUNC staking rewards.



LUNC price falls 5% amid market-wide selloff trading volume and open interests rise.




The Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) community is voting on a proposal to revise the distribution of its burn tax. This pay-per-job (PPJ) proposal, submitted by developer Frag from Genuine Labs, requires community and validator approval to implement changes outlined in proposal 12098, which passed in April.



The proposal seeks to implement a revised burn tax distribution as suggested by the community. Currently, the 0.5% burn tax allocates 80% for burning and splits the remaining 20% between the community pool and validator rewards. The new proposal would change this to 10% each for the Community pool and Oracle pool, effectively redirecting the burn tax portion to long-term staking rewards.



Frag’s implementation plan outlines the technical changes required. This includes updating the ante handler with the new distribution logic, adjusting parameters, modifying proposal types and handlers, and writing unit tests. Additionally, a non-empty upgrade proposal handler will facilitate rollout with a coordinated chain halt. Frag estimates completion within 56 hours at a cost of $3600 in LUNC. The task involves development, local testing, unit tests, testnet rollout and coordination, and mainnet rollout and coordination, with high odds of completion by mid-July.









The proposed change would benefit validators by increasing long-term staking rewards but slightly decrease the APR (around 0.5%) for users. The proposal currently enjoys overwhelming support (99.97%) from validators, including Interstellar Lounge, JESUSisLORD, and StakeBin. However, some top validators haven’t voted yet.As of press time, LUNC’s price reflected broader market weakness, dropping 5% in the last 24 hours to $0.0001024. Despite the price decline, trading volume has increased, with both LUNC and 1000LUNC futures open interest rising. Meanwhile, USTC’s price also fell over 4% to $0.02059, marking a 12% decline over the week.

Donald Trump supports Bitcoin as a ‘shield’ against CBDCs

Recently, former president Donald Trump supported Bitcoin mining, as he believes it is the last ‘barrier’ against central bank digital currencies (CBDC).
Let’s see all the details below. 

Trump sees Bitcoin as the solution to the threat of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) 
As anticipated, the presidential candidate Donald Trump is once again at the center of attention for his growing interest in cryptocurrencies. 
Recently, he indeed emphasized the importance of Bitcoin (BTC) mining. During a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, the former president promised to support Bitcoin mining should he return to the White House.
The meeting saw the participation of various figures from the sector, including representatives from the Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining company, CleanSpark Inc., and Riot Platforms. S. 
Matthew Schultz, co-founder of CleanSpark, shared on X that he met Trump, stating:
“I just met a big fan of Bitcoin who appreciates what we are doing with CleanSpark Inc. in Georgia, Mississippi, and Wyoming.”
At the same time, Trump stated on Truth Social his desire for the United States to produce all the remaining Bitcoin, thus motivating his recent support for the miners. Additionally, Trump criticized the current president of the United States Joe Biden, accusing him of being hostile towards BTC.
Trump emphasized that such a position would only favor countries like China and Russia, and believes that Bitcoin mining represents the last defense against central bank digital currencies (CBDC) developed by other nations.
The activity of Bitcoin mining has long been a subject of debate, particularly for its high energy consumption, criticized by both democrats and environmental activists around the world.
According to reports, the United States is the largest consumer of energy for Bitcoin mining, using an impressive one-third of the global electricity consumption for this activity. The country indeed employs 145.6 GWh per year. 
China is in second place with 81.2 GWh, while Kazakhstan occupies the third position with an annual consumption of 50.9 GWh.
USA: the 2024 elections could decide the future of Solana ETFs
With the approach of the 2024 United States presidential elections, the fate of exchange-traded funds (ETF) on altcoins, such as Solana, could be strongly influenced by the political outcome.
Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shown some leniency, allowing fund managers to list spot ETFs on Ethereum. 
However, the president of the SEC, Gary Gensler, has warned that it will take time before these ETFs are available. Trump’s victory could increase the chances of approval of an ETF on Solana. 
The speculations on the next potential crypto ETFs have already begun, with Solana emerging as one of the main candidates. 
Cathie Wood, CEO and CIO of ARK Invest, stated that major financial institutions will likely focus on leading cryptocurrencies when proposing new ETFs, citing Solana as a possible target.
Franklin Templeton, which manages approximately 1.64 trillion dollars in assets, praised the significant growth of Solana and suggested the possible launch of an altcoin fund: 
“On Solana, we see Anatoly’s vision of a single atomic state machine as a powerful use case for decentralized blockchains, reducing informational asymmetry. And we are impressed by all the activity seen on Solana in Q4 2023: DePIN, DeFi, Meme Coin, NFT, Firedancer.” 
In the meantime, CoinShares has recorded a significant increase in altcoin holdings among hedge funds and asset managers, with particular attention to Solana. 
Considering Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has suggested that his victory could create a more favorable environment for altcoin ETFs. 
Trump could appoint a new SEC commissioner with a more permissive approach towards cryptocurrencies.
According to Balchunas, a Trump victory in the 2024 presidential elections could push ETF issuers to submit numerous new applications to the SEC: 
“If Trump wins, we might see other currencies become ETFs.”

Trump Courts Bitcoin Miners, Assures White House Support


							

Former US President Donald Trump has had a meeting with prominent Bitcoin miners.



CleanSpark Inc. CEO Matthew Schultz praises Trump as a huge fan of Bitcoin.



Brian Morgenstern shares insights on Trump’s support for Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining.




Matthew Schultz, co-founder of Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark Inc., tagged former US President Donald Trump as a “huge fan of Bitcoin.” Following a meeting with Trump, Schultz posted on X about the 2024 Republican Presidential Candidate’s support for Bitcoin.







According to a recent Bloomberg report, Trump met with several Bitcoin miners at Mar-a-Lago on June 11. During the meeting, Trump expressed his enthusiasm for fostering Bitcoin mining, promising to be an advocate for miners in the White House.



Adding to the controversy surrounding President Joe Biden’s anti-crypto stance and Trump’s criticism, the latter stated that he loves and “understands” cryptocurrency. In a previous statement, Trump mocked Biden’s skeptical approach toward cryptocurrency, adding that Biden doesn’t understand what crypto is.



In his X post, Schultz said Trump “LOVES what we’re doing at CleanSpark Inc., in Georgia and Mississippi, and Wyoming.”



Jason Les, the CEO of North American Bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms, had also met Trump at the event. Riot Platforms shared an X post about Les’ meeting with Trump to discuss Bitcoin mining and energy.







Brian Morgenstern, Head of Public Policy at Riot Platforms, also shared insights on Trump’s vow to support Bitcoin mining. He stated, “President Trump will protect your right to own Bitcoin, to mine Bitcoin, to transact with Bitcoin, and for many of us, to work in the Bitcoin industry.”









In the runup to the U.S. presidential election, Trump’s pro-crypto stance made headlines, as he welcomed campaign donations in crypto. His strong opposition to Biden’s anti-crypto policies and advocacy for a convenient regulatory framework has made him a fan favorite of the crypto masses.

ICBC: the largest bank in the world bets on the crypto Ethereum (ETH)

ICBC, the largest bank in the world, claims that the crypto Ethereum represents the driving technical force of the digital future, defining it as “digital oil”. At the same time, it describes Bitcoin as “digital gold”. 
Let’s see all the details below. 

According to the bank ICBC, the crypto Ethereum is ‘the digital oil of the 21st century’
As anticipated, the largest bank in the world, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), is defining Bitcoin (BTC) as “digital gold” and Ethereum (ETH) as “digital oil”.
In a new report shared by Matthew Siegel, head of digital assets at VanEck, the ICBC praises the two main criptovalute by market capitalization.
The report indicates that the market demand for digital assets is robust, driving innovation in the sector.
“The market demand drives the continuous evolution of digital currencies.”
The report compares Bitcoin to gold, highlighting that the cryptocurrency has additional advantages: 
“Bitcoin maintains scarcity similar to gold through mathematical consensus, while simultaneously solving issues related to its divisibility, authenticity, and transportability. Its monetary attributes are weakening, while its asset attributes are strengthening.”
Defining Ethereum as “digital oil,” the report praises the various features of the ecosystem of the leading smart contract platform. Although ICBC highlights some shortcomings of the network, it believes that technological progress will resolve them over time.
“Ethereum has consistently improved its technology in terms of security, scalability, and sustainability, providing a technical foundation for the digital future.”
Sustainability, security, and efficiency
Furthermore, the report reiterates how Ethereum introduces Turing completeness with its unique programming language (Solidity) and the virtual machine (EVM). 
Allowing developers to create a wide range of smart contracts and complex applications, providing strong support to blockchain technology. 
Not surprisingly, says the report, its flexibility is widely recognized in the sectors of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and it is also expanding to physical infrastructure networks (DePin).
“In essence, the Turing completeness of Ethereum allows it to execute any programming instruction with the necessary resources and correct instructions, but it also poses several practical challenges. Looking to the future, Ethereum developers will continue to work to balance sustainability, security, and efficiency.”
Ethereum under pressure: bear forecasts dominate the market
Ethereum, the second cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is going through a difficult period. 
Its price has indeed failed to surpass the threshold of 4,000 dollars, generating concern among traders and investors. 
To better understand the current market dynamics, it is useful to observe the behavior of the participants in the futures market, according to CryptoQuant.
An important indicator is the Taker Buy Sell ratio, which measures the relative aggressiveness of buyers compared to sellers. 
A ratio greater than one indicates that buyers are more aggressive, while a ratio less than one shows greater aggressiveness on the part of sellers.
Examining the 7-day moving average chart of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio for Ethereum, it is noted that the ratio, which has never exceeded one, has collapsed in recent days. 
This indicates that the sellers have been more active in the futures market, continuing to sell short or to cash in the profits from the gains at the beginning of the year.
A drop so marked in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio is not generally a positive sign for Ethereum. In fact, it indicates that the majority of futures traders are bear on Ethereum and expect a further price drop of the cryptocurrency.
In the macroeconomic context, several factors could reverse this trend. Good news, such as new partnerships, technological discoveries, or regulatory approvals, could restore investor confidence and drive up the price of Ether.

Ripple launches the XRPL fund to support the development of XRP Ledger

Ripple has launched a new XRPL Japan and Korea fund, with the aim of supporting the innovation of the XRP Ledger for those markets. From what has emerged, the amount dedicated to this fund will be in the tens of millions of dollars. 

Ripple: the new XRPL Japan and Korea fund that supports the innovation of XRP Ledger
Ripple has announced the launch of its new XRPL Japan and Korea Fund to support innovation of the XRP Ledger in the dynamic Japanese and Korean markets. 

“We are proud to launch the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund to promote innovation and utility of #XRPL in APAC! It includes: Corporate partnerships; Grants for development projects; Investments in startups; Community growth.”
The amount that Ripple has dedicated to this fund is part of the 1 billion XRP, coming from the funds dedicated to XRPL Grantsi and XRPL Accelerator. In the specific case of the Japan and Korea market, the dedicated fund will be tens of millions of dollars. 
The general commitment of the Ripple fund primarily serves to provide financial, technical, and commercial support to developers building on the XRP Ledger. 
Not only that, the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund will provide support to a series of solid initiatives to promote innovation on the XRP Ledger in both countries. 
Among others, Ripple cites corporate partnerships to explore use cases of XRP Ledger in various sectors, investments in startups and also the growth of the community with local events, hackathons, and educational programs. 
Ripple dedicates the new fund for the integration of XRP Ledger in Japan and Korea 
At the moment, both Japan and Korea already host some of the XRP Ledger communities, defined as among the most vibrant and rapidly growing globally. 
In this regard, Emi Yoshikawa, vice president of strategic initiatives at Ripple, said:
“The launch of this fund testifies to Ripple’s strong confidence in the potential of Japan and Korea as fundamental regional hubs for blockchain innovation. It also underscores our ongoing commitment to promoting innovation in the local XRP Ledger communities, and we look forward to seeing the transformative impact of this fund in these vibrant markets”.
Only in this 2024, Ripple has already approached these two markets by supporting projects that use XRP Ledger. 
Specifically, announced in May 2024, Wave 7 of the XRPL Grants program saw projects based in Japan and Korea, VWBL and Moai Finance, secure funding to continue building and scaling on the XRP Ledger.
The Oro and Argento tokens developed on XRPL
Recently, the digital finance company, Meld Gold, announced that it will launch the Gold and Silver tokens developed on XRP Ledger (XRPL). 
In practice, the company would have chosen the XRPL to tokenize gold and silver, as part of the rapidly growing market of Real World Asset (RWA). 
In the third quarter of 2024, the stablecoins anchored to gold and silver, developed on XRPL, will therefore be launched.

Ledger’s Ian Rogers Explains Why the Expected Approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC Is ‘Incredibly Exciting’ | Cryptoglobe


                                
Yesterday, during a conversation on “Bloomberg Crypto,” Ledger Chief Experience Officer Ian Rogers shared his enthusiasm about the potential approval of a US-listed spot Ether ETF. This development is seen as a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency market, and Rogers provided insights on its implications and potential impact.



Rogers described the potential approval of a spot Ether ETF as “incredibly exciting,” noting that it represents a major game-changer for the industry. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. SEC has already had a profound effect on the market, and a spot Ether ETF could further catalyze growth and adoption. However, Rogers emphasized that predicting the exact outcomes is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the market and the aggressive price targets set by financial institutions.



“We’ve seen the price targets come out of some of the financial institutions, which are quite aggressive,” Rogers commented. He acknowledged the complexity of the market and the numerous factors at play, making it difficult to forecast precise movements. Despite this uncertainty, Rogers expressed his optimism and personal investment interest, stating, “We’re excited and watching closely, and personally, I’m buying.”



The discussion also touched on how the approval of a spot Ether ETF could enhance the use of Ethereum in the broader crypto ecosystem. Ethereum, known for its versatility and ability to support various applications through smart contracts, stands to gain significantly from increased institutional interest and investment.



Rogers highlighted the transformative potential of Ethereum, particularly its role in securing and building on blockchain technology. He pointed out that the current market cycle offers abundant and inexpensive block space, largely thanks to Ethereum’s layer 2 solutions. This development contrasts with the previous market cycle in 2021, where such capabilities were limited.



“Ethereum is an incredible tool for securing chains that we can all build on,” Rogers stated. He referenced a recent debate between Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake and Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko, which underscored the ongoing discussions about the long-term applications and advantages of different blockchain platforms.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Rogers says the conversation underscored the vibrant and evolving nature of the crypto space, with numerous tools and platforms available for startups and developers. Rogers expressed optimism about the future applications that will emerge in the next market cycle, given the enhanced capabilities and resources now available.



“What we have now, and what every startup has, is many different tools to work with,” Rogers noted. This variety of tools and platforms opens up new possibilities for innovation and development in the crypto industry. The approval of a spot Ether ETF could further stimulate this innovation by attracting more investment and interest in Ethereum and its ecosystem.

In the same interview, Rogers talked about the critical role of self-custody in the world of cryptocurrency. He highlighted the fundamental reasons why self-custody is essential and its broader implications for digital ownership.



Rogers emphasized that self-custody is at the heart of the crypto revolution. He posed a compelling question: if not for self-custody, why engage with crypto at all? He believes that the true innovation of blockchain technology lies in the concept of digital ownership, which is only meaningful if individuals have secure and direct control over their digital assets. This mirrors the broader internet revolution, where information became freely accessible and movable.



Self-custody ensures that digital assets are safe and available when needed. According to Rogers, this is more than just an option; it is a right. Rogers thinks that just as people can store their physical possessions in a personal safe, they should have the ability to securely store and use their digital assets. This analogy extends to everyday items like passports and driver’s licenses, which individuals control and use for various purposes beyond their initial issuance. Similarly, self-custody of digital assets allows for flexible and autonomous usage.



Rogers also touched on the interplay between AI and blockchain, describing them as complementary technologies. He said that while AI contributes to digital abundance by generating content and data, blockchain ensures digital scarcity, providing a secure and verifiable record of ownership and transactions.

Shiba Inu's Decentralized Exchange Adds Crucial User Tool


								DEXTools, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) analytics platform, has announced the integration of ShibaSwap, the decentralized exchange (DEX) of cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB). This strategic collaboration, unveiled on Wednesday, marks a significant step forward for ShibaSwap by providing its users with sophisticated analytics and real-time trading data.
DEXTools stands out in the DeFi space with its comprehensive suite of analytical tools that cater to a vast array of decentralized exchanges. It tracks approximately 3.5 million tokens and handles data from millions of users each month.
The platform’s main offerings include detailed insights into token metrics, liquidity pool statistics, trading volume analysis, and price movement tracking across various DEXs. Additionally, DEXTools allows users to perform token swaps directly within its interface, facilitated by its proprietary DEXT utility token which unlocks premium features.
What The Tool Offers Shiba Inu Users
With this integration, ShibaSwap gains access to a robust array of analytical tools that will empower its users with enhanced capabilities to monitor and analyze market trends in real-time. These tools are crucial for traders who require detailed and up-to-the-minute data to make informed decisions, optimize their trading strategies, and manage risks more effectively.

The integration also enriches the user experience on ShibaSwap by providing advanced charting tools, real-time alerts, and a more intuitive interface. These additions are expected to make the platform not only more user-friendly but also more appealing to both novice and experienced traders looking for an edge in the increasingly competitive DeFi market.


ShibaSwap itself has undergone significant development since its inception in 2021, particularly with its recent migration to Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 scaling solution. This move has improved transaction speeds and reduced costs, further enhancing the platform’s utility and user experience. The upgrade has introduced new features such as enhanced dashboards and trending token discovery charts, making it easier for users to navigate and exploit the DeFi ecosystem.

Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous lead developer of the Shiba Inu project, expressed his enthusiasm about the collaboration with DEXTools: “Happy to see Dextools support Shibaswap! Keep up the momentum as we move into summer.” This sentiment highlights the positive impact expected from the integration in bolstering the capabilities of ShibaSwap.
This integration is a part of the broader “Shibarium homecoming” initiative aimed at consolidating all Shiba Inu-related projects into a unified ecosystem. The partnership with DEXTools is expected to draw more users to ShibaSwap by offering a more comprehensive, efficient, and insightful trading platform. This move not only solidifies ShibaSwap’s position in the DeFi market but also enhances its transparency and reliability, thereby fostering greater trust within its community.
At press time, SHIB traded at $0.0000221.

A new report by European law enforcement agency Europol cast aspersions on cryptocurrency mining, calling the burgeoning industry vulnerable to money laundering and financial frauds.What Happened: The 56-page report on encryptions and data privacy accused the mining industry of being a soft target for "criminal actors."To illustrate, the report cited cases where mining rigs were used to buy cryptocurrency equipment from criminal proceeds–a case of money laundering."Even when such purchases were not profitable, criminals can still run such mining operations as it can be a cover for illicit earnings," the report underlined. Moreover, it can fetch them profits if they mine new cryptocurrencies.Europol added that such activities were observed in mining pools, especially those targeted by ransomware attackers.The report further highlighted the growing menace of cryptojacking – a cyber attack that exploits a target computer to illicitly mine cryptocurrencies. Put simply, this method steals a miner's processing power for which they make huge capital investments.The agency also flagged specific examples where attackers used mining pools to run Ponzi schemes. The BitClub Network, which promised earnings from non-existent pools, scammed investors of millions of dollars.Why It Matters: The scathing criticism comes even as former President Donald Trump warms up to Bitcoin BTC/USD miners to build support for his presidential bid. Trump had a meeting with miners at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday, meeting top executives from mining giants like Riot Platforms Inc. RIOT and CleanSpark Inc. CLSK.In an unprecedented endorsement, the Republican challenger said via his Truth Social account, "Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC." He joined the chorus, demanding all remaining Bitcoins be mined in the U.S.Read Next: Shiba Inu Spot ETF Petition Crosses 10K Signatures: Wishful Thinking Or Inevitable Reality?Photo by Parilov on Shutterstock

Donald Trump reportedly pledges support for Bitcoin miners in White House


    After making cryptocurrencies one of the main considerations of his campaign in the upcoming presidential elections, former United States President Donald Trump has pledged to champion Bitcoin (BTC) miners in the White House if he secures the presidency.



Indeed, Trump recently met with several Bitcoin miners at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on June 11 and has told them that he loves and understands the crypto sector, according to Matthew Shultz, executive chairman at a major crypto mining company CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK).







Furthermore, Shultz said that the former US president had expressed his belief that miners of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset can assist in stabilizing energy supply from the grid, a stance he promised to advocate for if elected in the White House. 







On top of that, Trump has also met with Jason Les, the CEO and director of Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), another one of the biggest blockchain companies in the world, which operates mining facilities that validate transactions on blockchain networks, primarily for Bitcoin, according to his X post on June 11.







Shortly after, Trump posted on his Truth Social account that Bitcoin mining might be “our last line of defense against a CBDC,” referring to a central bank digital currency, adding that he wanted all of the remaining Bitcoin to be “MADE IN THE USA!!!” as it would help the country be “ENERGY DOMINANT!!!”

Trump v. Biden: Crypto issue



As a reminder, the (repeat) presidential hopeful has significantly shifted his position toward crypto assets in the past years, moving away from the view that they “are not money” and “can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity,” as he argued back in 2019.



However, he has since done a 180 on the matter, recently stating he was “fine with crypto,” pointing out at the differences on this issue between him and his rival in the presidential race, the incumbent US President Joe Biden, as well as starting to accept campaign donations in digital currencies.







At the same time, Biden has apparently made a surprising change in relationship with the crypto industry as well, as his team has started to approach key crypto industry participants, seeking insights and advice on “crypto community and policy moving forward,” as Finbold reported on May 30.

ProShares Quickly Emerges As Spot Ether ETF Contender - The Defiant

The firm filed 19b-4 and S-1 forms with the SEC on June 7 and June 11.ProShares, an issuer of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managing $70 billion in assets, has quickly emerged as a major contender in the race to bring spot Ether ETFs to market.On June 11, ProShares filed an S-1 registration statement for a spot Ethereum ETF. The filing came one day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged ProShares’ 19b-4 application, which it submitted just a few days earlier on June 7.“SEC just added the ProShares' Ethereum ETF Filing to its website,” said James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg. “That is extremely quick. Instinct initially says this won't launch on day one with the other ETFs whenever that is but who knows. This is interesting.”“Looks like ProShares entering spot ETH ETF race,” tweeted Nate Geraci, co-founder of ETF Institute. “Was always surprised they didn’t launch spot BTC ETF.”Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) would act as administrator, cash custodian, and transfer agent for ProShares’ spot Ether ETF. Coinbase would provide custody, execution, and credit services to the fund. Delaware Trust Company would serve as trustee, and ProShare Capital Management is the fund’s sponsor.Coinbase Credit will serve as the company’s trade credit lender, allowing it to borrow Ethereum (ETH) and cash for certain transactions that exceed its trading balance.Bank of New York Mellon will serve as transfer agent, processing purchase and redemption orders and maintaining fund ownership records.The filing also details previously disclosed roles, including BNY Mellon’s role as administrator and cash custodian, Coinbase Custody’s role as Ethereum custodian, Coinbase Inc.’s role as prime execution agency, Delaware Trust Company’s role as trustee, and ProShare Capital Management’s role as sponsor.The news comes after the SEC approved the 19b-4 filings from eight prospective spot Ethereum ETF issuers on May 23. The move paves the way for the Ether ETFs to begin trading once the SEC also approves their S-1 registration statements, which the regulator has indicated will take place in the coming months.The SEC’s 19b-4 approvals comprised an abrupt change of heart from the SEC, which had appeared to exhibit hostility towards the applicants in the months leading to the May deadline.ProShares launches leveraged ETFsProShares’ spot Ether ETF bid coincided with the firm launching 2x leveraged long and short ETFs offering exposure to Ether.On June 7, the ProShares Ultra Ether ETF (ETHT) and ProShares UltraShort Ether ETF (ETHD) debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. ETHD was the first 2x short Ethereum ETF to enter the market, while ETHT followed Volatility Shares’ 2x Ether ETF (ETHU) launching on June 4.

Support for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) from the World's Largest Bank! - Bitcoin Sistemi


The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the world's largest bank, included the largest cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum in a recent report.
Defining BTC as “digital gold” and ETH as “digital oil”, ICBC pointed out how fast cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are growing.


Comparing BTC with gold, the giant bank said, “Bitcoin solves the problems of gold being difficult to divide, difficult to determine its authenticity, and inconvenient to transport, while also maintaining gold-like scarcity through mathematical consensus.”
Afterwards, ICBC described Ethereum as digital oil. Arguing that ETH has an important role in providing strong support for many Web3.0 innovations, including the launch of stablecoins, the bank stated the following in the report:






“Ethereum is providing the technical power for the digital future by constantly improving its technology in terms of security, scalability and sustainability.
Additionally, the launch and development of stablecoins provides a bridge for connecting the digital currency market to the real world.”

“State-owned banks in China continue to speak highly of Bitcoin and Ethereum,” said VanEck digital asset research manager Matthew Sigel regarding ICBC's latest report on Bitcoin and Ethereum. said.

Binance Delists Pairs, Invests in AI-Enhanced Layer-2 Token


Binance Labs, Binance’s venture capital arm, has made a strategic investment in Zircuit, a Layer 2 network. Zircuit integrates a zero-knowledge rollup with artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance security, aiming to protect users against smart contract vulnerabilities and malicious threats.
However, Binance Labs has not disclosed the amount and other investment terms.


Zircuit’s architecture merges established rollup frameworks with zero-knowledge proofs. It claims this results in a high-speed, low-cost solution that remains fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 

“Through its integration of sequencer level security, Zircuit is providing a more secure L2 solution, and we look forward to watching it grow and develop further,” Yi He, Head of Binance Labs said.

Indeed, crypto hackers primarily focus their attacks on the Ethereum blockchain. A report from Immunefi indicates that during May 2024, Ethereum and BNB Chain were the most frequently attacked networks, representing 62% of the total financial losses. Ethereum experienced nine separate security breaches, accounting for 43% of the total damages incurred across all networks.

“We’re innovating on top of a deep technical foundation, and making Ethereum safer for the next billion users,” Dr. Martin Derka, Co-Founder of Zircuit, said.

As Zircuit prepares for its mainnet launch this summer, it boasts over $3.3 billion in staked assets. Its “Build to Earn” program has attracted over 1,100 participants.
Hence, the community is buzzing, anticipating a potential airdrop to reward early adopters following the mainnet launch. 

“Zircuit could be the next big airdrop. It’s still under the radar for most, but crypto whales (quietly) are farming it on Pendle, Fluid, and other protocols,” DeFi researcher Ignas said.

Furthermore, Binance has updated its trading operations. After a routine evaluation, several trading pairs, including ALPACA/BTC and QUICK/BTC, have been delisted due to low liquidity and trading volume. 
These changes, effective from June 14, 2024, at 03:00 UTC, aim to maintain a high-quality trading market. Despite the delistings, users can continue trading these pairs’ base and quote assets on other available pairs at Binance.

As PEPE loses 15.92% in 7 days, Is THIS a potential support level? - AMBCrypto



Rising volume combined with the price decrease might drive a lower value for the memecoin.
If a reversal occurs, PEPE could jump to $0.000014.

The last seven days have been tough for memecoins including Pepe [PEPE]. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of the token was $0.000012.
This represented a 15.92% decrease in the last seven days.
However, it does not seem like things would change for the better. One reason for this could be linked to PEPE’s increasing volume.
At press time, the was $1.22 billion. An increase in volume means that interest in a particular cryptocurrency is increasing. On the other hand, a decrease in volume suggest less buying and selling.
No way ahead for the memecoin
If volume increases alongside the price, it means that there is a lot of buying going on. In this case, the uptrend could be strengthened.
However, while PEPE’s volume increased, the price fell, indicating that the downtrend could get stronger. If this continues, the price of the token might tumble, and a target of $0.000020 could be possible.
Source: Santiment
A few days ago, AMBCrypto reported that whales were buying the dip. In non-crypto terms, a whale is an individual that possesses large quantities of a cryptocurrency.
Because of their large holdings, whales have the capability to influence price significantly. However, the effect of the accumulation has yet to reflect on the memecoin’s price.
As a result, we went ahead to check if selling was still intense or not. To do this, we looked at the exchange flow.
According to Santiment, the exchange inflow was 5.63 billion. On the other hand, PEPE’s exchange outflow was $5.67 billion. Exchange Inflow tracks the number of tokens sent to exchanges.
An increase in the Exchange Inflow, most times, lead to a price decrease. However, if the exchange outflow increases, it means market participants are choosing to hold the cryptocurrency.
Source: Santiment
Hence, the difference in the inflow and outflow was minimal. Therefore, the token might not undergo another correction.
PEPE’s price eyes $0.000010
As such, PEPE might not fall below $0.000010. However, if the market condition gets overheated, bearish forces might lead the price lower.
From the technical perspective, AMBCrypto analyzed the token on the 4-hour chart. First off, we looked at the Fibonacci retracement tool, which shows a specific support and resistance point.
This could be vital to the price movement of the token. At press time, the 0.236 Fibonacci level was at $0.000010. This was a support level for PEPE, and indicates that the price might drop to the region.
This was also supported by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). At press time, the MACD was positive.

But the 12 EMA (blue) and 26 EMA (orange) were in the negative region, implying that the momentum was not completely bullish.
However, if buying pressure increases, PEPE’s price could key into the $0.000014 resistance where the 0.618 golden ratio resided.

MetaMask Adds 'Pooled Staking' for Cheaper Ethereum Validation

Staking on Ethereum conventionally requires users to tie up 32 ETH with the network, which at current market prices totals some $112,000. "Pooled" services like Lido, Rocket Pool and now MetaMask give more users access to staking by bundling together assets from various people, making it possible for anyone to stake even if they don't have 32 ETH.

Vitalik Buterin Says Ethereum Is ‘ Where Yesterday’s FUD Is Today’s Solved Problem’ | Cryptoglobe


                                
On June 11, Ethereum Foundation co-founder Vitalik Buterin commented on the current state of Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) projects, and more specifically Optimism’s OP Mainnet.



The image he embedded in his post on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) shows a list of L2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, categorized by their stage of development and the type of rollup technology they use (ZK Rollup or Optimistic Rollup). Vitalik Buterin’s post suggests that “stage 1+” L2s are those with robust proof systems that provide strong security guarantees. He welcomes Optimism to this group and expresses his hope that more L2s, particularly those using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs, will soon achieve this level of maturity.



Based on this image, there are currently no ZK-Rollups in stage 2, which is the stage Buterin is referring to when he mentions “proof systems that actually have teeth”. Only Optimistic Rollups like Fuel V1 and DeGate V1 have reached stage 2.







The image is a screenshot from L2BEAT, a website dedicated to tracking and comparing various Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

L2BEAT offers a detailed overview of different L2 projects, covering aspects such as technology, performance, security, and adoption metrics. Their categorization system is designed to help users grasp the diverse approaches to scaling Ethereum and to stay informed about the current status of each project.



Stage refers to the rollup stage based on its featured and maturity:



Stage 0 (“full training wheels”)Stage 1 (“limited training wheels”)Stage 2 (“No training wheels”)



Stage 0: Full Training Wheels



The “Stage 0” designation signifies that the Layer 2 solution is in its initial development phase, marked by several key limitations:



Incomplete Proof System: The mechanism for verifying transactions, known as the proof system, is still being developed.Withdrawal Censorship: There is a risk that users’ withdrawals can be restricted by centralized operators who have permission to control this process.Centralized Upgrades: Updates managed by centralized actors, as opposed to a more decentralized Security Council, provide users with less than 7 days to exit in the event of operator issues or censorship.



Stage 1: Limited Training Wheels



The “Stage 1” status indicates some progression from Stage 0 but highlights areas needing improvement to achieve further decentralization and user assurance:



Restricted Fraud Proofs: Only pre-approved (whitelisted) actors can submit fraud proofs, which limits openness and decentralization.Short Upgrade Notices: Upgrades that are not related to on-chain provable bugs give users less than 30 days to exit, limiting their response time.Broad Security Council Actions: The Security Council’s actions are not strictly limited to on-chain provable bugs, suggesting a need for clearer governance rules.



L2BEAT points out that these stages do not reflect the security of the rollup itself.

Symbiotic launches 'permissionless restaking' protocol, secures $5.8M funding - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Symbiotic, a new restaking protocol, has officially launched and announced a $5.8 million seed funding round led by prominent crypto-native investors Paradigm and cyber.Fund, signaling strong support for Symbiotic’s vision of creating a permissionless and modular framework for networks to customize their restaking implementations.Crypto Briefing previously reported that Lido co-founders Konstantin Lomashuk and Vasiliy Shapovalov, along with venture capital firm Paradigm were secretly funding Symbiotic. The protocol is a direct competitor to EigenLayer, although it has key differences in terms of the security model. Notably, Symbiotic allows the use of a number of ERC-20 tokens and is not limited to ETH and staked Ether derivatives (such as Lido’s stETH).According to its announcement, Symbiotic aims to address the challenges faced by decentralized networks in ensuring adequate security and incentivizing infrastructure operators to adhere to protocol rules. By introducing a neutral coordination layer, Symbiotic enables networks to leverage the security of existing ecosystems, providing a streamlined and safe path to decentralization for projects at various stages of development.One of the standout features of Symbiotic is its highly flexible and modular design, which grants networks unparalleled control over their restaking implementation. Network builders can customize critical aspects such as collateral assets, asset ratios, node operator selection mechanics, rewards, and slashing mechanisms. This adaptability allows participants to opt in and out of shared security arrangements coordinated through Symbiotic, ensuring that each network can tailor its security setup to its unique requirements and goals.Symbiotic’s architecture prioritizes risk minimization through the use of non-upgradeable core contracts deployed on Ethereum. By eliminating external governance risks and single points of failure, the protocol provides a trustless and robust environment for participants. The minimal yet flexible contract design further minimizes execution layer risks, instilling confidence in the platform’s security.Another key advantage of Symbiotic is its capital efficiency, achieved through a permissionless, multi-asset, and network-agnostic design. By enabling the restaking of collateral from diverse sources, the protocol can offer scalable and cost-effective security solutions for networks of varying sizes. An evolving cross-network reputation system for operators enhances capital efficiency and trust within the ecosystem, benefiting network builders and participants alike.Symbiotic’s potential to support a wide array of use cases has already attracted the attention of several notable projects. Ethena, Chainbound’s Bolt, Hyperlane, Marlin’s Kalypso, Fairblock, Ojo, and Rollkit are among the many projects exploring the integration of Symbiotic’s restaking primitives. These collaborations span various domains, including cross-chain asset transfers, zero-knowledge proof marketplaces, and application-specific security requirements, showcasing the protocol’s versatility and broad appeal.
“Symbiotic is a shared security protocol that serves as a thin coordination layer, empowering network builders to control and adapt their own (re)staking implementation in a permissionless manner,” the protocol said.
As Symbiotic enters its bootstrapping phase and begins integrating restaked collateral, the impact of its shared security model could be critical to the decentralized finance sector. With its focus on flexibility, risk minimization, and capital efficiency, Symbiotic has the potential to become a cornerstone of the decentralized economy, empowering networks to achieve greater security and alignment while enabling an inclusive and collaborative ecosystem.

Pepe, Bonk surge despite sell-off in memecoins - CoinJournal



                    

                    
PEPE and BONK look to be defying this outlook with notable gains in the past 24 hours.
Respected crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes a crypto bounce is likely amid multiple macroeconomic events this week.

Pepe (PEPE) and Bonk (BONK) are leading top meme coin gainers today as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu struggle alongside the broader crypto market.
Bitcoin’s sharp declines on Tuesday, coupled with bleeding for Ethereum, Solana and other altcoins, saw the sell-off pressure cascade into memecoins.
Analyst on crypto market outlook
According to crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe, while BTC and altcoins have struggled with downside pressure, a “bottom could be in” amid several macroeconomic events lined up for this week.
It includes the anticipated CPI release, FOMC meeting and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. These are events that could have a notable impact on the broader market.
“The markets have been correcting down as the anticipation of these events usually has a negative relationship with the price action on the crypto markets, especially altcoins. On top of that, Roaring Kitty’s event and GameStop’s correction of last week didn’t have a positive impact on the price action,” he posted on X.
Van de Poppe says a bullish flip is likely given previous market reactions to FOMC meetings.
Pepe price
PEPE traded to lows of $0.00001163 on June 11, hitting the level amid downside pressure across the market.
While the price of Pepe remains below a downtrend line formed after the rejection from around $0.000017 in late May, today’s bounce sees it trade near $0.000013. 
This price level has Pepe up 8% in the past 24 hours after paring some of the early gains amid intense volatility across the meme coin market.
Nonetheless, PEPE looks poised for more upside action if buyers hold the support area.
Bonk price
Bonk (BONK) is the first Solana-based dog-themed memecoin, which went parabolic in late 2023 to help Solana break above the $200 level.
In recent months, this token has lagged newly launched counterparts such as dogwifhat (WIF). However, Bonk remains a top meme coin on Solana and is currently soaring alongside GME.
Price of Bonk is currently at $0.00002872, up 6% in the past 24 hours. BONK soared to an all-time high of $0.00004547 in March this year. 
While down 17% this past week, today’s bounce could spark a new surge.

Tether's EU Exit and the Road Ahead for Stablecoins


                                EU's Ban on Major Stablecoins Sparks Crypto Volatility and Confusion                                The crypto world is preparing for a big change as the European Union plans to ban several major stablecoins, including Tether (USDT), starting July 1st. The new EU regulations, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation, will effectively remove cryptocurrencies like Tether from being traded within the 27-nation bloc. This major regulatory shift is expected to have a noticeable impact on the digital asset markets, causing considerable doubt and challenges as the crypto community adjusts to these new rules.For beginners, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar or commodities like gold. Their stability makes them attractive for traders, investors, and businesses dealing in crypto. However, the EU authorities have growing concerns about the risks they create.The main point causing concern? Lack of transparency and proper backing. Many major stablecoins, like Tether, don't fully back up their digital coins with the assets they claim. This makes them vulnerable to sudden withdrawals and financial instability that could affect the entire crypto ecosystem.EU's MiCA Rules – Tether's Exit and AlternativesEnter the EU's new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rules are a major change aimed at controlling the stablecoin Wild West. MiCA demands issuers hold enough liquid reserves to cover all stablecoins in circulation, go through comprehensive audits, and meet strict capital requirements. In simple terms, this makes them more like heavily regulated banks or money market funds.For Tether, the $60 billion stablecoin giant, meeting MiCA's ambitious standards seems like a distant dream. Its famously unclear reserves are a mix of corporate bonds, other cryptos, and loans instead of solid cash and liquid assets. Achieving MiCA's high standards would expose its entire business model to scrutiny.So from July, Tether will vanish from major EU crypto exchanges like Kraken and Bitstamp, replaced by approved alternatives like Circle's USD Coin (USDC) and Societe Generale's EUR CoinVertible. But can these reliable options fill Tether's huge gap?EU's MiCA Rules Trigger Liquidity ConcernsMarket makers fear a severe liquidity shortage as traders rush from euros into dollars to continue using Tether outside the EU. A divided market split between regulated and unregulated areas could ignite, increasing volatility.Yet, regulators appear unaffected, focused on managing the "crypto-chaos." They argue that bringing transparency and safety around important stablecoins justifies short-term disturbance.Paolo Ardoino, Tether's outspoken CEO, has blasted the EU's "hugely restrictive" rules as overkill that will choke off innovation. He claims their push for banks to fully back and control stablecoins defeats their decentralized purpose.Tether's Transparency Impact – EU's Crypto Policy ShiftCritics argue that Tether brought this on itself through years of lack of transparency about its unclear reserves. Its multi-billion dollar settlements with US regulators highlighted how the largely unregulated model enabled risky practices.As the crypto world prepares for another volatile summer, all attention is on Europe's bold regulatory experiment.

Insider Trading Alert on Solana (SOL) Based Memecoin: Price Dropped by 95 Percent! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While investors in Solana (SOL)-based memecoins continue, a large sell-off in a memecoin caused the price to crash.
Another case of insider trading occurred in the Memecoin market, and the SOL-based memecoin called SPIKE fell by up to 95%.


According to Lookonchain's post, investors who had insider information about the memecoin named SPIKE started selling tokens like crazy shortly after the token was launched.
Insiders received large amounts of SPIKE through multiple wallets. However, he soon sold 292.95 million SPIKEs, equivalent to 29.3% of the total supply, for SOL 7,056 ($1.06 million).





These sales caused the SPIKE price to drop by 95% in a short time. At the time of writing, SPIKE continues to trade at $ 0.00887, with a decrease of 78.8% in the last 24 hours.

“Insiders are selling SPIKE like crazy and the price is down 95%!
Insiders purchased large amounts of SPIKE through multiple wallets.
Then, in a short time, 292.95 million SPIKE (29.3% of the total supply) was sold for 7,056 SOL ($1.06 million).”





What is SPIKE?
Solana-based SPIKE is known as the first documented artwork and drawing by Matt Furie.
Matt Furie is an American comic book artist and illustrator. He is known for creating Pepe the Frog, a character from the Boy's Club series, which was released in 2005. Furie also owns the artwork that inspired the popular memecoin PEPE.

In a Bizarre Statement, Trump Says Bitcoin Should Only be Mined in the US - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Former President Donald Trump is calling for the centralization of Bitcoin (BTC) mining in the United States, arguing it would help the country achieve “energy dominance.” In a post on Truth Social, Trump declared, “We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!!” He further suggested that U.S.-based mining could serve as “our last line of defense” against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and claimed that President Biden’s “hatred of Bitcoin” benefits geopolitical rivals like China and Russia.



The comments came after Trump, who became the first presidential candidate to accept cryptocurrency donations in 2023, met with executives from U.S. mining firms CleanSpark Inc. (NASDAQ: CLSK) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT). The former president’s embrace of Bitcoin mining aligns with his “America First” energy policies but raises questions about the implications of centralizing the decentralized cryptocurrency.



Understanding Bitcoin Mining



Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are created and transactions are verified on the cryptocurrency’s blockchain network. Miners use specialized computers to solve complex mathematical problems, receiving newly minted bitcoins as a reward for their efforts. Currently, a successful miner earns 3.125 bitcoins for adding a block to the blockchain, an amount that is halved roughly every four years.



The mining process is highly energy-intensive, with the Bitcoin network consuming an estimated 176 terawatt-hours of electricity annually worldwide. Profitability depends on factors like the price of Bitcoin, cost of equipment, and access to cheap electricity. As the cryptocurrency has gained mainstream acceptance, publicly traded companies have entered the mining space, with Marathon Digital Holdings ($5.60B), CleanSpark ($3.63B), and Riot Blockchain ($2.88B) ranking among the largest by market capitalization.





Implications of Bitcoin Mining Centralization



While Trump’s call for U.S.-centric Bitcoin mining could bring more transparency and regulatory oversight compared to mining in countries like China, it raises concerns about centralization. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is considered one of its core strengths, with a global network of miners competing to validate transactions.



Concentrating significant mining power within U.S. borders could make the network more vulnerable to government interference or targeted attacks. It may also run counter to the cryptocurrency’s founding ethos of decentralization and power distribution. 







Do you think Bitcoin mining should be centralized in any one country? Let us know in the comments below.

Altcoins Bleed Against Bitcoin: Is the Market Waiting for the ETH ETF?


							

The market lacks a driving narrative, impacting altcoins unless a major catalyst, like the ETH ETF, emerges.



Despite bearish sentiment, whales are accumulating altcoins down 30%-50%, signaling long-term confidence.



Utility-based tokens might be a strategic buy now, anticipating a Bitcoin surge past $100K for a broader market rally.




The much-anticipated “altseason” has yet to arrive, with the total market capitalization of altcoins falling back to December 2023 levels.



Despite the currently bearish sentiment, no major narratives are propelling the market, unlike the ICO boom of 2017, DeFi surge in 2020, or NFT craze in 2023. The absence of such trends suggests altcoins may continue to underperform against Bitcoin unless a catalyst, such as the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs emerge.



As noted by top crypto analyst Ash Crypto, the current market conditions could present a strategic buying opportunity. Altcoins have declined 30% to 50% from recent highs, dampening retail investor interest.







However, whales continue to accumulate, signaling potential long-term confidence. This suggests a prudent strategy might be to focus on accumulating utility-focused tokens and await a Bitcoin breakout above $100,000, which could ignite a broader market rally.









According to CoinMarketCap data, the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment is bearish. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,501.46, down 2.72 % in the last 24 hours. Binance Coin (BNB) is at $605.98, down 2.95%, and Solana (SOL) has dropped 4.46% to $149.33.







Source: Coinmarketcap



XRP’s live price is $0.481372, with a 24-hour trading volume of $1,309,737,077, showing a 0.87% decrease. Cardano is trading at $0.425030, with a 24-hour trading volume of $527,842,682, down by 1.56%. Shiba Inu, priced at $0.000022 with a 24-hour trading volume of $810,863,260, has declined by 1.12%. 



In contrast, Toncoin (TON) has risen 2.27% to $7.03, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 0.98% at $0.139692.

Worldcoin (WLD) Faces Major Support Test - What's Next?


Worldcoin (WLD) price failed to enter the Ichimoku Cloud, indicating a strong resistance at $5. 
The price broke below the 200 EMA last Friday and experienced a 21% decline on a single daily candlestick following this price drop. 
Worldcoin Holds Support Despite Persistent Bearish Trend

This significant price action set the tone for the subsequent bearish trend observed over the analyzed period. Additionally, the price has reverted to reach an important resistance level at $4.45, which served as support in the past and corresponds to a 4-hour Ichimoku baseline plateau. 
Currently, the price has stabilized around the $3.69 mark. Another important Baseline (Ichimoku) plateau that served as a key resistance level during December 2023.

If the price manages to reclaim the $4.45 level and breaks above it, this could potentially shift WLD’s mid-term outlook to a more positive trajectory. Conversely, dropping below $3.69 could push the price down to lower support levels, such as $2.55.

Worldcoin Faces Major Sell-Off
The subsequent weeks from June 2 and June 9 exhibited sharp declines, with prices plummeting to $4.25 and $3.81, respectively. This indicates persistent sell-off pressure and a lack of buying support at these levels.On May 12, the number of active addresses was 1,963, signaling robust user engagement. However, this metric steadily declined, falling to 1,267 by June 9. 
Worldcoin Active Addresses (Ethereum). Source: Santiment
From May 12 to June 12, 2024, Worldcoin’s price plummeted by 34%. Underscoring a period of significant bearish pressure. The number of active addresses declined by approximately 35.1%, dropping back to levels seen in mid-February 2024.The reduction in active addresses suggests a waning interest among users, possibly driven by the declining price and broader market sentiment. This drop in active addresses aligns with the bearish price action, indicating reduced participation and potential exit of market participants.

Strategic Recommendations
Positive Scenario: If Worldcoin’s price manages to reclaim the $4.45 level and break above it, this could potentially shift WLD’s mid-term outlook to a more positive trajectory. This price movement would likely attract new buyers and restore confidence among existing investors, leading to increased trading volume and positive momentum.

Negative Scenario: Conversely, if the price drops below $3.69, this could push the price down to lower support levels, such as $2.55. Breaking this key support level might trigger further sell-offs, increasing bearish sentiment and leading to additional downward pressure.

Outflows Continued in Bitcoin ETFs Before US Inflation Data! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) faced significant net outflows of $200 million on Tuesday, continuing the trend that ended a record streak of consecutive net inflows from Monday.
US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $200 Million Net Outflow Ahead of FOMC Meeting
Grayscale's GBTC led the outflows with $121 million leaving the fund on Tuesday. Ark Invest's ARKB followed with a net outflow of $56 million, while Bitwise's BITB retreated $12 million. Fidelity and VanEck also experienced single-digit net outflows, according to SoSoValue data.


Other funds, including BlackRock's IBIT, recorded no flows on Tuesday, indicating a broader cautious trend among investors.
11 U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs had just ended a 19-day streak of net inflows in which they accumulated $64.93 million on Monday. Despite recent outflows, these funds have generated a total of $15.42 billion in net inflows since their launch in January.






Market participants are now closely watching key economic indicators to be released later this week. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting results and the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will be announced today.
CPI, a key measure of inflation, is expected to rise 0.1% from April, signaling a broader disinflationary trend, according to a report published on CNBC.


The Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting is not expected to bring any surprises, with CME Group predicting a 99.4% probability that the Fed will maintain its current 5.25% to 5.50% interest rate.

Trump calls Bitcoin mining 'last line of defense' against a CBDC


    After reportedly meeting with several Bitcoin (BTC) miners at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, during which he promised support for Bitcoin mining if elected into the White House, former United States President Donald Trump had more to say on the matter.



Specifically, Trump expressed his view that “Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC,” referring to the earlier announced central bank digital currency that many believe threatens the nation’s economy, in a post on his Truth Social account shared on June 12.

CBDC issue in the US



As a reminder, CBDCs have become a point of contention in US politics, with Congressman Tom Emmer warning that they might be “CCP-style surveillance tool” out to “destroy the American way of life” as he was presenting his CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, arguing that:








“With this legislation, we are going to stop unelected bureaucrats in the Biden Administration from using a central bank digital currency that threatens to destroy the American way of life.”




Back in January, the (repeat) presidential hopeful pledged he would “never allow a CBDC,” or digitized or tokenized form of currency issued and regulated by the central bank with the underlying technology possibly involving blockchain, if he returned to the White House, stating that:




“Tonight, I’m also making another promise to protect Americans from government tyranny. As your president, I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.”




CBDCs around the world



Meanwhile, a growing number of countries around the world are actively exploring CBDCs, with over 100 of them in various phases of this process – either research, development, or pilot stage – last year, according to the data acquired by Finbold back in July 2023.



In October, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) announced it was advancing its digital euro project, despite ECB president Christine Lagarde earlier triggering privacy concerns after stating that the Eurozone’s CBDC “will not be completely anonymous.”

Shiba Inu fans petition for a SHIB ETF: Will it be the next big thing? - AMBCrypto



SHIB community pushes for ETF amid Bitcoin and Ethereum approvals.
Solana and XRP ETF possibilities add to market speculation.

With the approval of the spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF in January and the anticipated launch of the Ethereum [ETH] ETF in June, the market is speculating which coin will be the next. 
Amidst the discussions, the Shiba Inu [SHIB] community is buzzing about the possibility of a SHIB ETF.
The petition
The SHIB community has petitioned Grayscale, a prominent crypto ETF issuer, to consider launching a Shiba Inu ETF. 
Interestingly, the petition has gained 10,596 signatures so far, sparking excitement within the community.
The petition launched on Change.org noted, 
“The introduction of a Shiba Inu ETF would symbolize a progressive stance towards cryptocurrency investment, mirroring the market’s dynamism and diversity.”
What’s driving this buzz?
Further justifying the launch of a SHIB ETF, the SHIBARMY highlighted several key points. 
 Firstly, recent Google Trends data reveals Shiba Inu’s remarkable popularity, positioning it as the second most popular cryptocurrency in the U.S., after Bitcoin.
Secondly, the proposed ETF would streamline SHIB investments, bypassing the complexities of direct crypto purchases and digital wallet management. 
Additionally, a SHIB ETF would provide investors with a regulated and accessible avenue for capitalizing on the potential of Shiba Inu. 
They further added, 
“As an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, Shiba Inu notably satisfies the Howey Test criteria, affirming its status as a non-security under U.S. law.”
This highlights SHIB’s strong market demand, investor confidence and growing adoption. 
SHIB isn’t alone!
Well, this wasn’t the first instance of an altcoin sparking excitement about its ETF. 
Notably, CNBC ‘Fast Money’ trader Brian Kelly and Daniel Yan, co-founder of Matrixport, have suggested that a Solana [SOL] ETF could be in the works.
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse further echoed this sentiment during a recent interview at Consensus 2024 who noted, 
“I think it’s just a matter of time, and it’s inevitable there’s gonna be an Ripple [XRP] ETF, there’s gonna be a Solana ETF, there’s gonna be a Cardano [ADA] ETF, and that’s great.” 
Shiba Inu’s market trends
The speculation surrounding a potential SHIB ETF has made a significant impact on its burn rate. 
As per Shibburn data, in the past 24 hours, the burn rate surged by an astonishing 2834.92%, highlighting the heightened interest and activity surrounding Shiba Inu at the time of writing.
Despite the surge in Shiba Inu’s burn rate, the price action appeared largely unaffected, with red candlesticks dominating the daily charts and indicating a 1.17% drop over the past 24 hours. 
This performance was further confirmed by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which remained below the neutral level. 
However, things remain uncertain as, Shiba Inu was observed to be in a consolidation phase, showing no clear signs of a significant upward or downward trend, but rather moving within a relatively narrow price range.

Crypto execs court Labour as UK election looms - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently announced a snap election, placing the country’s political situation into uncertainty and turmoil. In response, crypto executives have turned to the competition to gather support and lobby for clearer crypto regulation.According to a report from Bloomberg, two nights prior to Sunak’s announcement, crypto executives gathered on a House of Commons terrace, mingling with lawmakers over wine and canapes. This event was, according to Bloomberg’s sources, organized by US-based crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc. and its adviser, former Conservative Chancellor George Osborn. This session was claimed to be part of a concerted effort to strengthen ties with British policymakers.While members of both major political parties attended, the crypto industry’s influence campaign has increasingly focused on the Labour Party, given its commanding and steady lead in opinion polls.Sunak’s decision to set the election for July 4 confirmed the wisdom of this approach, but it also highlighted the uncertainty surrounding crypto regulation in the UK, as Labour has not held power since 2010, when Bitcoin was still in its infancy.Labour leader Keir Starmer has remained largely quiet on the topic of cryptocurrencies, leaving industry insiders guessing about his intentions for regulation should his party emerge victorious.Laura Navaratnam, UK policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation, suggested that even Labour may not have a clear stance yet, claiming that while everyone else is “trying to guess” what Starmer’s intentions are for the country’s crypto sector, it’s also possible that Labour does not know “what they think yet.”The upcoming elections in the UK and US, set just four months apart, represent a critical juncture for the crypto industry. Since the previous electoral cycles, the sector has experienced a severe market downturn and intensified regulatory scrutiny. However, the past year has also brought a remarkable resurgence, marked by the approval of Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products in both countries.In the US, the crypto industry is bolstering campaign contributions to crypto-friendly candidates to sustain this positive momentum. Meanwhile, in the UK, the focus has been on cultivating relationships with Starmer and the Labour Party.
“We’re fearful that if the government delays too long in getting a full regulatory package in place, we’re going to be way behind our competitors,” said CryptoUK board advisor Ian Taylor.
The crypto industry’s wish list for the UK includes swiftly introducing comprehensive regulations, reviving the stablecoin legislation proposal, easing restrictions on marketing crypto products, and addressing difficulties in obtaining banking access. However, the fate of these objectives remains uncertain, particularly if Labour takes the reins of government.As the election approaches, crypto executives are also turning their attention to key Labour figures such as Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, and Tulip Siddiq, the shadow city minister. These two figures are likely to oversee efforts to restore London’s status as a global financial hub post-Brexit should Labour secure a win.The crypto industry is also adapting its political messaging to resonate with a potential Labour government. Rather than emphasizing pro-market and pro-competition themes, companies are prioritizing grassroots outreach in Labour strongholds and demonstrating how digital assets can benefit ordinary people.

Shiba Inu Loses 14% In Last 7 Days - Will The Misery Worsen?


																Shiba Inu (SHIB) might be facing its own demise as analysts predict a continuation of its week-long price decline. The meme coin, known for its association with the adorable Shiba Inu dog breed, has lost nearly 14% of its value in the past seven days, raising concerns about its future.

Bearish Signals Fill The Air
Technical indicators often used to gauge market sentiment are flashing red for SHIB. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) currently sit at 38 and 35, respectively. While these values suggest the asset might be oversold and ripe for a rebound, other indicators paint a bleaker picture.
The Elder Ray Index, which measures the strength of buyers versus sellers, has been firmly in negative territory since June last week, indicating a clear dominance of bears in the market.

The current technical outlook for SHIB is bearish. The lack of buying pressure combined with strong selling momentum suggests the price could drop further in the short term. Analysts expect to see SHIB retreating to the $0.000020 mark.
Is The Howl Of The Crowd Fading?
NewsBTC’s analysis also highlights a potential decline in investor interest for the self-proclaimed “Dogecoin Killer”. This waning enthusiasm could be a significant contributing factor to the price drop.
The meme coin’s initial surge to prominence relied heavily on social media hype and community-driven movements. However, with the overall cryptocurrency market experiencing a correction, and meme coins facing increased scrutiny, the “Shiba Army” might be losing some of its steam.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.39 trillion. Chart: TradingView
While the immediate future appears bleak for SHIB, a complete collapse isn’t entirely out of the question. Market sentiment could trigger a price rebound. If bulls regain control and investor confidence returns,
SHIB could potentially climb back up to the $0.000024 mark. However, analysts warn that this scenario hinges heavily on unforeseen market forces and a renewed wave of community support.

SHIB Price Forecast
Meanwhile, with a projected value of $0.00007 by July 12, 2024, the present analysis of Shiba Inu (SHIB) points to a large potential price growth of 226%. But even with this bullish price forecast, the technical indications show that the market is still pessimistic.

The Fear & Greed Index, which pegs high levels of greed at 72, supports this feeling. Shiba Inu’s price volatility over the last 30 days has been moderate at 4.50%. Only 40% of the days have seen increases, suggesting that there hasn’t been much bullish momentum.

FTX's Ghost Token: Can FTT Defy the Odds and Deliver 5X Returns?


							

FTT hit a low of $1.37, crashing by 15% from the weekly high of $1.61.



Analyst Mags argued that FTT would either see a 5X rally or drop to zero.



Targeting a $10 price point, the analyst predicts an “inverse FTX” scenario for FTT.




FTX’s native token, FTT, has plummeted amid the ongoing Bitcoin-led price correction, recently hitting a low of $1.37, down approximately 15% from its weekly high of $1.6109. The token has also declined over 20% from its value a month ago.



However, some market analysts see potential in FTT, betting on significant price growth. In an X post, technical analyst Mags revealed accumulating FTT over the past few weeks, acknowledging that FTT is a “shitcoin” lacking inherent utility to boost its value beyond market speculation.







Despite this, Mags asserted that FTT could experience gains of up to 500% when market conditions improve, arguing that FTT will either see a 5X rally or drop to zero.



Specifically targeting a $10 price point, the analyst predicts an “inverse FTX” scenario for FTT, drawing parallels to FTT’s price of $25 just days before FTX’s bankruptcy. Following the bankruptcy in November 2022, FTT lost nearly 100% of its value, hovering around $1 ever since. Mags anticipates a dramatic comeback for FTT in the current bull market, similar to its previous trajectory.









Specifically targeting a $10 price point, the analyst predicts what he calls an “inverse FTX” scenario for FTT. This outlook is inspired by the fact that FTT traded as high as $25 just days before FTX went bankrupt. Mags is not the only one projecting an “inverse FTX” case for FTT. Analyst Javon Marks suggested as well that FTT is in an oversold trend, based on technical indicators. He projected an impending 270% rally, potentially pushing FTT to the $6 level before any further upward movement.

FED Interest Rate Decision is Expected in Bitcoin Today! At what time will it be announced? Here are the Expectations! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The FED left interest rates unchanged at 5.25-5.50 percent in May. Following the May decision, markets are now waiting for the June interest rate decision.
When Will the June FED Interest Rate Decision Be Announced?
While the fourth FED interest rate decision of 2024 is expected to have an impact on gold, dollar, oil, Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto currencies, the FED will announce its June decision on June 12, that is, today at 21:00 CET.


FED President Jerome Powell will make a statement after the decision.
In Which Direction Are Expectations Concentrating?
Macroeconomic data, which signals that the fight against inflation may last longer than expected, increases concerns that the FED may start interest rate cuts later.





While the probability of the FED not changing interest rates in June is priced at 99.4%, expectations for an interest rate cut in the US this year have now dropped to one or two.
At this point, economists revise the FED's expectation of 3 interest rate cuts in 2024 to 2, while they do not expect the first interest rate cut to be made before September.


However, economists think that the US inflation data to be announced today will be important data for postponing the FED's interest rate cut decision to a later date.
According to LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics Economist Derek Tang, speaking to Bloomberg, the FED sees an upside risk in inflation.





Tang said about this:

“At this point, the interest rate decision means a relaxation process that must be carried out very carefully. “FED members do not intend to stimulate the economy in an undesirable way as a result of excessive easing.”

According to Bloomberg Economics, which provides a comprehensive macroeconomic research service to Bloomberg's Terminal subscribers, this meeting may be the most important meeting of the year, where FED President Jerome Powell will give the clearest clue about the interest rate cut schedule.
Bloomberg economist Anna Wong said that instead of three interest rate cuts in March, she predicts that there will be two interest rate cuts expected on the dot plot today.

While the FED was expected to keep interest rates constant in June, Bitcoin started the critical week with a decline. BTC, which dropped from $69,000 to $66,000 in the last two days, continues to be traded at $67,380 at the time of writing.

Trump met with Bitcoin mining execs at the former president’s Mar-a-Lago resort on June 11.Donald Trump is courting the Bitcoin mining industry in the Republican presidential candidate’s latest pro-crypto push.On June 11, Trump said he wants every remaining Bitcoin (BTC) to be mined within the United States. Trump added that bolstering the domestic mining industry will also serve to promote the country’s energy industry and protect the nation against hypothetical moves to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC)."Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC,” Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. “We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be made in the USA!!! It will help us be energy dominant."Trump also held a meeting with executives from Bitcoin mining companies including CleanSpark Inc., Riot Blockchain, and Galaxy Digital at his Mar-a-Lago residence.Bitcoin’s supply is hard-capped at 21 million coins. Nearly 94% of BTC or 19.7 million coins have already been mined, much of which was produced in jurisdictions offering cheap renewable energy such as China. The final BTC is expected to be mined by the year 2140.Amanda Fabiano, head of mining at Galaxy Digital and one of the meeting’s attendees, tweeted that promoting the Bitcoin mining industry serves to strengthen the U.S. electrical grid and foster job creation, particularly in “small-town” areas."Our industry has faced an enormous amount of political struggle, fueled by misinformation and misguided narratives,” she said. “Today, a representation of Bitcoin miners had the chance to explain that to President Trump.”CleanSpark co-founder, Matthew Schultz, was also present at the meeting. Schultz told Bloomberg that Trump committed to supporting the Bitcoin mining industry should he become re-elected.The news follows President Joe Biden proposing a 30% tax on electricity used for Bitcoin mining, among other regulations aimed at the cryptocurrency industry in March.The Biden administration’s proposed 2025 budget estimated the new taxes could generate nearly $10 billion in revenue next year and more than $42 billion across the next decade. The proposed excise tax targets firms using computing resources to mine digital assets and would be phased in over three years: starting at 10% in the first year, increasing to 20% in the second, and reaching 30% in the third year, effective after Dec. 31, 2024.Despite Trump's pro-mining pronouncements, the former president failed to provide any policy proposals aimed at supporting the U.S. mining sector.Bitcoin halving hits miner revenuesThe cryptocurrency mining sector has recently taken a hit after mining rewards were cut in half by the quadrennial Bitcoin halving event in April.Data from blockchain.com shows that on April 16, the day of the halving, the Bitcoin hash rate peaked at 650 exahashes per second (EH/s), but has since dropped to 593 EH/s — indicating that many inefficient miners have been forced offline due to reduced rewards no longer offsetting their operational expenses.Other miners have been selling off their reserves in a bid to keep afloat, presumably anticipating higher BTC prices in the future. According to CryptoQuant, miner reserves have dropped to their lowest level since July 2021 amid the largest annual drop since 2011.Trump courts crypto industryDespite Trump’s recent pro-crypto pivot, some in the web3 community are skeptical that the presidential candidate would deliver on his promises if re-elected, noting that he failed to introduce permissive cryptocurrency regulations during his four-year term from 2016 through 2020.His recent supportive remarks appear aimed at gaining the favor from the crypto industry ahead of the 2024 election. In 2021, Trump labeled Bitcoin a "scam."Regardless, Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency stance has garnered him support from web3 industry leaders. He reportedly raised $12 million at a Silicon Valley fundraising event on June 6. Last month, Trump also announced he would accept political donations in the form of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin And Gold: China's Largest Bank Highlights Comparable Scarcity | Bitcoinist.com


								Digital assets, like Bitcoin, have ushered in a new era for the cryptocurrency industry by radically changing the financial and technological landscape. Recently,  the world’s largest bank by total assets, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), has applauded the remarkable growth and evolution of digital currencies, emphasizing their transformative potential in the financial landscape. Particularly, the bank focused on Bitcoin, likening its limited quantity and intrinsic rarity to that of gold. 
Bitcoin’s Scarcity Comparable to Gold
ICBC bank lauded digital currencies for their significance in a constantly changing financial environment in its Macro Economy In-depth Analysis. VanEck head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel shared the report on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, calling it a love letter to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The analysis highlights the exponential increase of digital currency types and uses as a result of human beings’ capacity for imaginative belief. According to the report, the ongoing evolution of digital currencies is driven by market demand, as evidenced by the inception of Bitcoin, the creation of Ethereum, and the ongoing investigation of official digital currencies by different central banks.
Furthermore, the bank made a comparison between Bitcoin and gold, claiming that the crypto asset retains a scarcity similar to gold. Given BTC’s mathematical consensus, which addresses its issues of being hard to split, hard to detect authenticity, and cumbersome to carry, this comparison was made. “Its monetary attributes are gradually weakening, while its asset attributes are constantly strengthing,” the report added.
ICBC’s analysis highlights Bitcoin’s limited supply of 21 million coins in keeping with the finite character of gold, which has historically supported its value. With only 21 million coins ever to be produced, BTC, sometimes known as digital gold, has long been praised for its scarcity. Specifically, the crypto asset’s rapid increase in value and popularity over time can be attributed to its scarcity.
This analogy emphasizes how BTC is quickly becoming the modern counterpart of gold as a digital store of value. Additionally, the fact that one of the most powerful financial institutions in the world has acknowledged Bitcoin’s scarcity lends the cryptocurrency more credibility and attraction to both institutional and individual investors.
Ethereum Is Digital Oil
The report also delved into Ethereum’s uniqueness and role in the digital currency landscape. It referred to Ethereum as “digital oil” because of its vital function in enabling decentralized apps and smart contracts in the blockchain network. According to ICBC, Ethereum introduces Turing completeness, in contrast to Bitcoin, with its unique virtual machine (EVM) and programming language (solidity). 

Due to its Turing completeness, ETH can execute any programming instruction as long as the instructions are accurate and have enough resources. Thus, developers can have the ability to create and organize a wide range of intricate smart contracts and applications, hence offering robust platform support for blockchain technology.
ETH’s adaptability has attracted widespread recognition in the domains of Non-fungible tokens (NFT) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and it is progressively expanding to the physical infrastructure network (DePin).

Bearish days are some of the most troubling times in the digital currency ecosystem, and investors tend to lose faith during this period. Drawing on this, Shiba Inu Marketing Lead Lucie has shared some unique things community members can do to weather the current bearish storm.Bear market to-do listIt is worth noting that bearish market days are often characterized by elongated days, wherein Shiba Inu ends the trading day down on the negative. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu has slumped by 0.34% in 24 hours and by more than 15% over the past week.According to Lucie, it is best for longer-term investors to stay away from the market. While away, the SHIB publicist said investors can try to focus on long-term goals. As a community, Shiba Inu’s long-term goal is to hit the one-cent price mark. To achieve this, a lot of SHIB needs to go off circulation through burning, with enough use cases added to the market. Lucie also emphasized the need to educate oneself to get through the bear market. The executive advocated limiting social media exposure where fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) spread, while also pushing for portfolio diversification. Another intention is to stay connected with positive communities while practicing discipline.When needed, Lucie noted that taking breaks is important, with users likely to do better when they reflect on past market cycles.Brighter days triggeredAs a financial market product, it is unlikely that Shiba Inu will stay down forever. With its strong correlation with Bitcoin (BTC), it is also likely to follow any bullish recovery the premier coin might see moving forward.Shibarium, the project’s Ethereum-based layer-2 scaling solution also serves as a major catalyst to watch as Shiba Inu plots a pathway to recovery.

What's Next for Algorand (ALGO) as Millions Hit Order Books?


Algorand’s (ALGO) price reached a monthly low of $0.15 on Tuesday, June 11, despite trading around $0.18 in early June. On-chain analysis examines the token’s potential, highlighting indicators that may drive ALGO’s price action.
In March, ALGO followed the broader altcoin rally, reaching a yearly peak of $0.31. However, as the market fell to the demand of bearish forces, so did ALGO. Is the token ready for respite, or is a further downtrend in the works?
Algorand Sellers on the Sidelines
BeInCrypto examines the Order Books of 11 crypto exchanges to gain insight into this. Employing this metric, one can ascertain whether investors plan to sell off many tokens or buy them.
The Order Books have the “bid” and “ask” segments, as shown below. In simple terms, a bid is a price level at which traders are willing to buy a cryptocurrency. The opposite is ask, which describes prices targeted at selling.
According to data obtained from IntoTheBlock, Algorand investors have placed bids to buy 53.97 million tokens. At an average price of $0.16, those assets are worth $8.09 million.

On the other side of the divide, another set lined up to sell a staggering $80.27 million ALGO. This average asked price was $0.16, meaning the value that could be sold is $12.84 million. 

Therefore, the significant difference between the buy and sell orders indicates that bears are in charge.

Bearish Sentiment Lingers For Algorand
Furthermore, Santiment data revealed that the Weighted Sentiment around Algorand was negative. Weighted Sentiment tracks the level of positive or negative comments about a project. If the metric is positive, it means that the average market participant is optimistic. 
This could lead to increased buying pressure and a possible price increase. Alternatively, a negative reading suggests that most participants share cynical opinions about a token. 
In this instance, it becomes difficult for the price to bounce except on rare occasions where the negative sentiment becomes extreme.

In summary, ALGO may attempt to revisit $0.16. However, the block of sell orders in that region and the bleak outlook may force a rejection. If this prediction plays out, Algorand’s price may slide further.
ALGO Price Prediction: Can It Slide to $0.14? 

Besides the abovementioned indicators, the Global In and Out of Money (GIOM) supports this bearish forecast.  In non-technical terms, the GIOM categorizes addresses based on those making money at a breakeven point and addresses holding at a loss.
With this metric, one can identify support and resistance regions. The larger the group, the more a price level can hold as resistance or support.  
The chart below shows that 1.12 million addresses purchased 2.68 billion Algorand tokens at an average price of $0.19. This means that if ALGO approaches this sell-wall, holders may try to break even. Hence, this could be a resistance point for ALGO, and a rejection to $0.14 may be likely. 
Algorand (ALGO) GIOM and Price Prediction. Source: IntoTheBlock
However, one may need to look for Algorand’s network activity. For instance, the number of zero-balance and active addresses on the network has been increasing since June 10. Precisely, active addresses were 102.670 on June 11. Zero-balance addresses were, however, 37,980 on the same day.

Active addresses estimate the number of users on a blockchain, while zero-balance addresses measure the number of new wallets interacting with a network.
The increase in both metrics may be positive for Algorand. If the number continues to grow, it could invalidate the bearish theory.

In addition, one has to keep an eye on the $0.15 region. This could prevent ALGO from another downturn since millions of holders bought a ton of tokens at that price. 
Beyond that, network activity has been the most intense in the same region this month. If these holders mount pressure on the token at this point, ALGO may bounce toward $0.17.

Crypto trader turns $30M to $17M in two months, loses $13M


    A crypto trader and the formerly largest Ethena (ENA) staker has capitulated with $13 million of mostly realized losses. As fear took over, the investor unstaked a $17 million position built with an initial investment of around $30 million.



Notably, the trader built his position from April 5 to April 10 with four 5 million ENA withdrawals from Binance. According to a Lookonchain report on X, the purchases resulted in a 23.24 million ENA position worth $30 million. The average price was $1.29 per token.



Later, the Ethereum (ETH) address ‘0x886b70db1A5Ec9DA60231D3A059b640dB7f116ed‘ staked the recently acquired ENA, becoming the token’s largest staker, interested in the yield.







However, the strategy backfired, with a consistent two-month price loss since the top when this crypto trader bought the tokens. As a result, he unstaked a then-worth $17.3 million position and sold 19.36 million at a loss. By Lookonchain‘s posting time, the capitulation was worth $14.1 million, with ENA at $0.71.

Ethena whales sell-off since April’s all-time high



It is worth noting that Ethena whales have been selling off their tokens since the all-time high reached in April.



Finbold gathered data from Santiment showing the whale activity of addresses holding between 10 million to 100 million Ethena tokens. Overall, these whales held 459 million ENA on April 8, dropping 33% to 305 million ENA on June 12.

Ethena raises concerns while backed by known crypto traders



Interestingly, at that time, Ethena got in the spotlight, backed by known crypto traders and investors such as Arthur Hayes. The increased attention raised concerns and similarities with Terra (LUNA), backing an algorithm stablecoin, as reported by Finbold in April.



In summary, Ethena is a protocol built on Ethereum that has a governance token, ENA. Ethena aims to be “the internet bond,” providing a synthetic dollar, USDe, and “internet native yield.” 



Nevertheless, it is impossible to know whether Ethena will be a huge success or a drastic failure. Investors engaging with USDe must understand the risks and make conscious decisions moving forward.

Is Bitcoin's bottom in? Indicators suggest the worst has gone for BTC


    The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant drop as this week began, led by macroeconomic fears and Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action. Now, indicators suggest the worst has gone for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies if CPI data and interest rates come as expected.



In particular, BTC reached support in its tighter price range at $66,000, as previously reported by Finbold. A technical analyst highlighted this zone as an ideal entry point to Bitcoin, which was recently achieved.



Nevertheless, the leading cryptocurrency still trades at $67,875 — slightly below the 30-day exponential moving average of $67,957. Moreover, a strong 4-month resistance lies at $72,000, being a level worth watching in the following days.

Bottom signal: Bitcoin exchange reserves and social volume



In this context, the cryptocurrency trader and analyst Ali Martinez reported that nearly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin left crypto exchange reserves in the last 48 hours, for a total of 14,140 BTC. This movement could indicate a positive sentiment and bullish bias for the near future as investors purchase and secure Bitcoin.







From a social perspective, a parody account spotted a bottom signal related to outflows from the Bitcoin ETFs. Finbold collected similar data from Santiment, showing peaks of “ETF outflow” mentioned on social platforms, with BTC price bottoms.



Recently, these mentions appear to be surging again, as some of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) registered outflows of $200 million.

Furthermore, the retail demand for BTC has dropped by 17% while Bitcoin registered low spot trading and on-chain transaction volumes. Technical analysts suggest a positive outlook could fuel a price surge to $100,000 per coin, at a psychological target.



Macroeconomics turmoil: CPI data and FOMC meeting



However, worse-than-expected CPI data and a bearish tone at today’s FOMC meeting could invalidate these analyses.



On that note, the finance market currently expects a 3.5% Core CPI year-over-year (YoY), 100 basis points (bps) below last month’s 3.6% and a 3.4% YoY CPI, equal to May results. The forecasted data is likely already priced in, meaning that better or worse results could impact the markets.



Therefore, crypto investors and traders must remain cautious despite the positive signals of a bottom for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's retail demand falls 17%; Is this a precursor to a massive rally?


    The average demand for Bitcoin (BTC) among retail investors has plummeted to its lowest point in five months, echoing levels last seen in January.



Notably, this previous low was followed by a significant 75% surge over the subsequent two months.



According to data shared by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler on June 10, the average monthly change in demand for Bitcoin among retail investors—those with up to $10,000 in transfer volume—has fallen to negative 17% over the last 30 days.











Adler pointed out that a similar previous drop to negative 18% in January saw Bitcoin’s price increase from $40,000 to $70,000, fueled by the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. This surge pushed Bitcoin to its mid-March all-time high of $73,679.



In May, Adler used the same metric to show that demand had decreased by 31% over the 17 days before May 24, reaching a negative 14.50%. 



He pointed that this drop was likely due to increased interest in GameStop (NYSE: GME) and Ethereum (ETH), possibly because of the initial approval of spot Ether ETFs.



ETF activity and Google search trends



In stark contrast to the declining retail interest, Bitcoin’s trading volume for ETFs has seen a notable increase.



According to a report by Santiment, the combined trading volume for the top seven largest Bitcoin ETFs hit around $2.89 billion, its highest level since mid-May.



This surge indicates a renewed interest among investors, possibly reacting to market dips. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, however, have seen net outflows of $200 million, continuing a trend from Monday that ended a 19-day streak of net inflows.







Additionally, Mike Alfred, a value investor and active crypto commentator, highlighted a disconnect between Bitcoin’s price trends and the decline in organic search engine traffic on Google. 



Despite a spike in searches from Q4 2023 until early January 2024, the trend has been downward since then. This initial spike was primarily due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) preparing to approve the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs.



The substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, coupled with low retail engagement, suggest that institutional interest remains robust. This momentum, combined with potential CPI changes, could indicate that the market is still in the early phase of its next growth cycle. 



Analysts and investors will be closely monitoring for signs of increased retail participation, which could signal a broader market upswing.



BTC 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold



At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $67,412, reflecting a 1.4% decrease in the last 24 hours, while trading volume has surged by 8% to reach $31.3 billion, with a market cap of $1.32 trillion.



While the current low retail demand may seem concerning, historical trends andongoing institutional interest suggest that Bitcoin could be poised for significant growth in the coming months.



As always, careful analysis of market indicators and a long-term perspective will be essential for navigating the dynamic world of digital assets.

9 Must-See Trailers from the Xbox, Ubisoft, and Summer Game Fest Events - Decrypt

While E3 itself might be a memory, many of the traditions around the late, once-iconic gaming expo are still in place. It's June, and big publishers are showing off the goods they have coming up in the next couple of years.Microsoft, Ubisoft, and others have shown off games at both their own shows and at broader shows like the Summer Games Fest in recent days. The showcases this year ranged from lackluster to surprising—especially for Microsoft, who brought a huge slate for its showcase after a very rough first half of the year.These events inundate gamers with tons of trailers, and it can be hard to wade through it all, avoiding the games that you know aren't for you and finding the ones that will surprise and delight you.While we can't tell you which games you're going to like best, though, we can pick out the trailers that we thought were the most exciting from the events. Here's what you can look forward to.Editor's note: All of these games are expected to be traditional "Web2" games without crypto or blockchain elements.Doom: The Dark AgesRelease Date: 2025We'd heard rumors that a medieval Doom game was ready for Microsoft's show for a bit. However, if you were expecting swords and shields instead of chainsaws and shotguns—you're half right! Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel to Doom and Doom Eternal, but there are still plenty of guns; a double-barrel shotgun is the first thing we see the Slayer equipping.Alongside that, though, is a bulky-looking shield emblazoned with the Doomslayer rune. The Captain America-style shield can be thrown and will bounce back to the player. Pull a ripcord, though, and the shield sprouts spinning blades. The trailer also shows off a flying mount and a Doomslayer mech, plus a gun that chews up skulls and spits out the fragments. Stunning.Perfect DarkRelease Date: TBAWe've been waiting for Perfect Dark for a long time. The wait's going to be a little bit longer, but this debut trailer has us salivating. It hints at the story—though those hints may be much larger for fans of the original—but offers a great rundown of the gameplay.From a first-person view, Joanna Dark does some hacking and stealth before breaking out into some fast parkour, running across a wall, and jumping through a window. Once she lands inside, she readies her weapon for both lethal and non-lethal gunplay.So far, all of it looks great, offering gameplay akin to Deus Ex and Mirror's Edge in one package—but it's important to remember that this was a heavily rehearsed gameplay segment, not a demo played live on a stage. But we can't wait to see what The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics are cooking up with this classic Rare franchise.Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake EaterRelease Date: TBAListen, we weren't expecting this, either. While the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater isn't an Xbox-published game, it still made a splash during the showcase. We'd been dreading seeing this remake in action, expecting to see Konami take the cheapest possible path for an easy cash grab since series creator Hideo Kojima has long since split.But it looks like the publisher is taking it seriously, because this trailer has completely upended our expectations. It shows off some solid modern graphics that still hold on to the visual style of the original, and tons of action and hand-to-hand combat. It looks to be much more than a simple up-rez of the original, as it will offer a new control style alongside traditional Metal Gear controls.AvowedRelease Date: 2024Obsidian is one of the most prolific studios under the Microsoft brand, having given us 10 games in the last decade. The team has been at work on Avowed, a first-person medieval RPG, for some time now. Comparisons were made early on to Skyrim, but expect this to be a more focused game. The story takes our protagonist to the Living Lands, which are affected by the Dream Scourge, giving enemies and monsters a creepy-looking sort of glowing infection.You'll have to choose sides and who to trust, and what to do about the Dream Scourge, while fighting with melee, ranged, and magical weapons to survive.FableRelease Date: 2025Another game we've been waiting for word on for what seems like forever is Fable, the reboot of the beloved Xbox RPG series. Playground Games, best known for Forza Horizon, is handling the title, which is set to arrive 15 years after the last core entry.This trailer gives us some story, a little gameplay, and some great visuals. Playground still needs to prove itself when the game is released, but what we're seeing so far is encouraging and hits the right kind of quirky vibe the series is known for.Sid Meier's Civilization VIIRelease Date: 2025We usually prefer a gameplay trailer so that we know what we're getting into with a game, but there are exceptions—and Civilization is one of them. We know roughly what we're getting with Civilization: tech trees, warring nations, diplomacy, and Ghandi dropping nukes. That, and it's not a very fun game to watch, even if it's genuinely one of the most compelling games to play.All we needed from this trailer was the confirmation that Civilization VII is on the way, and when we'll hear more. The trailer ends with the promise of a gameplay showcase in August, and a full release sometime in 2025.Assassin's Creed ShadowsRelease Date: November 15, 2024Assassin's Creed Shadows, releasing this fall, is finally taking us to the setting fans have been begging for since the beginning of the series: Sengoku-era Japan. You'll play as a samurai named Yasuke and an Iga ninja named Naoe, engaging with the series' stealth and action gameplay in varying ways.After some initial trailers, Ubisoft also went in-depth with much longer looks at the game, but this is the particular look that got us ready to dive back into Assassin's Creed again.Silent Hill 2Release Date: October 8, 2024Silent Hill fans have been waiting a long time for a good Silent Hill game. While a few entries have their share of fans, though, nothing has hit like the first three Silent Hill games, especially Silent Hill 2. The game's combination of psychological and survival horror, strange characters, and excellent music left an imprint on fans who never quite let it go.Given that strong emotional connection, initial responses to this trailer have been mixed. But Silent Hill 2 is coming back around, 23 years later—and if it's even half as good as the Resident Evil 4 and Dead Space remakes, then we'll be thrilled.Astro BotRelease Date: September 6, 2024Astro Bot has been a low-key mascot for Sony for a while now. Astro Bot Rescue Mission is seen by many critics and fans as the best game to hit PlayStation VR, full stop, while PS5 pack-in game Astro's Playroom shows off the DualSense controller better than any other game since—and it's just a fun, sweet little platformer on top of that.Now, Astro Bot is finally getting its own full-size PlayStation 5 game, and we've waited more than long enough. If you have a PlayStation 5 and you haven't played Astro's Playroom, then you can get a feel for the adorable little robot right now for free. Otherwise, we'll get to see what he's capable of this September.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Bitcoin Stabilizes Amid Further ETF Outflows

Bitcoin has stabilized following its plunge below $67,000 on Tuesday, with traders awaiting the latest key macroeconomic reports from the U.S. BTC nudged upward toward $68,000 during the late European morning, an increase of 1.3% in the last 24 hours. Ether meanwhile rose around 0.2% to sit just under $3,550. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which measures the broader digital asset market, is about 0.25% higher in the last 24 hours. Attention will be on the CPI data, due today, from the U.S. and the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which will indicate the Fed's monetary policy.

Five Critical Ethereum, Solana Altcoin Trends To Know - Benzinga

Crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards highlighted five critical trends in the current altcoin cycle, offering insights into how investors can navigate an increasingly crowded market.What Happened: The analyst acknowledges the overwhelming number of altcoins flooding the market, adding that the influx of new coins and scams makes it difficult for every coin to achieve significant price pumps, unlike in past cycles. "The money in the markets is flowing into a much higher number of cryptos than some years ago," thereby diluting potential gains.The five trends he outlines are:
Age of Coins: Newer coins, particularly those launched in 2022 or later, have emerged as significant winners in the current cycle. He pointed to coins like Injective INJ/USD, Sui SUI/USD, Render RNDR/USD, and Fetch.ai FET/USD that have outperformed older altcoins such as Polygon MATIC/USD, Cosmos ATOM/USD and Chainlink LINK/USD.

Technological Superiority: He highlighted that the technology behind cryptos matters, emphasizing speed, security, and use cases as crucial factors. Solana SOL/USD is a crypto example of a winning technology due to its speed and scalability.



Narrative-Driven Markets: While trends may shift, current winning narratives include AI and meme coins. Stockmoney Lizards warned, "With meme coins, it’s pure gambling, but there are some decent AI projects."

OKX Hacked: Victims Reimbursed, 2FA Security Beefed Up


							

OKX users who were recently affected by a hack received full compensation from OKX.



The exchange decides to add a mandatory Google Authenticator to avoid similar incidents.



SlowMist reported earlier that the accounts were compromised by a SIM-swapping attack.




The two OKX users who were recently hacked received their full compensation from OKX. . Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu had a report on two user accounts that were hacked through SMS and email hijacking.







On June 9, 2024, Blockchain security firm SlowMist founder Yu Xian reported a major exploit in the OKX ecosystem, resulting in the loss of funds for two OKX users. The users’ accounts were reportedly compromised in a SIM-swapping attack due to a vulnerability in the platform’s Two-Factor authentication (2FA) security system.







Xian elaborated on the hackers’ potential strategies and the critical details identified by the tracker, he stated,




 “The SMS risk notification came from “Hong Kong” and a new API Key was created…The premeditated gang committed the crime in a concentrated manner.” 




Security analytics platform Dilation Effect further investigated the matter and identified a vulnerability in OKX’s authentication system, finding that OKX allows for lower security verification methods during sensitive operations.









In response to the hack, OKX initiated a probe and contacted the affected users, promising compensation if OKX was found responsible for the losses. The platform stated:




 “We attach great importance to the “exchange user assets stolen” situation reported online today…If it is finally determined that the platform is responsible, the platform will take the initiative to bear it. In addition, we will announce the results as soon as the relevant investigation is completed. 




As per Colin Wu’s post, OKX has fulfilled its promise. Additionally, the platform has decided to implement mandatory Google Authenticator to prevent any such mishaps in the future.

The Following Cryptocurrencies Are Impacted by Binance's Latest Change


																TL;DR

Binance will stop supporting pairs like ALPACA/BTC and QUICK/BTC later this week, advising users to adjust their trading bots to prevent losses.
The exchange added IO.NET (IO) to several services and introduced new contracts for Binance Futures Copy Trading.


The Upcoming Amendments
Binance continues to adjust its offerings “to protect users and maintain a high-quality trading market.” The process includes periodic reviews of all listed pairs, with some of them removed from the platform due to poor liquidity or other reasons.
Most recently, the company revealed it will halt trading services on the following ones: ALPACA/BTC, NFP/TUSD, MDX/BTC, QUICK/BTC, and XAI/BNB. The delisting effort will come into effect on June 14. 
“Users are strongly advised to update and/or cancel their Spot Trading Bots prior to the cessation of Spot Trading Bots services to avoid any potential losses,” the exchange warned.
Some affected cryptocurrencies, such as NFP, MDX, and XAI, slightly dipped after the announcement. Their plunge coincides with a market correction reigning in the entire cryptocurrency sector.
It is worth noting that a more severe price decline usually occurs when a leading exchange like Binance terminates all services with a certain digital asset. Such was the case in February when the popular privacy coin Monero (XMR) collapsed by over 20% after the firm withdrew its support.




Additional Binance Updates
Besides removing some trading pairs, Binance added IO.NET (IO) to Binance Simple Earn, “Buy Crypto,” and Binance Convert. The company also included it on Binance Margin and Binance Futures, while the addition to Binance Auto-Invest is scheduled for June 13. 
Last but not least, the firm introduced the following contracts: BB/USDT, ONDO/USDT, and TNSR/USDT to Binance Futures Copy Trading. 
The feature is designed for traders that may lack the time or expertise to hop on the bandwagon on their own, allowing them to automatically replicate the trades of professional or experienced individuals. However, it’s important for users to conduct their own research and understand the risks involved before participating in copy trading.

Here’s the remaining parameter for Bitcoin to hit $100,000


    As Bitcoin (BTC) struggles to maintain its price above $67,000 with a target of $70,000, a crypto trading analyst has identified technical indicators that point to a new all-time high.



In a June 12 TradingView post, the analyst TradingShot noted that Bitcoin is poised to reach $100,000, the next possible high target. 



The expert observed that Bitcoin has been practically consolidating since the May 21 high of above $71,000, and the recent pullback over the past five days is starting to inflict a certain degree of fear in the market again.







TradingShot pointed out that the price movement was witnessed on February 6, 2024, and October 14, 2023. The analyst observed that  50-day moving average re-testings on the one-day timeframe occurred after the price broke below the 1D MA50 and formed the bottom of the bearish leg.

The market expert segmented Bitcoin’s price action into phases, trading within the Mayer Multiple Bands (MMB) Mean and the MMB 2SD below. Historically, after each test of the 1D MA50, Bitcoin has entered an upward channel approaching the MMB.



Bitcoin’s path to $100,000



Therefore, TradingShot noted that the final parameter needed to confirm the start of this upward channel, which could propel Bitcoin toward the $100,000 mark, is for the one-week Relative Strength Index (RSI) to break above its moving average level. 




“The only parameter that’s left to confirm the start of this (blue) Channel Up that will test the MMB is the 1W RSI to break above its MA level (yellow trend-line). As you can see 100k following that, is a rather conservative technical Target within this pattern,” the analyst noted. 




According to TradingShot’s analysis, a breakout of the weekly RSI above its MA level would likely signal a solid bullish trend, making the $100,000 target a conservative estimate.



Notably, after Bitcoin rejected $71,000, the asset dropped to $67,000, where the maiden cryptocurrency has been consolidating for days. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin dropped below $67,000 to a low of approximately $66,800.



It’s worth noting that the brief sell-off coincided with a day when United States-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a second-straight day of outflows. The ETFs recorded $200 million in net outflows on June 11, the highest since the May 1 figure of $580 million.



In the meantime, the market remains jittery regarding how key macroeconomic data will impact Bitcoin. Notably, the market is looking forward to the release of the CPI data and the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The Fed will decide the next monetary policy after the meeting. 



Bitcoin price analysis



As of press time, Bitcoin traded at $67,980, dropping by over 1% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, BTC is down 4%.

At the moment, investors will be monitoring Bitcoin’s immediate support level of around $67,000, with stronger support at $65,500 if the former fails. On the resistance side, $69,000 is the immediate level to watch, followed by the more critical $70,000 mark.



Finally, the price action in the next few days will likely revolve around these levels, with breaks above resistance potentially leading to bullish momentum and breaks below support indicating further bearish trends.

Ripple Established a Partnership with This Altcoin, the Price Moved! - Bitcoin Sistemi


XRP Ledger, the blockchain network backed by payment firm Ripple, announced its new sidechain.
Accordingly, XRP Ledger announced the official name of its new sidechain and said that it is called “XRPL EVM sidechain”.


XRP Ledger has partnered with Axelar on this sidechain. At this point, XRP Ledger stated that this sidechain will start by serving as Axelar's private bridge protocol.
Axelar will allow users to convert XRP into wrapped XRP (eXRP), which will also be used as the native token for gas fees on the sidechain.





While Ripple said that using Axelar will simplify the user experience and increase security, it also praised Axelar's past performance and integrations with major projects such as Uniswap and Microsoft.

“The XRPL EVM sidechain will be launched with Axelar as the private bridge to source the sidechain's natural gas token (eXRP) from XRPL.
Axelar can also be used to bridge the XRPL mainnet as well as other fungible tokens from over 55 blockchains on the Axelar network.”

As you may remember, Ripple announced in recent months that it would launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin that will be released on XRP Ledger and Ethereum later this year.


Axelar (AXL) price moved after the news.

Economist Henrik Zeberg Says ‘Everything Bubble’ About To Grow Bigger - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								Macro strategist Henrik Zeberg thinks the economy is currently in the midst of an “everything bubble” that’s primed to get even bigger.
The economist tells his 143,400 followers on the social media platform X that the current bubble’s blow-off top isn’t finished.










“Bubble – where?
Below is Market Capitalization to GDP (gross domestic product):
1929 was a major Bubble: 105%
2000 was a major Bubble: 138%
2007 was a major Bubble: 105%
What do you think the current level of 188% represents? Then add on Crypto Bubble and Private Equity Bubble. When recession sets in the ‘Everything Bubble’ will pop!”
Source: Henrik Zeberg
Private markets have witnessed a “remarkable” period of growth for more than a decade, surging from $9.7 trillion in assets under management (AUM) in 2012 to an estimated $24.4 trillion AUM by the end of last year, according to analysis from Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY).
Earlier this week, Zeberg said central banks like the Federal Reserve in the US and the European Central Bank (ECB) tend to cut rates shortly before a recession.
“Economic Expansion ahead – or Late Cycle and hence Recession ahead?
Let me make it easy for people who find it difficult to understand where we are in the Business Cycle.
On Thursday, ECB chose to cut its Fund Rates.
ECB and FED always will try to cut rates late cycle to hinder economy from falling into recession.
Now look at the chart.
Are we ‘Late Cycle’ – or standing in front of ‘New Economic Expansion’?
THINK!”
Source: Henrik Zeberg
The Federal Reserve will likely issue its next statement on the Federal Funds Rate at the June 12th Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The central bank is expected to keep rates the same.

Billionaire Bill Miller Thinks Bitcoin Is Still 'Significantly Undervalued' - Benzinga

Billionaire investor Bill Miller thinks Bitcoin BTC/USD remains “significantly undervalued” despite its recent performance against fiat currencies.What Happened: Miller’s insights come from his latest publication, where he revisits his long-standing belief in the transformative potential of Bitcoin.He first expressed his optimism about Bitcoin in a 2015 piece titled "A Value Investor's Case for…Bitcoin?!" and continues to see immense untapped potential in the digital asset.“Despite Bitcoin recently hitting new highs against every fiat currency, I believe Bitcoin today is still significantly undervalued,” he remarked. Miller suggests that the world is in the early stages of a profound shift in how capital and its governance are perceived globally.Highlighting the inherent issues within traditional monetary systems, Miller noted, “The challenge with current monetary systems is that humans control them, and human judgement is subject to error and influence.” He underscores the point that political and regulatory maneuvers often lead to currency debasement, diminishing the value of money over time. According to Miller, Bitcoin offers a compelling alternative, free from the pitfalls of human intervention and manipulation.In his analysis, Miller references Lyn Alden‘s book “Broken Money,” which argues that the most efficient monetary technologies ultimately prevail.Also Read: Bitcoin Climbs Above $67.5K As Spot ETFs See $200M Outflows On TuesdayHe draws parallels between Bitcoin and other revolutionary technologies, such as those developed by NVIDIA, Google, and Meta, which have drastically outperformed other stocks. “Humans are notoriously bad at contextualizing the relevance and potential of new technologies,” Miller said, emphasizing that Bitcoin represents a similar epistemic breakthrough.“Bitcoin is a true technological breakthrough,” Miller stated, “as there now exists an effectively unalterable, automated and transparent global ledger network with decentralized governance.” He believes that this decentralized nature of Bitcoin enables a secure and accountable system for transferring property rights, independent of human intervention or the possibility of confiscation.Discussing Bitcoin’s intrinsic value, Miller expressed, “My view is that it's many multiples of its current $1.5 trillion market capitalization in a world of fiat governance systems fast approaching one quadrillion dollars of capital.” He argues that Bitcoin, despite its relatively small share of the global capital market, offers a superior monetary governance system compared to traditional fiat currencies.Miller concludes his analysis with a cautionary note: “Continuing to ignore Bitcoin will serve those who do it over the next decade as well as it has over the past one – not well.” What’s Next: As the world adapts to new financial paradigms, Miller’s endorsement of Bitcoin underscores the ongoing debate about the role of digital assets in the global economy.For more insights into the future of digital assets, industry stakeholders are encouraged to attend Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where these topics will be explored in depth by experts and thought leaders.Read Next: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Continue To Drive High Trading Volume, Report FindsImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Analyst: 'Been Here Before' - Bitcoin Slumps To $66,000 As FOMC Nerves Hit


								Bitcoin enthusiasts faced a roller coaster ride this Tuesday as the leading cryptocurrency took a nearly 5% tumble, dipping below $68,000. This sharp decline erased the gains made during a bullish run that saw BTC touch $71,950 just last week. Analysts are scrambling to decipher the reasons behind the sudden skid and predict Bitcoin’s next move, with the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting looming large.

Risk Aversion Reigns As Investors Eye FOMC, Inflation Data
The crypto market seems to be mirroring the broader financial landscape, where a cautious mood prevails. Investors are adopting a “risk-off” approach as they brace for the release of crucial economic data, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the FOMC meeting.
The CPI report, a key inflation gauge, is expected to shed light on the state of the US economy. The FOMC meeting, where the Federal Reserve will decide on interest rates, is another major event that could significantly impact investor sentiment.
Bitcoin is now trading at $67,573. Chart: TradingView
The upcoming week presents a perfect storm for riskier assets like Bitcoin. The combination of potential interest rate hikes and inflation concerns is putting a damper on investor appetite. This risk aversion is likely translating into outflows from Bitcoin, leading to the price drop we’re witnessing.

Dormant Bitcoin Wakes Up, Adding Fuel To The Fire
Adding another layer of intrigue to the price movement was a large Bitcoin transfer that occurred earlier on Tuesday. A wallet that had been dormant for over five years suddenly sprang to life, transferring a whopping 8,000 BTC, valued at over half a billion dollars, to several addresses, including the prominent cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The sudden movement of such a large amount of Bitcoin could have triggered some short-term volatility in the market.
Source: Lookonchain
Analysts Share Views On Bitcoin’s Post-FOMC Trajectory
While the immediate future appears uncertain, some analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Markets are “risk-off mode ahead of CPI and FOMC tomorrow,” commented analysts at QCP Capital, a global digital asset trading firm and market maker.


This sentiment is echoed by some crypto analysts on social media. Popular figures like Moustache and Max pointed out historical instances where FOMC meetings coincided with price dips followed by bullish reversals.

ICBC Recognizes Ethereum's Role in the Digital Economy


                                ICBC's Endorsement: Ethereum as 'Digital Oil' and Its Impact on Crypto                                In a significant endorsement, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) the world’s largest bank has dubbed Ethereum (ETH) as 'Digital Oil'. This acknowledgment positions Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization as a pivotal asset in the digital economy. ICBC highlighted Ethereum's potential in supporting various Web3 innovations including the launch of stablecoins.Ethereum's Role in Innovation and Technical Advancements ICBC praised Ethereum for its continuous advancements in security, scalability, and sustainability. The bank noted that Ethereum's technology is essential for driving the digital future, especially through its support for stablecoin launches and bridging the gap between the digital currency market and the real world. This development underscores Ethereum's role in enhancing the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and promoting complex smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).ICBC acknowledged Ethereum’s unique programming language, Solidity which empowers developers to create sophisticated smart contracts and DApps. The bank’s statement emphasized that Ethereum Network's support for developers facilitates the deployment of these advanced applications cementing Ethereum’s position as a cornerstone of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and DeFi.ICBC’s Shift in Stance on CryptocurrenciesOver recent years, ICBC's perspective on cryptocurrencies has evolved dramatically. Once supportive of China's cryptocurrency trading ban, ICBC now recognizes and praises the growth and achievements of Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC). The bank has likened Bitcoin to gold, appreciating its mathematical scarcity and its solution to the challenges of carrying physical gold. This shift in stance is particularly notable given China’s stringent regulations on cryptocurrencies.ICBC’s endorsement comes at a time when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the spot Ethereum ETF, leading to significant inflows into ETFs. This approval has generated enthusiasm within the cryptocurrency community with spot Ethereum ETFs attracting considerable interest. This development indicates a growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into mainstream financial markets.ConclusionICBC’s positive remarks on Ethereum and Bitcoin are groundbreaking, especially considering China’s historical ban on cryptocurrency trading. While many Chinese investors continue to trade cryptocurrencies through alternative means, ICBC’s endorsement suggests a potential shift in regulatory attitudes. This development raises hopes that China may eventually lift its cryptocurrency ban, fostering a more open and supportive environment for digital assets in the future. According to CoinGabbar, as the world’s largest bank continues to back cryptocurrencies, it could signal a new era for digital finance in China.Also Read: SEC's Next Step For Ether ETF Depends On Issuers Action

Bitcoin gains as May CPI data shows moderate inflation numbers - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bitcoin showed a relative price gain momentum Wednesday following the release of the May Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which showed that inflation grew by 3.3% year-over-year, slightly lower than the 3.4% rate recorded in April. The crypto market reacted positively to the news, as the moderation in inflation fueled hopes for potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the coming months.Bitcoin gained roughly 2.3% over the past hour since the announcement of the May CPI data, with the broader market from the top 20 cryptocurrencies all showing positive movement. Ethereum is also up 2.6% over the past hour, according to data from CoinGecko. Notably, NEAR Protocol’s NEAR token increased the most over the past hour, with a 5.4% rise despite a 13.4% decline over the past week.According to data shared by Barron’s and released by the Labor Department earlier today, the monthly pace of inflation slowed to 0.1% in May, down from the 0.3% growth rate seen in April. Core CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, also decelerated to an annual rate of 3.5%, the lowest since April 2021.Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, commented on the current market sentiment:“For Bitcoin, we’re seeing a favorable situation in the market right now. The cryptocurrency can overcome the resistance level in the zone of 71k-73k and renew all-time highs in the following weeks, driven by optimism in financial markets. Such positive sentiment is caused by expectations of coming interest rate cuts in the US and Europe that stimulate capital inflow into risk assets.”Utushkin also noted the growing risk appetite among investors, as evidenced by elevated trading activity in meme stocks and penny stocks with low ratings. He observed that crypto investors are shifting from major coins towards meme coins, further increasing the market’s risk profile.“Elevated trading activity with meme stocks such as GameStop and other penny stocks with low ratings shows a growing risk appetite,” explains Lienkha, adding that despite the crypto market already being high-risk by default, their analysis indicates that crypto investors are gradually “shifting from major coins towards meme coins, increasing the risk.”Economists and analysts have been closely monitoring the shelter component of the CPI, as housing costs have proven to be a stubborn source of inflationary pressure. Many expect housing and rent inflation to ease in the coming months, which would help bring overall inflation closer to the Fed’s 2% target.Despite the encouraging CPI data, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to maintain a cautious stance regarding potential rate cuts during the upcoming FOMC meeting. The central bank is also likely to emphasize the strength of the US economy and the persistence of elevated inflation as reasons to keep interest rates higher for an extended period.While investors continue to assess the implications of the latest inflation data and await further guidance from the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remain sensitive to macroeconomic developments. The cautiously optimistic sentiment in the market, tempered by the potential for unexpected negative events, will likely continue to shape the near-term trajectory of these digital assets.

Bitcoin: How FOMC meeting, CPI report could influence BTC's next move - AMBCrypto



BTC saw a surge in long liquidations in the past 24 hours.
This comes as the market awaits the release of the CPI report and the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] price corrected to near $66,000 during the intraday trading session on 11th June, ahead of 12th June’s U.S. inflation report and FOMC meeting.
The coin has, however, rebounded slightly since then to exchange hands at $67,243 as of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap’s data. 
As reported by CNBC, economists expect the May Consumer Price Index (CPI) to show a modest increase of 0.1% from April. However, this would still translate to a 3.4% annual increase in prices. 
The Federal Reserve is expected to do nothing regarding interest rates. 
However, its officials will take other actions, such as releasing quarterly updates to their Summary of Economic Projections, which could be influenced by the CPI report. 
Long traders bear the brunt
BTC’s price slump on 11th June led to a surge in long liquidations in its futures market. According to Coinglass, liquidations on that day totaled $67 million, with 77% of them being long liquidations.

Liquidations happen in an asset’s derivatives market when a trader’s position is forcefully closed due to insufficient funds to maintain it. 
Long liquidations occur when the value of an asset suddenly drops, forcing traders who have open positions in favor of a price rally to exit their positions. 
AMBCrypto found that on the day in question, BTC’s long liquidations totaled $52 million, while short liquidations totaled $14 million.
Bitcoin to surge?
Although many long traders have been plunged into losses in the past 24 hours, market observers noted that the coin’s historical performance hints at a possible recovery in no time. 
In a post on X, pseudonymous crypto analyst Gumshoe noted that four FOMC meetings have been held so far this year, and each one followed the same pattern. 
BTC’s price declined 10% in the 48 hours before these meetings and fully recovered on the day of the meetings. According to Gumshoe, “The market always prices in overly bearish statements, then reverses.”

Another crypto analyst, Jelle, shared the same sentiments. The analyst opined the Federal Reserve meetings “have been good for the market recently.”
According to Jelle, the past four FOMC events have coincided with local bottoms and resulted in over 20% rallies for the leading crypto asset.

Ripple And Axelar Partner For Ethereum VM Sidechain Launch


								RippleX, the development wing of Ripple Labs, has unveiled a major update to the XRPL EVM sidechain, facilitating Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility with the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This major development is set to enhance interoperability and open up new avenues for decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on XRPL.
Ripple Partners With Axelar For EVM Bridge
The initiative to integrate EVM capabilities into the XRPL was first introduced on the XRPL devnet in October 2022. In a detailed blog post released by Team Ripple, the new sidechain is highlighted as a pivotal innovation.
“We collectively believe that the future of blockchain is multi-chain, and are excited to share an update on one of the top requests from the developer community: bringing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility to XRP Ledger (XRPL),” the post reads. This compatibility aims to bridge the functional gap between XRPL and Ethereum, enriching the XRPL ecosystem with the vast array of existing Ethereum tools and DApps, thus enhancing its utility and reach.

The XRPL EVM Sidechain, now officially named, operates with a bridge facilitated by Axelar that utilizes wrapped XRP (eXRP) as both the native asset and gas token. This bridge is crucial for ensuring seamless asset transfers between XRPL and the EVM sidechain, maintaining robust interoperability and efficient transaction processing.
The blog post also emphasizes the technical collaboration with Peersyst Technology, stating, “The Ripple engineering team has also been working closely with Peersyst to expand the interoperability of XRPL. Axelar is a battle-tested, production-ready and fully compatible bridge to bring wrapped XRP (eXRP) as a native currency to the XRPL EVM sidechain.” Ferran Prat, CEO of Peersyst, noted, “The Peersyst engineering team is now working to migrate the main bridge to Axelar for the devnet.”
Axelar’s integration provides a decentralized bridge operated by a network of validators, enhancing security and facilitating broader cross-chain interactions. With 75 validators in its network, Axelar enforces rigorous security protocols, including key rotation policies to prevent potential attacks, ensuring the infrastructure’s reliability and trustworthiness.
The new sidechain also aims to simplify the user experience, which has been previously complicated by the use of different bridges for different types of transactions. By using Axelar’s technology for all XRPL to EVM transfers, the process becomes more streamlined and user-friendly.

“The current process of transferring new tokens via XLS-38 is arduous. Using two different bridges—XLS-38 for XRP and Axelar for other tokens and for executing cross-chain smart contracts—complicates the user journey. By consolidating to a single bridge, the process becomes simplified, making it more intuitive and user-friendly,” RippleX writes
Moreover, the company outlines the ongoing significance of the XLS-38 proposal in its blog post, explaining its role in enabling XRPL developers to create custom sidechains. While the amendment remains subject to voting and approval, Ripple’s UNL validator has taken a stance of voting ‘No’ until further validation and community feedback are secured.
Over the next 12-15 months, Ripple engineers will continue to evaluate community input and adoption metrics to refine and possibly expand the EVM sidechain’s functionalities. By engaging with the developer community and gathering feedback, Ripple aims to ensure the XRPL continues evolving to meet user needs effectively.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.483.

Ethena (ENA) Whale Faces $13M Loss With 30% Token Drop


The price of ENA, the native coin that powers the Ethereum-based synthetic dollar protocol, Ethena, has cratered by almost 30% in the past seven days. 
The steady drop in the altcoin’s price during that period has prompted its largest whale address to offload some of its holdings to prevent further losses. 
Ethena’s Largest Staker Pulls Out
As of this writing, ENA trades at $0.72. During the early trading hours of today, the altcoin’s price plunged to $0.68, its lowest level since May 20.

The double-digit decline in ENA’s value recorded over a seven-day period has caused its largest staker to send a significant amount of its holdings to Binance in the past 24 hours for onward sales. 
On-chain data showed that through a series of deposits on June 11 between 20:39 and 20:46 ​​Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), the whale address deposited 11.016 million ENA tokens to Binance.
In the past six hours, this whale has moved 19.36 million ENA tokens to Binance, valued at approximately $14.1 million, with an average token price of $0.72.
Following these sale transactions, this address currently holds 3.88 million ENA, valued at $3 million at current prices. This indicates that the whale now sits on an estimated total loss of $13.07 million.

Interestingly, despite ENA’s price decline, the total value of assets locked (TVL) on the protocol has continued to climb. At $3.44 billion, Ethena’s TVL is at its all-time high. 

Ethena Total Value Locked. Source: DefiLlama
This steady uptick in Ethena’s TVL hints at the possibility of an ENA price rebound, pseudonymous crypto analyst Route2Fi opined in a post on X.
According to the analyst, ENA’s price is heavily influenced by the popularity of the Ethena Protocol. This is similar to how LUNA’s price rose in 2021 alongside the growth of the Anchor Protocol.
Clarifying that this does not mean that ENA is a Ponzi scheme, the analyst noted that its value rises when its underlying protocol, Ethena, gains traction.
ENA Price Prediction: Rally May Not Occur in the Short-Term
While Route2Fi has opined that ENA’s value might rebound in the short term, an assessment of the token’s key technical indicators suggested this may not be true.
For example, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) rested below the 50-neutral line at 41.08. 

This indicator measures overbought or oversold conditions in a market by tracking an asset’s price momentum and changes. 
It ranges between 0 and 100, with values above 70 suggesting that the asset is overbought and due for a correction, while values above 30 suggest oversold conditions.
At 41.08, ENA’s RSI suggests a decline in buying pressure and a spike in selling momentum. 

Ethena Analysis. Source: TradingView
If selling pressure continues to dominate, the altcoin’s value might drop under $0.70 to trade at $0.40.

However, if invalidated, and the bulls re-emerge, ENA’s price may trend towards $1.07.

Consensys Eyes Lido’s Lunch With No-Minimum Pooled Staking - The Defiant

Consensys is targeting the liquid staking sector with its MetaMask Pooled Staking service.MetaMask, the popular Ethereum wallet from Consensys, is seeking to compete against the liquid restaking sector with the launch of its pooled staking service.Announced on June 12, MetaMask’s pooled staking service allows users to participate in Ethereum staking with allocations of less than the usual 32 ETH minimum.Users’ ETH is staked via validators operated by Consensys, which previously required deposits of at least 32 ETH. Consensys charges a 15% fee on Ethereum rewards generated through pooled staking. Users can also unstake at any time.“Based on blockchain data, 99% of ETH holders have less than 32 ETH,” Consensys said. “MetaMask’s new solution enables staking any amount of ETH to earn rewards for contributing to the network's security.”MetaMask Pooled Staking is currently available to a select segment of Metamask, with Consensys working to continue rolling out the service to users over the coming days. Consensys noted that U.S. and U.K.-based users will be excluded from the product’s initial launch, but said it plans to service those users in the future.“We’re excited to bring our staking solution to many more MetaMask users,” said Matthieu Saint Olive, Senior Product Manager at Consensys.Consensys hosts more than 33,000 validators across multiple regions commanding more than one million staked Ether. The company claims a more than 99.9% validator participation rate and has not suffered any slashing events.The launch of pooled staking positions Consensys in competition with major liquid staking players such as Lido and Rocket Pool.Liquid staking similarly allows users to pool assets with a third-party validator in exchange for a fee, with users receiving liquid staking tokens (LSTs) that can be sold off at any time or used in DeFi protocols. LST protocols also enable users to participate in staking without posting the 32 ETH collateral required by staking Ethereum natively on the Beach Chain.Liquid staking has emerged as a major sector, with Lido, the top LST protocol, currently commanding 28.6% of all staked Ether, according to Dune Analytics. Coinbase ranks second with 12.9%, followed by liquid restaking protocol EtherFi with 4.6%, Binance and Kiln with 3.3% each, and Renzo with 3%.Nearly 27.2% of Ethereum’s supply is currently mobilized for staking.Consensys' expanded staking service comes despite the company currently battling the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court.In April, the firm sued the SEC in a bid to get the courts to rule that Ether comprises a commodity and not a security asset, making the SEC's attempts to regulate the asset unlawful.The move came two weeks after the regulator issued Consensys a Wells Notice — which informs a company that the SEC has completed an investigation into them, and typically precedes a formal complaint.Related: Web3 Teams Compete To Bring Restaking To $1.2T Bitcoin Ecosystem

Polkadot parachain Moonbeam launches a $13M Web3 gaming fund

Moonbeam Network, a Web3 smart contract platform, has launched a $13 million funding initiative to boost its ecosystem growth in key areas like gaming and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.The $13 million package consists of a $10 million innovation fund, $1.5 million in Moonbeam ecosystem grants, and $1.5 million in Moonriver grants.Moonbeam said the funding marks the next phase of its Moonrise initiative, which aims to evolve the parachain into a leading solution for integrated Web3 networks, including Polkadot and Ethereum.Innovation fundThe Moonbeam team explained that one of the network’s primary goals was to attract more games to its blockchain to boost its gamer acquisition and retention.To this end, it has selected N3MUS as the first recipient of the innovation fund to develop a gaming-focused ecosystem. N3MUS aims to integrate Web3 gaming into the mainstream by merging traditional gaming with blockchain technology.Sicco Naets, Head of Ecosystem Development at Moonbeam Foundation, told CryptoSlate that the N3MUS funding demonstrates Moonbeam’s commitment to supporting developers and reducing friction in blockchain technology.Similarly, Neal Peters, the CEO of N3MUS, added:“This partnership marks a significant milestone for N3MUS as we strive to bridge the gap between traditional gaming and blockchain technology.”Additionally, Moonbeam’s partnership with N3MUS will include co-organizing events to integrate N3MUS into Moonbeam and promote gaming projects. Moonbeam will also connect N3MUS and other fund recipients with venture capital firms for potential further investment.Ecosystem grantsBeyond the innovation fund, Moonbeam is also supporting its parachain projects and the Moonriver canary network with grants.The first ecosystem grant will allocate 4.5 million GLMR, valued at approximately $1.5 million, to four projects on the parachain, including StellaSwap DEX, Moonwell Lending Protocol, Cross-Chain Interactions platform Prime Protocol, and Beamswap. These protocols are expected to launch their incentive programs on June 14.Additionally, efforts are underway to enhance DeFi activities through a proposal for the Moonriver canary network, which would distribute 113,618 MOVR, worth $1.5 million.The intended beneficiaries include DeFi projects like Beamswap and Moonwell, amongst others. These projects will use the funds to facilitate liquidity provision on their platforms. However, the proposal is currently pending approval.Disclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem.

Zimbabwe Steps Up To The Crypto Plate: Public Input Sought For Regulations


								Zimbabwe is taking an exciting step into the future by launching a public consultation to get opinions on regulating cryptocurrency operations in the country, Bloomberg reports. This is a big change for a nation that has historically struggled with currency issues.

By asking for feedback from the public and talking to industry experts, Zimbabwe aims to balance encouraging innovation in the growing crypto sector with making sure it’s done responsibly and in line with international standards.
From Tough Times To Digital Future
Zimbabwe’s economic history is full of challenges, including several currency crashes, the latest one in 2019. In response, the government introduced a gold-backed virtual asset called the ZiG in April 2024.
This move showed that the country is becoming more open to digital assets as a potential solution for long-term financial stability. The current public consultation on crypto regulations builds on this, showing a willingness to embrace new technologies while protecting the nation’s economic well-being.
Open Dialogue For Strong Regulations
Zimbabwe’s approach focuses on transparency and inclusivity. The government is seeking input from a variety of people, including citizens, domestic and foreign crypto service providers, and industry experts.

This open dialogue ensures that the new regulations reflect the public’s concerns and needs, build trust in the system, and attract responsible businesses to operate legally. The consultation period is open until June 26th, giving plenty of time for people to participate and feel involved in the future of cryptocurrencies in the country.

Zimbabwe: Navigating The Global Crypto Scene
Zimbabwe’s move into crypto regulation comes at an important time for the global market. The recent Bitcoin halving event in April caused a significant downturn, raising concerns about crypto’s volatility. However, not everything looks bad.
The introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US and Hong Kong shows growing interest from big institutions, indicating a potential future for responsible crypto adoption. By seeking public input and aligning regulations with international standards, the government is positioning itself to navigate this dynamic environment, attract responsible investors and businesses, and reduce potential risks.

The future of Zimbabwe’s crypto regulations is still to be decided. Important areas like KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) requirements and exchange licensing procedures will be key parts of the final framework. Successfully balancing public concerns, industry expertise, and international best practices will be the ultimate test for Zimbabwe’s goal to become a player in the global crypto scene.

Merlin Chain revolutionizes Bitcoin yields with DeFi opportunities


    Merlin Chain, a Layer-2 blockchain, has announced it’s working on bringing new yield opportunities for Bitcoin (BTC) traders, according to the information shared with Finbold on June 12.



With its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms and a suite of innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, Merlin Chain aims to provide bitcoiners with the chance to earn staking yields and access a range of DeFi services.



Enhanced yield for Bitcoin holders



For years, Ethereum (ETH) investors have enjoyed various yield-generating avenues such as staking rewards, liquidity mining, and yield farming. 







In contrast, holding BTC has not offered similar benefits, apart from the asset’s gradual appreciation. 



Merlin Chain Founder Jeff has emphasized the strong market position of BTC while highlighting the surprising lack of yields its holders enjoy:




“Everyone knows bitcoin has been one of the best-performing assets over the past decade, hilariously detonating the cynical predictions of many anti-crypto critics, but holders have missed out on yields that other ecosystems provide. We are therefore delighted to finally grant BTC investors and hodlers concrete incentives to not just HODL, but earn and participate in the exciting DeFi ecosystem!”




To leverage Merlin Chain’s yield opportunities, users will bridge their BTC to the network using the Merlin Bridge. 



That involves locking BTC on Layer1 and receiving gas BTC, which can then be staked into Merlin’s PoS mechanism to generate M-BTC, a wrapped bitcoin asset that earns staking rewards similar to stETH.



Bitcoin holders can stake M-BTC on DeFi platforms like Solv Protocol to earn SolvBTC and access various DeFi services.



Moreover, they can  supply liquidity to earn yields from Merlin-integrated protocols and explore DeFi primitives such as lending, borrowing, and engaging in derivatives and other DeFi activities with BTC. 



Additionally, they can bridge SolvBTC assets to Bitcoin Layer2 networks like Linea to earn extra rewards.



A new chapter for Bitcoin and Merlin Chain



Merlin Chain has already bridged over $13 billion worth of bitcoin in the last month and a half and distributed over $700 million worth of BTC to Layer2 networks.



The platform has also partnered with leading crypto custodians, such as Fireblocks, Cobo, Ceffu, and Antalpha.



In total, Merlin Chain collaborates with over ten major institutions to scale participation and decentralize the network’s validator set.

Solana, Ripple ETFs Unlikely In Near Future, Says Cboe VP - Benzinga

Rob Marrocco, the Vice President and Global Head of ETF Listings at Cboe CBOE, on Wednesday highlighting the challenges of crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.What Happened: Marrocco expressed skepticism regarding the near-term feasibility of ETFs based on cryptocurrencies like Solana SOL/USD and Ripple XRP/USD, citing the absence of a futures market for these assets as a significant hurdle.He noted that the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs was largely influenced by the existence of a futures market.Regarding the potential for a Solana ETF, Marrocco suggested that a viable pathway would involve introducing a Solana futures ETF first, which could pave the way for a spot ETF. However, he cautioned that even with the introduction of futures ETFs, establishing a track record could be a lengthy process.Marrocco emphasized the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, stating that it would provide clarity for market participants and regulatory agencies alike. He acknowledged the challenges associated with legislative action but argued that it could offer a more expedient path compared to waiting for a futures market to develop.Lara Crigger, the editor-in-chief of VettaFi, echoed Marrocco’s sentiments, emphasizing the lack of a futures market for Solana as a barrier to ETF approval by the SEC.Also Read: Bitcoin Climbs Above $67.5K As Spot ETFs See $200M Outflows On TuesdayIndustry experts remain divided on the issue, with some expressing doubts about the prospects of Solana ETFs, while others believe that recent developments, such as the approval of Ethereum ETFs, could pave the way for similar tokens.In the context of evolving regulatory dynamics in the US, the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) represents a significant development.This bipartisan legislation aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, delineating responsibilities between the CFTC and the SEC.FIT21, which recently passed in the House, seeks to address regulatory uncertainties surrounding digital assets and ensure investor protection and market integrity. Its enactment into law is pending a Senate vote, underscoring the ongoing legislative process.While the prospects of crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum face challenges, regulatory developments such as FIT21 could play a crucial role in shaping the future landscape of digital asset investment.What’s Next: For further insights into the future of digital assets and the evolving regulatory landscape, consider attending Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Donald Trump Opens 21-Point Lead In 2024 Presidential Race, According To Crypto BettorsImage: Shutterstock

Bitcoin surges above $69k after better-than-expected US CPI

Bitcoin’s price has soared past $69,000 after the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May showed a slight decline.Available data shows that the much-anticipated US CPI inflation data was better than several experts’ predictions.Table showing US inflation data (Source: Trading Economics)Charlie Bilello, the Chief Market Strategist at Creative Planning, said:“Overall, US CPI moved down to 3.27% year-on-year in May from 3.36% in April. US inflation has now been above 3% for 38 straight months. US Core CPI (ex-Food/Energy) moved down to 3.41% year-on-year from 3.62% last month. This is the lowest core inflation reading since April 2021.”Bilello further pointed out that the US Inflation rate has drastically reduced from the 9.1% peak of June 2022 to 3.3% today. He added that the decline in these numbers was caused by the “lower rates of inflation in used cars, gas utilities, apparel, food at home, gasoline, medical care, fuel oil, food away from home, shelter, and electricity.”Bitcoin rises on optimistic CPIThe better-than-expected CPI numbers immediately had a positive impact on Bitcoin’s price, with the BTC rising by more than 2% on the 1-hour candle to as high as $69,377 as of press time.Mike Alfred, a board member at IREN Energy, pointed out that the movement showed that:“Bitcoin already knows that CPI + Fed won’t be major bearish catalysts. It’s a highly intelligent global macro asset that prices in almost everything in advance.”Meanwhile, the market attention has shifted to the US Federal Reserve, which will reveal its decision on current interest rates later today. Jesse Cohen, a Global Markets Analyst at Investing.com, said:“The May CPI Inflation report could give the Fed the confidence to begin laying out the carpet for rate hikes in the months ahead. It’s going to take a minimum of three or four soft inflation prints before I think they’re ready to cut rates, but this would be a start.”Posted In: Bitcoin, CryptoLatest Alpha Market Report

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Swings Continue in Mid-June


                                Updates on Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Its Mid-June Market Performance                                The crypto community is buzzing about the latest news on Shiba Inu [SHIB], famously known as the "Dogecoin Killer." As we move into mid-June 2024, investors and fans are closely watching this meme coin inspired by dogs, hoping it can bounce back from a recent drop in value.Some are hopeful, mentioning its previous surges and strong community support as signs of potential recovery. Others, however, remain careful, pointing out the volatility natural in such risky assets. Regardless, the Shiba Inu coin continues to capture attention and spark debates within the crypto space.The Early June Blues In early June, the token's price stayed around $0.0000232, showing a modest 0.68% increase over the previous 24 hours. However, this modest gain was overshadowed by declines in other key time frames, with SHIB experiencing a 7% drop over the past week and a 0.82% dip over the past month.These mixed messages have left the SHIB market with a sense of doubt, causing some investors to question the meme coin's direction.The Mid-June Rally Prediction Even though the rough beginning, analysts stay hopeful about Shiba Inu's chances for mid-June. According to Changelly, a well-known crypto exchange, SHIB could potentially jump by an impressive 30% from its current level, reaching a target price of $0.00003232.This prediction has excited the SHIB community, who are looking forward to the expected rise. However, many things affect how well the asset does, like market trends, new technology, investor feelings, market liquidity, trading volume, and regulations.Additionally, as a community-driven network, the overall support and enthusiasm of the SHIB community could significantly influence the asset's ability to achieve or even exceed the $0.00003232 target.Long-term Holders React as SHIB Price DropsWhile the mid-June rally prediction has generated excitement, recent on-chain data suggests that long-term SHIB holders are preparing for another potential sell-off. According to the Sentiments Age Consumed metric, which tracks the intensity of selling pressure from long-term investors, there has been a significant spike in the number of long-held tokens moving to new addresses.On June 11, the Age Consumed figure hit an incredible 3465.6 trillion, much higher than previous highs observed in April and May 2024. This surge in selling activity by long-term holders has sparked fears of another wave of sell-offs, potentially delaying the expected rebound phase.The Bollinger Band indicator adds weight to the negative view, indicating that SHIB's price might fall below the crucial support level of $0.0000217. If the selling continues, SHIB's price could decline toward the support level of around $0.000020 throughout June 2024.Community Strength and PotentialDespite the challenges and doubts surrounding Shiba Inu, the meme coin's community remains firm in their belief and support for the asset. SHIB's success has been largely powered by its dedicated following, and its consistent enthusiasm could play an important role in the coin's ability to endure the current challenge.As the crypto market changes, the strength of the SHIB community will be tested. How they support the meme coin and stay positive could greatly affect its performance and chance for a mid-June comeback.Conclusion The crypto world is buzzing about the mid-June 2024 price forecast for Shiba Inu (SHIB), predicting a possible 30% increase. Yet, current data and indicators hint at a challenging road ahead, especially for those holding onto SHIB for the long term, as they prepare for more selling activity.As everyone looks forward to a possible rally, how SHIB supporters stand strong will decide if this meme coin can recover and regain its place in crypto. We'll see in mid-June 2024 if Shiba Inu can overcome hurdles and succeed.Also read - Will Shiba Inu Steps In FLOKI’s Bold Educational Initiative?

Is Bitcoin's Q3 Curse Real? Crypto Market Takes a $279 Million Hit


							

Over $279 million was liquidated in the crypto market, with 89,872 traders affected.



The single-largest liquidation occurred on OKX on the ETH-USDT-SWAP.



Crypto analyst Ali Martinez cautioned investors about BTC’s performance in Q3s.




The crypto market experienced a sharp price crash in the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin (BTC) dipping to $67,000, resulting in $279 million in liquidations, according to Coinglass data.



In the past 12 hours, $116.01 million was liquidated, with $28.45 million liquidated in just four hours. In the past hour alone, liquidations totaled $4.20 million, according to Coinglass data. Over 89,872 traders were liquidated, with the single-largest liquidation occurring on OKX’s ETH-USDT-SWAP, valued at $5.21 million.



Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin has “historically underperformed in Q3, with an average return of 6.49% and a median return of -2.57%,” suggesting a potential for sluggish price movement in the crypto market.







Bitcoin fell 11.5% in Q3 2023, 22.8% in Q3 2019, 10% in Q3 2015, and 39.7% in Q3 2014. However, it rallied 25% in Q3 2021, 17.9% in Q3 2020, 80% in Q3 2017, and 40% in 2013. While the median return for Bitcoin in the third quarter historically stands at -2.57%, the average return is 6.49%.









According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin has declined 5.34% in the past seven days but has gained more than 10% in 30 days. Despite multiple attempts, Bitcoin has been unable to break above its all-time high of $73,000, reached in March.



Notably, the US CPI came out to 3.3% while the expected rate was 3.4%. Santiment stated that if the US CPI comes out lower, the price of the leading digital asset will see a surge in the short term and once again make an attempt towards the $70,000 price level. 



Interestingly, the performance of the cryptocurrency is affected heavily by the CPI rates and the decisions of the United States Federal Reserve.

Bitcoin Soars Above $69K On Improved Inflation Data Print - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD is surging on better-than-expected consumer price inflation data, gaining 2.5% in the past hour.What Happened: The latest data from the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) revealed no change for May, beating economist predictions of a 0.1% increase and down from the 0.3% rise seen in April.On an annual basis, the CPI rose by 3.3%, slightly below both the previous month’s 3.4% and analysts’ forecasts.The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2% in May, better than the expected 0.3% rise and consistent with the previous month’s 0.3%. Year-over-year, the core CPI showed a 3.4% increase, below the anticipated 3.5% and April’s 3.6%.In response to these softer inflation figures, Bitcoin surged to $69,400, marking an almost 4% increase within the last 24 hours.This reaction comes after a period of stagnant inflation rates in recent months, which have remained above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target despite aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023. The Federal Reserve’s actions had initially led to a rapid decline in inflation, but the trend plateaued, dampening market expectations for imminent rate cuts.Earlier this year, traders were predicting five to six 25 basis point (bps) rate cuts in 2024 by the year’s end. However, this forecast had been reduced to one or two cuts, with the first not expected until September, as indicated by the CME FedWatch Tool. According to K33 Research, “Crypto prices have been ‘highly sensitive’ to U.S. economic data recently.”Also Read: Donald Trump Wants ‘All The Remaining Bitcoin To Be Made In The USA’The combination of rising inflation and decreased expectations for rate cuts contributed to Bitcoin’s drop from its all-time high of over $73,000 in March to under $57,000 in May. Traders are now looking forward to looser monetary policies to boost the next phase of the crypto rally.In contrast to U.S. trends, several major central banks globally, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada, have already begun reducing benchmark rates. These actions have helped push the U.S. dollar index (DXY) to a one-month high.Investors are also keenly awaiting the release of the Federal Reserve’s “dot plot” later today. This projection of interest rates by Federal Market Open Committee members could significantly influence asset prices.As the market absorbs these developments, the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on November 19 will offer valuable insights.Read Next: Billionaire Bill Miller Thinks Bitcoin Is Still ‘Significantly Undervalued’Image: Shutterstock

Has the Altcoin Season Ended Before It Could Begin?


The changing market conditions creating a bearish atmosphere are harming the potential of an altcoin season.
Bitcoin has been receiving market support owing to the increasing demand generated by a successful spot BTC ETF run.
Is Altcoin Season Over?
Altcoin season, also known as “altseason,” is a period in the cryptocurrency market where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin. This phenomenon is primarily identified by observing two key indicators: Bitcoin’s dominance and altcoins’ price performance.

Bitcoin’s dominance refers to the percentage of total cryptocurrency market capitalization held by Bitcoin. During the altseason, this dominance decreases as investors shift their capital from Bitcoin into various altcoins. A noticeable decline in Bitcoin dominance indicates that altcoins are gaining a larger market share.
This decline was last noted in January this year when BTC’s dominance fell sharply from 54% to 50%. However, since then, the dominance has noted an uptrend, reaching 55% in the past month.
This is the most BTC has dominated the crypto market since the March 2021 crash, when the same dominance fell from 70% to 40% in a few days.

Alongside the decrease in Bitcoin’s dominance, altcoins typically experience substantial price increases. This surge in altcoin prices, often outpacing Bitcoin’s growth, is a clear signal of altseason. Investors seek higher returns by diversifying their portfolios into altcoins, driving up their prices. 

Generally, when 75% of the top 50 altcoins, excluding stablecoins, perform better than BTC over a period of three months, the altcoin season is considered active and successful.
However, over the last 90 days, only eight cryptocurrencies have managed to outperform Bitcoin. Even the meme coin craze and the hype surrounding spot Ethereum ETF approval failed to pull up alts.
Top 50 Altcoins’ Performance. Source: Blockchaincenter
This points to a disappointing answer to the above question: The altcoin season ended before it could even begin.
When Is the Next Altcoin Season?

The answer to this question is not straightforward since the volatility of the crypto market makes everything very uncertain. In addition, developments in the macro-financial markets have also impacted the direction of cryptocurrencies.
However, a pattern has emerged since 2022. August 2022 marked the second-to-last altseason, after which it took six months for Bitcoin season to begin. The next and most recent altcoin season began eight months after this, in January this year. Now, five months later, we are witnessing Bitcoin season again.

Thus, if this pattern continues, investors can expect the altcoin season to begin in approximately seven to eight months. This puts the potential timeline for the next altseason in February 2025.
Nevertheless, it is wise to be wary of the broader market and macro-financial markets’ cues.

Bitcoin miners sell BTC worth $83M - Price to fall below $67k now? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin miners sold over $83 million in BTC recently.
BTC has dropped to the $67,000 price level.

Bitcoin [BTC] has experienced declines over the past few days, with the most notable drop occurring on 11th June. In response to this decline, miners have been selling off their holdings to take some profits. 
However, these sales are not being reflected on the exchanges. Despite these circumstances, the open interest continues to maintain a respectable volume.
OTC sales deplete the Bitcoin miner reserve
An analysis of key Bitcoin miner metrics revealed a decline in miner holdings. The miner reserve, while maintaining a volume of around 1.8 million, has experienced slight declines. 
However, tracking the miner outflow showed a decrease, indicating that the volume being sent to exchanges from miner wallets has declined.
The metrics may be confusing at first because the flow of BTC from miner wallets is not visible, yet the reserve has seen declines. 
However, the situation becomes clearer when analyzing Over the Counter (OTC) sales. 
Source: CryptoQuant
An analysis of BTC Miner OTC sales revealed that some major mining companies have been selling off their holdings. According to a chart on CryptoQuant, there was recently the largest OTC sale since late March, with around 1,200 BTC sold. 
This is a sign of miner capitulation, indicating that miners are selling their BTC holdings, potentially due to financial pressures or to lock in profits amidst market declines. 
These types of transactions do not immediately impact exchange volumes but still reduce the overall reserve.
How has BTC trended amidst sell-offs
An analysis of Bitcoin on a daily time frame chart showed a negative trend over the last seven days. AMBCrypto’s analysis of its price trend indicated that between the 6th and 7th of June, Bitcoin’s price dropped from the $70,000 range to around $68,000.
However, BTC saw another major decline on 11th June, taking its price lower. Analysis of the chart showed that it declined by over 3%, bringing its price down to the $67,000 range.
 At this rate, Bitcoin was moving dangerously close to its short moving average (yellow line), which has served as support at around the $65,000 price range.
Source: TradingView
As of this writing, BTC was trading at around $67,400, with a slight attempt at an uptrend.
 Analysis of its Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed that it is now below the neutral line, with the RSI at around 47. This indicates that BTC is currently in a bear trend.
Bitcoin still getting lots of interests
An analysis of another key metric revealed that despite the miner sell-off and the price decline, Bitcoin continues to see a high volume of interest. 
This suggests that, even in a bear trend, there remains significant engagement and potential optimism in the market.
A look at the Open Interest chart from Coinglass showed it was around $34 billion as of this writing.
 Analysis of the chart indicated that its all-time high (ATH) was around $39 billion, a level achieved in March when the BTC price was over $70,000. 
This suggests that cash inflow has not stopped, and many traders are buying in due to the price drop.

Read Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2024-2025

Additionally, comparing the current open interest (OI) to its all-time high (ATH) shows that there has been no significant loss of positive sentiment around the price of BTC. 
Despite the recent declines, traders remain engaged and optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential.

Imminent breakout? XRP whales accelerate accumulation around $0.5


    In recent weeks, XRP has increasingly consolidated around the $0.5 mark as investors await a possible breakout. 



Notably, amid the dormancy in XRP’s price, new on-chain data indicates that whale investors have been accumulating the token, possibly in anticipation of a rally. Particularly, addresses with at least 100 million coins have been buying more XRP tokens during the dip in the first ten days of June.



Adding weight to this observation is the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) metric, which provides further insight into investor behavior. As of June 1, the 90-day MDIA for XRP stood at 1,812, indicating investors prefer to hold onto their XRP holdings rather than engage in active trading.







XRP’s next price movement 



When looking at the next XRP price target, crypto analyst Dark Defender has suggested that the token might be lining up for a possible rally. In an X post on June 12, the analyst noted that the cryptocurrency had formed a familiar pattern from 2017.



The analyst observed that on the weekly time frame, XRP had positioned itself above a critical support level, echoing past instances where the token demonstrated resilience amid market turbulence. 



Moreover, indicators suggest the possibility of a forthcoming reversal, with sentiment teetering on the brink of oversold territory. According to the analyst, crossing above $0.6640 and breaching the $1 resistance mark are pinpointed as pivotal moments that could pave the way for a sustained uptrend.




“The other side of the orange line, the resistance stands around $1. It will be easy above $0.6640 and $1,” the expert said. 




At the same time, the expert provided a chart indicating that the price is testing the support line of the ascending channel, an area that has historically provided a good entry point for bullish positions.

The stochastic oscillator is near the oversold region, suggesting potential for upward movement if historical patterns repeat. If the support line holds, a bounce back towards the upper trendline could occur, potentially aiming for the $0.70 to $1.00 range over the next few months. 



Although XRP has failed to replicate the movement of assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency has several underlying fundamentals likely to spur a breakout. For instance, if the ongoing Ripple and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) case is ruled in favor of the blockchain firm, it could act as a catalyst for XRP’s rally.



Additionally, Ripple’s continuous expansion of its network of partnerships with financial institutions worldwide brings much-needed credibility from institutional involvement. Indeed, the market also anticipates that XRP will likely rally once Ripple rolls out its stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.



XRP price analysis



At the time of reporting, XRP was trading at $0.49, having rallied by over 2% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, XRP was down 6%.

In the short term, XRP appears to be consolidating between the $0.47 support and the $0.50 resistance. Notably, a breakout above $0.50 could signal a potential move towards the next resistance at $0.52. On the other hand, a breakdown below $0.47 could lead to further declines, with the next support levels likely around $0.45 or lower.

Here's How Much Trump Could Have Had Today If He Didn't Sell His Ethereum Back In December - Benzinga

As the upcoming elections draw closer, former President Donald Trump’s involvement in various sectors, including cryptocurrency, could play a significant role. Many are wondering if Trump is a big crypto investor himself as recent data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that Trump reached a quick $33 million high last week. According to Arkham, he currently holds 475.6 ETH, worth $1.73 million. Don't Miss: In December 2023, Trump sent over 1,000 Ethereum (ETH) tokens to Coinbase, presumably to sell. At the time, the Ethereum was worth $2.3 million. However, ETH has since performed well, and Trump may regret selling too soon.If Trump were still holding all 1,075 ETH he sent to Coinbase, they would be worth around $3.9 million, nearly 60% higher than what he sold them for, as ETH reached higher than $3,600 today. If he held and sold now instead, Trump could have had $1.6 million more in his portfolio.With many investment management firms aiming to list spot Ether ETFs, some experts believe that Ethereum’s continued market share growth and its leading status among smart contract platforms could propel its value to a $2.2 trillion market cap, or approximately $22,000 per coin, by 2030.Trending: If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.While Trump might regret his sale, the ETH was free. He acquired the tokens through an NFT project that utilized his name, image, and likeness, granting Trump royalties through his licensing deals.The Trump Digital Trading Cards project was minted in December 2022 for $99 each. The 45,000 unique NFTs feature photos of Trump in different settings and poses. Currently, the cheapest NFT is on sale for a little less than $500 (0.14 ETH), and the most expensive sale goes for 37 ETH (worth nearly $150,000 at the time). However, the Trump NFT projects do not stop there. Trump released another project in late 2023, coined the "Mugshot Edition," a nod to his legal troubles. It offered personalized rewards, with those who bought at least 47 Trump cards getting to have dinner with him at Mar-a-Lago and receiving a piece of the suit Trump wore for his mugshot when he was arrested in August.As Trump continues to earn royalties and performs well on the campaign trail, it will be interesting to see how he manages his ETH position going into the presidential election in November. Mark Cuban said earlier this week on X, that crypto could be a big factor in tipping the scale in favor of Trump this November.Read Next:

Layer-1 (L1) blockchain Solana (SOL) has recently shared insights from a report titled “Overview of Real World Assets on Solana” by Reflexivity Research.
This report highlights the blockchain’s strong infrastructure, solid developer community, and cutting-edge technology, which make it an ideal platform for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.
Why Solana Stands Out in the Real-World Asset Tokenization Sector
Solana has become a significant platform for deploying RWAs due to its high throughput and active trading ecosystem. Its ecosystem supports tokenization through decentralized exchanges (DEXs), oracle services, on/off ramps, and bridges.

Solana’s advantages in hosting RWAs include scalability, low gas fees, and high transaction speed. These are essentials for the frequent trading of tokenized assets. The development of specialized infrastructure, including RWA-specific tools, further supports the growth of tokenization on Solana.

It also uses standardized tokens, such as the Solana Program Library (SPL) token and Metaplex standards for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), to ensure secure, efficient transactions and enhanced liquidity. Solana’s SPL token standard handles everything related to tokens on its network.

“This ensures that users can trust that transferring any specific SPL token doesn’t involve malicious code capable of stealing their funds,” the Solana team wrote.

In January, Solana introduced an iteration called “token extension,” which allows collaboration with large, regulated institutions. These extensions address the needs of real-world asset tokenization, offering features such as confidential transfers and interest accumulation.
Austin Federa, Head of Strategy at Solana, explained that Solana’s token extensions include more than a dozen features designed to meet the needs of developers, enterprises, and financial institutions.


“Token issuers, from game developers to stablecoin issuers, can choose to enable any combination of token extensions, which reduce the amount of work your engineering team has to do and provide capabilities that weren’t previously possible,” Federa explained.

Key Projects Driving RWAs Tokenization on Solana
Solana’s real-world asset tokenization ecosystem spans yield-bearing assets such as US Treasuries and non-yield assets like real estate, private credit, and physical goods. Key projects in tokenized US Treasuries include Ondo Finance (USDY) and Maple Finance (cash management). Additionally, Etherfuse on Solana offers ‘stablebonds,’ a tokenized bond offering aimed at retail investors in Mexico.

Parcl on Solana enables investing in specific geographic real estate markets without requiring direct property ownership for non-yield-bearing assets. HomebaseDAO tokenizes real estate assets and allows fractional ownership using NFTs on Solana.

Meanwhile, private credit platforms like Credix Finance allow investors to allocate stablecoins (e.g., USDC) into the liquidity pool or invest in specific tranches of deals. Credix facilitates USDC borrowing for borrowers, typically fintech companies in emerging markets.
Additionally, Solana’s ecosystem includes tokenized physical goods. BAXUS enables buying and selling tokenized spirits, Collector Crypt tokenizes physical cards, and AgriDex tokenizes agricultural commodities.
The Pyth Network oracle also provides real-time data feeds for trading and financial applications, leveraging Solana’s rapid block times and low transaction costs. This diversity illustrates real-world asset tokenization’s extensive applications and potential on Solana.

Despite its potential, the real-world asset tokenization sector faces challenges, including regulatory compliance, enforceability issues, and reliance on oracles. New standards and third-party audits are needed to build trust and prevent fraud. Borys Pikalov, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at tokenization firm Stobox, emphasized the importance of regulatory compliance for blockchain providers.

“Developers of chains with a heavy RWA focus should comply with technical standards for the securities infrastructure to be selected by regulated entities for their RWA operations. Given that most RWA transactions will likely be regulated, the lack of such compliance would leave RWA-focused chains with a relatively small market,” he told BeInCrypto.

Should Banks Be Crime Fighters? The Hidden (and Not So Hidden) Costs

Are these rules futile? Crime is impossible to effectively measure, intent even more so, which means we have no way of knowing just how much is prevented. But, to pick one example, a United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report from 2022 showed that cocaine seizures in 2020 were more than double the 2010 level, and 5% higher than the previous year. Of course, this could mean that officials are better at tracing and seizure. But it’s more likely there’s just more drugs moving, and anyway, success at confiscation has little to do with money laundering. In other words, it’s hard to argue that crime – drugs, smuggling, sex trafficking, sanctions busting – is heading down, despite the heavy-handed and punitive approach.

Ethereum to 'attack' its all-time high, lead altcoins at 'upwards only' market


    The cryptocurrency market is poised for a significant turnaround, which could drive Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins to previous all-time highs. The shift happened as June 12’s U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data came in lower than expected.



According to Michaël van de Poppe, CIO & Founder of MN Trading Consultancy, this could be a “massive sign” for altcoins and Bitcoin (BTC). Notably, the professional trader highlighted finance data as a leading indicator for this bullish stance in a post on X.




“The Dollar and Treasury Yields are dropping significantly as the markets are expecting rate cuts to be happening.” 
— Michaël van de Popp








The Core CPI year-over-year (YoY), month-over-month (MoM), and the regular CPI YoY and MoM were all lower than forecasted. This positive data suggests that inflation is weakening, potentially leading to interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.



Macroeconomic data to boost an altcoins season



Earlier on June 12, Van de Poppe had stated that the altcoin bottom could be in, as multiple macroeconomic events, including the CPI news and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, were set to impact the markets. He compared the potential rally to previous FOMC events, where cryptocurrencies saw significant gains after correcting before the event.




“It might even be the case that Bitcoin is attacking an all-time high in the coming weeks if there’s a dovish stance from the FOMC.” 
— Michaël van de Poppe




The analyst also expects the Dollar and Treasury Yields to fall from the CPI data and the upcoming Producer Price Index (PPI) data, leading to the end of the altcoin and crypto market correction.



‘Once in a few years golden opportunity’



This outlook aligns with the long-term cycle analysis provided by Jelle, a known crypto and stock trader. According to Jelle, altcoins present investors with a “golden opportunity once in a few years,” as reported by Finbold.




“Altcoins present investors with a ‘golden opportunity once in a few years’ to ‘make a lot of money.'” 
— Jelle




On that note, TradingView‘s “Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding BTC” index (TOTAL2) shows a pattern of accumulation zones lasting 450, 720, and now 650 days in each cycle. If this pattern plays out, an altseason is imminent and could bring huge gains for traders positioning at this point.







Van de Poppe believes that after the correction period, the crypto market will move “upwards only” with the potential approval of the Ethereum ETF in the coming weeks. Therefore, Ethereum could attack its all-time high during the summer.




“After that, it’s upwards only where the Ethereum ETF is likely going to find approval in the coming weeks and start attacking the all-time high during the summer.” 
— Michaël van de Poppe




Notably, another known cryptocurrency trader and on-chain analyst, Ali Martinez, reported Ethereum whales continue to accumulate. During the recent dip, these highly capitalized addresses purchased over 240,000 ETH, worth $840 million, highlithed Martinez.







As the cryptocurrency market awaits the FOMC rate decision and Fed speech, traders and investors should keep an eye on the price action of gold, the dollar, and treasury yields. While an altseason seems likely, it’s essential to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results, and demand plays a crucial role in driving the altcoin market.

Cryptocurrency Sector Continues to Be the Target of Hackers! Here are the Most Targeted Platforms in the Last 13 Years! - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Crystal Intelligence's report, in the last 13 years, the cryptocurrency industry has faced 785 cases of theft, resulting in losses of approximately $19 billion.
Blockchain Crimes Continue to Increase
The report highlights the ongoing and growing problem of blockchain-related crimes despite advances in security measures.


The report divides incidents into three main types:

Security Violations: 220 incidents
DeFi Hacks: 345 incidents
Fraud Schemes: 220 incidents

The most significant theft recorded was the 2019 Plus Token Ponzi scheme, which resulted in losses of $2.9 billion. The increasing trend in crypto crimes continued and 2023 was a record year. That year alone there were 286 thefts worth over $2.3 billion.





Increased Illegal Activities
“Despite improved and enhanced monitoring and reporting mechanisms, illegal activities on the blockchain continued to increase,” the report said. This statement underlines the challenges the industry faces in combating sophisticated cybercriminals.

Most Targeted Platforms
Ethereum has emerged as a primary target for crypto criminals over the past two years, with 131 incidents resulting in losses of approximately $1.3 billion. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was attacked 100 times, causing a loss of over $186 million.


Latest Events
The report includes data until March 2024, but states that since then, Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin has been hacked for $320 million.
In response, DMM Bitcoin announced plans to raise capital to fully refund affected users.





Ongoing Efforts and Challenges
The steady increase in crypto-related crimes highlights the urgent need for robust security protocols and regulatory frameworks.
Despite advances, the dynamic and decentralized nature of the blockchain industry poses ongoing challenges in securing digital assets.
As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, industry stakeholders must be vigilant and proactive in developing innovative solutions to protect against theft and fraud and ensure the security and integrity of the digital financial ecosystem.

On-Chain Analyst Willy Woo Says Bitcoin Weathering Miner Capitulation Phase Before Price Rebound - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) is currently weathering a miner capitulation phase, according to on-chain analyst Willy Woo.
Woo tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that the Bitcoin halving event in April is currently “culling weak miners”










The event, which happens roughly every four years, essentially cuts the Bitcoin reward that miners receive for powering the network in half, reducing the new supply of BTC entering the market.
Woo says the weak miners dump BTC “as they die” and then Bitcoin’s price rebounds afterward.
“But first we need to purge the degen open interest in futures bets. Liquidations need to happen before a pump.” 
Source: Willy Woo/X
Woo also shares a chart that examines Bitcoin’s network flows.
Explains the analyst,
“A visualization of capital flows in and out of the Bitcoin store of value network over time. Units on the left are billions of USD per day. 
Slowly, slowly… then all at once.”
Source: Willy Woo/X
Bitcoin is trading at $66,681 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 5% in the past 24 hours and more than 5.5% in the past seven days.
BTC is also down more than 9.5% from its all-time high of $73,738, which it set on March 14th.

AI Token Prices Plunge as Bear Market Intensifies


							

Crypto community curious on AI tokens freefall.



FET, AGIX, and RNDR slump after weeks of trending sideways.



All three coins have lost about 30% value in the past week.




AI-based tokens are experiencing a downtrend, raising concerns in the crypto community. Several top AI tokens, including FET, AGIX, and RNDR, have broken key support levels after weeks of sideways movement.



FET consolidated after hitting an all-time high of $3.485 on March 28. Initially appearing as a minor pullback, the trend has developed into a classic price reversal, with FET’s price falling over 58% in the past three months.



TradingView data shows FET entered a horizontal trend in mid-April, oscillating around $2.168. However, last week’s price action saw FET drop sharply, falling 32% since last Thursday to trade at $1.540 at the time of writing.









SingularityNET’s AGIX token has followed a similar pattern. After reaching an all-time high in March, AGIX entered a sideways trend before breaking below support in a sharp decline.



AGIX currently trades at $0.658, marking a 30% drop in the past week, according to TradingView data.



While AGIX broke through several support levels, daily chart data shows it is currently holding at a significant support level established on April 13.Like FET and AGIX, RNDR has shown significant bearish momentum in the past week, breaking below support and out of a horizontal channel. A 26.5% drop in the past week has altered RNDR’s recent trend pattern. However, the distributed GPU rendering protocol would need to break below support around $6.5 to confirm the downtrend. As of this writing, RNDR trades at $8.34, per TradingView data.

Ripple (XRP) Hits Key Resistance Post 13% Decline


This analysis explores Ripple’s (XRP) recent price activity and network engagement, providing valuable insights into the underlying dynamics and potential future directions.
Can XRP bounce back from its recent price decline as active addresses decline?
Ripple Daily Technical Outlook
On Friday, June 7, XRP saw a significant 13% decline, highlighting the critical role of the Ichimoku Cloud in assessing support, resistance levels, and trend direction. 

Despite attempts, XRP failed to breach the daily Ichimoku Cloud, underscoring its importance. XRP was also unable to surpass the 100 EMA (blue line) and 200 EMA (green line), falling short of the upper boundary of the Ichimoku Cloud. The baseline (red) acted as a strong support level. 
The rejection from the cloud and the breakout below the baseline are crucial indicators for determining price direction.
Read More: How To Buy XRP and Everything You Need To Know
Ripple Price Analysis (Daily). Source: TradingView
Following this drop, XRP stabilized around $0.49, which served as support, with the baseline acting as resistance. However, XRP broke below the $0.49 support level, reaching $0.48. 
Currently, XRP is stabilizing around this mark, with $0.49, and the daily Ichimoku Cloud baseline is now likely to serve as strong resistance levels.
If XRP rises above $0.49, the outlook will significantly change. The key support level to watch is the Ichimoku baseline; a break above this level could signal a bullish rise on the horizon.

XRP On-Chain Analysis: Active Addresses
This analysis focuses on the activity of XRP’s active addresses over the last 30 days, highlighting significant changes and trends. 
The dataset includes hourly data on the price of XRP and the number of active addresses over a 7-day period, allowing for a detailed examination of market behavior and participant engagement.
The data indicates a healthy level of activity within the XRP network. The rolling 7-day change metric smooths out the hourly volatility and highlights a steady growth trend in user engagement. 
This is a positive sign for the network as it demonstrates growing interest and participation, which are essential for the ecosystem’s vitality and long-term success.

Active addresses increased from 66,000 to 107,000 between June 1 and June 8, then sharply declined from 107,000 to 92,000, resulting in a decrease of 14.02%.
Despite the sharp decline in active addresses, the current level of active addresses remains relatively high. 
Read More: Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030
XRP: Active Addresses (7D). Source: Santiment

This sustained activity has likely contributed to the stability of XRP’s price, preventing it from experiencing the drastic drops seen in other top 20 altcoins by market cap. 
If the number of active addresses were to fall back to 60,000 or lower, it could generate significant selling pressure. 
This is because many trading algorithms incorporate active addresses as a key indicator of a blockchain network’s health and activity. Therefore, maintaining high levels of active addresses is crucial for supporting XRP’s price and overall market confidence.

What's Going On With Bitcoin Mining Stock Riot Platforms Wednesday? - Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) - Benzinga

Riot Platforms Inc RIOT shares have been volatile amid ongoing developments surrounding a potential takeover attempt of Bitfarms Ltd BITF. Shares are moving higher Wednesday after the Bitcoin BTC/USD mining company commented on the recent adoption of a shareholder rights plan.What To Know: Bitfarms previously initiated a strategic alternatives review process to consider continuing to execute on the company's business plan, a business combination or other strategic transaction or a sale of the company following a takeover attempt from Riot.The special committee determined that Riot's offer "significantly undervalued" the company. Riot then announced that it built a 12% stake in Bitfarms as it continued to pursue a potential takeover. Bitfarms followed up that move with the adoption of a shareholder rights plan.Under terms of the shareholder rights plan, if Riot or another entity builds a stake of more than 15% in the company between June 20 and Sept. 10, Bitfarms will issue new shares, diluting the stake of Riot or other entity pursuing a hostile takeover.Why It Matters: On Wednesday, Riot issued a press release commenting on the newly announced shareholder rights plan, which it called “shareholder unfriendly.”Riot argued that the 15% threshold is in direct conflict with established legal and governance standards and suggested the move is further evidence that the Bitfarms board is disregarding good corporate governance.“We have attempted to privately engage with the Bitfarms Board and recently sent two letters urging constructive collaboration with us around the addition of at least two new directors who are fully independent of Bitfarms and Riot. Instead of engaging with us privately and in good faith, Bitfarms has responded by implementing an off-market Poison Pill with a trigger well below the customary 20% threshold,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot.“We will continue to push to address the serious corporate governance issues at Bitfarms and ensure that shareholders have a say on the Company’s path forward.”It’s worth noting that former President Donald Trump has called for all remaining bitcoin to be mined in the United States, which may be helping lift mining stocks Wednesday.

Stability AI Releases SD3: The Most Powerful, Open-Source Image Generator is Available in HuggingFace - Decrypt

Stability AI, a leading company in the field of artificial intelligence, has just released the latest generation of its open-source image generator, Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3). This model is the most powerful open-source, uncensored, customizable text-to-image generator to date.SD3l is released under a free non-commercial license and is available via Hugging Face. It is also available on Stability AI's API and applications, including Stable Assistant and Stable Artisan. Commercial users are encouraged to contact Stability AI for licensing details."Stable Diffusion 3 Medium is Stability AI’s most advanced text-to-image open model yet, comprising two billion parameters,” Stability AI said in an official statement, “the smaller size of this model makes it perfect for running on consumer PCs and laptops as well as enterprise-tier GPUs. It is suitably sized to become the next standard in text-to-image models.”Decrypt got access to the model, but the ComfyUI workflow shared by Stability required some nodes that were not still available. The usual workflows compatible with SD1.5 and SDXL don't work with SD3. There is a post in Reddit explaining how to run it using StableSwarmUI.The model's key features include photorealism, prompt adherence, typography, resource-efficiency, and fine-tuning capabilities. It overcomes common artifacts in hands and faces, delivering high-quality images without the need for complex workflows. The model also comprehends complex prompts involving spatial relationships, compositional elements, actions, and styles. It's remarkably accomplished at generating text without artifacting and spelling errors, thanks to Stability AI's Diffusion Transformer architecture. The model is capable of absorbing nuanced details from small datasets, making it perfect for customization.SD3 generation samples. Image: Stability AIThe model was first unveiled in February 2024, and was made available via API in April 2024.Stability AI has collaborated with Nvidia to enhance the performance of all Stable Diffusion models. The TensorRT-optimized versions of the model will provide best-in-class performance, with past optimisations yielding up to a 50% increase in performance.Stability AI conducted internal and external testing, as well as the implementation of numerous safeguards to prevent the misuse of SD3 Medium by bad actors.According to a spokesperson from Stability AI, the minimum hardware requirements to run SD3 range from 5GB to 16GB of GPU VRAM, depending on the specific model and its size. SD3 uses a different encoding technology in this model, so it can generate better images and have a better understanding of text prompts. It will also be capable of generating text but will require large amounts of computational power.“For SD3 Medium (2 billion parameters) we recommend 16GB of GPU VRAM for higher speed, but folks with lower VRAM can still run it with a minimum of 5GB of GPU VRAM," Stability AI told Decrypt. The firm added that, "SD3 has a modular structure, allowing it to work with all 3 Text Encoders, with smaller versions of the 3 Text Encoders or with just a subset of them. Much of the VRAM is used for the text encoders. There is also the possibility of running the biggest Text Encoder, which is T5-XXL, in CPU. This means that the minimum requirements to run SD3 2B are between SD1.5 and SDXL requirements. For fine tuning that also depends on how you handle Text Encoders. Assuming you preprocess your dataset and then you unload the encoders, the requirements are around the same of SDXL using the same method.”Stability added that “there is no need for a refiner." This feature simplifies the generation process and enhances the overall performance of the model. SDXL introduced this feature by releasing two models that were supposed to run one after another. The base model generated the overall image and the refiner made sure to add the little details. However, the Stable Diffusion community quickly ditched the refiner and fine tuned the base model, making it capable of generating detailed images on its own.For some examples of what custom SDXL models are capable of generating right now without detailers, we have a guide with photorealistic generations.Despite controversy around the company’s finances and its future, Stability made sure to let us know this won’t likely be its last rodeo. "Stability is actively iterating on improving our image models as well as focusing on our multimodal efforts across video, audio & language," the spokesperson said.Beyond Stable Diffusion, Stability AI has released open source models for video, text and audio. It also has other image generation technologies like Stable Cascade and Deepfloyd IF. Stability AI plans to continuously improve SD3 Medium based on user feedback.“Our goal is to set a new standard for creativity in AI-generated art and make Stable Diffusion 3 Medium a vital tool for professionals and hobbyists alike.” Stability AI said.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Tether teases new assets as old ones are forgotten


Tether chief exec Paolo Ardoino has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to tease that Tether is prepared to “unveil its new class of digital assets” next week. 
It’s not clear exactly what digital assets will be announced next week, but we do know that they will be the latest in a long line of digital assets launched by the stablecoin giant, many of which have now been largely forgotten.
The most popular asset Tether has created is, of course, USDT, which is ‘tethered’ to the value of the US dollar. However, it also has assets tied to other currencies like the Euro, Offshore Yuan, and the Mexican Peso. 
Perhaps the most interesting of these assets is the Offshore Yuan Tether, which was launched in collaboration with Zhao Dong. Dong was once one of the most prominent over-the-counter traders in China and had previously disclosed that he was a Tether shareholder.
After the announcement of this product, he was arrested and eventually convicted of charges equivalent to money laundering in China. The last time any of this asset left the Tether Treasury on Ethereum was 2019 and the most recent time assets went back to the Treasury was January 2023. On Tron Offshore Yuan Tether has only left the Treasury once, also in January 2023.

The Euro version of Tether has less than €32 million in circulation, largely on the Omni Layer, an implementation that Tether announced last year it was discontinuing support for. The last transaction from the issuer address for Euro tether on the Omni layer was in 2019 to revoke 1,000 tokens, a quantity well under the $100,000 USD minimum redemption size that Tether advertises.
The story is barely any better on Ethereum, where the last time tokens left the Tether Treasury was in July of 2022. 
The Mexican Peso version of Tether is a newer asset launched in 2022 and there are approximately Mex$20 million in circulation. No assets have left the Tether Treasury for this asset since June of 2022. 
Furthermore, Tether has never shared an audit or attestation for any of these assets.

ChatGPT-4o predicts Bitcoin price as U.S. CPI inflation cools


    Bitcoin (BTC) gained $1,500 in seconds as the May print of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed inflation cooling faster than expected. 



The most awaited U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data today revealed that inflation remained unchanged at 0.3% in May, surpassing market estimates. 



Notably, market watchers were eagerly anticipating this crucial inflation data for insights into the current economic health and the potential stance of the U.S. Federal Reserve with their policy rate plans.







The cooling inflation figures have significantly boosted market sentiment, causing Bitcoin and other altcoins to surge. Following the CPI data release, Bitcoin surged 3.60%, reaching $69,411.30.



Altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also saw substantial gains, rising nearly 3% and 4%, respectively. This positive market reaction underscores the critical role of inflation data in shaping investor expectations and market dynamics.



ChatGPT-4o Bitcoin price prediction



With the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, traders and investors are keenly focused on potential interest rate decisions. In this context, Finbold provided technical analysis and market projections to ChatGPT-4o for a one-month BTC price prediction.



This period is chosen to capture the immediate aftermath of the FOMC meeting and the typical short-term market response to significant economic events.



Considering the cooling CPI data and its impact on market sentiment, ChatGPT-4o forecasts a favorable environment for Bitcoin. 



If the FOMC maintains the current rates, Bitcoin is likely to trade between $70,000 and $73,000. However, in the less likely scenario of a rate cut, Bitcoin could see more pronounced gains, trading between $73,000 and $75,000

Institutional Interest in Digital Assets: Bitcoin Leads the Charge

Deciding which tokens merit inclusion, and in what proportions, is a pivotal consideration. Despite the proliferation of thousands of cryptocurrencies, only a select few warrant inclusion in institutional portfolios. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as industry stalwarts, are indispensable. Additionally, tokens such as Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK) should be considered, albeit with careful, active management to mitigate potential risks. This balanced approach ensures that investments in digital assets are both judicious and resilient.

SEC's Approval of ETH ETFs Paves the Way for Ethereum's Dominance

Lastly, a higher ETH price could kick-start the Ethereum DeFi economy, setting off a powerful feedback loop. To take a simple example: just on AAVE, there is ~$9 billion of ETH-linked collateral (between wETH, wstETH, weETH), plus another $1 billion or so in L2s. Sure, some of this collateral is used for delta-neutral strategies like recursive lending and points farming, but most of it is likely not.

Retail Investors Still Bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) Ahead of FOMC Meeting


																Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market experienced a notable surge following the release of the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, and now eyes are on tonight’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.
Bitcoin and Ethereum posted gains of 3.4% and 2.43% over the past 24 hours, respectively. The crypto market remains uncertain, with BTC hovering at around $70,000, Ethereum struggling to get past $4,000, and investors treading with caution. However, there has been a notable shift in market sentiment, especially among retail traders on Binance.
Retail Investors’ Long Positions
According to Hyblock’s latest findings, 70.25% of accounts on crypto exchange Binance hold net long positions on Bitcoin, a significant increase from 57% just 24 hours prior. This essentially suggests that retail players are increasingly attempting to “buy the bottom,” showing a strong belief in a potential rebound ahead of the FOMC meeting.
“We are down quite a bit, but retail is still favoring long positioning. 70.25% of accounts on Binance are currently in a net long on BTC. Just 24 hrs ago, this was 57%. In other words, they continue they continue trying to buy the bottom.”
It is important to note that this behavior by retail investors comes amidst ETF outflows, which demonstrates investor caution ahead of the fact.
Data compiled by Farside revealed that Grayscale’s GBTC experienced the largest net outflows amounting to $121 million. Following closely behind are ARK Invest’s ARKB, which witnessed $65.5 million, and Bitwise’s BITB with $11.7 million in outflows.




Next up were Fidelity’s FBTC with $7.4 million and VanEck’s HODL with $3.8 million in outflows. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT did not record any activity on Tuesday. However, the latest wave of outflows ended the 19-day streak of net inflows for the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, with outflows totaling almost $65 million the day before.
Bitcoin Bullish on Optimistic CPI
Lower inflation figures are further expected to boost the crypto market, which has been range-bound for weeks. In May, the CPI remained essentially unchanged, as it surpassed the previously estimated 0.1% increase and declined from April 0.3%. Annually, CPI increased by 3.3%, slightly below both predictions and April’s 3.4%.
The latest price movement and the retail long position could also mean that BTC had already priced in the latest CPI data and the upcoming Fed decision.
As described by IREN board member Mike Alfred, Bitcoin is a “highly intelligent global macro asset” that potentially anticipates and incorporates major economic factors well in advance of their release.
Charlie Bilello, the Chief Market Strategist at Creative Planning, tweeted,
“Overall, US CPI moved down to 3.27% year-on-year in May from 3.36% in April. US inflation has now been above 3% for 38 straight months. US Core CPI (ex-Food/Energy) moved down to 3.41% year-on-year from 3.62% last month. This is the lowest core inflation reading since April 2021.”

Meme Coins: Forbes Says There Is Real-World Utility Behind the 2024 Crypto Boom | Cryptoglobe


                                
As detailed by Sandy Carter in a recent report for Forbes, meme coins are a unique category of cryptocurrency that initially gained attention through internet jokes and memes. Despite their humorous origins, meme coins like Dogecoin have demonstrated remarkable staying power and significant market performance. According to Forbes, while Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has dominated headlines in 2024, meme coins have outshone other digital assets with returns exceeding 1,300% for the top tokens this year.



Sandy Carter is the Chief Operating Officer at Unstoppable Domains. She brings a wealth of experience from her previous roles at AWS and IBM, where she held influential positions. Sandy is deeply committed to advancing diversity and inclusion in technology, exemplified by her role as chairwoman on the board of the nonprofit organization Girls in Tech and her past involvement with the Diversity Committee at the World Economic Forum.



Carter is also a founding member of the Blockchain Friends Forever social movement, which supports women in the Web3 space. As an active participant in the cryptocurrency community, she holds and trades modest amounts of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). Her current focus and passion lie in exploring and promoting enterprise use cases for decentralized technologies.



Forbes attributes some of the success of meme coins to speculation and celebrity endorsements, such as Elon Musk’s well-known support for Dogecoin. However, Forbes emphasizes that the true value of meme coins lies in their real-world utility rather than their comedic appeal. Yet, not all meme coins hold the same potential, and some should be regarded with skepticism.



A prime example of a meme coin gaining serious traction is Shiba Inu (SHIB). Forbes highlights that Shiba Inu is not just a novelty; it has substantial real-world applications. According to Carter, recently, Shiba Inu partnered with Zama.ai to develop a platform featuring fully homomorphic encryption, which enhances identity, security, and risk management solutions within financial technologies. She says this partnership is setting new standards in both the cryptocurrency sector and the traditional financial industry.



“Shiba Inu is one of the largest memecoins by market capitalization, and recently announced a partnership with Zama.ai to develop a fully homomorphic encryption platform. This means that Shiba Inu will be able to create identity, security and risk management solutions that are embedded within payment and other financial technologies. This doesn’t just drive enhanced privacy and security in the memecoin or crypto sector, but is setting standards for the traditional financial industry as it converges with the crypto economy.”



Forbes also points out the impact of celebrities on the meme coin market. Australian model and singer Iggy Azalea has successfully launched the Mother Iggy coin, which saw a staggering 1,200% increase in just one week, bringing its market value to $200 million. Carter says the coin’s utility is further extended as token holders will soon be able to purchase phones and monthly cell plans from Azalea’s telecommunications company. However, she warns that celebrity backing alone does not guarantee success, as evidenced by the sharp decline in value of Caitlyn Jenner’s coin, which now sits at less than $6 million from an initial market cap of $43 million.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

For a meme coin to thrive, it must foster a large and engaged community. Carter uses Floki as an example of a meme coin that has evolved into a movement, branding itself as “The People’s Cryptocurrency.” Floki supports utility-based projects and NFTs, and has developed unique features such as integration with the Valhalla Metaverse play-to-earn game and an NFT marketplace. Additionally, Floki University, a crypto education platform, responds to the growing interest from new investors, helping drive its market capitalization to over $2.5 billion.



Some of the most robust meme coins are those built on established blockchains. Forbes points out Bonk, which utilizes the Solana blockchain, making it well-suited for various decentralized finance applications. The integration with Solana allows Bonk to benefit from the extensive ecosystem already in place, including over 250 on-chain integrations.



Forbes advises that, similar to Bitcoin, meme coins require thorough research before investing. Carter says investors should evaluate a coin’s utility, community engagement, and development team. She also mentions that the true long-term value of a meme coin depends on its ability to solve real-world problems and offer genuinely useful functions beyond what existing cryptocurrencies provide.







Last month, a long-term SHIB investor made headlines for converting a modest investment of $2,625 into a staggering $1.1 million after holding the cryptocurrency for more than three years.



This remarkable investment story was brought to light by the blockchain analysis service Lookonchain. On 1 February 2021, the investor purchased 48.09 billion SHIB using 2 Ether (ETH), which was valued at $2,625 at the time. The investor sold their SHIB holdings for 278.7 ETH, equivalent to $1.1 million. Lookonchain shared the details of this profitable trade on the social media platform X on May 27.

SHIB Trading Volume Surges Amidst Rising Burn Rate


                                SHIB Token Burn Explodes Around 3010% in Just 24 Hours                                The popular meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) has significantly increased its token burn rate. According to Shibburn (a platform that tracks SHIB token burning), the burn rate surged by approximately 3010% on 12th June with more than 232 million Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens burned. This increase in the burn rate comes at a time when the price of SHIB has been consistently falling. The rise in the burn rate can potentially increase the value of Shiba Inu tokens by reducing their supply.Reports indicate that the Shiba Inu community collectively burned around 232.64 million tokens through multiple transactions in just one day. Notably, a single transaction from wallet 0xd9a… burned 225.63 million SHIB tokens. Other significant burns came from wallets 0xa9d… and 0xc58… which burned 3.18 million and 1.69 million tokens, respectively.What's impressive is that other community members also contributed by burning smaller amounts of tokens, adding to the overall increase in the burn rate. Currently, the total number of burned Shiba Inu tokens has reached 410.72 Trillion. Given the community's ongoing efforts, it's likely that the burn rate will continue to rise which could eventually boost the price of Shiba Inu.In the past 24 hours, the trading volume of SHIB has increased by 30.12%, reaching $816.98 Million. However, the current price of SHIB remains around $0.00002196.Future Prospects for Shiba InuShiba Inu is currently trading below $0.000025, which is a critical resistance level. If Shiba Inu surpasses this level, its price could reach $0.00003 in the coming days. Furthermore, if the momentum continues, the Memecoin could see its price move up to $0.00005. Achieving this upward movement would enhance its chances of reaching its target price of $0.0001 by 2025.However, SHIB is still far from its all-time high of $0.00008845. Given the current bearish trend in the token, it might take some time to achieve this target. Despite this, the ongoing efforts by the SHIB community and team are promising. The increased burn rate is gradually reducing the supply of SHIB tokens, which is crucial for boosting the token’s price in the future.Overall, the Shiba Inu community's active participation in burning tokens is a positive sign. The significant increase in the burn rate is a step in the right direction, aiming to reduce the overall supply and in turn increase the value of the remaining tokens. This strategic move might eventually lead to a substantial price increase for Shiba Inu, benefiting its holders and enhancing its position in the cryptocurrency market.ConclusionAs per CoinGabbar, while the current price of Shiba Inu remains low, the efforts to burn tokens are likely to play a significant role in its future price appreciation. The community’s commitment and the strategic burning of tokens are key factors that could help Shiba Inu reach its price targets in the coming years.Also Read: ICBC Praises Ethereum's Innovation, Calls It 'Digital Oil’

Bitcoin Price Prediction: Major Analysts Say BTC Is Headed For 6-Digit ATH


																Major crypto analysts have weighed in on the Bitcoin future trajectory, especially as the flagship crypto has maintained a tepid price action and has continued to consolidate since the halving took place. These analysts predict that Bitcoin will soon rise and climb to a six-digit all-time high (ATH). 
Bitcoin To Rise To $100,000
Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin would rise to $100,000 on its next leg up. He claimed that this upward trend would begin in the next seven to ten days, stating that BTC will “absolutely giga send” when that time comes. The analyst made these remarks while suggesting that the worst was over for Bitcoin. 

	Related Reading


He alluded to the “brutal” price correction that Bitcoin underwent shortly before and after the halving, with the flagship crypto experiencing a 20% price drop. As such, he believes that BTC is unlikely to decline that much again from its current price level. 
Instead, CrediBULL Crypto claimed that the downside is now limited to $60,000 and that, realistically, Bitcoin can’t drop below $62,000 and $63,000. Whatever happens, he expects the Bitcoin pump to begin in the next ten days, which would send it to $100,000.  
In another X post, CrediBULL Crypto stated that things were looking good for Bitcoin. He suggested that the bears would get shaken out of their positions once Bitcoin clears the asks that are above its current price level. He also noted that Bitcoin’s open interest is dropping a bit because the short positions are already starting to cover, and the spot premium is returning for the first time since May 20th. 
Source: X
Interestingly, CrediBULL had earlier predicted that Bitcoin would experience a price decline to $66,000. He had made this prediction as part of a bigger picture, which would send BTC’s price rallying above $71,000 following the price correction. Seeing as the drop to $66,000 has occurred, CrediBULL suggested that it was time for the upward trend to begin.

BitcBTCoin Still Headed For $173,000
Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has given a more bullish price for prediction, stating that the next target for the flagship crypto is $173,000. He made this assertion while noting that Bitcoin’s current price action is currently mirroring its price action in the 2017 market cycle, consolidating around Fib 1.0 just like it did back then.

He highlighted that Bitcoin had four monthly candles followed by an “explosive fifth one” back in 2017. According to Egrag, the same thing is happening again, with Bitcoin already showing four monthly candles while consolidating around its previous ATH. As such, he believes the explosive fifth candle will come in July, just like in 2017.

May CPI Report: Lower Inflation Spurs Bitcoin Price Uptick


							

U.S. CPI dips to 3.3%; Bitcoin reacts positively, underscoring its role as an inflation hedge.



A modest rise in medical and shelter costs influences the slight decrease in annual CPI, impacting financial markets.



Investors eye Bitcoin following the CPI release, suggesting growing cryptocurrency trust amid inflation concerns.




The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May 2024 rose 3.3% annually, slightly below the forecast of 3.4% and April’s figure. This continues the trend seen in recent months, with the CPI hovering around the 3.3% to 3.5% range.



Month-over-month, the CPI increased by 0.31%, reaching a value of 313.21. Notably, this month’s CPI data showed varied movements across categories:




The medical care index saw a marginal increase of 0.4%.



Used cars and trucks experienced a notable decline of 1.4%.



Energy and food prices saw minor increases, contributing to the overall change.




The shelter index, a major component of the CPI, remains a primary driver of the year-over-year increase.



This CPI data is crucial as it influences economic policy and provides insights into inflation trends, key indicators of economic health.



Following the release of the latest U.S. CPI data, which indicated a slight dip in annual inflation to 3.3%, Bitcoin experienced a notable price increase. This movement highlights the potential link between inflation trends and cryptocurrency values. Investors often view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, and today’s CPI data may reinforce this perception.



The modest rise in the index, particularly influenced by sectors like medical care and shelter, suggests an evolving economic landscape where digital assets could play a crucial role in diversifying investment strategies against inflationary pressures.

A new chapter for Tether in AI

Tether, the company behind the popular stablecoin USDT, has announced an ambitious plan to invest up to 1 billion dollars over the next 12 months: the investments will be primarily focused on emerging markets, artificial intelligence (AI), and biotechnologies, sectors considered strategic for the future of technology and the global economy.

A new chapter for Tether in AI
Tether is known for its predominant role in the cryptocurrency market. The stablecoin USDT is used worldwide as a medium of exchange and store of value due to its stability pegged to the US dollar. However, the company has decided to expand its reach beyond the cryptocurrency sector, exploring new investment opportunities that could have a significant impact on the technological and financial landscape.
Emerging markets represent one of the main areas of interest for Tether. These markets offer enormous growth potential and present unique opportunities for technological innovation. By investing in these countries, Tether aims to support the development of digital and financial infrastructures that can improve access to financial services for millions of people.
Investing in emerging markets will not only help stimulate economic growth in these regions, but it will also allow Tether to expand its global presence. The company could use its experience and resources to support innovative projects that foster financial inclusion and promote the adoption of blockchain technologies.
Artificial intelligence is another crucial sector for Tether. In the last two years, Tether’s venture capital (VC) branch has already invested around 2 billion dollars in AI and alternative financial infrastructures. This demonstrates the company’s commitment to supporting the development and implementation of advanced technologies.
AI has the potential to transform numerous sectors, from healthcare to finance, from manufacturing to services. The applications of artificial intelligence can improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and create new business opportunities. For Tether, investing in AI means not only supporting innovation but also ensuring that the company remains at the forefront of technology.
The future of biotechnologies
Biotechnologies represent another promising investment field for Tether. This sector has shown significant growth in recent years, thanks to advances in scientific research and the increase in investments in innovative healthcare solutions.
Biotechnologies offer the possibility to develop new medical treatments, improve the quality of life, and address some of the world’s most urgent health challenges. For Tether, investing in this sector means contributing to solutions that can have a positive impact on global health and supporting cutting-edge scientific research.
Tether’s investments in the next 12 months do not represent a radical change, but rather a continuation of the company’s strategy to support innovation and technological growth. In the last two years, Tether’s VC branch has demonstrated its commitment by investing around 2 billion dollars in crucial sectors such as artificial intelligence and alternative financial infrastructures.
This new wave of investments is a strong signal of Tether’s determination to maintain a leadership position in the global technology landscape. The company not only wants to be a key player in the world of cryptocurrencies, but also a promoter of innovation and progress in emerging and high-impact sectors.
Conclusion
The announcement by Tether to invest up to 1 billion dollars over the next 12 months in emerging markets, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology represents a strategic move that could have a significant impact on these sectors. These investments will not only support innovation and economic growth but also strengthen Tether’s position as a global technological leader.
With the continuous commitment to supporting innovative and high-impact projects, Tether demonstrates to be not only a force in the cryptocurrency sector but also a catalyst for positive change worldwide. As we look to the future, these investments could represent a fundamental step towards a more connected, efficient, and sustainable world.

'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli Ordered to Stop Sharing Wu-Tang Clan Album After DAO Lawsuit - Decrypt

A federal judge in Brooklyn has temporarily ordered infamous “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli to immediately cease playing copies of the one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.” The move came after the record’s current owners, the crypto collective PleasrDAO, filed a suit against Shkreli on Tuesday.PleasrDAO and Shkreli are set to meet in court later this month to debate the lawsuit, which alleges that by retaining copies of the album he previously owned and playing it for online audiences, Shkreli has violated a federal court ruling. Until that hearing, Shkreli is barred from “using, disseminating, streaming, or selling any interests in the album, including its data and files,” according to a ruling Tuesday evening by U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen. The storied saga of the Wu-Tang Clan’s unique, secretly recorded “Shaolin” album began in 2015, when Shkreli—then a controversial pharmaceutical executive—bought the sole existing copy of the record for a reported $2 million. The album came with the condition that it could not be commercially exploited until 2103.After Shkreli was then tried and convicted for securities fraud in 2018, the Department of Justice seized the album, and later sold it to PleasrDAO in 2021 for a whopping $4 million. Since then, Shkreli has repeatedly claimed online that he retained copies of the album, and has played it for audiences—actions, PleasrDAO says, violate the forfeiture order Shkreli signed at the conclusion of his criminal trial. “Martin has been disrespecting this work of art for years,” Leighton Cusack, one of the founders of PleasrDAO, told Decrypt. “A lawsuit was a last resort to honor the intentions of the original artists that this work of art would remain sacred.”On Twitter, Shkreli lambasted the lawsuit, arguing he never explicitly agreed to surrender his rights to play or share the album. He also emphasized that PleasrDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization designed to make decisions collectively, did not vote on whether to file the lawsuit or not. When asked by Decrypt how the organization came to the decision to sue Shkreli, PleasrDAO’s Cusack declined comment. Decrypt also reached out to Shkreli, but did not receive a response.On Tuesday afternoon, shortly before Judge Chen issued a temporary restraining order against Shkreli, PleasrDAO tweeted that their ultimate goal is to disseminate the “Shaolin” album publicly. “Our master plan is to release the music to the public in a way that honors the Wu-Tang Clan and gets them paid while circumventing the streaming oligopoly,” the DAO wrote. “Every action we are taking is in service of that mission.”The collective has not yet, however, laid out how it plans to do so.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Zimbabwe launches study to map and regulate crypto industry

The Zimbabwean government has initiated a study to develop regulations for the virtual asset industry.On June 12, the Zimbabwe Mail reported that the government had established a committee to collect data from crypto companies operating within the country. This study aims to provide a detailed understanding of the country’s crypto industry, including its size and scope.The committee is inviting contributions from both local and international crypto firms. The submission deadline is June 26.Study to usher in regulatory clarity for ZimbabweNick Mangwana, Zimbabwe’s Permanent Secretary for Information and Publicity, described the study as a ‘comprehensive project.’ Its goal is to offer an in-depth overview of the country’s crypto sector and serve as a foundation for future regulations.He stated:“Firstly, we aim to determine the nature and extent of the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Zimbabwe. This involves mapping out the various actors and activities within the space to get a clearer picture of its scope and scale.”He also emphasized the importance of assessing digital assets risks, such as money laundering and other illicit activities. Mangwana noted:“Our objective is to evaluate the dangers of cryptocurrencies being misused for money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities. Given the anonymity and decentralization that characterize these digital assets, it is crucial to identify and mitigate any associated risks.”The study is expected to lead to the creation of a comprehensive regulatory framework that will foster innovation and strengthen Zimbabwe’s financial system.Meanwhile, these efforts reflect how crypto adoption has surged in Africa. Many Africans use crypto to bypass banking and foreign exchange rate restrictions, and governments are starting to recognize the asset benefits for their citizens.As a result, several African nations, including Kenya, are progressing in developing the crypto industry.Latest Alpha Market Report

Bitcoin Whales Buy Amid Market Panic: $950M Exits Exchanges


								On-chain data shows Bitcoin whales may have quietly been accumulating at the recent price lows as exchanges have registered large withdrawals.
Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Has Observed A Decline Recently
As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a post on X, exchanges have seen significant withdrawals over the last couple of days. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “Exchange Reserve,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that these platforms are receiving a net amount of deposits right now. As one of the main reasons why investors would transfer their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can potentially be bearish for the asset’s price.
On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline implies the users are taking out a net number of tokens from these central entities currently. Holders may take coins to self-custody when they wish to hold into the long-term, so such a trend could prove to be bullish for the cryptocurrency.

Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve over the past few months:

Looks like the value of the metric has been riding a downtrend in recent weeks | Source: @ali_charts on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve has gone down recently. More specifically, a net amount of 14,140 BTC, which is worth around $954 million at the current exchange rate, has left these platforms during the last 48 hours or so.
In this period, Bitcoin has been trading at lows following its plunge, so it’s possible that these withdrawals could indicate some fresh accumulation has occurred at these potentially profitable prices.
Given the massive scale, of course, the whale entities would have to have been involved here. These humongous investors participating in possible buying at these levels and taking the coins to self-custody can naturally be a positive sign for the asset.
It would seem that the cryptocurrency may already be seeing the bullish benefit of this accumulation, as its price has now experienced a rebound back above the $69,000 level.
From the chart, it’s also visible that these recent exchange outflows aren’t something that’s exactly new in the market, as the Exchange Reserve has in fact been steadily going down over the past month.

As such, it would appear that there has been significant appetite for taking coins off these platforms in the Bitcoin sector recently.
BTC Price
While Bitcoin may have enjoyed a rebound from its recent lows following the whale exchange outflows, the asset’s price at $69,300 is still very much within the range that the coin been stuck moving inside for so long now.

These Three Stocks Can Surge if the Fed Cuts Rates in September - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



The stock market sighed with relief at the latest consumer price index (CPI) report released by the Labor Department on Wednesday. Instead of rising, the CPI stayed flat from the 0.3% uptick in April. Against the core estimates (without food/energy) of 3.5% annually and 0.3% monthly, core CPI for May was 3.4% and 0.2%, respectively. 



Including food and energy, this puts the annual inflation at 3.3%, helped by the slight 0.1% reduction in food costs and 2% decline in energy costs. Although this still means that inflation is increasing at 3.3% annual rate, the acceleration is not ramping up further. 



In turn, this gives the Federal Reserve more space to cut rates. Given that the shelter index rose by 0.4% in May, the central bank could suppress it by cutting rates, which would lower mortgage rates. Moody’s Chief Economist Mark Zandi believes that the Fed already achieved its objectives when looking at the whole macro picture.







For now, fed fund futures priced in the first rate cut for September by 0.25%, at 82.56% probability based on the CME FedWatch Tool. After today’s FOMC meeting, the tone and message will further paint a clearer picture.



Investors should prepare their portfolios in loosened financial conditions by considering these stocks.



Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)



Like many high-growth stocks, Elon Musk’s Tesla took a tumble since its all-time high of $409 in November 2021. Pressed by aggressive price cuts from Chinese automakers, the Fed’s hiking cycle starting in March 2022 only worsened the company’s tight margins.



The sustained hiking pressure made it more difficult to fund expenses cheaply, eventually leading to Tesla’s layoffs. Likewise, it doesn’t help the automaker’s bottom line that consumers have less disposable income as they need to serve higher debt loads.



However, with the easement on the horizon, Tesla is still in a position of strength, dominating pure EV markets in the US and EU. Ahead of robotaxis reveal in August, and the new entry Model 2 at $25,000 price tag set for 2025 release, TSLA shareholders should see a series of rallies.



Even Tesla’s Optimus robot has become more concrete, with a price tag between $25,000 and $30,000. Is now a good time to make a TSLA entry? At a price of $178, TSLA shares are still far from the 52-week average of $219.62. Over the last three months, the stock has been moving sideways, dropping by only 0.7%, suggesting a stable starting point before another rally. 





Essential Utilities, Inc. (NASDAQ: WTRG)



Utility stocks can be used to gauge the macro environment. Against inflation, they can adjust by offloading costs to consumers who need essential services. Because of that need, utility stocks have stable revenue sources that translate into regular dividend payouts. 



Moreover, if the Fed missed the mark by paving the road to recession, utilities’ predictable cash flows act as a foil. Providing water and natural gas services throughout the country, Pennsylvanian Essential Utilities has been investing $4 billion since 2020 to overhaul aging infrastructure.



With a new investment program of $1.4 billion through 2028, the company is ensuring its operating margins go up as less maintenance is needed on costly repairs and labor. In the last Q1 earnings reported in May, Essential Utilities delivered $265.8 million net income, a significant uptick from $191.4 million in the year-ago quarter.



The company offers a 3.32% dividend yield to shareholders at an annual payout of $1.2284 per share. In the last three months, WTRG stock is up 4% to the present price of $37.42, aligning with its 52-week average of $36.90 per share. Nasdaq’s forecast twelve months ahead puts the average WTRG price target at $42.5 per share.







Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)



It has been no secret that many investors have come to see Nvidia (NVDA) stock as a hedge against inflation, in addition to exposure to generative AI infrastructure. However, with that pressure easing, AMD’s performance is likely to see a boost as the second fiddle to Nvidia. 



If debt load on consumers is significantly reduced via rate cuts throughout the year, they are even more likely to boost AMD’s bottom line. After all, the company caters to the budget-friendly segment across the board, from CPUs/APUs to GPUs.



At the present price point of $161, AMD shares are 16% above the 52-week average of $138.14. Nasdaq’s forecasting paints a significant upside for the average AMD price target at $191.93 per share. 



Do you think the Federal Reserve was correct to inflate the money supply and, therefore, trigger inflation in the first place? Let us know in the comments below.

Crypto Exchange OKX Sees $204,000,000 in Outflows Following Reports of Security Incidents - The Daily Hodl


								Global cryptocurrency exchange OKX is witnessing a massive outflow amid reports of a security breach, according to the decentralized finance (DeFi) data aggregator DefiLlama.
Per DefiLlama approximately $204.67 million in crypto assets has exited OKX over the past 24 hours.










Over the past seven days, OKX has recorded outflows amounting to $633.88 million.
The world’s largest crypto exchange by volumes, Binance, has meanwhile recorded inflows of $128.51 million in a 24-hour period and inflows of $1.364 billion over the past seven days, per the DeFi data aggregator.
Source: DeFiLlama
Citing blockchain security firm SlowMist, Asia-focused journalist Colin Wu says that the security breach on OKX was conducted through SIM hijacking – a type of fraud where attackers manipulate a carrier to transfer the cell phone number of a target to themselves in order to receive the target’s calls or text messages necessary for two-factor authentication on online accounts.
“According to Slowmist, two OKX accounts were stolen this morning, and hackers created new Application programming interface (API) Keys with trading and withdrawal permissions. None of the victims used Google Authenticator, but instead used SMS or email verification. Hackers hijacked mobile phone verification codes to withdraw coins.”
Wu further says that feedback obtained on OKX’s social media account after the hack was reported indicates that the crypto exchange has lax security measures.
“The community feedback shows that OKX’s mandatory use of Google Authenticator is relatively rare, and email + SMS can be used for verification, which increases the risk of theft.”

GameStop (GME) Short Seller Citron Throws in the Towel Citing ‘Market’s Irrationality’ | Cryptoglobe


                                
Citron Research, a prominent short seller known for its bearish position on meme stock GameStop (GME), has revealed it exited its short position on the company’s shares as it noted it respects the “market’s irrationality.”



In an announcement on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the short seller is no longer shorting GME stock not because it believes the company will manage to turn around its current situation, but rather because “with $5 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult like shareholders.”



The announcement comes on the heels of a significant rally for GME, whose price surged above $30 a share on June 11, following a 22.8% intraday jump, before endirong a slight correction to now trade just below that mark. Year-to-date, GME’s shares are up more than 72%.



While analysts remain bearish on GameStop’s long-term prospects, with Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter setting a $11 price target, Citron opted to exit the short position rather than risk further losses citing the “market’s irrationality” for its decision.







The firm also suggested there’s irrationality in the cryptocurrency market, pointing out the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin ($DOGE) “remains a $20 billion entity.”



Citron also expressed concerns about the potential dampening effect of GameStop’s recent stock offering. The company raised $2.14 billion by selling 75 million shares, a move fueled by the renewed hype surrounding the stock after a live stream by Keith Gill, the retail investor known online as “Roaring Kitty,” which Citron called “an insult to capital markets.”







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Gill reportedly holds a significant position in GME stock and call options, currently valued at over $180 million, and could become a billionaire if the price of GME tops the $67 mark.



It’s worth noting that the recent meme stock trading frenzy started after RoaringKitty returned to social media from a three-year hiatus that ended after his testimony in Congress.



AMC Entertainment (NYSE; AMC), a movie theater chain, also experienced a significant uplift, as did various lesser-known cryptocurrencies associated with Roaring Kitty and GameStop.



Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has assured investors that the trading platform is well-prepared for the anticipated GameStop frenzy, emphasizing significant infrastructure improvements made to handle such market volatility while speaking on Fox Business.



Notably the trading platform Gill has been using, E*Trade, is reportedly considering banning the trader over potential stock manipulation according to the Wall Street Journal.

Bitcoin Holders Should Be Watching This Dot Plot At Today's FOMC Meeting - Benzinga

Wednesday’s highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting could set the stage for a bullish run in the cryptocurrency market if one important indicator aligns, according to a crypto analyst.What Happened: Crypto analyst Ted highlighted the importance of today’s FOMC announcements, saying “the market is priced for 1-2 cuts by December.” He referenced the Federal Reserve’s previous indications from March, which suggested 2-3 rate cuts.“Today’s new dot plot will provide insight into just how likely rate cuts in the U.S. are this year.”The “dot plot,” a graphical representation of FOMC members’ rate projections, is a crucial piece of information for market participants.Ted emphasized that the next dot plot won’t be released until September, making today’s release particularly significant. “Expect the market to hold onto this piece of information for the best part of the coming few months,” he said.For crypto enthusiasts, any deviation from the March dot plot could have substantial implications. “More rate cuts = bullish for crypto + risk, while the opposite is also true,” Ted noted.He pointed out that crypto bulls are hoping for a shift lower in the dot plot, which would signal FOMC members’ inclination towards lower rates.Also Read: Solana, Ripple ETFs Unlikely In Near Future, Says Cboe VPIn addition to the dot plot, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report adds another layer of complexity.Ted remarked, “If CPI meets or falls below expectations, that will continue the disinflationary trend and should help risk assets higher on speculation of a dovish Fed meeting later today.” He elaborated that a CPI miss lower than 3.4% for headline inflation and 3.5% for core inflation could provide a significant boost to crypto prices.A dovish outlook with indications of rate cuts could ignite a bullish trend, reinforcing the perception of cryptocurrencies as a viable hedge against traditional financial uncertainties.Following the lower-than-expected CPI data release earlier this day, Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD rallied significantly, boosting hopes for a dovish outlook.What’s Next: In light of these developments, the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 promises to be a crucial gathering for industry stakeholders.Read Next: Bitcoin Soars Above $69K On Improved Inflation Data PrintImage: Shutterstock

Brace for a breakout: Solana key support and resistance levels to watch


    Solana (SOL) is poised for more aggressive moves once it breaks out from its current consolidation period. On that note, there are key support and resistance levels that Solana investors and traders should watch moving forward.



Technical analysis on the SOL/USD daily price chart shows Solana trading at $159 without a clear direction. This is slightly below the 30-day exponential moving average of $162, another key level to watch for both support and resistance insights.



Notably, the most popular Ethereum (ETH) competitor has kept a 2-month price range between $138 and $175. These make key support and resistance levels for Solana, although four deviations occurred—three downwards and one upwards.







Breaking out from this range within a bullish sentiment could cause SOL to revisit this year’s high of nearly $210. Conversely, the first deviation’s lowest price was $117, which makes it a potential target for a bearish bias.



Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) evidences the neutral momentum for this cryptocurrency‘s native token at 47.3 index points.

Solana’s potential 53% surge if it breaks out from key support and resistance levels



Interestingly, the cryptocurrency trader and analyst Ali Martinez has identified a triangle formation on Solana’s price chart. According to Martinez, the triangle draws key support at $143, in an uptrend line, while having resistance at $178, as a downtrend level that could break out.



In particular, the analyst shows a bullish bias toward a resistance breakout that could drive SOL for a 53% surge. This bias could be benefited from an overall positive sentiment favoring altcoins, as reported by Finbold.







In conclusion, Solana’s key support and resistance levels to watch are $117, $138, $143, $162, $175, $178, and $210. The support levels are more robust than the resistance, suggesting a bullish breakout. It is important, however, to understand that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile digital assets, and indicators are not conclusive.

Zimbabwe Opens Consultation on Cryptocurrency Regulation


							

Zimbabwe seeks public input on cryptocurrency regulations as it aims to develop policies for the virtual asset sector.



A committee has been established to consult cryptocurrency operators in the country’s virtual asset ecosystem.



The move comes as Zimbabwe grapples with financial instability, having recently launched a new currency and faced challenges with inflation.




Zimbabwe is gearing up to regulate cryptocurrency regulations, seeking public input to develop policies in the digital asset sector. In a statement published in the state-run Herald newspaper, the government revealed its intention to assess and understand the cryptocurrency landscape. inviting comments from all cryptocurrency service providers operating within or outside the country but offering services to Zimbabwean customers.In line with global practices, the government has established a committee to consult with operators and compile their comments by June 26. The move by the southern African nation reflects a shift in sentiment towards digital assets, once viewed as highly speculative and risky.



While many nations remain hesitant to formulate a clear regulatory framework, Zimbabwe’s efforts signal a willingness to address the complexities of the cryptocurrency market and establish regulations that balance innovation with consumer protection.



Moreover, digital assets offer a potential solution for financial instability in developing economies without relying on international aid. Zimbabwe, grappling with economic challenges since 1999 and burdened with $19.2 billion in debt, has struggled to stabilize its currency.









The nation’s financial regulators have taken extreme measures to revive its ailing economy, including multiple attempts to establish a functioning local currency over the past 15 years, amidst challenges like inflation and currency crashes. Last year, it launched a new currency, ZiG (Zimbabwe Gold), providing temporary relief from rising costs. Consumer prices reportedly fell 2.4% from April to May.



However, the impact was short-lived and did little to address the nation’s long-term financial woes, as inflation remained a concern, with April’s rate at 57.5%. In this context, digital assets could serve as a hedge against local currency depreciation. Furthermore, leveraging blockchain technology can enhance transparency, efficiency, and accountability in key sectors, fostering economic growth and development.

Stocks to Watch Today: Apple, Oracle, and Tesla - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stocks surged on Wednesday amid growing optimism around artificial intelligence, even as they face scrutiny and challenges on various fronts.Apple’s stock soared to a record high as it unveiled a suite of AI-powered features, reclaiming its position as the world’s most valuable company. Meanwhile, Oracle’s stock surged after announcing partnerships with OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and securing significant AI contracts despite missing some Q4 estimates. Tesla’s stock also rose on ambitious robotaxi plans and a bullish price target from ARK Invest, but faces uncertainty surrounding CEO Elon Musk’s contentious pay package.



Apple Retakes Crown as World’s Most Valuable Company



Apple’s stock hit a record high of $217.37, up 4.93%, after unveiling an array of AI-powered features at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) earlier this week.



The iPhone maker’s market capitalization reached $3.332 trillion, surpassing Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to reclaim its status as the world’s most valuable company. Analysts believe Apple’s AI initiatives, such as integrating ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, could drive a significant iPhone upgrade cycle.



The tech giant boasts strong financials, with a trailing P/E of 30.03, a forward P/E of 26.25, and an EPS (TTM) of $6.90.





Oracle’s Stock Jumps on AI Partnerships and Contracts



Oracle’s stock price soared 11.95% to $138.68, despite missing some Q4 estimates, after the company announced partnerships with OpenAI and Google.



The software giant expects strong AI demand to boost sales in fiscal 2025, having signed over $12.5 billion in AI contracts in Q4 alone. Oracle’s market cap reached $383.069 billion, with a trailing P/E of 32.85, a forward P/E of 19.92, and an EPS (TTM) of $3.77.



The company also revealed upcoming generative AI features for its Fusion cloud applications, which will target supply chain management and human resources.



Tesla Faces Uncertainty Amid Ambitious Price Targets by ARK Invest



Tesla’s stock rose 5.59% to $180.20, driven by Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, which set a bold $2,600 price target for the electric vehicle maker by 2029.



ARK’s bullish outlook is based on expectations for Tesla’s yet-to-be-launched robotaxi business, which the firm predicts will account for 90% of Tesla’s value and earnings by 2029. However, some analysts see a risk of Tesla’s stock falling if CEO Elon Musk’s contentious $50 billion pay package is not approved at the annual meeting this week.



Tesla’s market cap is $585.234 billion, and its trailing P/E is 44.45, its forward P/E is 69.93, and its EPS (TTM) is $3.84.

Hack Statement from Bitcoin Exchange OKX: The Claims Are Lies, Compensations Have Been Paid! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Leading cryptocurrency exchange OKX said in a statement that an attacker hacked the accounts of some of its customers.
OKX stated that this hacking incident was quite limited and stated that some users' accounts were accessed using fake documents and compensation was paid to these people.


OKX denied the allegations of security breach and stated that the investigation into the issue continues.

“Description of recent security incidents on individual customer accounts:
“The damages of all users involved in this incident were resolved immediately.”








As you may remember, this hacking incident emerged on social media over the weekend after two OKX users claimed that their accounts were compromised and emptied.
Web3 security firm Dilation Effect claimed earlier this week that attackers exploited a vulnerability in OKX.


However, the exchange strongly denied the allegations of security breach and said, “This incident has nothing to do with Google Authenticator or SMS verification selection.”
OKX said in its latest statement that it has already paid compensation to users regarding the hacking incident and that they will continue to pay compensation to affected users.





Chinese cryptocurrency journalist Wu Blockchain announced in his post today that two users whose accounts were seized received full compensation from the exchange.

FED Leaves Rates Unchanged, But The Statement Issued Is More Critical - Here Are The Hawkish Statements That Brought Bitcoin Down - Bitcoin Sistemi


The FED decided to keep interest rates constant. However, it was seen that the FED followed a rather hawkish attitude in the statements it published with the interest rate decision.
Here are the statements made by the FED along with the interest rate decision:



The FED left the overnight interest rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.50% and foresees only one interest rate cut in 2024.
Despite the 'lack of progress' mentioned in the May 1 statement, 'modest progress' was made towards the 2% inflation target.
The Fed does not think it would be appropriate to lower its policy target range until it gains greater confidence that inflation is sustainably moving toward 2%.
The economy continues to grow at a solid pace, employment growth is strong, and the unemployment rate remains low.
The risks to achieving policy objectives have moved towards a better balance.
Inflation decreased last year but remains high.
The FED will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities.
According to FED forecasts, 4 out of 19 officials do not foresee a rate cut in 2024, while 7 predict 1 and 8 predict 2 cuts.

Solana-Based AI Altcoin Explodes After Earning Support From Crypto Exchange Binance - The Daily Hodl


								A Solana (SOL)-based altcoin project with an artificial intelligence (AI) focus is soaring after gaining support from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.
In a new announcement, Binance says it’s listing decentralized AI computing network io.net (IO) for trading on its platform.










“Binance is excited to announce that io.net (IO) has been added to Binance Simple Earn, ‘Buy Crypto’ and Binance Convert. In addition, Binance will add IO on Binance Margin, Binance Futures and Binance Auto-Invest at 2024-06-11 14:00 (UTC), 2024-06-11 14:00 (UTC) and 2024-06-13 10:00 (UTC) respectively.” 
IO is trading for $5.66 at time of writing, up nearly 52% in the last 24 hours. The altcoin, with a market cap of just over $534 million, reached an all-time high of $5.84 following the Binance announcement.
The io.net project aims to create a decentralized computing network that allows machine learning engineers to access distributed cloud clusters at a lower cost. The intent is to address the challenges of traditional cloud service providers that have inadequate capacity, creating problems such as high costs and longer wait times to access hardware with cloud services.
Says the project team,
“Our vision is to build IO to be the currency of compute, powering an ecosystem of products and services that enable access to compute as a resource and as an asset.”

Groundbreaking XRP Announcement by Ripple CEO and Official X Account - Bitcoin Sistemi


XRP developer Ripple announced the launch of a new stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), during the XRP Ledger Community Summit (XRPL Apex) in Amsterdam.
The announcement was made by company CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who announced that the stablecoin, which will be first offered on XRP Ledger and Ethereum, will be backed by the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio.


“The Ripple stablecoin is called RLUSD; I like to call it Real USD or Ripple USD,” Garlinghouse said. He noted that RLUSD complements the broader XRP ecosystem. However, the CEO did not announce the launch date of the stablecoin. The company's official account stated that RLUSD will arrive later this year.

In addition to the stablecoin, the company's development arm RippleX announced the development of the XRPL EVM Sidechain. This sidechain aims to bring Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility to XRP Ledger (XRPL) and open new opportunities for developers on XRP Ledger, particularly in the areas of DeFi and real-world asset tokenization.





The XRPL EVM sidechain will be connected to the XRPL mainnet via a bridge using wrapped XRP (eXRP) as the native asset and gas token.

BREAKING: FED Released Its Highly Anticipated Interest Rate Decision - Here is Bitcoin's First Reaction - Bitcoin Sistemi

The FED has finally announced its eagerly awaited interest rate decision.
As expected, the FED left interest rates constant.


Bitcoin experienced a decline of $1000 after the decision.






This means the Fed's benchmark interest rate will remain in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, its highest level in 23 years, for about a year.
All eyes are now on Powell, who will hold a press conference at 21:30. As Bitcoinsistemi.com, we will share this press conference with you immediately.


Powell will likely talk about the decision and shed light on how the central bank views the overall economy. The market will look for clues in Powell's statements to predict what interest rate steps the FED may take for the rest of the year.
Experts stated that the possibility of the FED, which announced its interest rate decision after the two-day meeting, to cut interest rates was almost non-existent.






Inflation, which means a constant increase in prices throughout the economy, has been well above the 10-year median value of 2.1% in the United States for more than three years. FED policymakers say they prefer inflation to be 2% or “low and stable” in order to “make sound decisions about saving, borrowing and investing.”
Although inflation has fallen significantly in the last two years, it continues to remain above the FED's target of 2%. While the US inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, was unchanged during the month when seasonally adjusted, the annual rate decreased slightly to 3.3%.

MetaMask debuts Pooled Staking Feature | Bankless


Consensys, the developer behind Ethereum’s popular MetaMask software wallet, just launched a pooled staking feature that enables users of its wallet to stake any amount of Ether onchain.What’s the scoop?StakeWise Solution: Consensys leveraged the open-source architecture of Ethereum liquid staking protocol StakeWise to create its pooled staking offering.Increased Accessibility: Operating a validator on the Ethereum network requires 32 ETH, but MetaMask’s new pooled staking feature will enable anyone to provide security to earn commensurate staking rewards.But Not Available to All: Pooled staking is rolling out in stages, meaning only certain eligible users can access the service today. Additionally, Consensys has stated it has no plans to offer the feature to U.S. or U.K. users due to regulatory uncertainty.Bankless Take:Considering that America's SEC previously fined crypto exchange Kraken for offering a similar pooled staking product – albeit one that was custodial in nature – it makes sense that Consensys is currently unwilling to provide this product to users in certain jurisdictions.Fortunately, increasing regulatory clarity, which America’s Congress is attempting to provide, should provide access to these services for U.S. users, even in the event pooled staking schemes fall under the designation of investment contract and can only be offered by registered brokerages.Although MetaMask’s latest feature is certainly a nice-to-have for individuals with less than 32 ETH looking to stake, it remains unclear what category of user will opt to stake a small amount of ETH onchain instead of purchasing liquid staking tokens.

Buy signal for two strong cryptocurrencies this week


    The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of recovery following the release of cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. Amid this potential recovery, two cryptocurrencies stand out with notable strong momentum.



Finbold analyzed the Relative Strength Index (RSI) heatmap from CoinGlass on June 12 to spot potential buy signals. 



The average weekly RSI shows a neutral-50 landscape, indicating that the market could move in any direction. However, the average daily RSI is currently below 43.90, reflecting recent market conditions. 







This situation creates an ideal situation for a bullish continuation, making these assets prime candidates for a strong upward move this  week, thus presenting a clear trading buy signal.



Injective (INJ) shows strong buy signals



Injective (INJ) is currently showing strong buy signals based on its recent performance and technical indicators. The 24-hour RSI of 66.31, combined with a notable price increase of 21.43%, indicates strong upward momentum. This suggests that INJ is experiencing significant buying pressure and is likely to continue its bullish trend.

RSI values across shorter time frames, notably 15 minutes to 12 hours, consistently remain above 60. This reinforces the immediate buying interest and potential for quick gains, making INJ an attractive option for both short-term traders and long-term investors seeking growth. At press time, INJ is trading at $32.524.



Oasis (ROSE) demonstrates robust performance



Oasis (ROSE) has demonstrated a robust performance with a 24-hour RSI of 68.61 and a price increase of 21.29%. The consistent RSI values across multiple time frames, from 15 minutes to 12 hours, highlight ongoing buying pressure. This suggests sustained market confidence in this asset.

The weekly RSI of 59.13 further supports the notion of continued positive sentiment, making ROSE an appealing choice for investors looking for assets with solid growth potential. At press time, ROSE is trading at $0.13276.



The significant price movements and technical strength in both INJ and ROSE indicate that they are in buy zones, presenting compelling opportunities for investors and traders to capitalize on their current bullish trends. 



Despite the potential buy signals for these two strong cryptocurrencies, the market is volatile, and things can change quickly. Investors should remain vigilant and stay informed about market conditions.

MetaMask Lowers Barrier to Ethereum Staking, Excludes US, UK Initially


							

MetaMask is launching a pooled staking feature.



The feature will be available to MetaMask Portfolio users outside the US and UK.



This feature aims to engage many Ether holders, particularly those with less than 32 ETH.




MetaMask, a self-custodial Ethereum wallet, is set to introduce a “pooled staking” feature to its users this week. According to the crypto wallet firm, this new feature will enhance the Ethereum blockchain’s security and incentivize participation.



This service will enable MetaMask wallet holders to stake their Ether (ETH) tokens without meeting the previous minimum of 32 ETH ($112,000), required for Ethereum staking and Consensys validators.



MetaMask’s staking pool eliminates this minimum, allowing users to stake any amount of ETH while still earning rewards for securing the blockchain through enterprise-grade validators. Users can also track their rewards and funds within the MetaMask wallet. Matthieu Saint Olive, senior product manager at MetaMask developer Consensys, stated: 




“With Pooled Staking, MetaMask users now have an easy way to stake ETH in enterprise-grade validators while maintaining full control of their ETH, earning rewards and making Ethereum more secure.” 




Staking pools play a crucial role in securing proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum, rewarding participants for validating transactions. Blockchain insights reveal that 99% of Ether holders have less than 32 ETH, and 74% of the circulating supply remains unstaked. This solution will allow a wider pool of ETH owners to participate in staking.









The “pooled staking” feature will initially roll out to eligible users upon launch before being released to all stakers. However, the feature will not be available to US and UK users.



“At launch, the service will be available to any MetaMask Portfolio users not in the US or UK.” “We look forward to expanding on MetaMask Pooled Staking’s success by bringing it to users in these jurisdictions soon,” a Consensys representative stated.



Meanwhile, the Consensys official noted that U.S. cryptocurrency policies, particularly Etheruem’s staking policy, are “still experiencing meaning evolution.”



While the team did not specify a release date, they expect to introduce the product to its US audience soon. Similarly, the impending Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) guidelines will provide more clarity for the UK staking market.

Terraform agrees to pay nearly $4.5B in proposed judgment with SEC - Blockworks


The Securities and Exchange Commission asked the court to approve a final consent judgment in its case against Terraform Labs and its former CEO Do Kwon. 
The Wednesday filing says the US securities regulator and Terraform agreed that the former stablecoin issuer pay nearly $4.5 billion. The amount includes roughly $3.5 billion in disgorgement, more than $460 million in prejudgment interest and $420 million as a civil penalty. 
Kwon, the former chief executive, will pay $200 million to the Terraform bankruptcy estate. The company filed for bankruptcy at the beginning of this year ahead of its trial against the SEC. 
“The proposed consent judgment both addresses the magnitude of this fraud by imposing significant remedial, punitive, and deterrent remedies, including a multi-billion dollar judgment against Defendants, and provides for meaningful and speedy recovery for investor victims that collectively lost billions when Defendants’ scheme collapsed,” the SEC wrote.
The SEC didn’t immediately return requests for comment. A spokesperson for Terraform declined to comment.
The regulator said that its penalties – the aforementioned $420 million and Kwon’s $80 million — are “well within the statutory limits.”
The penalties “will send a clear deterrent message to those who might be contemplating similar fraudulent schemes: no matter what get-rich-quick profits they might achieve in the short-term, ultimately, they will be held to account. And these significant penalties are particularly warranted given the evidence at trial of the devastating losses to investors that resulted from Defendants’ fraudulent conduct,” the SEC continued.
Earlier this year, following a short trial, Terraform and Kwon were found liable for “intentionally and recklessly orchestrating one of the largest securities frauds in US history.”
Kwon is prohibited from serving as either an officer or director of a public company, the SEC said. 
The judgment, if approved by the court, ends the legal battle between the regulator and Terraform. Terraform’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD, collapsed in 2022, wiping billions from the crypto market.

What happened to influential crypto pumper Teeka Tiwari?


Anyone who’s been around crypto for the past seven years is familiar with Teeka Tiwari. In late 2017, he emerged as the most powerful promoter of digital assets, and although he’s faded from prominence in recent years, anyone who experienced his pumps will never forget his fame.
They also might wonder if it was legal.
When Tiwari added a coin to his portfolio, it wasn’t unusual for it to suddenly rally on millions of dollars of buying within seconds and tens — if not hundreds — of millions of additional trading activity throughout the course of the day.
When he was at his zenith, every pick rallied without exception. Finding his new picks at the exact second he released them became so competitive that his website team hired sophisticated caching experts to handle inundating website traffic and to counteract trading bots.
The Teeka Tiwari effect
For example, Tiwari picked AION for his flagship crypto newsletter portfolio Palm Beach Confidential on March 15, 2018, at 4:00 pm New York time. One minute prior to his pick, the coin was trading around $2.40. One minute after his pick, it hit $4.90. After just 30 minutes, the token had added $20 million in trading volume yet had, predictably, retraced almost all of its gains. 
Like most newsletter authors, Tiwari emphasized fundamentals and long-term thinking, but traders only cared about his initial, market-moving effect.
Consider another example. Tiwari picked POWR for Palm Beach Confidential on January 17, 2018, in an unscheduled, 2:42 pm announcement. Within five minutes, traders had somehow found their way to a computer screen to place an additional $1 million in trades and boost its price 22%.
Similar examples are too numerous to list. He added at least one new coin to his portfolio a month, and traders would carve out hours from their schedules to prepare and trade the event. He not only picked microcap coins but also top 20 coins like Cardano, Stellar, Ripple, or Maker. His recommendations would have immediate effects on even these larger coins.
Knock-off newsletters began to try to copy his success, with James Altucher launching Altucher’s Crypto Trader, and similar copycat bulletins springing up at Agora Financial, Stansberry, and other direct-response publishers.
Since Tiwari’s pick in 2018, AION has crashed to near-$0.

‘Not Financial Advice’ (wink)
That Tiwari became the most powerful promoter of digital assets is a mix of luck and confluence. He was not a self-made celebrity but rather a product of a massive direct-response advertising campaign. His employer, Palm Beach Group, was one of several giant investment newsletter companies alongside other giants like Stansberry, Weiss, Mauldin, Angel, and biggest of all, Agora Financial. 
Every piece of content published by a direct response publisher like Palm Beach intends to elicit an immediate and measurable response. Hence, direct-response. As opposed to evergreen or long-term approaches like branding, Agora Financial newsletter authors focused on actionable information.
Its most successful newsletters, like Tiwari’s Palm Beach Confidential, were investment newsletters. By and large, they provided an investment ‘pick’ — specific and publicly available assets — on a regular cadence. Authors would sometimes track these picks in a hypothetical portfolio but would always be sure to disclaim their legal liability by pointing out that these picks weren’t investment recommendations or financial advice.
Occasionally, its newsletters would reach a level of notoriety like Palm Beach Confidential and this fame might even allow the publisher to raise the price (in the case of Teeka Tiwari’s newsletter, to $10,000 per year).
In recent years, Palm Beach Confidential’s annual subscription is down 50%. With so much revenue growth, valuations at the biggest direct response publishers crested $1 billion.
Nevertheless, fame and influence eventually fade.
Read more: What’s happening with OneCoin scam’s biggest promoters?
What has happened since?
Nowadays, Tiwari no longer writes Palm Beach Confidential. Most of his crypto picks from 2017-2018 have declined to near all-time lows today, including SALT, AION, XEM, LOKI, WINGS, LSK, DGD, TNT, RCN, CND, LKK, BAT, OMG, STEEM, GFT, QSP, CRPT, DRGN, XZC, GRIN, BNT, FUN, and BTS.
Tiwari also got into legal trouble. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged Jonathan William Mikula, Tiwari’s analyst at Palm Beach Venture, for conspiracy to tout — and touting — unregistered securities for undisclosed compensation.
Although the DoJ didn’t charge Tiwari, the famous direct response newsletter author Porter Robinson wrote a letter to MarketWise workers, claiming, “Tiwari did the same when he engaged in his consulting arrangement that violated the company’s policies prohibiting conflicts of interest.”
On the civil side of the legal system, the Securities and Exchange Commission also sued Tiwari’s analyst, Mikula.
Tiwari has had run-ins with regulators before. In 2005, he consented to FINRA sanctions barring him from acting as a broker. Since that action, he left the broker-dealer business and worked at Tycoon Publishing, later acquired by Agora Financial. Tiwari also worked with Stansberry Research’s Tom Dyson at Common Sense Publishing, which later became Palm Beach Research Group.
A few months ago, in February 2024, Legacy Research’s editor-in-chief Kris Sayce emailed subscribers of Palm Beach, saying, “We parted ways with Teeka and are working on finding an alternative to the publications you’ve been receiving.”
Tiwari apparently left to start his own newsletter under his own name. He’s still promoting new crypto coins. He promises to “help you demystify cryptocurrency to make life-changing gains.” Gains, of course, only so long as you get out before they crash to all-time lows, like most of his picks.

Very Critical FED Decision is Just Minutes Away! Here are Analysts' Last Minute Views - Bitcoin Sistemi


The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) has taken an unexpected turn. In May, the unadjusted CPI annual rate was announced as 3.3%, which was below the expectation of 3.4% and decreased compared to the previous value of 3.4%.
The unadjusted core CPI annual rate for the same month also came in at 3.4%, below the expectation of 3.5% and below the previous value of 3.6%. This marks the lowest core CPI annual rate since April 2021.


This unexpected drop in CPI is largely attributed to the drop in gasoline prices. The market currently expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in November with 100% certainty. However, the possibility of a rate cut in September remains uncertain.
In the cryptocurrency market, analysts of hedge fund QCP Capital shared their views. According to analysts, while traders eagerly awaited the release of CPI data and the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, they stated that both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) spot prices remained within a certain range.






Analysts expressed optimism heading into these events due to several factors:

BTC futures swap points rose from the lows of 10% yesterday, indicating that traders are taking profits from their base trades by covering their short positions.
Today, with the significant increase in the funding rate, aggressive purchases were seen in bonds due on June 13. This shows that the market is positioned for an upward surprise.
With the stock market reaching record highs for the second consecutive year, analysts believe that a consistent CPI and a neutral result from the FOMC could push the crypto market to new highs once again.

Binance-Listed Altcoin Dropped 50 Percent in the Last Week: Developers Explained Why - Bitcoin Sistemi


Highstreet (HIGH), an altcoin listed on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has experienced a significant decline in its token price in the last week.
The value of the token dropped from a high of $8.87 to a low of $2.89. According to the developers, this drastic drop was the result of a malicious attack that led to the sale of 20 million tokens.


The attack was meticulously planned and executed. Malicious actors initially purchased tokens from the South Korean exchange Bithumb and then laundered them through the BSC bridge. This strategy effectively concealed their identities, making it difficult for the Highstreet team to detect the attacker.
CoinMarketCap chart showing the decline in the HIGH price over the last week.

“We recently conducted an investigation into Highstreet's recent price movements. Our findings confirmed that these movements were the result of a malicious attack on our community,” Highstreet developers said in a statement. said. They also revealed that the attacker withdrew 20 million tokens, 9 million of which were directly from a Korean exchange.





The Highstreet team called on all investors to be careful and stay alert following this incident. Developers responded to the fraud allegations against them as follows:
“Highstreet has no intention of undermining its own project, especially in light of our recognition as one of the top 50 partnerships and the upcoming staking launch with Gudchain.”

BREAKING: Terraform Labs Settled with SEC in Terra-SEC Case! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to the latest development, Terraform Labs reached a settlement in its lawsuit with the SEC and agreed to pay $4.47 billion.
Terraform Labs, a leading crypto firm, has agreed to pay a staggering $4.47 billion to settle a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).


The deal was announced by the regulator today.
The agreement was announced in principle at a telephone conference May 29 before Judge Jed Rakoff. The terms of the agreement were expected to be completed by June 12, 2024 and submitted for court approval.





The SEC's lawsuit against Terraform Labs and its founder Kwon focused on the misleading promotion and sale of crypto tokens, primarily the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and other Terra-related tokens. The SEC accused Terraform Labs and Kwon of offering crypto assets without proper registration and misleading investors about their stability and investment potential.
The SEC was initially seeking approximately $5.3 billion in damages, pretrial interest and civil penalties.

GameStop Stock Jumps as Speculation Over Roaring Kitty Intensifies - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsGameStop's stock price popped this morning, with the video game retailer’s share price continuing to improve after it raised more than $2 billion—and all while traders speculate over the next moves of meme stock influencer Roaring Kitty (aka Keith Gill).On June 7, GameStop filed to sell up to 75 million shares of its common stock at its market value of the time of $46.55—which has been inflated over the past couple of months due to Roaring Kitty’s return. The company announced late Tuesday that it sold the maximum number of shares registered with the SEC, raising $2.137 billion in the process.GME jumped 14% in early trading this morning, rising from $29.29 at open to a daily high of $33.50. However, it has since cooled to $31.35, marking a 3% rise on the day since Tuesday's close.That's a stark difference to the last time GameStop announced it was selling additional shares. Back in May, GameStop filed to sell 45 million shares, resulting in its stock price tanking—and Roaring Kitty again left social media for a while.This all comes amid the company being the subject of an internet storm stirred up by Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue. On Thursday, he posted his GameStop holdings on Reddit community SuperStonk, prompting speculation that he could become a billionaire (at least on paper) if the price kept climbing.Kitty didn’t reach that peak, however, after a disappointing Q1 earnings report dropped the next day and sent the stock tumbling—all before Roaring Kitty started livestreaming on YouTube for the first time in three years. The stock continued to fall over the coming days, with the influencer taking to Twitter to apparently poke fun at his own misfortune.He hasn’t disappeared like last time, however. Instead he’s continued to post memes on Twitter and give more Reddit updates on his GME positions, which are now down over $350 million from last Thursday through the end of the trading day Monday.Some fans and GameStop traders are getting antsy without a daily holdings disclosure on Tuesday, questioning whether he’s still holding his position or has made a move—but a cryptic Twitter post injected hope into the community. The GameStop bull posted a meme from the U.S. version of the popular sitcom “The Office” of a young Michael Scott shaking his boss's hand. This meme, as defined by Know Your Meme, is used to “express feelings of meeting an elder when they were young.”Like many of Gill’s memes, it's unclear exactly what his intentions are with the post. But the boss in the suit has the GameStop logo emblazoned on it, and the young Michael Scott has a cat sticking out of his front pocket.Some traders have speculated that it's a sign that Gill is joining the GameStop board. This comes after an unverified document circulated on social media, suggesting that GameStop will expand its board from five to seven members in an alleged move to bring Gill onboard.That’s purely speculation for now. But Gill has become the unofficial face of the company amid the meme stock movement, and has driven substantial value to the share price amid his bull posting in 2020/2021 and again lately.And with a claimed holding of 5 million shares, Gill is one of the largest GME holders, beaten only by a handful of institutional holders and mutual funds as of disclosure reports from earlier this spring. Whether GameStop will want to make such a move—and whether Gill wants to work from inside the company instead of outside—remains to be seen.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum NFT Card Battler ‘Parallel’ Launches on Epic Games Store - Decrypt

Parallel, an NFT-driven competitive card game built on Ethereum, launched Wednesday on the Epic Games Store, potentially reaching a far larger audience in the process.The Epic Games Store is a prominent PC gaming marketplace, and had 270 million users as of the end of 2023, including some 75 million monthly active users. Epic Games is the creator of free-to-play shooter hit Fortnite and has acquired other games like Rocket League, but the store hosts games from a wide array of studios.Parallel, which was GG’s pick for the 2023 game of the year, expanded access earlier this year with the launch of an open beta version of the game, following the previous closed beta.The competitive trading card game is built around NFTs minted on Ethereum and layer-2 scaling network Base, although it also features non-tokenized in-game cards. Players who download the free-to-play game on the Epic Games Store can unlock five additional “Apparition Packs” with the non-NFT cards.Along with opening up more avenues to play the game, including a planned mobile version of the game at some point, Parallel Studios—which raised $35 million in March, and recently launched Parallel’s Planetfall expansion—is also embracing esports with over $500,000 worth of prizes planned for the first year of Parallel League competition.But there are bigger plans beyond, teased Head of Partnerships Franklin Fitch.“Parallel going live on Epic opens us up to millions more players worldwide,” said Fitch in a release. “But we don't plan to stop there. As we roll out more ways to access and play Parallel, we also plan to scale our competitive prize pool into millions of dollars next year.”Beyond Parallel, the firm is also developing Colony, an upcoming generative AI-driven simulation game built on Solana.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices Dip as Fed Signals One Rate Cut Ahead in 2024 - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsCryptocurrency prices wavered Wednesday as investors parsed commentary from the Federal Reserve that provided new insight into the U.S. central bank’s fight against inflation.Policymakers’ move to leave interest rates unchanged for an 11th consecutive month was a foregone conclusion, based on movements in Fed futures markets. At its most restrictive position in over 20 years, the Fed kept its benchmark borrowing rate at a range between 5.25% and 5.50%.This month’s release of a so-called “dot plot,” however, suggested shot callers at the U.S. central bank have seen a notable shift in financial conditions since March. The Fed in its most recent Summary of Economic Projections had penciled in three rate cuts through years-end.The dot plot released Wednesday suggested Fed policymakers now think one rate cut could be more appropriate—interpreted by the market as a hawkish sign. The projection went beyond the two rate cuts that economists had expected the Fed could telegraph, as it looks to keep rates higher for longer in the face of a strong economy and U.S. labor market.Cryptocurrency prices had risen earlier in the day on news that inflation had slowed to 3.3% in the 12 months through May. The report indicated that consumer prices for American goods and services rose slightly less last month than economists had expected.Following the Fed’s announcement, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell. Just 15 minutes after the Fed’s move, for example, Bitcoin’s price swiftly fell 1.2% to around $69,000 from $69,900. Meanwhile, the prices of Ethereum and Solana also ticked down at similar rates.The Fed has maintained in recent months that it will not cut rates until it has “gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell affirmed that stance on Wednesday and said, “So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.”“Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” Powell added in a statement. “In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee’s 2% inflation objective.”Before the conclusion of the Fed’s policy meeting, futures traders penciled in a 61% chance that the Fed cuts rates in September, likely delivering a boost to the U.S. economy through lower borrowing rates. That figure fell to 59% following the release of Powell’s written remarks.Not long before U.S. inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed began lifting interest rates from near-zero to cool a red-hot economy. While inflation has come down significantly since then, Powell affirmed Wednesday that the U.S. central bank’s quest to 2% isn’t over yet.Powell pointed to Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index report, where inflation was flat on a month-to-month basis in May, as a sign of potential progress. “Let me say that we welcome today's reading and hope for more like that,” he said.“The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals,” Powell added, of which one is “maximum employment” among U.S. workers.The price of so-called risk assets, including stocks and crypto, typically face pressure as interest rates rise and the payouts on holding cash and U.S. Treasuries become more attractive. Investors anticipate the opposite would happen as the Fed loosens U.S. monetary conditions.“We can't know what the future holds, but in the meantime, we've made pretty good progress on inflation with our current stance,” Powell said, adding that the Fed is looking for a gradual decline in inflation and greater balance in the labor market. “We’re making good progress here.”Edited by Andrew HaywardEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to add a further quote from Powell.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Crypto company Terraform will pay a $4.5 billion SEC penalty

Photo: Police officers escort Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon after he served a sentence for document forgery, in Podgorica, Montenegro, March 23, 2024. (Stevo Vasiljevic) (Reuters)Crypto company Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon have agreed to pay $4.47 billion to settle a civil lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Bloomberg reports. Novo Nordisk could surpass LEGO as Denmark’s most valuable brand very soonThe lawsuit followed the firm’s collapse in 2022, which resulted in the loss of $40 billion in investor assets and had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency world. Following the news, Terraform’s LUNA token climbed over 10%, hovering around $0.58, according to CoinMarketCap.Kwon, once considered a crypto king, was arrested in March 2023 for forging travel documents while attempting to leave a southern European country Montenegro. Now, he is awaiting extradition to the U.S. or South Korea, where he will face potential charges.The SEC filed a case against Terraform and Kwon regarding the deceptive promotion and sale of crypto tokens, particularly the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST).The TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin was tied to the cryptocurrency Terra (LUNA), which meant that $1 UST was always worth $1 USD of Luna. However, in May 2022, the value of LUNA plummeted from over $120 per coin to nearly zero, resulting in a loss of over $50 billion in UST/LUNA market capitalization and triggering a crash that wiped $400 billion in value from the wider crypto market.The situation worsened when FTX also collapsed in the same year. The financial watchdog accused Terraform and its co-founder Kwon of offering crypto assets that were not properly registered and misleading investors about their investment potential and stability. The SEC demanded that Kwon disclose all of his financial accounts and assets.In addition to Kwon, U.S. authorities have cracked down on a number of individuals involved in crypto fraud this year, including FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, and “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver.

BREAKING: FED Chair Jerome Powell Speaks After FED's Interest Rate Decision - Here's LIVE Developments - Bitcoin Sistemi


After the FED announced that it left interest rates constant, Jerome Powell started his very important press conference at 21:30 Turkey time (UTC+3).
Here are all the details from Powell's speech:



Inflation has decreased significantly but is still very high.
The FED generally expects GDP to slow down from last year's pace.
We maintain our restrictive policy stance.
The employment growth rate is still strong but slower than in the first quarter.
The unemployment rate remains low.
Inflation has decreased significantly.
The strong immigration rate increased labor force participation.
Our economy has made significant progress.
The risks to accomplishing the dual mission are in better balance.
We need to see more good data to support confidence about inflation.
We will continue to be extremely careful against inflation risks.
FED forecasts are not a plan, they may change.
If the economy remains solid and inflation continues, we will continue to keep interest rates where they are for as long as necessary.
If employment weakens unexpectedly, the Fed is ready to respond.
Overall, the broad set of indicators on the labor market suggest that the market is relatively tight but not overheated.
So far this year, we don't have any more confidence in inflation to cut rates.
We will continue to make decisions meeting by meeting.
We assume inflation numbers are good but not great.
If you have inflation of 2.6 or 2.7%, that's a good point.
We're making a pretty conservative forecast on inflation, so if we get better numbers, I think we'll see the forecasts come down.
We welcome today's inflation figures and hope for more.
We need more confidence that inflation will fall back to 2%.
Our confidence in the forecasts is not high.
We remain slightly conservative in our inflation outlook.
I won't be specific about how many good inflation numbers will be needed to cut interest rates.
We do not have the confidence to relax the policy at this time.
We were informed about the first CPI data this morning.
We will watch the labor market for signs of weakness, but we're not seeing that right now.
We experienced a pause in the progress of inflation in the first quarter, and we concluded that it would take longer to cut interest rates.
Due to the slow progress in inflation, interest rate cuts were postponed to a later date.
A better inflation report than almost everyone expected was announced today.
The long-term neutral interest rate is theoretical.
People think it is less likely that interest rates will fall to pre-pandemic levels.
The policy is restrictive.
The neutral interest rate question is a question everyone asks.
The evidence is quite clear that the policy is currently restrictive and is having the impact we would hope for.
We think our policy stance is correct.
We are ready to change our policy as appropriate.
We think the policy is restrictive and eventually the economy will weaken.
No one foresees an interest rate increase as a base scenario.
The banking system is sound, strong and well capitalized.
Inflationary pressures have decreased, but inflation in non-housing services remains high.
There is a surprising increase in import prices of goods.
Wages are still above sustainable levels.
However, overall inflationary pressures have decreased.
Wages are not the main cause of inflation, but wages must fall for overall inflation to return to 2%.
Not only the first interest rate reduction, but the entire interest rate process is important.
Data like today's CPI is a step in the right direction.
But a data is just a data, we don't want to focus too much on this data.

FED officials' common forecast for interest rates means only a quarter-point cut by the end of 2024.
This is an important change. That's two reductions less than the median estimate in the quarterly Summary of Economic Forecasts released in March. Before the rate decision was announced, interest rate futures markets were pricing in the possibility of up to two cuts this year from the current target range for the federal funds rate of 5.25% to 5.5%.

Euro-Pegged Stablecoin Volumes Grow As New Regulation Acts As Potential Boon for Sector: Kaiko - The Daily Hodl


								Euro-pegged stablecoin use is increasing amid new European crypto regulations that phase in over time, according to digital asset analytics firm Kaiko.
In a new report, Kaiko says that the European crypto market is facing big changes as the regulations impacting stablecoins in the 2023 Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law go into effect later this month.










Says Kaiko,
“Impending regulation in Europe is about to shake up the stablecoin market. Binance revealed plans to restrict stablecoins that don’t meet the bloc’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) standards last week. Elsewhere, reports suggest Kraken has been actively reviewing which stablecoins meet the European Union’s standards, potentially leading to delisting of non-compliant stablecoins for their EU users.” 
Kaiko suggests that the new crypto regulations could be a “boon” for MiCA-compliant Euro-backed stablecoins as their use is suddenly increasing in Europe.
“While Europe has traditionally lagged the US and APAC when it comes to crypto trading, Euro-backed stablecoins have consistently grown in volume since the beginning of the year, suggesting that demand is finally picking up in European markets. Their average weekly volume in 2024 was $270 billion which is 70 times higher than their EU counterparts. In contrast, just 1.1% of all transactions are done using Euro-backed stablecoins. However, it is notable that this share has increased from near zero in 2020 and is currently at an all-time high.”

Fortune 500 Companies Are Moving On-Chain, With 35% of Executives Drawing Up Tokenization Plans: Coinbase Report - The Daily Hodl


								New research by the top US-based crypto exchange Coinbase reveals that Fortune 500 companies are slowly opening up to blockchain.
In a new report, Coinbase details how blockchain technology is drawing top blue-chip corporations.










According to the crypto exchange, a survey of Fortune 500 executives found that over half of them are currently working on on-chain projects.
 “America’s top public companies are busier on-chain than ever. On-chain projects announced by Fortune 100 companies have increased 39% year-over-year and hit a record high in Q1 2024. A survey of Fortune 500 executives finds that 56% say their companies are working on on-chain projects. 
From the biggest legacy brands to small business, stablecoins to tokenized T-bills, trusted names and products in finance are embracing blockchain technology and crypto, driving innovation and providing on-ramps for widespread adoption.”
Coinbase goes on to note that 70% of Fortune 500 executives are interested in learning about stablecoins while 86% recognize the potential benefits of asset tokenization for their company. About 35% say they are drawing up tokenization plans.
According to Coinbase, 70% of Fortune 500 executives are interested in stablecoins because they can be processed instantly for a low cost internationally and domestically, be used for easy conversions, lower transaction fees and transfer of money within the company.
Coinbase also reports that 86% of executives are interested in tokenization because it would streamline regulatory processes, reduce transaction times, improve the traceability of funds, cost savings, and potentially drive engagement.
According to the research, 55% of Fortune 500 executives who have yet to adopt blockchain technology say they are hesitant because they lack the trusted talent to do so.

Wu-Tang Clan 'nothing to F with' but does PleasrDAO have Shkreli case?


In a very public tiff, PleasrDAO — an a16z and Paris Hilton-funded ‘DAO’ with 74 members, according to a 2021 New York Times article — has decided to sue Martin ‘Pharma Bro’ Shkreli regarding his distribution of a Wu-Tang album that he originally purchased in 2015.
The album was seized by the US government and sold to PleasrDAO after Shkreli was convicted of securities fraud.
According to the original sale of the album, called Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, it cannot be commercially exploited until the year 2103. Shkreli has streamed portions of the album on YouTube and has admitted to making copies of it and distributing it to friends. It remains unclear if this violates the agreement of the original sale.
A temporary restraining order has been put in place which ensures that — at least for the time being — Shkreli is unable to play the album publicly.
He attempted to sell the album on eBay, where bids hit one million dollars before it was removed from the auction site, back in 2017.

While it’s impossible to know who will win the case, Shkreli has made it clear that he plans to attack the idea that PleasrDAO is a DAO at all (although, as Hayden Adams of Uniswap pointed out, PleasrDAO has never really been a traditional decentralized autonomous organization) and that with proper due diligence, it would have known that Shkreli had widely distributed it before the DAO purchased the album.
It’s unclear what PleasrDAO hopes to get from Shkreli outside of a few million dollars, at best, as the former pharmaceutical CEO has lost most of his money. Sadly, the former founder and face of PleasrDAO, Jamey Johnson, was placed in a medical coma last year after suffering a serious injury in an ATV accident and hasn’t been heard from since.
Protos reached out to PleasrDAO on X, but it did not comment.

Bitcoin, Ether, SOL, Cardano, XRP, Shiba Inu Braced For $500 Billion Bull Earthquake As US Inflation Cools ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin rebounded to almost $70,000 on Wednesday following the release of the May Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which came in cooler than expected. Other leading cryptocurrencies also nudged higher as the market reacted positively to the news.



CPI Fuels 4.7% Bitcoin Jump



The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 3.3% year-over-year in May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday, coming in slightly below economists’ forecast of 3.4%. The softer inflation data relieved investors and fueled market participants’ expectations of rate cuts.



Bitcoin (BTC) welcomed the inflation read, jumping to as high as $69,945, up nearly 5% over the past 24 hours. BTC settled at $69,665 at publication time, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum, the industry’s second-largest crypto, has gained 4.9% on the day. Other cryptocurrencies including Solana (SOL), Ripple’s XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu have rallied 8.7%, 4.8%, and 11%, respectively.



U.S. economic data has affected crypto prices in recent months. For example, hotter-than-expected inflation figures pulled Bitcoin from historic highs above $74,700 in March to sub-$58K levels in May.



Analysts believe looser monetary conditions will turbocharge the benchmark cryptocurrency’s price to new all-time highs. However, despite the promising CPI print, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged during the forthcoming FOMC meeting.

Notably, several key central banks globally have already begun slashing benchmark rates, with the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada lowering rates last week.



With U.S spot Bitcoin ETF buying slowing and even going net negative on some days, macroeconomic factors will likely continue to shape the near-term trajectory of cryptocurrencies. On June 11, investors pulled out $200 million from the ETF instruments, the highest net outflows in a single trading day since May 1 — which saw net record-breaking outflows of $564 million.

Shiba Inu Sees 3,275% Spike In Burn Rate As Sentiment Improves, Time To Get Back In? | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu burn rate has seen a notable spike over the last 24 hours, following significant burns from the community. This is a notable change from the prior week’s slow and disappointing burn rate, showing a return of bullish sentiment among investors.
Shiba Inu Burn Rate Spikes 3,275%
According to data from the Shiba Inu burn tracking website, Shibburn, there has been a 3,275% increase in the burn rate in the last day. The website shows that more than 232 million tokens have been burned in this time period, a stark increase from the 1.37 million tokens that was burned yesterday.

Interestingly, while there have been a total of nine burn transactions recorded during this time, only one transaction made up the majority of the burned tokens for the day. The “0xd9a84f7” address sent over 225.64 million SHIB tokens to the burn wallet.
At the time of the transactions, the tokens burned by this wallet were worth approximately $5,000. This means that this address alone accounts for 97% of all of the tokens that were burned in the 24-hour period, being the sole reason for the 3,275% spike in burn rate.
The daily burn rate is not the only metric that has been positively impacted by this burn. As Shibburn reports, the burn has also pushed the weekly burn rate to 265.86 million, a 560.94% increase from the prior week. This figure means that the “0xd9a84f7” wallet burn makes up 85% of the total weekly burn so far.
SHIB Starting To See Positive Metric
The Shiba Inu burn rate is not the only thing that has turned positive recently as investor sentiment has starting moving toward bullishness once more. One major instance of this is crypto analyst Mags predicting a major price increase for the meme coin.
According to the crypto analyst, SHIB has entered a buying zone, and it could be the last time to get into the meme coin before it surges. Mags expects the Shiba Inu price to jump at least 3x from here, putting a target at the $0.00014 level.

However, there could be a threat to this recovery as long-term holders could be preparing to sell. The Age Consumed metric on the Santiment website which tracks the number of Shiba Inu tokens being moved daily and the last time they were last moved suggests that there could be further selling coming as the Age Consumed figure remains high. If this happens, then the SHIB price could fall lower than its current level and possibility lose the $0.00002 level.
Presently, the SHIB price is trending at $0.0000224, with a 13% decline in the last week.

Terraform Labs agrees $4.5 billion settlement with SEC - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Terraform Labs is to pay $4.47 billion to settle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The SEC sued Terraform Labs and its former CEO Do Kwon after the firm’s collapse in 2022.

Terraform Labs has agreed to a $4.47 billion settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The news follows an earlier report that Terraform Labs and its founder and former CEO Do Kwon had reached agreement over a settlement.
On Wednesday, it emerged that the company had agreed to pay the hefty $4.47 billion as part of the resolution of a fraud case the SEC filed after the firm’s implosion in 2022.
The SEC filed its lawsuit in February last year and in April, it emerged the regulator sought $5.3 billion from Terraform Labs and Do Kwon.
The $4.47 billion settlement awaits court approval.
Terraform Labs/SEC agreement
According to court filings, Terraform Labs will pay approximately $3.5 billion as disgorgement, $460 million in prejudgment interest, and $420 million in civil penalties.
The firm’s former CEO Kwon is also to pay just over $200 million, this going to the Terraform Labs bankruptcy estate.
“Payment of the monetary remedies against Kwon shall be deemed satisfied, provided that all transfers by Kwon to the SEC and the Terraform bankruptcy estate in the Bankruptcy Case total no less than $204,320,196, excluding the value of any Terraform Crypto Assets transferred to the Terraform bankruptcy estate, only if and until Kwon completes: (1) transferring into an escrow account agreed by Kwon and the Commission staff $4,700,000 within 30 days of Final Judgment,” the settlement reads in part.
Terraform Labs’ collapse in 2022 saw massive contagion across the crypto industry, with billions of dollars wiped from the market as prices nosedived. 
Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) and Terra (LUNA) traded 5% and 6% up respectively after the news.

Here’s Why Memecoins Are Outperforming Most Altcoins This Cycle, According to Analyst Will Clemente - The Daily Hodl


								A popular on-chain analyst is providing a rationale for why memecoins have massively outperformed most altcoins this cycle.
In a new interview with Bitcoin (BTC) bull Anthony Pompliano, Will Clemente says that traders are diving into memecoins because they believe that it’s the crypto sector that offers the highest upside potential.










Clemente highlights that while other altcoins come with solid fundamentals, traders ignore them because it is difficult to understand their value proposition.
“If I want to go further out on the risk spectrum, what should I allocate to? There’s all these very highly obfuscated, a lot of technical jargon, questions about the value accrual for a lot of these altcoins that are mid-nine-figure billion or $2 billion market cap tokens. 
The reality is the average retail participant has a very low likelihood of a 10 or 15Xing something like that. But they have a much higher probability of doing so with memes. So I think a lot of people that are coming into the space looking to speculate for the first time are participating there.”
Clemente also says that traders are flocking into memecoins because they don’t have the skill to swim with the sharks.
“The pool of market participants that are playing that game is a lot less sophisticated than the pool of market participants that are trading Bitcoin… think about you’re going to go play poker at a table. You’re going to go play with these high-stakes guys that have been playing for 25 years or you’re going to go sit at the table with people on your same skill level. 
I think that’s how a lot of people are thinking about participating in these memecoin markets as well.”

Analyst Forecasts Bitcoin Heading Towards A 6-Figure Milestone | Bitcoinist.com


								As Bitcoin continues to trend below its recent all-time high of $73,000, determining the next trajectory of the asset has been a topic of interest within the cryptocurrency space. Well-known cryptocurrency analyst and enthusiast Javon Marks has made a daring prediction that has drawn the attention of the crypto community, forecasting that the digital asset’s value will soon cross into the six-figure territory and surpass the desired $100,000 price level.
Bitcoin Value To Under Massive Surge To $116,652
Marks bases his bullish projection on a confluence of bullish indications that indicate the price of the flagship crypto asset is about to have a big upswing in the upcoming months. Additionally, Marks points to a favorable market condition, which might drive Bitcoin’s price significantly.
Related Reading: Bitcoin Maximalist Samson Mow Identifies Godzilla Candle Scenario For BTC – What This Means
His forecast is in line with the general market sentiment, as other traders and analysts project substantial increases for Bitcoin due to its technical and fundamental qualities.
According to the analyst, with the significant bull indication(s) confirmed, Bitcoin’s 3D price is presently holding above a vital threshold of $67,559. Thus being above this crucial threshold indicates that the current technical goal for BTC is the $116,652 mark.
The post read:
Bitcoin’s (BTC) 3d price is currently holding above a vital level at $67,559 and being above implies the current technical target to be $116,652 with the major bull indication(s) confirmed.
Javon marks noted that with this objective in place, the digital asset may rise by an additional 66.33% from its current price in order to reach the target. Meanwhile, the only thing standing in the way could be time, suggesting a promising future for BTC.

In support of this bullish structure, the expert pointed out that Bitcoin has verified another Hidden Bullish Divergence and the one before it produced a nearly +200% increase in value. Given that the market might be quietly preparing to display a level of strength not seen before, Marks might see this as a catalyst for BTC to rise to the aforementioned price target.
BTC’s 6-Figure Target Is Inevitable
Javon Marks is not the only cryptocurrency analyst who has predicted the crypto asset will reach a 6 figure target in this current bull cycle. Titan of Crypto, a popular market expert has also highlighted Bitcoin’s potential to surpass the $100,000 in the upcoming months.

Considering past bull cycle trends, the expert anticipates BTC to reach the coveted $111,000 price level, claiming the move is inevitable. Even though, this level seems intriguing, Titan of Crypto is confident the coin might top out this bull cycle above this target.
At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was trading at $67,761, demonstrating a 1% rise in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has plummeted by over 14%, while its market cap is up by 1.05% in the past day.

President of $4,250,000,000 Investment Firm Says Crypto Markets Still Have ‘Quite a Way To Run’ - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								The president of a multibillion-dollar investment firm says that the digital assets market still has a long way to run.
In a new interview with Bloomberg, 21Shares co-founder and president Ophelia Snyder says that the crypto markets are still in their infancy despite having an overall market cap of $2.6 trillion.










“[Our] short-term outlook is that we’re still really early, which is something I think people are forgetting right now [because] they’re seeing the massive assets coming into US products, some of the most successful ETF (exchange-traded fund) launches of all time… 
It’s still really early. Most institutions [are] still not in the space. Most intermediaries [are] still not investing into the space. This is still a lot of early adopter money still, which means the market has quite a way to run. And we’re still in the early innings from our perspective.” 
21Shares, along with other financial giants, had their bids to create spot market Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the crypto king.
Now, the firm is awaiting the regulatory body’s decision on ETFs based on Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market cap, after it modified its application. According to Snyder, ETH ETFs will likely be approved, but will be less successful compared to BTC’s ETF.
“Do I think ETH is going to be less successful than [BTC]? Yes. But I would also say that every equity ETF that’s going to launch in the next 18-24 months will also be less successful… 
Ether is a bit more complicated. I think one of the other things that’s different about Ethereum is that there’s been a lot less investor education. People have been talking about Bitcoin for a long time, and they’ve been doing education with investors for a long time. 
Ether is both more complicated to explain, more complicated to understand and also just less effort has gone into doing that in the last 5-10 years.”

Mellow Finance to Help Lido Hold On to its Place as Largest DeFi Protocol - The Defiant

The liquid restaking protocol could help boost Lido's stETH market cap. Restaking wars are heating up as Mellow Finance’s launch this week is helping the original staking protocol, Lido Finance, wrestle market share from rising giant, EigenLayer.Mellow Finance is the liquid restaking protocol for Symbiotic, an EigenLayer competitor, and is now a part of the Lido Alliance, an initiative designed to establish stETH as a foundational restaking asset.Mellow’s total value locked grew to $115 million just one day after its June 11 launch. The restaking service raised a $5.8 million seed round from venture capital firm Paradigm and the Lido founders' investment firm Cyber.Fund.Mellow Finance introduces a “modular infrastructure” for creating Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), offering depositors a range of permissionless vault options. This setup allows users to choose their own risk levels when restaking.Within 5 hours of its launch, which was also on Tuesday, Symbiotic depositors reached the platform’s initial cap of 41,290 wstETH, or $173 million."Mellow enables depositors more flexibility regarding their desired level of exposure to risk while still benefiting from the liquidity of staked assets,” read the documentation.Lido's DeFi BreakthroughLaunched in December 2020, Lido was the breakout sensation in decentralized finance (DeFi), allowing users to stake cryptocurrency on Ethereum, while receiving a tradable token called stETH, representing their deposits.This proved extremely popular and propelled Lido to become the largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, currently holding $33 billion worth of deposits.However, Lido has faced challenges with a declining market share as many users have shifted assets over to EigenLayer, a protocol that allows users to restake Ethereum's native ETH token to help secure other networks. EigenLayer amassed $18 billion worth of deposits since opening to investors last year.Lido’s TVL has declined 13% after peaking at $39.8 billion in March, while EigenLayer’s TVL has almost doubled in that time to $19 billion.EigenLayer attracted users with its restaking model that allows them to use staked ETH to secure other protocols, increasing investors’ staking yields.What Are Restaking Vaults?Mellow Finance is building its restaking vaults using Symbiotic, which accepts any crypto asset based on Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard.EigenLayer only accepts certain assets like ETH, EIGEN, and select ETH derivatives. And while EigenLayer accepts deposits of Lido's stETH, it has placed caps on the amount of stETH one can deposit.CuratorsMellow Finance will offer customizable vaults managed by curators who distribute assets across various validated services. Curators such as Steakhouse Financial, P2P Validator, Re7 Labs, and MEV Capital will introduce vaults accepting stETH. Initially, users will earn "points" for their deposits, which could potentially convert to token airdrops later.This is similar to EigenLayer’s restaked points system, which allows users to accumulate points based on the quantity of their staked assets and the duration for which they are staked.What’s NextAs Symbiotic wstETH limits have been capped for now, new deposits into Mellow vaults don’t get restaked into Symbiotic. This means even as more ETH gets into Mellow vaults, the amount of Symbiotic points shared among those ETH stakers remains the same, leading to potential dilution.To address this, Mellow Finance has proposed that depositors who contributed before hitting the Symbiotic limit will receive 1x Symbiotic and 1x Mellow points. Those who deposited afterward will get 1.5x Mellow points until their deposits can be restaked into Symbiotic, at which point they will also begin to accumulate Symbiotic points.

‘Hamster Kombat’ Tips: How to Earn Millions More Free Coins in the Telegram Game Ahead of the Airdrop - Decrypt

Are you one of the more than 100 million players apparently tapping away at Telegram to earn a share of the upcoming Hamster Kombat airdrop? Hamster Kombat is the latest Telegram gaming sensation, building upon the “clicker” premise of Notcoin while layering in amusing twists as you take the role of a crypto exchange CEO—who’s also a hamster.It’s a simple distraction, but your tapping and upgrading could pay dividends with the token launch on The Open Network, which is currently planned for July. Notcoin is this year’s biggest gaming token launch so far, but Hamster Kombat has already pulled in way more players.We’ll see how things work out with the airdrop (more details here), but if you want to boost your in-game coin earnings and potentially set yourself up for a bigger bag, here are several tips that can collectively add millions more coins to your daily haul.Spend those coinsSure, Hamster Kombat’s core gameplay mechanic is tapping the screen, but you’ll only get so far if that’s all you do. Instead, hit the “Mine” button at the bottom of the screen and start buying upgrades for your exchange. That’s how you unlock passive income.By investing in various markets, PR, team, and legal enhancements, along with special cards, you’ll gradually amass coins by doing nothing at all—even when you’re not playing. You’ve gotta spend money to make money, right? Well, this is the Hamster Kombat version of that.Screenshots from Hamster Kombat. Image: DecryptCheck in oftenGranted, you’ll need to play regularly to maximize your passive income. Hamster Kombat will only keep amassing free coins while you’re offline for a total of three hours. After that, the coins stop rolling in until you open up the game, claim your accumulated earnings, and reset the clock. Luckily, it just takes a few seconds and then you can hop back out.Do the daily comboWhat’s the fastest way to boost your coin haul? Execute the daily combo. Essentially, the game designates three special cards for each day’s combo, and if you can buy or upgrade the three specific items/cards before the next cycle, you’ll earn 5 million free coins—easy as that.We’ve put together a dedicated guide for the daily combo, how it works, and how to find it, so be sure to check that out if you’re looking for more detail here. As we write this, the current daily combo is License Europe, Prediction Markets, and Top 10 Global Ranking. Spend some of your coin to upgrade those, and you’ll get a massive addition to your piggy bank.Invite friendsIf your gut reaction to this is “Ugh,” we hear you: Nobody wants to annoy their friends with free-to-play invites. But in Hamster Kombat, some of the cards and unlocks are gated behind successfully convincing a certain number of friends to start playing, meaning you might miss out on daily combos or other earning opportunities if you abstain.Granted, we don’t blame you for continuing to abstain. But if you have a few pals that might want to hop into the Telegram mini app and start playing alongside you, then shoot them an invite from within the game (under the “Friends” tab) or copy the link and paste it into your Telegram chats. Just give ‘em the courtesy of a heads-up.Screenshots from Hamster Kombat. Image: DecryptClaim the daily rewardEasy one here: Under the “Earn” tab, just hit the Daily reward button under “Daily tasks” and claim your free coins. It’s only 500 coins on day one, but if you’re playing steadily, the reward eventually jumps up to 5 million by day 10. That’s free fake money! The daily amount resets after that, so it’ll be a slow climb back up to seven-figure freebies, but keep at it.Complete the tasksAlso under the Earn tab, you’ll find opportunities to earn bounties of coins for watching Hamster Kombat videos on YouTube, joining the game’s Telegram announcement channel, or following its Twitter (aka X) account. Your mileage may vary on whether you want to bother, but if you’re aiming to maximize your in-game haul, then these are easy ways to snag bonus coins.Input the daily cipherUnlike the daily combo, you won’t have to spend coins or worry about inviting pals to earn a bunch of free coins from inputting the daily cipher. It’s a daily Morse code entry that lets you bag 1 million coins, and the early codes have been crypto terms like BTC, ETH, and WALLET.We’ve put together a guide with more detail on how it works and how to find the new daily code, but it’s really as simple as locating the code (on social media or in Telegram groups), tapping the “Earn per tap” box three times to trigger the input mode, and then entering the correct combinations of taps and long presses until the Morse code is accepted.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Whales Go on Buying Spree, Snapping Up $840 Million in ETH


							

Whales purchased 240,000 ETH during a price drop, spending $840M, showing strong faith in Ethereum’s future.



Ethereum-based apps make revenues similar to public companies, highlighting its move towards mainstream use.



Ethereum’s price is steady at around $3,650, with crucial support at $3,450 and the potential for a rise if it goes above $3,660.




Ethereum (ETH) is showing strength in the volatile crypto market, according to crypto analyst Ali. Large investors, known as whales, recently purchased over 240,000 ETH during a price dip. This significant purchase, valued at around $840 million, demonstrates strong confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value and its crucial role in the global crypto ecosystem.







Crypto applications built on the Ethereum blockchain are generating revenues comparable to those of several public companies. This highlights the innovation, resilience, and vision driving the global crypto industry. These applications are becoming integral to daily financial and digital activities, marking a significant milestone in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency.



Crypto analyst Crypto_Scient noted that Ethereum is currently consolidating around a crucial daily level of $3,650, a critical area for determining the next move. If Ethereum closes below $3,660 and consolidates, a drop toward the $3,200 support level may occur. Conversely, reclaiming and consolidating above $3,700 could signal a bullish trend, encouraging long positions.







The recent price correction has been less severe than anticipated, leaving Ethereum in a more favorable position than Bitcoin. Ethereum is holding and bouncing from its 12-hour 200 Moving Average (MA) and has tapped into the 1-day Fair Value Gap (FVG) on the recent drop. Local support has been established around $3,450. If consolidation continues above this level, a move toward $3,660 is likely in the coming days. A flip of the $3,660 level to support would confirm a bullish deviation, potentially attracting more long positions. Any dip towards the $3,500 to $3,450 range presents a scalping opportunity for traders.









As of the latest update, Ethereum’s price is $3,541.88, with a 24-hour trading volume of $14.73 billion. This represents a 0.25% increase in the past 24 hours but a 6.69% decline over the past seven days.



Whales’ accumulation of ETH during the price dip strongly indicates underlying confidence in Ethereum’s potential. Additionally, the ability of Ethereum-based applications to generate revenues on par with traditional public companies further solidifies their role in the evolving financial landscape.

GameStop Short Seller Pulls Out: ‘We Respect the Market's Irrationality’ - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsShort seller Citron Research has abandoned its short position in game retailer and meme stock GameStop as the company built up a $4 billion cash reserve amid the resurgence of stock influencer Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. Keith Gill), per an acerbic tweet Wednesday morning.Citron made it clear it did not close the position because it now has a bullish view of the game company. Rather, the company said, “with $4 billion in the bank, [GameStop has] enough runway to appease their cult-like shareholders.”Despite a lowered price target of $11 per share from investment firm Wedbush on Wednesday, Citron added that “we respect the market’s irrationality.”The tweet ended with a jab at Roaring Kitty’s recent livestream, his first in three years, calling it “an insult to the capital markets.”GME shares spiked late last week, climbing to nearly $47 per share, as word spread that Roaring Kitty had returned after several years out of the spotlight. Shares plunged early this week, falling to below $25 before reversing course and climbing to $33.50 early Wednesday. The stock has dipped again to $28.69 as of this writing.The midweek spike may be attributable to GameStop's announcement yesterday that it completed its at-the-market equity offering program, through which it sold 75 million shares for gross proceeds of $2.1 billion.Citroen's withdrawal comes less than two weeks after it had taken a new short position in the stock. Company founder Andrew Left told Reuters last week that “it's fun to go back into the fire.”"The first time, three-and-a-half-years ago, (GameStop) was a cultural phenomenon, and that's played out by now,” Left told the news agency. “The company has deteriorating financials and is a good short."Citron had a short position in GME shares in 2021, when retail traders enacted a short squeeze to pressure institutional investors. The short seller was left taking a near-total loss.With today’s news that Citron has bowed out of its latest bet against GameStop, it appears that Roaring Kitty has won a second round against the short seller.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Following FED's Interest Rate Decision, Santiment Named 4 Altcoins: "These Are Standing Out Today" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Analysts from cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment drew attention to 4 different altcoins in a report they published recently today.
According to analysts, artificial intelligence and “big data” themed altcoins were among the prominent ones during the market-wide recovery today. Santiment claimed that onchain data has begun to be accumulated by major wallets of these technology-themed cryptocurrency projects.


Santiment named four prominent altcoins today:

These four altcoins also saw significant increases during the day. DBD ranked first with 35%, followed by LIKE with 26%, DX with 19% and 0X0 again with 19%.






Cryptocurrency-themed altcoins have become extremely popular, especially after NVIDIA's shares saw a significant rise this year.
Apple, one of the largest companies in the world, announced in its statement yesterday that it had launched an artificial intelligence project called “Apple Intelligence”. Apple also announced that it signed an agreement with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, for this project.


The deal in question was harshly criticized by Elon Musk over privacy concerns and said he would ban Apple products from his companies if Apple integrated OpenAI at the operating system level.

Altcoin Season On The Horizon? Analysts Point To Potential Early Peak - Benzinga

Cryptocurrency analysts are buzzing with anticipation of a coming altcoin boom, with some suggesting the party could start sooner than expected.What Happened: Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher suggests that while historical patterns indicate a peak in October 2025, several factors might lead to an earlier zenith for altcoins.“In both prior cycles, altcoins have peaked exactly 546 days post-halving,” Deutscher noted. “If this cycle follows the same pattern, this would suggest an altcoin peak in October 2025.” However, he cautions against relying solely on historical data, adding, “For a variety of reasons, such as cycle acceleration and macro factors, I think we peak earlier than this.”Deutscher emphasized that despite the limitations of looking at just two data points, the broader implication is clear. “We are probabilistically still early in the cycle from an altcoin point of view,” he explained. “Or at least earlier than many are propagating.”Supporting this perspective, crypto trader Jelle observed similarities between the current altcoin behavior and the market dynamics at the end of 2020. “Altcoins are still playing out very similarly to what we saw towards the end of 2020,” Jelle said. Also Read: Solana, Ripple ETFs Unlikely In Near Future, Says Cboe VP“A bunch of wicks into the key support, and then suddenly; price ripping higher. Expecting this time to play out the same, soon enough. Be patient. The best is yet to come.”Technical analyst Yoddha provided a structural overview of the altcoin market’s trajectory. “The weekly candle went from looking like crypto is a scam to crypto is the future,” Yoddha noted, outlining the typical stages of a bull market. “The Altcoins bull market blueprint is simple: An extended period of accumulation, breakout, a brief period of consolidation & disbelief, and then the bull market. We’re nearing the end of the consolidation. Bring on the bull.”Echoing this optimism, crypto commentator Steph Is Crypto highlighted a significant technical indicator for Bitcoin BTC/USD, which often sets the trend for altcoins.“This bull flag breakout is still active for Bitcoin on the weekly,” Steph noted. “Don't get shaken out right now. #BTC and #Altcoins are about to explode soon.”What’s Next: As the crypto community closely monitors these developments, the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will provide a timely platform to discuss the implications of these trends.Read Next: Bitcoin Soars Above $69K On Improved Inflation Data PrintImage: Shutterstock

MoonPay integrates PayPal for crypto purchases in the UK and EU - CoinJournal



                    

                    
MoonPay integrates PayPal for EU and UK crypto purchases using fiat.
PayPal, the third most popular payment method in the US, brings convenience to MoonPay.
MoonPay’s move aims to lower entry barriers and foster trust among its growing user base.

MoonPay, a leading cryptocurrency payments platform, has announced the integration of PayPal as a new fiat on-ramp for its users in the European Union and the United Kingdom.


This move will allow customers to use PayPal to purchase cryptocurrencies on the MoonPay platform, providing a seamless and convenient user experience. Initially available to 1% of European users, a full rollout across the region is expected soon, though residents of Croatia, Iceland, and Hungary will not have access to this service.
MonnPay expanding crypto access with PayPal integration
MoonPay’s decision to integrate PayPal stems from the latter’s significant popularity in the United States, where it ranks as the third-most commonly used payment method after Apple Pay and traditional bank cards.
By offering PayPal as a payment option, MoonPay aims to lower the barriers to entry for new users, making it easier and more convenient for them to purchase cryptocurrencies. Ivan Soto-Wright, CEO and co-founder of MoonPay emphasized that this move will provide a frictionless experience and increase trust among its growing customer base.
In the United States, MoonPay already offers PayPal as a payment method in 48 states, with New York and Texas being the exceptions. The integration is part of MoonPay’s broader strategy to enhance its services and cater to the diverse needs of its global user base.
By incorporating PayPal, MoonPay leverages a widely trusted and user-friendly payment option, which is expected to attract more users to its platform.
PayPal’s foray into the crypto market
PayPal’s integration with MoonPay is part of its larger strategy to establish a foothold in the cryptocurrency market.
In August 2023, PayPal launched its own U.S. dollar stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), backed 1:1 by cash and short-term cash equivalents.
Initially deployed on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, PYUSD faced challenges due to Ethereum’s limited transaction speed and high costs.
To address these issues, PayPal deployed PYUSD on the Solana network in May 2024. Solana offers higher throughput and lower transaction costs, making it suitable for everyday transactions. This deployment also introduced “confidential transfers,” a feature that hides transaction amounts from the public while ensuring compliance with reporting regulations.
Stablecoins like PYUSD play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide liquidity, reduce transaction costs, and facilitate cross-border payments. By offering a stable value, these digital tokens enable more efficient and secure transactions, thereby promoting wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.
MoonPay’s integration of PayPal as a fiat on-ramp is a significant step towards making cryptocurrency more accessible and user-friendly for individuals across the UK and EU.

Is Coinbase or Robinhood Stock the Better Bet? | Bankless


Coinbase stock has long been the obvious choice for investors seeking exposure to crypto through ownership in a publicly traded company, but another player is increasingly reaching out for this crown…Last Thursday, Robinhood announced that it would double down on crypto through a $200M acquisition of Bitstamp, the oldest active crypto exchange in existence, which has active licenses for operations in over 50 nations!Should you be loading up on COIN or HOOD stock?Today, we’re exploring the differences between Coinbase and Robinhood to understand why investors are bullish on each stock 👇🔵 The Case for COINCoinbase is often regarded as the most reputable crypto exchange, a distinction that has enabled it to cultivate deep ties among American crypto enthusiasts of both the retail and institutional variety during its 12-year existence.Centralized crypto exchanges typically offer limited insights into their financials; however, Coinbase’s status as a publicly traded company on U.S. stock exchanges requires it to undergo stringent audits and file corresponding reports with the SEC, mitigating the possibility that customer funds are misappropriated.Although any exchange’s most familiar functionality are the trading features, Coinbase is so much more than just a simple marketplace; the company is a pioneer among CEXs building onchain and has played a major role in infrastructure development, launching its own wallet and the Ethereum L2 Base!Thanks to the implementation of EIP-4844 in Ethereum’s March Dencun upgrade, L2 costs to post data have been slashed by multiple orders of magnitudes, increasing Base’s onchain operating margins to almost 100% to allow nearly every penny of transaction fees paid on Base to be funneled directly into Coinbase’s coffers.While Base revenues have fallen substantially off from their late March congestion highs, the network is the second largest L2 by TVL as calculated by L2BEAT and generates more margin than any other major L2, frequently netting over $100k in daily profit.Source: Dune AnalyticsBeyond its onchain infrastructure, Coinbase offers a comprehensive suite of custody tools to its users, offering white-glove staking services – and an ETH liquid staking token – in addition to institutional grade custody solutions.Coinbase Custody is widely recognized as the preeminent digital asset custody provider, and services eight of the eleven American spot BTC ETFs, including Grayscale’s GBTC and BlackRock’s IBIT (the two largest such products in terms of assets under management). This arrangement enables Coinbase to earn custodial fees from the assets they manage, in addition to trading fees for creations and redemptions, providing potent revenue drivers for the firm should spot crypto ETFs continue to gain traction with traditional market participants.
Crypto payments have not yet achieved mainstream adoption, but the Coinbase team has developed the infrastructure needed to make it a possibility through their Commerce platform, which enables merchants to to accept hundreds of crypto assets as payment for goods and services directly to their self-custodial crypto wallet.Further willingness to hold crypto assets among the public and their recognition of the benefits provided by self-custodial technologies would bode well for Coinbase’s ability to generate revenue from this platform.Coinbase also caters to international users who are unencumbered by American financial regulation and can access futures on a wide array of crypto assets through the exchange; these services could be easily expanded to the U.S. platform – which currently offers only BTC and ETH futures – should the crypto industry receive positive regulatory clarity.As an added side benefit, owners of COIN stock receive a small amount of the upside benefits from the success of the Coinbase Ventures portfolio, which consists of lucrative private market opportunities that many retail and external investors are unable to access.🟢 The Case for HOODWhile Coinbase dominates Robinhood in terms of the crypto transaction volumes it processes, Robinhood remains the undisputed champion for retail traders in the United States.Even though Robinhood has fewer assets under custody on its platform in comparison to Coinbase – even when summing the former’s equity, options, cash, and crypto balances together – it enjoyed 70% more monthly active users than Coinbase during the first quarter of 2024, highlighting the exchange’s prevalence among retail traders.Undeniably, Robinhood’s greatest strength is regulatory compliance; the exchange is regulated as a broker by the SEC, making it well-positioned to become a dominant crypto exchange should a new classification of digital asset securities within the agency’s purview be created, and their trading be restricted to only registered brokerages.
Although Coinbase is clearly the more crypto-native firm and has attracted a deep talent pool of individuals well connected within the industry, there is nothing to stop Robinhood (besides regulatory uncertainty) from creating its own crypto applications.Robinhood has already developed its own proprietary non-custodial wallet solution and recently launched an integration that enables users to purchase crypto directly from the Uniswap Mobile App using funds from their Robinhood Connect account!Through its proposed acquisition of Bitstamp (which could still be shot down by regulators), Robinhood acknowledges the growth potential for its crypto operations in spite of ongoing legal battles with the SEC over them and supplies confirmation that it will engage with blockchain technology to the fullest of its ability.Bitstamp’s 4M active users based primarily out of Europe – a highly desirable demographic for its American-centric buyer – and the purchase includes the transfer of Bitstamp core products for staking and lending, enabling Robinhood to better compete against service offerings from crypto’s CEXs and underscoring that it can simply purchase crypto tech that others have developed to catch up to crypto-native competitors. Robinhood Doubles Down on Crypto with Bitstamp Acquisition on BanklessEven amid an SEC onslaught, Robinhood is committing to crypto.🧐 TakeawaysFor crypto investors already bullish on COIN, it is easy to gain similar confidence in HOOD, considering the firm appears to be making an aggressive push into crypto markets and has already earned the favor of U.S. retail investors, who would be incredibly likely to size into crypto given the presence of an effortless purchase/custody solution should mania return to the industry.Alternatively, Coinbase possesses a proven crypto performance track record and benefits from significant amounts of institutional adoption, made apparent by the preference for its services demonstrated by spot crypto ETF issuers.Both of these publicly traded exchanges come with their own unique advantages and pitfalls, and although Robinhood is currently the underdog in this race, Coinbase’s position of dominance is anything but assured, particularly in a future with more stringent crypto financial regulations.

Santiment Announced the 2 Most Popular Altcoins of Today: "These Are Coming After Bitcoin" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Santiment, one of the most popular cryptocurrency analysis companies, shed light on the current most popular altcoins of the crypto world in its latest analysis.
According to the analysis company, Bitcoin, unsurprisingly, remains the most popular cryptocurrency. Analysts think that this popularity took a leap today after former US President Donald Trump announced his interest in Bitcoin mining.


In his statement, Donald Trump described Biden as an enemy of BTC and stated that he wanted all Bitcoins to be released from now on to be issued within the borders of the USA. Following Trump's statement, there was a significant increase in the shares of mining companies traded on the stock exchange in the USA.

On the other hand, Santiment analysts think that in addition to BTC, two cryptocurrencies have become extremely popular these days.





The first of these, Minswap (MIN), was cited as an example by analysts. According to Santiment, increasing concerns in terms of transparency and reliability may have increased interest in this altcoin.
Secondly, Santiment argues that the altcoin called Onyxcoin (XCN) has become one of the most popular altcoins in the cryptocurrency market these days. The reason for this is the use of core chain verification and the Klay chain as a gas fee.

US court issues final judgement against Terraform Labs, Do Kwon, imposes $4.5 billion in fines

The US District Court for the Southern District of New York has issued a final judgment against Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon, in the high-profile case filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The ruling finds the defendants guilty of multiple securities law violations and imposes stringent penalties and restrictions on their future activities. The penalties include total fines amounting to roughly $4.5 billion.According to the June 12 court filing, the sum includes $3.6 billion in disgorgement, $467 million in prejudgment interest, and $420 million in civil penalties.Kwon is jointly and severally liable for $110.0 million of the above disgorgement and $14.3 prejudgment interest amounts.Additionally, Kwon must transfer various assets, including ownership interests in PYTH tokens and other holdings, to the Terraform bankruptcy estate. These assets will be used to satisfy the monetary penalties and are to be distributed to harmed investors through a liquidating trust.The order allows Terraform Labs to treat the amount due as an unsecured claim in its bankruptcy case, meaning that the SEC will receive the funds through a distribution when Terraform Labs’ Chapter 11 plan becomes effective and based on the distribution priorities.The SEC is empowered to enforce the court’s judgment using all authorized collection procedures, including civil contempt if Kwon fails to comply with the transfer orders within 30 days of the judgment.Kwon must also pay $204.3 million in remedies separate from his liability in Terraform Labs’ payments, including $110 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $14.3 million, and an additional $80 million in civil penalties.Ban on most activityThe order also bars Terraform Labs and Kwon from violating anti-fraud provisions under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.Furthermore, it permanently bars Terraform Labs and Kwon from transacting in unregistered securities, transacting crypto asset securities, or inducing others to transact in crypto asset securities, among other related restrictions.The restrictions allow Terraform to perform certain transactions related to its bankruptcy case. The company can dispose of crypto in its bankruptcy estate with court approval, must destroy wallet keys and burn tokens as required. It can also allow third parties to withdraw, unstake, and unwind positions on its platforms.The order also permanently bars Kwon from acting as an officer or director of any issuer with a registered class of securities or reporting obligations.The SEC began its case against Terraform Labs and Kwon in February 2023, alleging that the firm had defrauded crypto investors, including through its now-collapsed Terra USD (UST) stablecoin. Courts found the defendants liable for fraud in April of this year.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Andrew Tate-Backed Solana Token DADDY Up 450% Amid Insider Buying Claims - Decrypt

Just a year after disavowing crypto, former kickboxer and social media personality Andrew Tate began a meme coin spending spree late last week, shilling a number of tokens in the process. The latest token he’s endorsed has skyrocketed past a $275 million market cap, but on-chain analysts are alleging significant insider activity ahead of the surge.DADDY is the latest in a line of tokens that self-proclaimed misogynist Tate has publicly supported. Tate claims to have chosen DADDY as a direct rival to Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER token in an attempt to, as he put it, “flip it for the patriarchy.”Since launching on June 9, the Solana-based DADDY token climbed in value—but it wasn’t until Tate started promoting the project that it really started to jump. On Tuesday afternoon, Tate posted his first tweet referencing the token before actively shilling the project in the early hours of Wednesday morning.As a result, the Solana token is up over 450% to a price of $0.28 over the past 24 hours. But crypto analytics startup Bubblemaps has called foul play, claiming that a large portion of the supply was bought at launch with more being purchased before Tate promoted it on Twitter.Bubblemaps claims that shortly after the token launched, the creator of DADDY sent Andrew Tate’s public wallet 40% of the supply, while Tate later bought and burned an additional $10,000 worth of tokens. But, as proclaimed by Tate himself, he didn’t sell any tokens.Instead, nearly 20% of the total supply was snatched up by just 11 wallets funded through Binance, all before the meme coin posted on its Twitter account for the first time. Bubblemaps cannot confirm the source of these wallets, but the firm believes the timing and amount bought “strongly suggest” they all come from the “same group.”“These wallets hold ~19% of the total supply, worth $30 million at the current price,” Bubblemaps said on Twitter early Wednesday, ahead of the latest gains. “One wallet selling could crash the liquidity.”In addition to this group, the analytics firm highlighted another cluster of wallets that holds 10% of the supply, all bought before Tate’s first tweet, which Bubblemaps said has apparently been attempting to cover its tracks by splitting funds into separate wallets. For now, Tate claims that he won’t sell any crypto tokens—going as far as to publicly denounce crypto again on Twitter. That said, there is nothing stopping him from selling his over $100 million share of DADDY tokens that make up 40% of the total supply.“Real Gs know that their money is safe with a real G,” Tate tweeted in response to concerns, as fears circulated that he may dump on investors. “I will never sell what was sent to my wallet, I will only burn and buy.”Not all of Twitter bought his promise as pseudonymous crypto influencer Ansem—who had previously slammed Tate, challenging him to a boxing fight—accused him of owning the wallets with suspicious activity. Tate’s response to these serious accusations was simply, “Shut up hoe.”This all comes amid the Tate’s trail for alleged human trafficking and rape in Romania. More recently, in March, British authorities issued a separate arrest warrant for Andrew Tate and his younger brother Tristan on charges related to rape and sexual assault. Romanian authorities agreed to extradite the influencer only after the conclusion of his trial in their country.  Tate is currently in Romania awaiting trial. He is barred from leaving the country.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Can XRP Repeat Its 2017 Rally? Analyst Sees Eerie Similarities


							

Analyst Dark Defender cautions XRP holders as the token lags in the current bull cycle.



XRP saw a staggering 60,000% increase between early 2017 and 2018.



The analyst parallels XRP’s current position and the historic 2017 surge, hinting at a possible repeat.




Analyst Dark Defender has cautioned XRP holders who have grown increasingly impatient with the asset’s performance. XRP, unlike other top-ranking tokens, has not seen a significant rally since the start of the current bull cycle in late 2023.



Ripple’s quarterly market reports for Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 confirmed XRP’s underperformance, revealing a mere 7% increase in Q4 2023 followed by a 5% decline by the end of Q1 2024. During the same period, rivals like Bitcoin and BNB reached new all-time highs.



With frustration mounting among XRP holders, reputable market observers urge caution, emphasizing that XRP’s trajectory closely mirrors its 2017 pattern. Notably, XRP traded as low as $0.00639 in January 2017, a price range it had maintained since 2015.



By December 2017, XRP was trading at $0.22. In a remarkable turn of events, XRP experienced an explosive rally that propelled its value to $3.84 by January 2018. This represented a staggering 60,000% increase from its value a year earlier and a 1,650% gain in just four weeks.



Analyst Dark Defender believes a similar scenario may be unfolding in 2024. “Imagine you are in 2017, tired of price fluctuations for years. You sell it for nothing just before XRP hits $3.82,” he said.







The analyst emphasized that on a weekly chart, XRP has once again moved above a key support level. His indicators suggest a potential shift towards an oversold state, similar to previous weeks, which could signal an impending trend reversal.









Moreover, the analyst identified the resistance level for XRP as around $1, suggesting that the path to this price point could become easier once XRP surpasses $0.6640. With XRP currently trading at $0.49, he warned that those selling their XRP holdings might regret their decision if the market experiences a rally akin to the one in 2017.

Eigen Labs acquires Rio Network to expand EigenLayer blockchain capabilities - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Eigen Labs acquires Rio Network and integrates LRT tech into EigenLayer for enhanced staking utility.
LRT technology from Rio Network open-sourced to standardize liquid restaking across blockchains.
EigenLayer facilitates multi-chain asset security, boosting efficiency in decentralized finance.

Eigen Labs, the force behind the EigenLayer protocol, is expanding its capabilities by acquiring Rio Network and its innovative liquid restaking token (LRT) technology.


The acquisition of Rio Network marks a significant step towards enriching token staking functionalities within the EigenLayer ecosystem.
Acquisition and open-sourcing of LRT technology
Eigen Labs’ acquisition of Rio Network includes obtaining its intellectual property rights, notably the liquid restaking token (LRT) technology.
By integrating this technology into EigenLayer and subsequently open-sourcing it, Eigen Labs aims to foster transparency and community-driven innovation.
The decision to make LRT open-source serves as a strategic move to standardize and enhance the implementation of liquid restaking across blockchain networks.
This approach not only expands EigenLayer’s capabilities but also encourages broader adoption and collaboration within the blockchain community.
Enhancing token staking utility with EigenLayer
EigenLayer, launched in 2023 and backed by substantial Series A funding, has rapidly emerged as a pivotal player in the blockchain staking landscape.
The EigenLayer protocol enables users to maximize the utility of their staked assets, such as Ether (ETH), by securing multiple blockchains simultaneously. This capability addresses the growing demand for efficient asset management and utilization in decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.
Moreover, EigenLayer’s approach complements traditional staking models by offering flexibility and interoperability, thereby promoting a more dynamic and interconnected blockchain infrastructure.
By open-sourcing LRT, Eigen Labs not only enhances its protocol’s capabilities but also fosters innovation and collaboration within the blockchain community.
Moving forward, EigenLayer’s role in optimizing the use of staked assets across multiple blockchains is set to further strengthen, contributing to the broader evolution of decentralized finance and blockchain technology.

Bitcoin writer and privacy advocate L0la L33tz, for one, wrote a whole essay about the subject, arguing that politicians cannot be trusted, that Trump failed to deliver on many of his previous campaign promises, and that Bitcoin doesn’t really even need political support.

The Shiba Inu Survival Guide: Tips for HODLING Through Crypto Winter


							

Lucie advises limiting social media exposure during bearish crypto markets.



SHIB value has dropped over 12% in the last seven days.



Shiba Inu community surpasses 10,000 signatures for SHIB ETF petition.




Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, Lucie, recently addressed the community’s challenges during the current cryptocurrency market downturn, emphasizing the importance of self-education, diversification, and emotional resilience in navigating bearish periods.







The Shiba Inu (SHIB) token, like many other cryptocurrencies, has not been immune to the downward trend. As of writing, SHIB is priced at roughly $0.0000225, having fallen more than 12% over the past week. This sharp decline has left many investors feeling anxious about their holdings.



Lucie emphasized the importance of self-education to navigate bearish markets. She suggested that long-term investors should focus on diversifying their portfolios and limit their exposure to social media, where misinformation often spreads.



Furthermore, practicing discipline and engaging with supportive communities are two key strategies for maintaining emotional stability during turbulent times.



Lucie also offered practical advice for maintaining emotional resilience, including temporarily stepping away from the market if negativity becomes overwhelming. This can help long-term investors avoid the emotional traps often associated with downturns.









In related news, Coin Edition had reported on a notable achievement within the Shiba Inu community. A petition urging Grayscale Investments to launch a SHIB Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has garnered over 10,000 signatures, exceeding its initial goal.



Overall, Lucie’s observations and the community’s proactive efforts highlight the group’s resilience in the face of market challenges. By following these recommendations and staying informed, Shiba Inu investors can better navigate the negative phases and prepare for future opportunities.
